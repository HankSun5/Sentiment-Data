While short-term traders aim for quick wins, those looking for the best crypto to invest in long-term know that real value lies in a project’s vision, utility, and adoption potential. As markets shift, attention is turning toward assets that show strength beyond price action. Monero (XMR), Aave (AAVE), Celestia (TIA), and BlockDAG have all emerged as key tokens this week. Each serves a different role, privacy, decentralized finance, modular scaling, and full-stack infrastructure. These projects are showing signs of resilience, making them worth watching. But one project is gaining momentum faster than the rest. BlockDAG is increasingly being viewed as the best crypto to invest in long-term wealth growth. Here’s what sets it apart from its peers and why it’s capturing the spotlight. 1. BlockDAG: Strong Fundamentals Fuel Long-Term Appeal Among newer projects, BlockDAG is quickly gaining ground as a strong candidate for the best crypto to invest in long-term. Its presale started at just $0.001 and has already climbed to $0.0276, a 2,660% increase. Even now, a limited $0.0018 entry is open until June 20, offering late buyers another chance before the official launch. With a confirmed listing at $0.05, those buying today could already expect a gain. However, some analysts are pointing to a longer-term target of $1, which represents a 35x increase from the current offer. The platform’s standout feature is its full EVM compatibility, allowing Ethereum dApps to move over without any code changes. It has already drawn over 2 million users to its X1 mobile mining app. In addition, it has raised $305 million and sold 22.6 billion BDAG coins. With 20 exchange listings confirmed and a U.S.-based partnership on the horizon, it’s building momentum fast. For those seeking the best crypto to invest in long-term with a solid use case, working infrastructure, and user growth, BlockDAG is increasingly difficult to ignore. As the final presale phase wraps up, this may be the last moment to enter before demand surges. 2. Aave (AAVE): DeFi Growth Supported by Tech & Governance Aave is one of the foundational names in DeFi and is proving its ability to grow in this space. Over the past week, AAVE has climbed 11–14%, recently reaching highs around $270. It has since seen a 4.6% pullback in the last 24 hours, but overall demand for its staking and governance features remains high. The protocol is built on a solid technical base and operates across 14 different blockchains. Developer activity is notable, with roughly 90 commits each week. The launch of v3.3 and zkEVM support further boosts its ability to scale. Its new GHO stablecoin has added more utility, strengthening its long-term outlook. Resistance near €270–280 is being tested, and a clear breakout could unlock more upside. For those interested in the best crypto to invest in long-term DeFi plays, Aave remains a strong choice based on innovation and sustained network activity. 3. Monero (XMR): Privacy & Resilience Under Pressure Monero continues to lead the privacy segment, trading between $309 and $312. Although it’s down by 3–7% this week, that move reflects wider market concerns rather than internal weakness. Monero’s base of long-term holders values its ability to support private, untraceable transactions. With a market cap of around $5.7 billion, XMR remains in the top 25 cryptos. It is currently consolidating between $306 and $322, after pulling back from a recent high of $338. Even as regulators increase scrutiny, the network’s resilience and growing use on decentralized exchanges continue to attract interest. Its privacy-first model gives it a durable advantage in a niche with few serious competitors. For those interested in the best crypto to invest in long-term privacy tools, Monero remains a consistent choice supported by a strong community and active developers. 4. Celestia (TIA): Modular Blockchain Shows Long-Term Promise Celestia’s focus on modular blockchain architecture has brought in both investors and builders. TIA is trading between $1.74 and $1.83 after a 2.5% 24-hour bounce. Even so, it is still down nearly 10% over the past week and over 38% this month. With a market cap of $1.23 billion, Celestia is ranked among the top 70 cryptocurrencies. Though it may dip toward $1.69 based on short-term chart patterns, the project’s modular structure remains its strongest asset. It allows developers to scale and deploy efficiently, separating consensus from execution. As interest in rollups and modular chains grows, Celestia may become an important part of Web3 infrastructure. For those searching for the best crypto to invest in long-term scalability solutions, Celestia’s role in blockchain architecture deserves continued observation. Why BlockDAG Is Drawing Attention from Long-Term Thinkers In a market full of speculation, choosing the best crypto to invest in long-term requires looking beyond price charts. Monero, Aave, and Celestia all deliver strong fundamentals in their respective areas, from privacy to DeFi and infrastructure. But BlockDAG is standing out for combining performance with usability. It already offers ROI, strong user participation, and complete compatibility with Ethereum’s development tools. With exchange listings secured and interest growing daily, it is moving from early-stage promise to real-world execution. As presale rounds near their end and more traders take notice, BDAG may go from under-the-radar to center stage. For those who aim to build long-term portfolios around solid technology and proven traction, BlockDAG looks like one of the smartest opportunities currently available. Now may be the time to act. If your goal is to identify the best crypto to invest in long-term before the next market breakout, BlockDAG deserves serious consideration.

The takedown was part of a broader international investigation, codenamed Operation RapTor, which targeted the darknet platform’s operators and financial infrastructure. Incognito Market Shut Down According to Binance’s official press release , Incognito Market enabled the sale of over 1,000 types of illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine, and relied heavily on cryptocurrencies to process transactions while obscuring users’ identities. Despite the platform’s use of encryption, privacy tools, and a custom-built internal payment system, investigators working with Binance’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) were able to trace transactions on the blockchain to individuals connected to the marketplace. Binance’s FIU assisted in mapping the flow of illicit funds and identified several crypto wallets tied to the platform’s operations. The investigation ultimately led to a Taiwanese national, identified by the surname Lin and known by the alias “Pharaoh,” who supervised the operation and reportedly earned millions in profits. Lin was arrested and later pleaded guilty in a US federal court to charges including narcotics conspiracy, money laundering, and the distribution of misbranded drugs. Meanwhile, Binance’s FIU also froze over $3.5 million in related crypto assets, which law enforcement said helped cripple the marketplace’s financial operations. Binance has assisted in similar investigations before, including efforts with Europol to dismantle a child exploitation platform by tracking internal payment systems and identifying users. In an official statement, Nils Andersen-Röed, Global Head of Binance’s Financial Intelligence Unit, stated, “This case is a powerful reminder that blockchain offers no safe haven for criminal activity. Even with sophisticated privacy tools, every crypto transaction leaves a digital trail, which is increasingly vital in today’s law enforcement investigations. Cross-border collaboration and public-private partnerships are no longer optional – they are essential.” T3 FCU Targets Crypto Crime Besides Binance, another major player in the digital asset space has reported similar enforcement success. The T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU), a joint initiative by Tether, Tron, and TRM Labs, announced in the March update that it has frozen over $100 million in illicit crypto assets since its launch in August 2024. Working with global law enforcement, the unit has targeted crimes including money laundering, fraud, and terrorism financing. T3 FCU has analyzed millions of transactions globally and monitored over $3 billion in USDT activity to disrupt financial crime in the crypto industry.

This new project, set to be released by 2029, aims to fix quantum computers’ high error rates and inability to run long, complex programs. Industry leaders say quantum computers might become strong enough to break today’s digital security systems. This could be dangerous for banks and might even breach inactive crypto wallets . While this is not an urgent threat, many worry it could happen sooner than expected. IBM’s Starling To Revolutionize Quantum Computers Quantum computers do not work like normal ones. Regular computers use bits, which can be either 0 or 1. Quantum computers use qubits, which can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This special ability makes quantum computers very fast, powerful, and efficient. They can solve problems much faster than regular computers, including breaking encryption. Encryption keeps online information safe, including the data in Bitcoin (BTC) and blockchain systems. However, today’s quantum computers are weak because qubits are very sensitive. Small changes in temperature or other conditions can make them stop working correctly. These errors prevent the computer from running large programs. As a result, IBM is focusing on building a fault-tolerant computer that can find and fix its own mistakes while running. This makes it more stable and allows it to handle longer and harder tasks. IBM’s Quantum Computer Starling and the 2029 Goal IBM’s new computer, Quantum Starling, will be able to run 100 million quantum operations using 200 corrected qubits. The computer will also use special hardware to fix errors in real time. IBM will install the system in its quantum data center in New York. This move is part of the company’s roadmap for building useful and scalable quantum computers by 2033. Over the next few years, IBM will test smaller systems and develop new software. These smaller machines will help IBM learn how to connect quantum chips, increase computing power, and prepare for larger builds like Starling. Crypto Community Panics, But Bitcoin Is Safe For Now IBM’s announcement has caused uproar in the crypto community. Experts say blockchains will not break overnight, but developers should start preparing now. Blockchain networks like Bitcoin use strong encryption to protect wallets and transactions, and today’s computers are not strong enough to crack these secret codes. Encryption methods that are safe from quantum attacks already exist; many believe it is time to use them. Meanwhile, some industry leaders like Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor say other systems, like banks and websites, could face quantum threats first. Bitcoin may be safer for a bit longer. Nevertheless, the risk to all digital systems will grow as quantum computers improve.

The resurgence coincides with the rise in activity on the network. According to Dragonfly data analyst Hildobby on X, the network first saw a surge in sandwich attacks around mid-May, and the number has continued to trend upward, particularly over the last week of May and the first week of June. The data shows that the number of sandwich DEX traders has exceeded 100,000 for two consecutive weeks, with trading volume exceeding $1 billion. 120k DEX traders were victims of sandwich attacks on BSC for the first week of June (Source: hildobby) Sandwich attacks are a form of on-chain market manipulation where the attackers front-run the victim’s trades by inserting their trades before and after to extract value from the victim’s transaction. The attacker artificially increases the price of a token by placing a buy order before the victim’s trade and then profits from the inflated value by placing a sell order right after the trade. This issue has long been a major problem for decentralized exchanges, with attackers automating the process using Maximum Extracted Value (MEV) bots. Interestingly, the attack happens due to the inherent nature of the DEX infrastructure. All submitted transactions go to the memory pool (mempool), which is visible to the public before miners select which transactions to execute. Attackers can manipulate transactions from here by offering higher fees to ensure miners reorder transactions to their advantage. The issue has long been an issue for BSC , with over a third of blocks on the network containing transactions impacted by the sandwich attacks on December 1, 2024. However, it is not peculiar to BSC, as other networks, such as Ethereum and Solana, also have to deal with it. One address in 2024, Jaredfromsubway.eth, made over $40 million in revenue with $6.3 million in profits in less than three months from sandwich attacks. BNB Chain tackled sandwich attacks before However, BNB Chain previously addressed the issue by introducing MEV protection for several wallets earlier this year. At the time, the network said there were three solutions: allowing users to have automatic or manual MEV protection, or even customizing the protection for advanced users. The automatic protection was available for select wallets, including Trust Wallet, Binance Wallet, OKX Wallet, TokenPocket Wallet, and SafePal, while other wallets could set up the feature manually. This solution appeared to have worked earlier, with sandwich attacks dropping significantly between late March and early May 2025. However, it appeared to have picked up again. Interestingly, the resurgence coincides with the increase in DEX transactions on BSC, with the network recording massive transaction volume. Dune data shows that the network recorded 69 million transactions in the first week of June, while the last week of May saw 58.45 million transactions. Interestingly, the impact of recent sandwich attacks is minimal, as they have affected only a small percentage of transactions within these two weeks. In the first week of June, over 776,000 transactions were sandwiched, while around 207,000 transactions were sandwich attacks. In the week before, total sandwich-related transactions were only around 1 million. Even more surprisingly, the number of sandwich bots on BSC has declined to less than 300 on average weekly since early April. This represents a major drop from the almost 9,000 sandwich bots in mid-February. BSC sees soaring transaction volume driven Meanwhile, the surge in BSC transaction volume is due to the Binance Alpha program introduced on May 20. The initiative, which spotlights early-stage Web3 projects for users to access tokens and airdrops, has driven tons of new users to the network, causing its DEX volume to soar. According to Defillama, BSC has been the leading network for DEX volume over the last 30 days, with $147.18 billion, far above Solana, which is in second place with $79.31 billion. The network is also leading in daily volume with $3.63 billion. BSC flips Solana in memecoin activity (Source: Jason Yanowitz) Interestingly, it has also flipped Solana in memecoin trading volume, showing how massively impactful the program has been. However, many observers believe the trading volume is inflated due to wash trading as users try to farm points through the Binance Alpha initiative.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi token priced at just $0.03, is quickly becoming the breakout story of summer 2025, with early investors speculating on a potential 30x+ surge before Q3 ends.

If you’re wondering what to buy before June ends, MUTM may be one of the top tokens quietly setting up for explosive growth, while others like SUI appear to be losing steam.

Mutuum Finance Turns Holding Into a High-Stakes Competition Mutuum Finance is rewarding participation. Through its new leaderboard system the top 50 MUTM holders are being spotlighted and will be rewarded. Those who climb the ranks will earn bonus tokens and community prestige transforming traditional token holding into a thrilling competitive experience.

Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To celebrate its early momentum and reward the community Mutuum Finance is hosting a massive $100,000 giveaway . Ten lucky early investors will be randomly selected to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Audited and Built for the Long Haul With so many DeFi projects falling short of their hype, Mutuum Finance is showing credibility to its hype. Certik has performed a full audit of its smart contracts which provides investors with assurance that the code is safe transparent and long-lasting. And to make its ecosystem even more stable Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum that will offer long-term stability liquidity and trust to retail and institutional customers.

However, a newcomer, Ruvi AI , is now stepping into the spotlight, drawing comparisons to Tron for its utility-focused innovation , structured roadmap , and incredible growth potential. With $1.7 million raised , over 150 million tokens sold , and a presale price set at $0.015 , Ruvi AI is positioning itself as not just another crypto token but a game-changer in the blockchain and AI sectors. Why Ruvi AI Is Drawing Comparisons to Tron Tron’s legacy lies in its impact on the entertainment industry, leveraging blockchain to decentralize content sharing and ownership. Similarly, Ruvi AI combines blockchain’s decentralization and artificial intelligence’s cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems across marketing , entertainment , and finance . This dual-focus approach makes Ruvi AI much more than a speculative token. It is a utility-driven project with broad applicability. Ruvi AI’s Phase 2 presale price of $0.015 per token makes it a highly accessible entry point for investors. This affordability allows early backers to secure meaningful positions without a significant upfront investment. Unlike speculative tokens, Ruvi AI follows a structured growth model with a transparent roadmap, boosting its credibility. Analysts are optimistic, projecting a post-listing valuation of $1 , which translates to an impressive 66x return for early participants. A Successful Presale Fuels Investor Optimism The buzz around Ruvi AI is supported by its stellar presale performance. Having already raised over $1.7 million and sold more than 150 million tokens , the project is quickly establishing itself as one of the most exciting opportunities in the market. Ruvi AI’s pricing strategy is a standout feature. Following the presale, the token’s price is set to increase to $0.07 , providing an immediate value boost for early participants. This price progression is a deliberate part of Ruvi AI’s planned development, underscoring its focus on sustainability and long-term growth . Earn More With VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers are designed to reward early contributors with substantial bonuses. This tiered system gives investors the chance to maximize their returns while supporting the project’s development. Here’s how it works: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. This tiered bonus structure is a testament to Ruvi AI’s commitment to fostering a loyal and engaged investor base, offering unmatched opportunities for financial growth. Built on Transparency and Security Ruvi AI’s focus on transparency and investor trust sets it apart from speculative projects. The platform is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a leading blockchain security firm. This ensures Ruvi AI meets high standards of reliability and technological soundness, giving investors peace of mind. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , a globally recognized trading platform. This strategic alliance ensures liquidity and smooth trading for token holders once the presale concludes. Combined, these measures highlight Ruvi AI’s efforts to establish a stable, trustworthy ecosystem. Solving Real-World Challenges Ruvi AI’s primary strength lies in its real-world applications , which make it more than just a financial asset. Here’s how it’s transforming industries: Marketing Ruvi AI empowers businesses to optimize their advertising strategies through AI-driven analytics, improving customer targeting and engagement for better ROI. Entertainment The platform enhances connections between creators and audiences by offering personalized content recommendations and integrating blockchain-backed payment systems to ensure secure, seamless transactions. Finance Ruvi AI addresses pain points such as fraud prevention and operational inefficiencies, simplifying financial processes for institutions and individuals. These practical applications establish Ruvi AI as a utility-first token with the potential to revolutionize multiple industries beyond the crypto space. Could Ruvi AI Rival Tron? While Tron solidified its position in decentralized entertainment, Ruvi AI is carving out a niche as a platform for scalable, real-world solutions . With a presale price of $0.015 , planned growth to $0.07 , and analysts projecting a $1 valuation , it offers investors a rare opportunity to achieve 13500% ROI . Backed by a CyberScope audit , a WEEX partnership , and strong presale traction, Ruvi AI is poised to emerge as a leader in blockchain innovation. For investors looking for the next groundbreaking project, Ruvi AI represents a chance to be part of something truly transformative.

Cloud mining has turned a once hardware‑heavy pursuit into something anyone can start with a smartphone, a modest budget, and a few taps. But can zero hardware really compound into nearly a million dollars? Absolutely—provided you choose the right provider. Below are five cloud‑mining services that have stood out this year for regulatory compliance, consistent payouts, and global scale. Together they show how US $100 can, in the right circumstances, snowball toward six—or even seven—figures. 1. HASHJ — Ultra-Short 1- to 3-Day Contracts for Rapid Gains Minimum deposit: US $100 • Peak daily return: Up to US $9,600 (investment‑dependent) • Payout mode: Daily auto‑credit in BTC or USDT, with zero hidden fees Licensed in multiple jurisdictions, HASHJ offers 2‑factor authentication, custodial wallets, and 24/7 live support. Its stripped‑down interface lets newcomers get started in under five minutes. How to begin: 1. Head to https://hashj.com and unlock an instant US $18 welcome bonus when you register. 2. Select a 1‑ to 3‑day contract. 3. Top up your account with crypto. 4. Let the platform handle the mining and watch daily revenue land in your wallet. 2. StormGain — Free Cloud Mining Plus Spot Trading in One App StormGain fuses zero‑cost cloud mining with a full spot‑trading terminal inside a single mobile app—no leverage, options, or other derivatives to complicate risk. The built‑in profit calculator, live price panel, and flexible contract lengths let users scale hash power up or down at will. Global, high‑efficiency data centers keep uptime high and temperatures low, making StormGain a one‑stop choice for miners who want the option to sell, HODL, or stake their freshly minted coins the moment they receive them. 3. Bitdeer — Enterprise‑Grade Hash Power, Retail‑Friendly Interface With heavyweight miner manufacturer Bitmain behind it, Bitdeer funnels data-center–level hash power directly into the hands of everyday crypto investors. Choose from shared mining pools, fixed‑term contracts, or large bespoke packages—perfect for everyone from small holders to institutions with deep capital. 4. hashj Mining — Legacy Stability for Conservative Investors A veteran of the cloud‑mining scene, hashj Mining (not to be confused with HASHJ’s ultra‑short product above) boasts years of operational history and a worldwide node network. Its yields are deliberately less aggressive than newer entrants, but its emphasis on rock‑solid uptime and stringent security standards makes it a favourite for risk‑averse users seeking reliable, predictable returns. 5. ViaBTC — Dual Engine of Mining Pool & Cloud Contracts ViaBTC operates one of the world’s largest public mining pools and offers cloud‑contract purchasing on the same platform. Investors can buy hash power outright or plug existing rigs into the pool for fee sharing. Comprehensive analytics and diverse withdrawal methods offer the perfect blend of instant liquidity and sustainable mining returns. The Bottom Line: Million‑Dollar Cloud Mining Isn’t Fantasy Turning a small stake into life‑changing capital may sound far‑fetched, but with a compliant provider, verifiable hash power, and transparent payout logic, it’s within reach. Actual results depend on contract choice, market cycles, and your reinvestment strategy—but these five names, especially the fast‑cycle model of HASHJ, prove that you don’t need hardware or coding skills to tap the digital gold rush.

Reports show that the digital collectible market had its most significant weekly gain in a long time. NFTs Market Sees Increased Trading Activity and Participation Notably, this happened as Bitcoin’s (BTC) price increased to $105,000, and Ethereum (ETH) also saw a slight increase. The global crypto market cap grew slightly from $3.28 trillion to $3.29 trillion. Activity in the NFT space has grown significantly. The number of buyers increased by over 50%, reaching over 1 million. Sellers also increased, and the number of trades increased by nearly 8%. This shows that more people are getting back into the NFT market. Immutable Surpasses Ethereum in NFT Blockchain Sales This rise in activity comes as Immutable (IMX), a blockchain used for NFTs, became the top-selling platform this week, beating the Ethereum blockchain for the first time in months. It made $41.7 million in sales, jumping over 150%. Ethereum dropped to second place but still grew by around 7%. The Bitcoin network stayed third with $19.4 million in sales after a 22% rise. Polygon also saw strong growth and is now close to Bitcoin. Other blockchains, like Mythos, BNB Chain, and Solana, also had more NFT buyers. Polygon had the biggest jump in buyers, followed by Solana and Bitcoin. New NFT Market Collections on the Rise Immutable’s growth has helped bring attention to fresh Non-Fungible Token collections. Guild of Guardians Heroes was the top-selling NFT collection this week. It made $24.7 million in sales, doubling its previous performance. This collection runs on Immutable, which helped it grow fast. On the Polygon network, Courtyard came second with $17.2 million in sales. Another Guild of Guardians collection, Avatars, came third with $10.3 million. DMarket held onto fourth place, and Bitcoin’s Ordinals, a new entry, made it into the top five with a massive increase in sales. These changes in rankings show that newer collections and platforms are gaining ground while older names, like CryptoPunks, are beginning to fade. Surprisingly, CryptoPunks dropped out of the top five collections, even though some NFTs sold for high prices. In late March, CryptoPunks saw the highest growth, as sales spiked by a staggering 141% to reach $6.3 million. Amid the collection’s success, CryptoPunk #2967 made the top individual NFT sale of the week, selling 420 ETH for $843,070. However, new NFT collections are taking over, and CryptoPunks are no longer in the spotlight.

This forms a build-up area that could lead to a strong move. If buyers step in, XRP may rise to $0.68 and then $0.75. But if it falls below $0.60, it could drop back to $0.55. Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) is approaching a breakout setup near $0.125. If it breaks cleanly, the price could rally to $0.14 or higher. Both XRP and XLM rely on technical cues. On the other hand, Web3 ai ($WAI) offers real utility, not just price charts. Stage 8 tokens are now priced at $0.000422, giving buyers access to actual tools they can use. XRP Trading Signals Point Toward Key Rally XRP continues to test the $0.60 support for the third time in ten days, creating a decisive zone for the next move. If buyers defend this level, the coin could rebound toward $0.68 and possibly reach $0.75. Though trading volume is falling, the Relative Strength Index is turning upward, signaling growing momentum. A close under $0.60 may send XRP down to $0.55, where the 200-day moving average lies. On-chain metrics remain stable, with active addresses holding steady. The current narrow trading range presents a defined risk-reward opportunity, especially with upcoming macroeconomic updates expected to increase market volatility. Stellar Nears Key Resistance Breakout Point XLM currently trades around $0.12 after maintaining support at $0.115 for three consecutive sessions. A descending resistance trendline from March is facing pressure, supported by increasing trading volume. A daily close above $0.125 may trigger movement toward $0.14, with $0.15 as a broader upside target. The Relative Strength Index has started rising, indicating a potential shift in buyer strength. Cross-border payment usage and smart contract activity are both growing, especially since the Soroban update. If XLM fails to hold the $0.115 level, the coin risks a decline to $0.10. Volume confirmation remains critical for short-term price direction. Web3 AI Offers Real Utility with 1747% ROI Potential Web3 ai stands apart by offering fully functional AI tools built for advanced decision-making. Unlike many platforms that rely on bots or static dashboards, Web3 ai uses deep neural networks for natural language understanding, alongside GARCH models to detect market risk shifts. It processes real-time blockchain data to inform decisions, prioritising actionable insights over predictions. The platform currently features many tools: sentiment analysis using both social and on-chain sources, risk modeling that detects early trend changes, smart contract scans to highlight risks or errors, coin screening for new asset reliability, portfolio insights to improve balance, trend identification rooted in fundamentals, live blockchain metrics, and a natural language interface for fast user interaction. All tools will be live upon launch and are built to deliver speed, clarity, and accurate insights. These services are powered by the $WAI coin, which fuels every query. Stage 8 coins are now available at $0.000422, with the final stage priced at $0.003276. Upon listing, $WAI will debut at $0.005242, offering a potential 1747% return for early buyers. With over $7.7 million already raised and all 50 presale stages progressing, Web3 ai moves toward a full launch. After listing, access costs will increase, making early acquisition of coins more valuable. Web3 ai focuses on practical usage, giving users immediate access to tools that assist in real tasks like smart contract checks or coin analysis. The platform does not rely on hype but on real, functional technology already in use. Summing Up! XRP relies on technical patterns; its trading signal remains bullish only as long as $0.60 holds. If it breaks, the setup fails. Stellar’s breakout at $0.125 must hold, or falls below $0.115 and undo everything. Web3 AI doesn’t rely on chart patterns. Stage 8 tokens are priced at $0.000422 and will list at $0.005242, offering a potential ROI of 1747%. Each query, whether a risk check or coin vet, uses up $WAI, creating real demand today. That means sooner or later, coin use translates into coin demand. The tools will be live upon launch, the funding stage is advancing, and the listing upsides are clear. For users seeking practical access and big potential gains, WAI stands out.

While many projects are still stuck in the planning phase, a handful are already making real progress before hitting major listings. That’s exactly where the Best Presale Crypto projects tend to shine, combining fast progress, working features, and low entry prices. Right now, Nexchain, Bittensor, and NEAR Protocol are showing solid performance with growing traction. All have unique features or active communities backing their rise. But BlockDAG is leading the charge. With more than $304 million raised, 2 million mobile miners running, and a presale price still under $0.03, it may be the most underpriced project on the market. Let’s break down four major projects and see why BlockDAG could end up as the Best Presale Crypto of the year. 1. BlockDAG: A Strong Presale Backed by Real Progress and Network Growth BlockDAG is flipping the script on how a presale should be done. Its price now sits at $0.0276 in Batch 29, after starting at only $0.001. Over 22.3 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, with more than $304 million raised. A $0.0018 special offer runs through June 20, giving early users a shot at up to 2,660 percent returns before its $0.05 exchange debut. With that confirmed $0.05 listing coming, there’s still time for a big pre-listing upside. But long-term growth looks even more exciting. Some analysts predict BlockDAG could reach $1, offering more than 3,500 percent ROI, thanks to strong foundations and clear use cases. This Best Presale Crypto has already secured 20 exchange listings and a major U.S.-based sponsorship. Technically, it delivers high speed and scalability using a hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work model that can handle up to 15,000 transactions per second. It is also EVM compatible, making it easy for Ethereum-based dApps to switch over. More than 2 million users have already joined the X1 mobile mining app, giving BlockDAG a live and growing network well ahead of launch. It also offers grants, no-code dApp development tools, and a clear roadmap. This is not just a coin, it’s a full system. For those after the Best Presale Crypto that delivers real features and big upside, BlockDAG ticks every box. 2. Nexchain: AI-Powered Speed with Yield and Utility Nexchain is becoming a serious contender among new Layer 1s focused on AI and blockchain. It is currently in Stage 18 of its presale, with over $4.2 million raised out of a $4.725 million target. Selling at $0.07, Nexchain aims to be the Best Presale Crypto through solid mechanics, anti-whale systems, vesting protections, and CertiK-verified contracts. Its hybrid consensus mixes Proof-of-Stake and AI, boasting an impressive 400,000 transactions per second. Users earn passive income from gas fees, with a 10 percent daily return. With frequent AMAs and product previews, Nexchain is executing well, building trust and interest across the board. 3. Bittensor (TAO): Price Bounce with Expanding AI Networks Bittensor’s TAO is making a solid comeback after dipping in early June, now trading between $395 and $430. With over $140 million in daily trading volume and strong movement past major EMAs, the mood is getting bullish. Resistance could soon be tested between $450 and $475. What makes Bittensor worth comparing with Best Presale Crypto projects is its growing AI ecosystem. Projects like AIX and StreetVision are already building on it. While TAO is not in presale, its success shows what early-stage networks should aim for. If growth keeps up, it may serve as a blueprint for what today’s Best Presale Crypto efforts can become. 4. NEAR Protocol: Solid Activity & Major Backing NEAR Protocol continues to prove why it’s among the strongest Layer 1s. Even with recent market tension, it bounced back 4 percent from $2.49 to around $2.63. It reached 46 million monthly users in May, second only to Solana. NEAR’s backers, including DWF Labs, are helping reduce its inflation rate from 5 percent to 2.5 percent. Tools like NEAR Intents are making DeFi easier, and its trading volume stays above $200 million daily. Though NEAR has already launched, it serves as a model for what a Best Presale Crypto can evolve into, especially for projects like BlockDAG that are focused on infrastructure and long-term growth. Top Projects to Keep an Eye On If you are hunting for the Best Presale Crypto that blends hype with real development, BlockDAG clearly stands out. It has a full product stack in place, over $304 million already raised, 2 million users actively mining on X1, and 20 confirmed exchange listings. Nexchain also brings strength through AI integration and income mechanics. Bittensor is gaining ground fast with its AI-backed growth. NEAR is already proving what this kind of momentum can turn into. But for those who want to get in early, BlockDAG’s pricing, active network, and potential for rapid growth make it the front-runner. With the $0.05 listing drawing near, this Best Presale Crypto might never dip under $0.03 again. Now is the time to get in.

Which Is The Best Crypto for 2025 Gains?",https://thecoinrise.com/sui-targets-breakout-pepe-jumps-15-and-unstaked-presale-hits-9-8m-which-is-the-best-crypto-for-2025-gains/,"SUI is lining up for a breakout as DeFi momentum builds, and PEPE is heating up again with fresh whale activity boosting short-term interest. Both are drawing eyes, but something else is quietly gaining serious ground, and this time, it’s not just another pump. Unstaked has crossed $9.8 million in its Stage 20 presale, and it’s starting to turn heads for the right reasons. At just $0.011397 per token, buyers aren’t chasing hype; they’re positioning early for what some believe could be a massive upside. The project’s focus on AI agent monetization gives $UNSD real-world utility, and the launch price target of $0.1819 offers a clear 27x potential out of the gate. But the buzz doesn’t stop there. With growing on-chain volume expectations, talk of 3000x returns isn’t just wild speculation; it’s becoming a serious forecast. For those looking beyond the usual names, Unstaked is emerging as a long-term play with real weight behind it. Unstaked Presale Buyers Are Thinking Long Game Unstaked is no longer a hidden gem; it’s fast becoming one of the most talked-about crypto presales of 2025. With over $9.8 million already raised in Stage 20 and more than 1.1 billion $UNSD tokens sold, momentum is clearly building. But this isn’t a typical presale frenzy. What’s happening here is strategic accumulation. Buyers aren’t chasing hype; they’re betting on strong fundamentals and long-term potential. Currently priced at $0.011397, $UNSD is targeting a launch value of $0.1819. That’s a projected 27x return from presale to listing, but the real story goes much further. Investors aren’t just focused on the launch day pump. They’re looking at what comes next: monetized AI agents that could drive serious on-chain volume and revenue. With that, some are predicting potential gains of up to 3000x over time. What’s helping Unstaked stand out is its no-nonsense approach, no private sales, no backdoor discounts, and liquidity locked from day one. It’s a fair launch model that’s becoming harder to find, especially in the crowded AI crypto space. $UNSD isn’t just another token; it powers everything from agent creation to governance and access within the platform. For those with an eye on the bigger picture, Unstaked is shaping up to be more than a presale win. It’s being viewed as one of the strongest long-term holds of the year, and those getting in early might just be catching the start of something massive. SUI’s DeFi Expansion Gains Momentum SUI is starting to grab serious attention as DeFi activity on the network picks up. With total value locked on the rise and daily users increasing, momentum is clearly building. Low gas fees and faster transaction finality are helping drive new interest, and analysts are now eyeing a potential push toward the $1.50 mark, provided current support levels hold. What’s adding fuel to this setup is the wave of new DeFi protocols launching on Sui. Yield chasers are starting to take notice, especially as other Layer 1s lose steam. Instead of stalling out, Sui is expanding, bringing in fresh projects and a growing user base at a steady pace. If this trend continues, SUI could quickly move out of the shadows and into serious mid-cap territory by Q3. With the ecosystem gaining traction and builders showing up, this isn’t just another short-term spike; it’s shaping up as a long-game play. Whale Activity Pushes PEPE Higher PEPE is back on the move, and this time it’s not just noise. Whale wallets are stacking up again, sending trading volume past key levels and lifting the price nearly 15% over the past week. After holding steady near its recent lows, the bounce has sparked real talk about whether PEPE is gearing up for another big meme coin run. What’s behind the move isn’t just hype; it’s fresh liquidity flowing into meme coins as traders start leaning back into risk. With PEPE’s market cap holding strong above $5.5 billion, this rally feels more grounded than speculative. The current surge looks like real demand, not just a quick flip. If momentum keeps building through the weekend, PEPE could easily punch through short-term resistance and lead a broader meme coin shift heading into Q3. Meme season might be heating up again, and PEPE is right at the front of the pack. Final Thoughts SUI is showing strength with growing DeFi activity fueling a potential breakout, while PEPE is gaining steam again as whale action and rising volume push it higher. Both are making solid moves, but neither offers the kind of setup Unstaked does right now. With over $9.8 million already raised and the presale price locked at $0.011397, Unstaked is still early, and that’s exactly what’s getting attention. The launch price is projected at $0.1819, setting up a 27x jump from current levels. But many see this as just the beginning. What’s driving the excitement? Real utility. The $UNSD token powers AI agent monetization, governance, and platform access, giving it serious long-term value. And with no private sales or early insider advantages, it’s one of the few presales that feels built for fairness. In a market full of short-term spikes, Unstaked is shaping up to be a long-term breakout.

The news, reported by Iranian state media and confirmed by The Jerusalem Post, showed two key South Pars gas facilities were hit Saturday by Israeli unmanned aerial vehicles, while another attack reportedly targeted an oil depot near Tehran. The response came just two days after Israel carried out air raids on Iran’s military leadership, missile sites, and nuclear infrastructure, raising fears that the conflict will spill into energy routes and supply systems. The attacks caused US crude oil to jump $2.72—a 3.7% gain—closing at $75.67 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent crude rose $3.67, up 4.94%, ending the day at $77.90. The rally followed a massive 7% surge on Friday, marking the most volatile move in the oil market since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Combined, last week saw a 13% gain in US crude alone. Iran retaliates, warns of shutting vital oil route The escalation didn’t stop at Israel’s offensive. According to The Times of Israel, Iranian missile strikes struck a major refinery in Haifa, worsening concerns over global oil supplies. Tensions remain high as the war enters day three, with no indication that either side will step back. On Saturday, a senior Iranian commander threatened to shut the Strait of Hormuz, the strategic chokepoint through which more than 20% of global oil exports move. If that happens, it could paralyze international energy logistics. Stock futures tumbled as soon as markets opened. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 92 points (or 0.2%), while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures both fell by 0.2% as well. This came on the heels of a brutal Friday session, when the Dow plunged over 700 points. All three indexes finished the week in the red—Dow down 1.3%, S&P 500 lower by 0.4%, and Nasdaq Composite closing with a 0.6% loss. Crypto stays largely muted as gold surges Investors ran to safety. Gold rallied hard, reaching $3,450. Global currencies took a hit. The euro fell to 1.1555 against the dollar, down 0.39%. The British pound dropped 0.45% to 1.3565, while the Japanese yen rose 0.66% to 144.14 per dollar. The Canadian dollar slid to 1.3587, and the Australian dollar dropped sharply to 0.6485, down 0.66%. The crypto market has managed to stay flat through it all. At press time, Bitcoin was worth $105,182, down 0.32%. Ethereum was up 0.15% to $2,538, while Cardano and XRP both rose 1%. Dogecoin dropped the most, falling 2.08% to $0.1751. Market watchers are now locked in on manufacturing survey data coming Monday morning, right before the Federal Reserve’s rate decision on Wednesday. With current expectations holding firm at a 97% probability of no change, the spike in oil prices is throwing a wrench into hopes for a pivot. As you may know, president Donald Trump has been publicly pressuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell for a rate cut. But with energy costs ballooning, odds of a policy shift are fading fast.

Institutional participation, once marked by caution, has now transformed into active engagement, with major entities embracing decentralized technologies at an accelerated pace. From the rise of innovative DeFi solutions to the growing adoption of real-world asset tokenization, the momentum across the digital finance landscape is substantial. As traditional financial systems progressively integrate decentralized models, a new wave of blockchain projects is emerging—many supported by highly informed and engaged communities. For buyers seeking near-term opportunities, the focus is increasingly shifting toward identifying the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term. This surge of adoption has led many to seek options outside of traditional financial systems, drawn by the appeal of transparency, control, and higher growth potential. Qubetics , a rising contender in this space, is one of the projects redefining what it means to participate in a secure, efficient, and user-first digital finance world. Let’s take a deeper dive into how it stacks up alongside established players like Algorand and Arweave. Qubetics – The Web3 Aggregator Reshaping Digital Finance One of Qubetics’ most talked-about features is its deep focus on fixing the Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet issue. Juggling four or five wallets, each tied to different chains—Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, you name it. That’s the reality today for many community members, especially freelancers managing cross-border payments, small businesses collecting multiple crypto payments, or Web3 devs jumping between testnets. Qubetics streamlines this process, offering a seamless and secure wallet that supports multi-chain operations without sacrificing custody or control. No third-party keys, no painful logins, no app-hopping. A freelance graphic designer getting paid in $USDT on Ethereum, then switching over to use Solana for gas-efficient NFT mints. Or an e-commerce store owner accepting crypto from backers across multiple blockchains. Qubetics puts that entire toolkit into one sleek interface. This practical functionality is precisely what makes it one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term, especially for buyers looking for real-world applications over hype. Qubetics Presale Heats Up: $TICS Gains Momentum as One of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold Short-Term That’s where Qubetics, the world’s first web3 aggregator, is winning attention. Currently in Presale Stage 37, Qubetics has already raised over $18 million, with more than 27,900 token holders and 515 million $TICS coins sold. Its presale token price is $0.3370, and analysts are making bold predictions about its trajectory. If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, we’re talking about a 197% return. If it reaches $10 or $15 after Mainnet, adopters could be looking at 2,867% to 4,350% ROI. Qubetics cut supply from over 4B to 1.36B $TICS—now just 10M tokens remain in the final sale at $0.3370. Listing will open at a 20% premium. Scarcity is real, and the clock is ticking. That’s the kind of growth projection that’s grabbing serious attention from the crypto-savvy crowd searching for the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term. On top of that, the project’s crypto presale has generated growing chatter thanks to its transparency and steady demand. Algorand – Consistency Meets Innovation Algorand’s reputation speaks for itself. Designed to be scalable and environmentally responsible, Algorand is known for its blazing transaction speed and near-zero fees. It’s built a strong base as a go-to blockchain for financial apps, especially where performance and trust matter. It’s no surprise then that Algorand is regularly included in discussions about the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term. The network’s structure enables smart contracts and token issuance with maximum security, making it a favorite for decentralized apps and institutions venturing into blockchain. Over the years, it’s maintained a solid market presence and loyal user base. ALGO tokens continue to move in sync with strategic developments, partnerships, and ecosystem upgrades, making them attractive for backers seeking both liquidity and dependability. Arweave – The Backbone of Decentralized Storage Arweave has established itself as a leading solution for long-term data storage on the blockchain through its innovative “permaweb” concept. By offering permanent data hosting via a one-time payment, Arweave eliminates the need for ongoing subscriptions or renewals, ensuring continuous access to stored information. This model is particularly valuable for decentralized applications, NFT metadata, and digital archives that require immutable, censorship-resistant storage. Over the past few years, the project has solidified its spot in the blockchain infrastructure club. Its native token, AR, is used to pay for storage, and the demand has been growing steadily. With Web3 developers prioritizing censorship-resistance and transparency, Arweave provides a vital layer of permanence. For anyone searching for alternative digital assets and wondering what the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term are, Arweave consistently lands on the radar. Conclusion – Which One Stands Out the Most? All three projects—Qubetics, Algorand, and Arweave—bring something valuable to the table. Algorand delivers steady, secure transactions. Arweave guarantees that your data is here to stay. But Qubetics? It’s solving real problems for real users, while actively shaping the future of Web3. Its crypto presale results, paired with clear technical purpose and real-life functionality, place it in the fast lane of adoption. So, if you’re seriously considering the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term , Qubetics should be top of mind. Its potential upside is massive, and the presale window is still open—for now. Do your research, weigh your options, and if it fits your strategy, consider joining thousands of backers who’ve already taken the plunge.

Qubetics stands out because it’s not just launching a token—it’s introducing the world’s first web3 aggregator with real utility, including a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet that solves daily crypto management issues for businesses and individuals. How does Qubetics offer short-term returns? With $TICS priced at $0.3370 and analyst predictions reaching $15 after Mainnet, Qubetics presents one of the highest ROI potentials in the short term, making it one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term. Can Qubetics’ wallet support multiple tokens across chains? Yes. It offers full support for multiple chains and tokens, solving a huge issue for buyers who use different platforms and don’t want to juggle multiple wallets.

The South Korean media outlet Biz Watch reported that the new government’s won-pegged stablecoin has become a “hot topic” in both the financial sector and blockchain industry, with “related” coins attracting attention. MEVerse (MEV) prices over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap) The outlet noted that while high-cap cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP are experiencing price stagnation, “only certain domestic coins have been showing abnormal price surges.” Examples include MEVerse (MEV), which shot up from around KRW 3 to KRW 20 won, as well as fanC (FANC), which rose from KRW 5 to KRW 13 won. fanC (FANC) prices over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap) In the same period, Wrapped Nine Chronicle Gold (WNCG) increased from around KRW 29 won to KRW 57 won. Tokens like BORA and Storm X (STMX) have also seen price rises of over 60% on domestic crypto exchanges. Coins Remain Popular in South Korea The outlet explained that MEV is a coin issued by the KOSDAQ-listed gaming and entertainment company Me2On. MEVerse (MEV) prices on the Coinone crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source:Coinone/TradingView) FanC, meanwhile, was issued by CELEBe, a Seoul-based startup that specializes in mobile app and social media-related services. In both cases, 99% or more of the coins’ global trading volume takes place on domestic exchanges like Bithumb and Coinone. Biz Watch wrote: “Many of these coins have been ignored by investors for a long time. Their trading volumes and market prices have been at rock bottom. As market interest has cooled, it has become harder to find information about project activity levels and technological capabilities.” Experts Issue Warning Apywa is a South Korean analyst that provides evaluation grades for domestic and international projects. It grades FANC at C- , with 41.48 points out of 100. By contrast, it rates BTC at A+ with almost 95 points. MEV scores 45.83 points (grade C), with STMX receiving a B- and BORA a B. Apywa deducts points for coins that show relatively low levels of community activity and development activity.

In other instances, these projects’ coins may have certain payment and/or settlement functions that have caught the eye of some traders. At the time of writing, MEV trading volumes on Bithumb were outstripping those of Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) . The top seven coins by trading volume on Bithumb over the past 24 hours.

An unnamed securities firm employee said: “With the government’s push to issue a won-denominated stablecoin, fintech and blockchain companies are announcing business plans, one after another. They are claiming relevance, and their prices are rising.” Nine Chronicles (WNCG) prices over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap) A crypto industry insider added: “In the past, projects like Paycoin (PCI) soared when local government stablecoins were a big thing. They then went on to drop by more than 30% in a few days. In the same way, coins related to won stablecoins could also plummet at any time. Investors should carefully consider the operational status and business viability of projects. People should invest with caution.” The post Kimchi Coins Booming on South Korean Stablecoin News – But Experts Urge Caution appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Altcoin|South Korea,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-15 23:30:00

Here’s the Timeline",https://timestabloid.com/investor-projects-462800-xrp-price-rally-heres-the-timeline/,"A crypto investor known as Remi Relief (@RemiRelierX) has predicted that XRP could reach $10,000 by 2029. According to him, the timeline is not arbitrary. It marks what would be Donald Trump’s final year in office following his re-election in 2024. In his post on X, Remi argued that Trump, now in his second and final term, will seek to establish a lasting economic legacy and that this could involve helping XRP reach extreme valuations. He claims the motivation isn’t to reward holders but to reinforce the U.S. government’s financial strength, which he says is increasingly tied to Ripple and the XRP Ledger (XRPL). In that context, a dramatic revaluation of XRP would serve broader national goals and support the long-term credibility of U.S.-led financial systems. XRP to $10,000 By 2029 … First let me preface this by saying XRP has a set price. I’ve been telling everyone this for months. How much is it? I don’t know but I think there will be a set “base price” of $10,000. I spoke about this in an earlier post which I’ll re-post… pic.twitter.com/1SbB2c5OFp — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) June 14, 2025 A Belief in a Fixed Price Model At the heart of Remi’s view is the belief that XRP has, or will soon have, a fixed or pre-determined base price. Though he acknowledges he does not know the exact number, he believes $10,000 is a realistic figure. This outlook stands in contrast to traditional market-based pricing, relying instead on the idea that price could be institutionally guided based on strategic utility. He has expressed this view previously and shares the explanation for his optimism. He referenced Quincy Jones, a developer for the XDC network, who once said XRP could theoretically reach $1 million depending on how much global debt it is used to settle. Remi agrees with that principle, stating he “100%” believes it. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Long-Term Strategy and Investor Discipline Remi cautions against selling too early. He warns that many retail investors will offload their holdings at $100 , $500, or even $1,000, thereby missing out on generational wealth, which he believes is XRP’s true potential. “$10,000 x 100 XRP = $1M,” he wrote, suggesting holders should aim to retain at least 100 XRP tokens if possible. He urges followers to store their assets securely, preferably off centralized exchanges. Other experts have advised token holders to store their XRP in cold wallets , and Remi Relief reveals that he uses around 15 cold wallets, two exchanges, and a dedicated crypto phone. His strategy stems from missed opportunities in earlier technological waves, such as the dot-com boom and Bitcoin’s rise, which he says he didn’t take seriously enough at the time. He shared tweets showing people who missed out on Bitcoin in the early days—a tweet from 2027 by someone complaining that they did not hold onto their XRP.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 248,500 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) looks very strong despite the recent marketwide correction. The trader sees HYPE consolidating close to the highs for now before igniting a fresh leg up en route to a new record high. “HYPE has insane strength right now, this one got bought up quickly. wouldn’t be surprised to see a bit more chop around here but $50+ is destined, even in these crazy times.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, HYPE is worth $40.44.

The trader notes that dogwifhat ( WIF ) and Popcat ( POPCAT ) are both in the midst of a downtrend and may drop to much lower levels if BTC fails to print new all-time highs. “Moment of truth for many of these [coins] soon; that could have just been a lower high formed.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia opens the trading week, BTC is changing hands at around $ 105,000, stuck in this range due to market uncertainty about whether the Israel-Iran conflict will escalate into a broader regional war, according to a recent note from trading firm QCP. QCP wrote in a Friday note published on Telegram that risk reversals have ""flipped decisively,"" with front-end BTC puts now commanding premiums of up to 5 volatility points over equivalent calls, a clear indicator of heightened investor anxiety and increased hedging against downside risks. The firm said that despite this defensive shift in positioning, BTC has demonstrated notable resilience. Even amid recent volatility, which saw over $1 billion in long positions liquidated across major crypto assets, on-chain data shows that institutional buying continues to provide meaningful support. QCP emphasizes that markets remain ""stuck in a bind,"" awaiting clarity on geopolitical outcomes, and warns that the digital asset complex will likely remain tightly linked to headline-driven sentiment shifts for the foreseeable future. With all that in mind, however, Glassnode data provides some reassurance to investors concerned about longer-term directionality. Although recent volatility underscores short-term anxiety, bitcoin’s current cycle gain of 656%, while lower than previous bull markets, is notably impressive given its significantly larger market capitalization today. Previous cycles returned 1076% (2015–2018) and 1007% (2018–2022), suggesting investor demand is still pacing closely with BTC’s maturation, even as near-term macro jitters dominate market sentiment. Galaxy Research Says OP_Return Debate Wasn't That Important The OP_Return debate was less important than what a ""loud but small group of critics"" wanted everyone to think, Galaxy Research's Alex Thorn wrote in a recent note. Thorn described critics' reactions as ""wild accusations of the 'death of Bitcoin'"" and argued that such hyperbole was misplaced given historically low mempool congestion. On-chain data shows that the mempool is virtually empty compared to a year ago, and the notion that a congested blockchain is suffocating BTC, as was the prevailing narrative in 2023, now appears significantly overstated. In the note, Thorn further highlighted the irony of labeling arbitrary data as ""spam,"" reminding observers that Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, famously included arbitrary text, the ""chancellor on brink of second bailout"" headline, in the Bitcoin’s blockchain's very first block. Instead, Thorn argued, Bitcoin's community attention would be better focused on potential upgrades like CheckTemplateVerify (CTV), a proposed opcode enabling strict spending conditions (""covenants""). ""We continue to believe [CTV] is a conservative but powerful opcode that would greatly enhance the ability to build better, safer methods of custody,"" he wrote, noting that around 20% of Bitcoin’s hashrate already signaled support for the upgrade. Bitcoin upgrades require extensive consensus-building, reflecting its open-source ethos, and Thorn emphasized that cautious, deliberate evolution remains critical for broader adoption and scalability. ByBit Launches Byreal, a Solana-Native Decentralized Exchange Bybit is entering the decentralized exchange space with Byreal, an on-chain trading platform built on Solana, Ben Zhou, Bybit's CEO announced via X over the weekend. Byreal's testnet is scheduled to launch on June 30, with the mainnet rollout expected later this year. Zhou said that Byreal is designed to combine centralized exchange features such as high liquidity and fast execution with the transparency and composability of DeFi. The platform will also include a fair launchpad system and curated yield vaults linked to Solana-native assets like bbSOL. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin held near $105,000 after more than $1 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated, led by a $200 million long on Binance, as rising Israel-Iran tensions triggered a sharp selloff, a flight from altcoins, and a brief but intense bout of volatility. ETH: Ethereum rose 2% to around $2,550 after finding strong support at $2,510, showing resilience amid Israel-Iran tensions and broader market volatility, with continued institutional inflows supporting the uptrend. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets rose Monday, led by Japan's Nikkei 225 gaining 0.87 percent, as investors weighed escalating Israel-Iran tensions, while oil and gold prices surged on safe haven demand. Gold: Gold climbed to $3,447 in early Asian trading Monday, hitting a one-month high as Middle East tensions and rising expectations of a September Fed rate cut outweighed strong U.S. consumer sentiment data.

The announcement came in a joint statement on Sunday as the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, paid his first official visit as head of government to Canada. Starmer held talks with Canadian counterpart Mark Carney as part of a series of bilateral discussions to deepen existing partnerships and forge new economic cooperation. The statement said the working group will recommend its suggestions to both PMs within six months. “We will establish a new structured UK-Canada Economic and Trade Working Group to deepen our existing trading relationship further,” the joint statement by the two prime ministers said. The move represents a fresh promise by the two countries to recast their trading relationship during changing global economic patterns and supply line disruptions. UK and Canada expand cooperation on digital trade and AI The new working group will tackle market access barriers and deepen cooperation in up-and-coming areas. It has identified as priorities digital trade, the building of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, and strategic alliances in critical minerals. Canada and the UK consider these sectors central to their future economic resilience . By coordinating efforts, they want to ensure their economies become even more competitive, inclusive, and innovative in a fast-paced world market. The move also addresses concerns inside Canada about too much reliance on US markets as Canadian industries — including steel, aluminum, and car manufacturing — continue to face tariffs and trade barriers to the US market. The Conference Board of Canada reports that the UK accounted for just 3.6% of Canada’s exports and 1.2% of its imports in 2024, making it a relatively minor trading partner. However, both governments are keen to explore untapped opportunities beyond the usual commodities trade. While Canada’s exports to the UK are largely dominated by gold and energy, the new plan seeks to broaden and diversify trade between the two nations. Leaders advance trade pacts and strengthen military cooperation Canada pledged to introduce legislation later in 2025 to ratify the United Kingdom’s accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and establish the new trade working group. The CPTPP is a broad trade agreement among 11 nations, including Japan, Australia, Mexico, and Singapore. The UK became a member of the trade bloc last year on a provisional basis, with benefits granted to it from nine Indo-Pacific markets. However, Canada and Mexico need final ratification to benefit fully from membership. The move reiterates Canada’s determination to multilateralism and its Indo-Pacific strategy and provides a stronger presence for the UK in the region following Brexit. In addition to their economic ties, the joint statement highlighted an expansion of defense cooperation between the two countries. Canada and the UK also reinforced the pledge to stand by Ukraine as part of wider G7 cooperation on global security. As geopolitical tensions mount and global supply chains are strained, governments seem to be coming together on common values and strategic objectives. The news comes as G7 leaders meet in Alberta this weekend for a three-day summit into global economic resilience, technological innovation, and international security. For Carney, the conference is an opportunity to promote Canada’s role in global trade and the green economy. It is Starmer’s first outing on the world stage since becoming leader, and he is focusing on wanting to reconnect internationally. This reinvigorated UK-Canada partnership is a timely testament that you can never have enough tried and trusted friends in today’s unsteady global economy.

Pepe Coin Forecast: Steady Climb into Q3 Pepe Coin (PEPE) is trading around $0.000012, rebounding slightly, up about 2.1% in 24 hours, after a recent dip that left prices roughly 12% lower than the May highs. Technical indicators point to consolidation, with analysts projecting a short-term bounce toward 0.000016, a potential 25% upside, if current support holds. Beyond that, broader bullish scenarios suggest PEPE could reach as high as $0.00004 by late 2025, assuming meme-coin momentum reemerges and BTC continues its upward trend. This positions PEPE as a meme-coin contender to watch, while new DeFi plays like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly emerge on investors’ radars. Mutuum Finance Presale Explodes Past $10.6M, 12,000+ Investors Already In The presale frenzy around Mutuum Finance is turning heads in the DeFi world, with over $10.6 million raised and a community of 12,000+ holders, it’s clear something huge is brewing. Right now, MUTM tokens are going for just $0.03, but the next presale round jumps to $0.035. That’s an instant 16.67% gain for phase 5 investors. And when it officially launches at $0.06, those in early could 2x their money.

On Saturday, June 15, the network recorded a small but notable decrease in difficulty, bringing it down to approximately 126.4 trillion. This follows the all-time peak of 126.9 trillion on May 31, according to data from blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. The drop is slight, but that’s a landmark for mining. Bitcoin’s difficulty is automatically adjusted approximately every two weeks to reflect changes in the total hashrate, the sum of all miners’ computing power aiming for solutions to the Bitcoin network . When additional miners join the network, the difficulty increases to help maintain block production at regular intervals. When miners go offline because of cost or inefficiency, the difficulty drops in adjusting. The hashrate is still robust, surpassing a psychological barrier of 1 zetahash per second (ZH/s) in April. Rising costs challenge miners While it remains a tad less tough, several miners struggle with heavier workloads. The April 2024 halving, a scheduled phenomenon that cuts Bitcoin’s block reward in half every four years, slashed the reward for successfully mining a block to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC for miners, which translates into half the revenue for the same work. Factors such as surging electricity prices, rising hardware costs, and the pressure to stay updated with the latest technological turnover have caused many smaller or medium mining operations to be on the brink. Production costs are expensive for some small-scale miners, particularly in regions with relatively high electric power prices or relatively inefficient power supply systems. For those miners, keeping operations going is burning cash, a high-stakes wager, given that they either have access to cheap energy or anticipate a sharp rise in the price of Bitcoin shortly. Big players grow despite headwinds While many miners are scrambling , larger publicly traded companies do the opposite: ramping up and holding onto Bitcoin. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) said it produced roughly 35% more Bitcoin mined in May despite facing industry headwinds. The firm also mined 950 BTC for the month, an increase from April’s amount. Rather than liquidating coins into fiat to cover costs — as many miners often tend to do — MARA decided to hold onto those obtained through Bitcoin mining and increased the size of their corporate treasury to 49,179 BTC. “Record production month for MARA, and we sold zero Bitcoin,” said Salman Khan, Marathon’s chief financial officer, in a June 3 post on X . CleanSpark, another major mining company with a degree of emphasis on renewable energy, also reported solid results. The company reportedly mined 694 BTC during the month, an increase of approximately 9% from the prior month. CleanSpark’s capacity of hashrate, an essential performance measure, rose to 45.6 exahashes per second (EH/s) by the end of May. CleanSpark CEO Zack Bradford said that the increase was attributable to continued investment in cleaner forms of energy and improved mining hardware. He added that they had intentionally scaled their footprint over the years to remain profitable in tough macroeconomic environments. Both companies are part of a new breed of miners who consider Bitcoin a revenue source and a strategic financial asset. It has boiled down to holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet, a decision increasingly adopted by the corporate treasuries experimenting with crypto. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

While several coins remain steady, others are quietly gaining traction, supported by growing use cases, solid frameworks, and rising community strength. Lately, Celestia (TIA), Kaspa (KAS), and Arbitrum (ARB) have drawn attention due to ongoing upgrades and technical improvements, showing potential for long-term performance. However, BlockDAG is making the strongest impression. Its presale has surpassed expectations, its tech supports scalability, and it’s gaining attention from developers. With powerful performance and increasing backing, it’s now considered more than just a rising project, it’s becoming a leading force. BlockDAG: Redefining Crypto Growth with Real Speed Early adopters in BlockDAG (BDAG) have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1, showcasing remarkable traction. The current Batch 29 price is $0.0276, but until June 20 the prices are rolled back to $0.0018, with the official launch set at $0.05, reflecting the continued demand. BlockDAG’s momentum is based on more than just talk. Its DAG-based Proof-of-Work approach delivers up to 15,000 transactions per second while keeping a high level of decentralization and security. The platform’s full EVM compatibility allows Ethereum developers to transition easily, enhancing adoption potential. So far, over 22.6 billion coins have been sold, with $305 million raised in the presale. More than 2 million people have already joined via the X1 mining app. With 20 centralized exchange listings confirmed and a U.S.-based sponsorship on the way, BlockDAG is proving its scale. Experts watching the most popular cryptos in 2025 now count it among the top names. For those who missed out on earlier breakout projects like Ethereum or Solana, BlockDAG may be that next big chance. Celestia (TIA): Tech Progress Despite Price Pressure Celestia (TIA) is trading between $1.80 and $1.83, slightly up for the day but still about 10% down on the weekly chart. With a market cap close to $1.23 billion and 24-hour trading volumes around $105–158 million, the coin remains in a consolidation phase near $1.75. Despite the sideways action, the tech behind it is showing strong momentum. A new partnership with a major Layer-2 chain now uses Celestia’s data availability layer, strengthening its place in the modular blockchain trend. New fraud-proof mechanisms and ongoing work on Composable Rollups are giving the network unique advantages. The platform’s staking yields of 15–17% also offer strong value during periods of market uncertainty. While short-term outlook may dip to $1.35, the overall structure remains solid. Many tracking the most popular cryptos in 2025 see Celestia as a strong modular player if market sentiment turns positive. Kaspa (KAS): Still Building After Hard Fork Hype Now trading near $0.0775, Kaspa has pulled back slightly with a 1.7% daily and 10% weekly loss. This comes after a 32% rally triggered by its KIP-10 Crescendo hard fork, which will allow the network to process 10 blocks per second, a massive upgrade in throughput. While there’s some price resistance around $0.08, the long-term view remains positive due to growing usage and strong distribution. Kaspa’s blockDAG structure and scalability focus continue to align with rising demand for solid infrastructure networks. Once the short-term dip is absorbed, analysts expect it to remain in the conversation about the most popular cryptos in 2025, especially in the tech-driven category. Arbitrum (ARB): Eyeing Growth in the Layer-2 Race Arbitrum currently trades between $0.345 and $0.35, showing a weekly gain of around 2%. With a total market value of $1.68 billion and daily volumes around $300 million, it’s attracting more interest. Increased address activity, up 30%, and higher bridging stats confirm growing usage. Even with a token unlock of nearly 92.6 million coins coming, ARB jumped almost 10%, signaling strong support. Should this pace continue, many expect a push toward the $0.56 mark. As Ethereum scaling becomes more crucial, Arbitrum’s position as a Layer-2 leader could help it remain one of the most popular cryptos in 2025 among rollup-based solutions. Final Take! The next crypto rally will favor coins with real use, strong networks, and loyal communities. While Celestia, Kaspa, and Arbitrum all bring something valuable, it’s BlockDAG that’s pulling ahead in user excitement and tech strength. Its $305 million presale, ability to scale at speed, and EVM-ready build make it one of the most popular cryptos in 2025. With over 2 million miners, 22.6 billion coins sold, and exchange listings coming, it checks nearly every box. Whether you’re closely tracking crypto market trends or exploring high-return ideas, BlockDAG is now a serious contender. The window to get in at a lower price is closing fast. In the race for the most popular cryptos in 2025 , BlockDAG is setting the pace.

However, the price has been moving sideways lately, with no strong movement in either direction. On the daily chart, XRP has been bouncing between support and resistance levels without making any big moves. Right now, the key support zone for XRP is between $2.05 and $2.10, while the main resistance sits around $2.30 to $2.40. If XRP can break above this resistance, the next challenge will be at $2.60. On the other hand, if the price falls below $2.05, it could find support around $1.90 to $1.80. In the short term, experts believe XRP is likely to continue trading sideways, as it lacks enough buying or selling pressure to push the price up or down in a big way. However, things could get more interesting in the long run. Can XRP Price Hit $10? One important update on the fundamental side is Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Since early June, the market cap of RLUSD has jumped from $310 million to $450 million — a big increase in just two weeks. This surge shows growing interest in stablecoins, and Ripple’s entry into this market could boost the overall demand and visibility for XRP in the long run. If stablecoin projects continue to gain attention, Ripple and XRP might benefit from the momentum too. Some analysts have pointed out that XRP is slowly showing signs of bullish pressure. If this continues and gains strength, XRP has the potential to climb much higher. In fact, the long-term price target for XRP remains between $7.50 and $10, but it will need stronger momentum and positive market conditions to reach those levels.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-16 02:04:19

Traditional assets fell, altcoins wobbled—but amid the chaos, a handful of utility-focused projects stood firm. Qubetics ($TICS) emerged in conversations due to its aggressive swap compatibility, slashed token supply, and real use cases in cross-border payments. That sharp separation from speculative tokens created a buzz among those hunting the best cryptos to join for short-term profits. Simultaneously, Cosmos began generating headlines after a protocol upgrade cut transaction fees by 40%, unleashing a surge in interchain activity. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash saw an uptick in merchant acceptance following a partnership with a major Latin American retail chain—highlighting low-fee, high-speed payments. These developments reinforced momentum toward coins with real-world applicability, not hype. Against this backdrop, smart capital is scanning the horizon for the next gainers—projects that deliver on utility and network growth. Cosmos, Bitcoin Cash, and Qubetics each fulfill that role, with Qubetics bringing novel infrastructure and a nearly sold-out crypto presale that may accelerate adoption for those entering now. These are not mere tokens; they stand among the best cryptos to join for short-term profits because they answer pressing needs in global finance, scalability, and enterprise adoption. Qubetics ($TICS): Cross‑Border Transactions Driving Real Utility Qubetics stands apart due to its final crypto presale in Stage 37. More than 515 million tokens have been claimed by over 27,900 holders, raising $18 million. Only 10 million tokens remain at $0.3370—a moment that has stirred a rush around this flagship best cryptos to join for short-term profits, thanks to the network’s tightened supply from 4 billion to 1.36 billion. Public allocation has jumped to 38.55%, integrating community‑first governance. This shift from speculation to purposeful utility has solidified Qubetics’ position among high‑growth prospects. That precise timing and structural scarcity positions it as a leading candidate among the best cryptos to join for short-term profits in the current market. Cross‑Border Payments: Real Use Case in Action Seamless remittances and merchant transactions form the backbone of Qubetics’ rollout: The non‑custodial multi‑chain wallet enables instant swaps between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana without wrapped tokens. A payment from a trader in Turkey can settle instantly in Pakistan without conversions or delays. This isn’t typical blockchain hype—it’s utility built for global currencies. Several fintech firms in Central Asia are piloting escrow systems using Qubetics’ wallet architecture, cutting fees and latency in cross-border settlements. Its integration with local digital ID platforms smooths compliance hurdles. By circumventing middlemen, Qubetics shapes the future of frictionless global payments. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics answers a genuine need. Cross‑channel trading, decentralized payments, and higher control over token supply fit the market demand. Its utility makes it one of the best cryptos to join for short-term profits, delivering infrastructure that addresses global finance and scalability pain points. Cosmos (ATOM): Interchain Scaling Gains Traction A recent protocol upgrade reduced transaction fees by nearly 40%, igniting renewed activity in the Cosmos ecosystem. Interchain contracts across 45 blockchains recorded a 25% uptick in usage. These upgrades brought Cosmos back into the spotlight as a durable option among the best cryptos to join for short-term profits. Interoperability solutions for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming are now launching more smoothly. Chains that once struggled with congestion are moving assets across Cosmos zones in seconds. This increased throughput and accessibility lifts both utility and developer interest at the core Cosmos hub. Projects leveraging Cosmos’ IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol are scaling rapidly. Lending dApps connecting to Ethereum bridge pools, NFT platforms syncing with Polygon, and gaming networks tapping Cosmos’ speed all highlight sovereign chain advantages. A Chainlink pilot enabled off‑chain data on-chain, improving the network’s data oracle capabilities. Developers report faster launches and lower network friction. By delivering genuine scaling across sovereign chains, Cosmos offers utility to builders and users. Reduced fees and stronger developer tools support its case as one of the best cryptos to join for short-term profits, addressing scalability and interchain limitations head-on. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Merchant Adoption Powers Momentum A recent partnership between Bitcoin Cash and a prominent Latin American retail chain added BCH as a checkout option for 450 locations. Payment volume climbed 18% within two weeks. BCH’s appeal lies in sub‑penny fees and instant confirmations, making it well positioned among the best cryptos to join for short-term profits. Marketing campaigns included in-store QR codes and mobile wallet integrations, boosting adoption. Local service providers began accepting BCH, and POS terminals handled microtransactions with ease. Merchants in Caracas reported smoother daily turnovers. Commuters preferring digital payments find BCH transactions faster than card networks. Micro‑subscription use‑cases—like digital tipping and pay‑per‑use charging—are emerging. A Decentralized Autonomous Retail app integrating BCH tokens helped 12 vendors enroll in pilot programs. This renewed merchant involvement places Bitcoin Cash into real transactional use again. These developments make BCH more than a peer-to-peer currency—it stands among the best cryptos to join for short-term profits due to its everyday utility and growing merchant network. Bitcoin Cash is delivering low‑cost, real transactions across markets with rising electronic adoption. It offers accessible entry points for users and merchants—factors that cement its position as one of the best cryptos to join for short-term profits, addressing fledgling payments infrastructure head-first. Qubetics’ QubeQode and Qubetics IDE: Tools Empowering Enterprise Builders Qubetics has released QubeQode, a no-code smart contract builder that allows enterprises to configure tokenized assets, remittances, and identity layers without writing a line of code. The companion Qubetics IDE supports JavaScript, Python, and Rust smart contracts seamlessly deployable across multiple chains. These platforms are gaining traction across provider pilot groups in Asia and Europe. A logistics firm utilized QubeQode to deploy sealed‑bid documents across networks, and a remittance corridor used the IDE for automated fiat conversions. These integrations have supported thousands of real‑world transactions without friction. In a market demanding faster builder onboarding, QubeQode and the IDE deliver. They provide escrow logic, programmable invoices, token custodial management, and data‑tracking capabilities—enabling applications that go live in days, not months. This developer ecosystem supports Qubetics’ position among the best cryptos to join for short-term profits, because these tools lower entry barriers and increase adoption velocity. Conclusion By evaluating three distinct use-case verticals, this article confirms that Qubetics, Cosmos, and Bitcoin Cash rank among the best cryptos to join for short-term profits based on real-world utility. Each token is positioned at a key nexus—Qubetics enabling cross-border money movement, Cosmos delivering interchain scale, and Bitcoin Cash restoring merchant-level adoption. The alignment of utility and network momentum makes this a pivotal opportunity window.

The legislation not only distinguishes between virtual and crypto assets but also aligns the country with global anti-money laundering standards, potentially paving the way for removal from the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) gray list. Vietnam’s presence on the FATF gray list since 2023 has created compliance challenges for local financial institutions and increased scrutiny of cross-border transactions. Vietnam establishes a two-tier classification system The National Assembly approved the so-called “Law on Digital Technology Industry” on Saturday, June 14. Slated for implementation in 2026, the law marks a broader push to spur innovation in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and semiconductors, while setting clearer rules for the crypto sector after years of regulatory limbo. According to The Investor Vafie Magazine, “the law defines crypto assets as digital assets that use encryption or similar digital technologies for validation during creation, issuance, storage, or transfer.” The legislation establishes clear distinctions between different categories of digital assets and also excludes securities and fiat currencies from the crypto asset definition. You might also like: Crypto VC funding: IREN’s $550m convertible offering, Hypernative’s $40m raise The new law creates separate categories for virtual assets and crypto assets. Virtual assets are considered as digital assets used for exchange or investment. At the same time, cryptocurrencies use encryption technology to validate transactions and also ownership. The government retains the authority to develop detailed classifications, business conditions, and management protocols for digital assets. In compliance with global best practices, regulatory bodies must implement cybersecurity measures to stop the proliferation of weapons, money laundering, and terrorism financing. The FATF has specifically recommended establishing clear virtual asset regulations as part of anti-money laundering compliance efforts.

Implementation begins Jan. 1, 2026 and provides a transition period for businesses and regulators to prepare operational frameworks. The Ministry of Science and Technology drafted the legislation as part of broader digital technology sector development initiatives. Beyond cryptocurrency regulation, the law establishes extensive incentives for digital technology enterprises and innovation programs. Special policies encourage controlled technology experimentation and shared digital infrastructure development across multiple sectors. Local governments must implement human resource development policies for digital technology industries, particularly for key projects involving semiconductors, artificial intelligence systems, and digital technology products. Subsidies will support hiring high-quality personnel and workforce training programs. The legislation also prioritizes software production and AI data centers for investment, tax, and land-use incentives. These sectors receive formal recognition as strategic priorities under Vietnamese law.

Legal Expert Says ‘Don’t Hope..’,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-xrp-skyrocket-to-5-after-ripple-lawsuit-decision-today-legal-expert-says-dont-hope/,"The post Will XRP Skyrocket to $5 After Ripple Lawsuit Decision Today? Legal Expert Says ‘Don’t Hope..’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to keep the crypto community on edge. Recently, both Ripple and the SEC renewed their joint request for an indicative ruling from Judge Analisa Torres — and now, latest rumors on social media claim a decision could arrive as soon as Monday. If the court approves the motion, many XRP supporters believe the token could quickly surge past $5. But not everyone is convinced this is a realistic outcome. Expert Issues Warning Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan warned the community not to get carried away. In a recent post, he reminded followers that it took Judge Torres just seven days to reject a similar joint motion earlier. He suggested that the quick decision in the last case might be a hint that this new motion could face the same fate. Morgan explained that the strongest part of Ripple and the SEC’s request is their argument that modifying the final judgment is a necessary condition for their settlement. If Judge Torres agrees to lower Ripple’s fine and dissolve the injunction, it would finally end the case, saving court resources by closing both the appeal and cross-appeal. Perhaps you should not hope for that. It only took 7 days for Judge Torres to reject the last joint motion to modify the judgment to reduce the fine and dissolve the injunction. Less than 7 days to decide the current joint motion may not be the best sign she will grant it. https://t.co/9yFksn6Jrq — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 15, 2025 However, Morgan also pointed out a weakness in this argument. He said that it was Ripple’s choice to make the settlement dependent on modifying the final orders. The parties could have simply agreed to end the legal fight and move on, but Ripple wanted more. Now, they’re essentially asking the court to accept a deal structured on their terms. “I think she might grant it,” Morgan admitted, “but it also wouldn’t surprise me if she doesn’t.”",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-16 02:47:06

According to a June 15 post on x by Polyhedra, the incident stemmed from “abnormal on-chain transactions” involving the ZKJ/KOGE trading pair. KOGE, issued by a group known as 48 Club DAO, operates in close connection with ZKJ through shared liquidity pools and has been incentivized through Binance’s Alpha Points program . Dear Polyhedra community — we want to emphasize that the fundamentals of Polyhedra remain strong, both in our technology and in the incredible support from our community. We’re continuing to build and push forward as planned. Today’s price drop was caused by a series of abnormal… — Polyhedra (@PolyhedraZK) June 15, 2025 Because the tokens are regularly traded against each other, their price dynamics are closely related. A chain reaction began when traders converted KOGE into ZKJ in large quantities as the liquidity in the KOGE/USDT pool dried up. This flooded the ZKJ/USDT pool. Major holders pulled a sizable portion of KOGE and ZKJ from on-chain pools, according to Binance, starting a “liquidation cascade” that caused the prices of both assets to plummet. KOGE dropped from $62 to $24 while ZKJ fell from nearly $2 to $0.30. On-chain analysts linked the price collapse to wallets farming Alpha Points. One wallet withdrew over 60,000 KOGE, roughly $3.7M, and 273,000 ZKJ, about $530K, while two others liquidated another $5 million combined. The rush was further heightened with a scheduled unlock of 15.5 million ZKJ tokens on June 19, which will add about $10 million in potential sell pressure to already stressed markets. You might also like: https://crypto.news/solana-sags-hold-holds-strong-altcoins-outshine-majors/ Community reports indicate that the KOGE/USDT pool was drained first, leaving holders unable to exit their positions. With KOGE/USDT liquidity gone, investors rushed to swap into ZKJ using the still-functional KOGE/ZKJ pool. The resulting spike in ZKJ redemptions overwhelmed its Tether ( USDT ) pair, leading to a chain reaction that pushed ZKJ to record lows. Despite the collapse, Polyhedra insisted the project’s fundamentals remain strong and that it is conducting a full review of the incident. Binance responded by adjusting Alpha Points rules. Starting June 17, trades between Alpha tokens like KOGE and ZKJ will no longer count toward user point totals, a move intended to limit similar imbalances. Binance is aware that ZKJ and KOGE have experienced significant price volatilities and our initial findings indicate the developments were a result of large holders removing on-chain liquidity, and liquidation cascade in the market. In order to maintain market fairness and… pic.twitter.com/O89hpRVaQz — Binance (@binance) June 15, 2025 The 48 Club has not publicly commented since the crash, though it had previously disclosed that KOGE was fully diluted at launch and stated no commitment to restrict token sales. DAO members expressed concerns, accusing the team of poor planning and lack of transparency. A bullish scenario following the collapse will depend on Polyhedra’s ability to quickly restore market stability and provide insight into its liquidity structure and token utility. Rebuilding trust and slowing the selloff may be possible with a detailed post-mortem and structural changes like better isolation between the KOGE and ZKJ markets. But if investor confidence continues to drop, a bearish outcome might occur, especially since another big ZKJ token unlock is scheduled for later this week. If there is no clear solution, selling pressure may persist and prices may level off, which would eventually damage ZKJ’s reputation.

Besides, there was a break above a contracting triangle with resistance at $2,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading near $2,575 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,585 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,620 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,660 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,880 swing high to the $2,441 low. A clear move above the $2,660 resistance might send the price toward the $2,720 resistance. An upside break above the $2,720 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone or even $2,880 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,620 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,540 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350.

Whale Wallets Trigger the Collapse 1/ $ZKJ plummeted by over 63%, with more than $99M liquidated. What happened — and who triggered the crash? pic.twitter.com/cTFrNySw3v — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 15, 2025 According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain , six whale wallets collectively sold 5.23 million ZKJ tokens for approximately $9.66 million, right before the crash. These wallets had previously removed liquidity from both ZKJ and KOGE, exchanging KOGE for ZKJ and then dumping ZKJ en masse. This aggressive sell-off drained liquidity and triggered a steep price drop, prompting a wave of forced liquidations for leveraged long positions. Among those liquidated were six traders who each lost over $1 million, with ZKJ accounting for 81.3% of all crypto liquidations in just four hours, per Coinglass data. ZKJ Coin Price Crash ZKJ’s price nosedived from $1.98 to a low of $0.7625, marking a more than 60% fall on CoinGecko. CoinMarketCap presented an even grimmer scenario, showing the token collapsing over 80% to $0.33, wiping out the token’s market cap to under $95 million. Although ZKJ briefly rebounded to $1.41, it quickly fell back to hover around $0.80 by midday. What’s particularly shocking is that ZKJ had been trading in a relatively stable range between $2.05 and $1.98 for over a month, making the sudden breakdown all the more alarming. KOGE Connection and Community Backlash It’s call a rug pull or a pump and dump. The weakness of all altcoins — CryptoEqualizer (@Crypt2Equalizer) June 15, 2025 Crypto X users were quick to call out what many now suspect to be a coordinated “pump and dump” or even a “long-planned harvesting operation.” A key post by user ETH APPLE alleged that the KOGE pool had run out of USDT, which left liquidity providers stranded and triggered a mass conversion of KOGE into ZKJ, ultimately crashing both tokens. “The issue began when the KOGE pool ran out of USDT, leaving LPs unable to exit positions,” wrote ETH APPLE. “This led to a mass sell-off of KOGE into ZKJ… the KOGE team hadn’t added any USDT to the pool.”",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-16 03:30:13

This was revealed in response to a user asking whether RLUSD would be added to Cardano. There is a whole XRP package with the glacier drop, lace wallet support, XRP DeFi and the RealUSD talks. — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 14, 2025 Charles replied that there is already a full XRP integration package in the works. “There is a whole XRP package with the glacier drop, lace wallet support, XRP DeFi, and the RealUSD talks,” he said. Glacier Drop to Include XRP Support and Midnight Airdrop The Glacier Drop is Midnight’s multi-chain airdrop, which was revealed during Consensus 2025 in Toronto. It will target around 37 million blockchains, including the XRP Ledger, but only retail users will be eligible for it. As part of the Glacier Drop, Midnight will airdrop two tokens: NIGHT (governance) and DUST (privacy-focused). XRP holders can qualify by storing their tokens in eligible wallets. Lace Wallet Set to Add XRP Hoskinson recently confirmed that Lace Wallet, Cardano’s lightweight, multi-chain wallet, will soon support XRP. This would allow users to send, receive, and store XRP alongside assets like ADA and Bitcoin. He has shown strong support for Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD. Launched in December, Real USD (RLUSD) currently runs on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger, but Cardano may soon be added in the future. XRP DeFi Use Cases XRP’s integration into Cardano could bring fresh DeFi use cases like lending and borrowing, and other financial services within the Cardano ecosystem. In late 2024, Hoskinson said Cardano could offer XRP some “amazing” DeFi tools. In February, a Wanchain bridge went live, allowing native XRP to connect to Cardano. The update turned heads, given Hoskinson’s past disagreements with the XRP community. But his recent comments hint at a shift in tone, as he opened up about the need for more collaboration and less competition within the crypto industry. Recently, Charles has also proposed diversifying $100 million worth of ADA into stablecoins and even Bitcoin, aiming to bring BTC into Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem and create a multi-asset treasury model.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|WALLET|XRP|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-16 03:52:13

On Saturday, the National Assembly passed the Law on Digital Technology Industry, a sweeping measure that defines, classifies and outlines the management of digital assets for the first time in the country’s history. The move follows years of regulatory ambiguity and mounting international pressure. Since 2023, Vietnam has remained on the Financial Action Task Force’s “gray list” due to insufficient anti-money laundering safeguards around virtual assets. In response, the government accelerated efforts to formalize digital asset regulations, culminating in this law, which is scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026. Vietnam’s National Assembly has passed the Digital Technology Industry Law on June 14, 2025, officially recognizing and regulating digital assets for the first time, effective from January 1, 2026. The law classifies assets into “virtual assets” and “crypto assets,” excluding… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 15, 2025 Vietnam Moves to Clarify Digital Asset Rules After PM’s March Directive It comes after Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính in March urged faster progress on crypto regulation , directing the Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Vietnam to submit a complete draft of the legal framework. The move reflected the government’s growing urgency to bring clarity to the fast-evolving digital asset space. The new law separates digital assets into two broad categories — virtual assets and crypto assets. Virtual assets are defined as non-financial digital tools used for exchange or investment. They explicitly exclude securities like stocks or bonds, and digital versions of fiat currency such as tokenized Vietnamese Dong. Crypto assets, by contrast, are encrypted digital units that use blockchain or similar technologies to confirm ownership and process transactions. This category also excludes financial instruments covered by civil or banking laws. It mainly refers to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with other blockchain-based tokens that rely on encryption for security and decentralization. With $105B in Crypto Inflows, Vietnam Targets Safer Market Structure Critically, the law gives the government the responsibility to define business conditions, operational categories and compliance requirements for digital asset activities. In addition, it directs regulatory agencies to enforce standards on cybersecurity, anti-money laundering and terror financing prevention. These measures are based on international best practices, aiming to bring Vietnam in line with global norms. These new safeguards are expected to help Vietnam align with FATF guidelines. They also aim to boost investor confidence by providing clearer rules. Vietnam is one of the world’s leading countries in crypto adoption, with 17m citizens holding digital assets. Given this scale, the new legal clarity marks a significant turning point for the country’s digital economy. According to Chainalysis, Vietnam ranks fifth globally in crypto interest , with $105b in capital inflows recorded across 2023 and 2024. Legislation Signals Broader Tech Ambitions, From AI to Semiconductor Supply Chains The legislation forms part of a wider strategy to grow Vietnam’s digital technology sector. In addition to crypto regulation, it promotes innovation in semiconductors, AI systems and digital infrastructure. To support this, the law introduces tax incentives, land-use benefits and R&D funding for companies in these fields. It also encourages the development of technical talent through training programs run by both public and private institutions. Le Quang Huy, Chairman of the National Assembly’s Committee on Science, Technology and Environment, said the law reflects Vietnam’s ambition to become a meaningful player in the global semiconductor supply chain. It outlines a national plan to support chip design, production and testing, while attracting foreign investment and integrating these efforts with the local electronics industry.

As Neo Pepe positions itself to make an impact in the financial market, crypto experts are debating its ability to balance its features with the financial wants of investors. Can meme coins become serious investments? From Internet Jokes to Symbolic Movements Over the last few years, meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) were often seen as tokens that relied on market trends. However, Neo Pepe looks to change this, chaining meme coins to assets that possess better features than being jokes, using decentralization and opposition to centralized financial control to achieve this. Neo Pepe’s whitepaper also shows the token to be a serious investment vehicle rather than an asset for entertainment, aligning the meme culture with deeper meaning. This shift represents an important moment in crypto, as most meme coins now provide relevant uses in the crypto market. Neo Pepe, for example, uses its usage to challenge systemic market manipulation and market centralization, transforming meme coins into better ideas and powerful tools for the community. Such a purposeful shift marks a clear move from being traditional meme coins to being long-term investments that impact society. Moreover, industry analysts have also recognized the increase in investors attracted to Neo Pepe. These investors are looking for tokens that provide value and usage in the real world, making Neo Pepe the best in the market that is looking to change the crypto culture. Strategic Presale Dynamics and Investor Commitment One factor that sets Neo Pepe apart is the way its developers designed its presale. It is expected to sell over 16 stages, with its price expected to increase from $0.05 to $0.16. The project is also targeting $50 million in funding during the presale. After the launch, tokens are expected to be unlocked every hour, which is expected to boost investor engagement and balance the market. Investors looking to participate in the Neo Pepe presale will be able to benefit if they enter the presale early, increasing loyalty and improving its community. This presale also provides an example of what future meme coins should be, departing from the previous speculative models and offering value through financial planning. Analysts have also commended Neo Pepe’s presale for its transparency and structure. Unlike some launches, Neo Pepe is creating an environment that helps investors, reducing volatility in the market. This approach appeals to investors and also maintains confidence and stability within the crypto market. In addition, the presale format is expected to help Neo Pepe sustain its visibility through the fundraising phases, allowing its investors to stay after the presale. This presale strategy shows that projects can adopt the same mode in the future, boosting the credibility and market performance of their tokens. Financial Stability Through Innovative Liquidity Mechanisms Neo Pepe introduces a new development that addresses the volatility of meme coins: a built-in auto-liquidity mechanism. With each transaction, 2.5% of the funds are added to the liquidity pool, and the tokens are burned immediately. This development allows the price of the token to be stable, transforming it into a better investment asset. Such design is far apart from the speculative nature of tokens in the market, positioning Neo Pepe as a better investment option. Experts also agree that this approach will set a new standard in the meme coin market, providing investors with financial discipline and confidence that is not usually seen in the meme coin sector. Crypto economists have also mentioned that Neo Pepe’s auto-liquidity mechanism will also help its price during market fluctuations. This initiative is better for investors’ confidence, as it ensures the market is stable, a feature that has been missing among traditional meme coins. Furthermore, Neo Pepe’s liquidity model also makes it hard for price manipulation and volatility, two of the most feared features associated with meme coins. By adding this financial stability, Neo Pepe presents itself as a reliable choice for institutional and retail investors. Robust Governance and Democratic Investor Participation Neo Pepe also sets itself apart through its governance model, carried out using the NEOPGovernor contract. Investors that hold at least one million $NEOP tokens automatically have voting rights to influence decisions in the project, including allocations and exchange listings. All proposals pass through a process, which includes a 48-hour delay enforced by the Time lock controller.

On June 16, the Tokyo-listed company disclosed the purchase of 1,112 additional Bitcoin ( BTC ) at an average price of 15.18 million yen per BTC, roughly $105, 000, bringing its total holdings to exactly 10,000 BTC. The acquisition, valued at approximately 16.88 billion yen, about $110 million, marks a major milestone in the firm’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,112 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 10,000 BTC* pic.twitter.com/XlM13kQnS9 — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 16, 2025 The latest purchase was financed through the issuance of a new $210 million bond to EVO Fund, also announced on June 16. These zero-interest bonds are scheduled to mature in December 2025 but can be redeemed earlier. The entire amount raised is being directed toward buying more Bitcoin, continuing the company’s focused approach to BTC accumulation. While the firm expects little impact on its full-year earnings, it has said it will update the market if anything changes.

That final figure would represent 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Alongside its Bitcoin buying, the company uses internal performance metrics to track progress. One of these, BTC Yield, measures how much Bitcoin is held per fully diluted share and is designed to reflect the impact of both buying BTC and issuing shares. As of June 16, the yield for the current quarter was 87.2%. Past quarters have seen even sharper increases, including a 309.8% rise in Q4 2024. To finance its expansion, Metaplanet has also raised money through stock sales. It granted EVO Fund 21 million new share rights in five tranches in January, with flexible pricing and no discounts. The firm’s aggressive capital raise and BTC acquisitions have positioned it as Asia’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin and the eighth largest holder globally.

Brazil has eliminated long-standing tax exemptions on crypto gains, replacing them with a flat 17.5% capital gains tax as part of a broader fiscal reform. Meanwhile, Vietnam passed a first-of-its-kind law recognizing digital assets and setting the stage for a nationwide digital technology strategy. Vietnam Passes Groundbreaking Law Recognizing Crypto Assets, Aims to Become Digital Tech Powerhouse The National Assembly of Vietnam officially approved the Law on Digital Technology Industry on June 14, ushering in a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets, artificial intelligence, and advanced technologies. The law , scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, positions Vietnam as the first country globally to enact a standalone law dedicated entirely to the digital technology industry. The new legislation provides long-awaited legal clarity for the crypto industry in Vietnam, recognizing digital assets and dividing them into two primary categories: virtual assets and crypto assets. Although both are based on encryption or digital technologies for their verification and transfer, they explicitly exclude securities, fiat-backed digital currencies, and other conventional financial instruments. Vietnamese lawmakers vote to approve the Law on Digital Technology Industry (Source: VGP ) Under the new framework, the Vietnamese government is now responsible for defining specific business conditions and regulatory mechanisms for both asset categories, signaling a shift from a loosely regulated market to a structured environment that could attract institutional interest and innovation. The law emphasizes strict compliance with cybersecurity standards and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, aligning Vietnam with international regulatory benchmarks, particularly those set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Vietnam has been on the FATF’s “gray list” since 2023 due to concerns over money laundering and terrorist financing. The introduction of these new safeguards is expected to be a major step in addressing those issues. By bringing crypto assets under formal supervision, the Vietnamese government hopes to mitigate risks associated with scams, fraudulent investment schemes, and unregulated platforms—issues that have plagued the country’s digital asset ecosystem in recent years. A Response to Rising Crypto Crime Vietnam’s crypto sector has experienced significant abuse by malicious actors, underscoring the urgency for regulatory reform. Earlier this year, Vietnamese authorities dismantled BitMiner, a fake crypto mining platform that defrauded over 200 investors of approximately 4 billion Vietnamese dong ($157,300). The operation claimed to be based in Dubai and sold fictitious mining packages and training programs. In another major crackdown in December 2024, Hanoi City police intervened just in time to prevent 300 potential victims from investing in the “Million Smiles” crypto scam. That scheme promoted a fake in-house digital currency called QFS (Quantum Financial System), tricking more than 100 businesses and 400 individuals out of nearly 30 billion dong ($1.17 million) through fraudulent claims that included ties to ancestral treasures and spiritual guarantees. Such cases have shown the need for robust consumer protections and legal definitions for crypto-related businesses—something this new law aims to deliver. While the legal recognition of crypto assets has grabbed headlines, the law’s implications go far beyond digital currencies. It forms the cornerstone of Vietnam’s larger strategy to become a regional and global leader in digital innovation. The legislation lays out broad incentives for companies working in critical areas such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and digital infrastructure. These include tax reductions, land-use incentives, and government-backed research and development grants. In particular, firms focused on core technologies like chip design and AI data centers are expected to benefit. Provincial governments will also be required to launch programs that support workforce development, offering subsidies, scholarships, and training initiatives tailored to digital technologies. Moreover, Vietnam plans to overhaul its education system by integrating digital technology skills into national curricula, ensuring that students are equipped with the competencies needed for the digital age. Vietnam's Role in the Emerging Digital Economy Vietnam’s latest legislative initiative places it at the forefront of a global trend where emerging markets are leading the charge in crypto adoption. A recent survey by Consensys highlighted Vietnam as one of the fastest-growing digital asset markets, supported by a young, tech-savvy population and growing smartphone penetration. International companies are already taking notice. Earlier this year, crypto derivatives exchange Bitget launched BitEXC, a custom-built trading platform tailored for Vietnamese users—an indication that global firms are preparing for a more regulated and accessible market. As the country prepares for the law’s implementation in 2026, businesses and regulators alike are watching closely. If successful, Vietnam could become a model for digital policy frameworks, offering a blueprint for how to simultaneously foster innovation, protect consumers, and uphold international financial standards. Brazil Ends Crypto Tax Exemptions with New Flat 17.5% Rate Under Provisional Measure 1303 Meanwhile, in a sweeping shift that could reshape the financial strategies of both retail and institutional investors, the Brazilian government has eliminated its longstanding tax exemption for small-scale crypto gains and implemented a flat 17.5% capital gains tax on all digital asset profits. The change comes under Provisional Measure 1303, part of a broader government initiative to increase public revenue through financial market taxation. Provisional Measure 1303 (Source: Brazil Government ) Previously, Brazilian residents were exempt from paying income tax on crypto sales under 35,000 Brazilian reals (roughly $6,300) per month. Above that threshold, capital gains were taxed on a progressive scale ranging from 15% to 22.5%, with the highest bracket applying to trades exceeding 30 million reals. Effective as of June 12, 2025, the new regime removes these thresholds, enforcing a uniform 17.5% tax rate across the board—regardless of transaction volume, wallet size, or investor type. Impact on Retail and Wealthy Investors The move marks a dramatic departure from a system that many small traders had relied on for tax relief. Under the old rules, small monthly trades went untaxed, allowing casual or beginner investors to explore crypto markets without immediate tax burdens. Now, even modest gains will be subject to the new flat rate, raising the barrier for entry and dampening enthusiasm among low-capital participants. Conversely, high-net-worth individuals and institutional traders may benefit from the flat tax, which could lower their effective tax liability. Under the previous system, large transactions—particularly those above 5 million reals—were subject to tax rates up to 22.5%. With the 17.5% cap now in place, Brazil's wealthier investors could see reduced tax bills on large-scale crypto activity. Perhaps more significantly, Provisional Measure 1303 expands the tax base to include self-custodied crypto wallets and foreign-held digital assets, making it harder for investors to sidestep local tax obligations through offshore strategies. According to local reporting from Portal do Bitcoin, the measure introduces quarterly tax assessments, giving investors the ability to offset losses over a rolling five-quarter period. However, this window will be reduced starting in 2026, tightening loss recovery options. The inclusion of self-custody wallets means that even crypto not held on centralized exchanges—long considered a regulatory gray area—will now be monitored for capital gains. Investors who previously stored funds in private wallets to avoid surveillance may now be compelled to declare holdings and gains under stricter transparency requirements. Other Financial Sectors Affected The government’s changes are not limited to crypto. Several once-exempt financial instruments are also being pulled into the tax net. Profits from Agribusiness and Real Estate Credit Letters (LCAs and LCIs) as well as Receivables Certificates (CRIs and CRAs) will now face a 5% income tax, ending their tax-free status. Meanwhile, revenue generated from betting and gambling has also been hit, with tax rates rising from 12% to 18%, further reflecting the government’s aggressive stance on extracting revenue from non-traditional financial sectors. These updates follow political backlash from an earlier attempt by Brazil’s Finance Ministry to increase the Financial Transaction Tax (IOF)—a plan that was ultimately abandoned amid strong opposition from both Congress and financial industry stakeholders. Brazil’s tax overhaul comes at a time when global regulators are tightening their grip on the cryptocurrency sector, particularly in emerging economies with large unbanked populations and rapidly growing crypto user bases. As the world’s seventh-largest crypto market, Brazil has historically embraced digital assets as tools for financial inclusion and inflation protection. But this latest pivot demonstrates the Brazilian government’s growing concern over unregulated capital flows, offshore tax evasion, and rising crypto-linked fraud, all while seeking new avenues to fund social programs and infrastructure. Bitcoin for Wages? Brazil Considers Crypto Salaries In March 2025, Brazilian lawmakers introduced a bill proposing that employers be allowed to pay up to 50% of wages in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. The bill, still under discussion, would prohibit full crypto-based salary payments for standard employees but permit full payment in digital assets for foreign workers and independent contractors, provided agreements are contractually defined. All payments would need to reference official exchange rates determined by institutions authorized by the Central Bank of Brazil, ensuring price stability and transparency in salary conversions. While the bill has not yet passed, it represents the country’s dual-track approach: tighten regulation while enabling innovation. If approved, it could make Brazil one of the first major economies to formally embrace crypto-denominated wages under a centralized regulatory structure.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-16 05:00:00

This shift is making way for the best altcoins to buy today that display solid growth signals. Solana is gaining traction in DeFi, Cardano is seeing large wallet accumulation, and Avalanche’s subnets are bringing fresh momentum. All eyes are also on BlockDAG, which is gaining fast due to its rapid presale progress and high-speed network model. BlockDAG’s position among the best altcoins to buy today has grown even stronger. The platform’s ability to attract developer interest, secure a US-based sponsorship, and reach new funding levels has made it one of the most followed altcoins heading into 2025. Below is a detailed look at BlockDAG, along with the latest on SOL, ADA, and AVAX. BlockDAG (BDAG) Currently one of the most active presales in the market, BlockDAG (BDAG) has moved to batch 29 with a coin price of $0.0276. The platform has already delivered 2,660% gains since batch 1, and batch 29 is currently priced at $0.0276. Analysts believe BDAG could reach $1 during the next major rally, representing a 35x increase from the current price. BlockDAG offers more than hype. Its full EVM compatibility allows Ethereum-based dApps to migrate without rewriting code. The system’s DAG-PoW hybrid structure supports over 15,000 transactions per second, making it a robust infrastructure choice. So far, more than 22.6 billion BDAG coins have been sold, generating $305 million in funding. The project is backed by 20 confirmed exchange listings and a new US-based sponsorship. With over 2 million users already mining through the X1 app and the final presale rounds almost complete, BlockDAG is becoming a top pick among the best altcoins to buy today. If the coin does hit $1 next year, many may look back at this moment as the turning point. Solana (SOL) Solana continues to show strength despite recent dips, now trading at $148.5 after a 2.7% decline over three days. Behind the scenes, however, activity is growing. Solana’s DeFi total value locked rose by $860 million in five days, hitting $8.81 billion. Although 31 million SOL tokens moved to exchanges, suggesting near-term sell pressure, many expect that capital to rotate into new growth phases. Analysts are monitoring the $142.6 support level and the $171.9 resistance level. A recovery could be quick if SOL maintains its support level and volumes rise. For now, Solana keeps its place as one of the best altcoins to buy today due to strong use cases and ongoing development. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is priced at $0.6415, down about 3.5% for the day and 4% over the past week. Despite broader pullbacks, some indicators point to a possible shift. Reports from Binance analysts show ADA forming a bullish pattern in the $0.633–$0.637 range, aiming for $0.652 if current momentum continues. A move above $0.645 could shift short-term sentiment. Large holders have added around 310 million ADA this past week, showing renewed interest. Although ADA has dropped more than 20% this month, its ongoing upgrades and strong community support keep it among the best altcoins to buy today. If a bounce from current support happens, ADA could offer solid value heading into next year. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche has made a quick move into the $19.2–$20.5 range after rising between 4–7% from its June lows. DeFi and NFT activity on Avalanche’s subnets are bringing attention back to the project, with more developers joining the platform. Current market data remains steady, with resistance at $20.5–$21. If broken, AVAX may push toward $22+. Support at $19–$19.5 has held firm so far, adding confidence in the outlook. With subnet growth and NFT adoption continuing, Avalanche is again seen as one of the best altcoins to buy today. Final Say! The market is starting to highlight projects with solid backing and clear direction. Solana’s rising DeFi figures, Cardano’s wallet accumulation, and Avalanche’s new integrations show real development. BlockDAG, however, draws strong attention with its $305 million presale, a large user base, and fast-growing batch pricing. Those tracking the best altcoins to buy today should keep these four on their radar. Solana offers fast and low-cost transactions. Cardano provides long-term, community-driven growth. Avalanche is building out its infrastructure for broader utility. BlockDAG combines speed and usability with wide support. For those watching closely, these could turn out to be strong players in the 2025 cycle.

Last week, the consumer sentiment index rebounded in its first improvement in six months, while cooler-than-expected consumer and producer inflation reports (CPI and PPI) lifted investor spirits. However, Friday’s escalation of conflict caused stocks and crypto to tumble as investors fled to cash and gold. Meanwhile, oil prices surged nearly 5% as markets opened for the first time since Friday, suggesting that the volatility is not going away yet. Economic events June 16 to 20 Monday morning is likely to see some market reaction from the weekend’s violence, which has continued from both sides. Iran reportedly told mediators Qatar and Oman that it is not open to negotiating a ceasefire with Israel while under Israeli attack. May’s Retail Sales report is due on Tuesday, providing data on how much consumers are spending on durable and non-durable goods. Retail Sales reports are a leading indicator of economic health, offering insights into inflationary pressures stemming from consumer demand. Tuesday also sees May’s Industrial Production report released. This Fed data shows the volume of production of US industries like manufacturing, mining, and utilities, and has little impact on markets. Wednesday has the big Federal Reserve rates decision, and futures markets still foresee no change in rates at the coming meeting, with a 96.7% probability of rates remaining at 4.25-4.50%. “If they [Federal Reserve] move rates lower too early before there is evidence that there is weakening in the economy that they can then point to, they raise the risk of actually boosting inflation expectations further,” said Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management.

In March, Pakistan launched the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to help build crypto laws. In April, it introduced its first-ever crypto policy 2025, designed to meet global compliance standards such as those set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The government is also fast-tracking legislation drafted by the PCC. Saqib, who heads the council, also revealed plans to set up a national Bitcoin reserve , a bold move signaling Pakistan’s commitment to becoming a crypto-forward economy. Meanwhile, Saylor also encouraged Pakistan’s idea of creating a Bitcoin reserve, basically a stash of Bitcoin that the country would keep like gold. He believes this could help Pakistan stand out as a forward-thinking nation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026, the legislation recognizes and regulates crypto assets for the first time in the Southeast Asian nation, reflecting Vietnam’s intent to position itself as a regional digital powerhouse. Under the new law, digital assets will be split into two primary categories: virtual assets and crypto assets. Both categories are defined as relying on encryption or digital technology for their issuance and transfer, but they notably exclude financial instruments such as securities or digital fiat currencies. The government is now responsible for specifying business conditions, regulatory classifications, and mechanisms for oversight. Additionally, the law incorporates international-level cybersecurity and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards, an effort to address Vietnam’s continued presence on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) gray list since 2023. Tech Incentives and Education Reform to Drive Innovation Beyond crypto regulations, the law lays the foundation for Vietnam’s ambition to become a leading digital tech hub . It outlines sweeping government incentives for companies operating in artificial intelligence, semiconductor manufacturing, and digital infrastructure. These incentives include tax breaks, land use benefits, and research and development (R&D) support, particularly for firms involved in core technologies like chip design and AI data centers. The legislation also mandates that regional governments support workforce development by offering training subsidies and promoting digital education. Digital technology skills will be woven into national curricula at various education levels to ensure a future-ready workforce. In a statement, the government said, “With this move, Vietnam has become the first country in the world to enact a standalone law specifically dedicated to the digital technology industry.” Vietnam Tightens Grip on Crypto Scams The country’s regulatory push comes amid rising crypto-related fraud. In February 2025, authorities arrested four people running BitMiner, a fake crypto mining platform that scammed over 200 victims out of 4 billion Vietnamese dong (about $157,300). In another major case from December 2024, Hanoi police foiled an elaborate crypto scam tied to a fraudulent token named QFS (Quantum Financial System), which had deceived 100 businesses and 400 individuals, raking in over 30 billion dong ($1.17 million).

The meeting comes after a series of bold steps by Islamabad. In March, the government established the Pakistan Crypto Council to create a legal framework for digital assets. Then in April, it introduced the country’s first national crypto policy, designed to align with FATF standards. Soon after, the government created the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. In addition, it announced a state-backed strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. With Support from Zhao and Trump Allies, Pakistan’s Crypto Plan Gains Weight Saylor is not the only high-profile figure showing interest. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was appointed a strategic advisor to the PCC in April. His addition, despite past legal controversies, is seen by officials as a signal of global credibility. Others from US political and financial circles have also entered the picture. Gentry Beach Jr., a close ally of President Donald Trump, visited Islamabad as part of a US delegation helping shape the council’s structure. Meanwhile, Zachary Witkoff, son of Trump associate and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, signed a deal in April between his firm, World Liberty Financial, and the PCC. The agreement aims to embed blockchain technology into Pakistan’s financial systems. Additionally, the company is reportedly linked to the Trump family, with Eric, Donald Jr. and Jared Kushner holding a controlling stake.

After hitting a low of $0.55 and a recent high of $0.63, the price has been struggling to maintain the uptrend. This dip is partly linked to broader market weakness, especially after rising geopolitical tensions across the world. At the moment, Pi Coin is still far from its all-time high of around $3, but the project’s network continues to grow, and developers are actively working on updates. Despite heavy withdrawals from the OKX exchange recently, the total Pi supply on exchanges has actually risen by 29 million in the past week, now sitting at 346.4 million Pi. Looking at the charts, the price seems to be forming a possible double top pattern near a resistance zone, raising the question, will Pi break out or face another rejection? The MACD indicator has shown a slight bullish crossover, while trading volume remains steady. Many traders are now wondering if Pi could climb towards the $1 mark soon. But the bigger question is — can it ever reach $50 or even $100 as some predictions suggest? What Could Drive Pi Coin Higher? Analysts believe three major factors will decide Pi’s future: Major Exchange Listings: If big platforms like Binance or Coinbase list Pi, it could spark a massive price rally. Ecosystem Growth: As more apps and services start accepting Pi, demand for the coin would naturally increase. Regulatory Approvals: Clear rules from governments will be crucial. If regulations turn strict, it could slow down Pi’s growth. Price Predictions: What’s Possible? Short-term (next few weeks): If momentum picks up, Pi could revisit $1.50 to $3. Medium-term (by 2025): With strong adoption and exchange listings, it might reach $10 to $50. Long-term (by 2030 and beyond): If Pi successfully builds a solid crypto economy and gains mass adoption, optimistic forecasts suggest prices between $50 to $100. However, if adoption slows or early miners start selling off their holdings, it might remain under $10.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-16 05:24:02

The setup in the truck was connected to a 10 kilovolt power line without permission. This illegal activity comes at a time when the russian officials are preparing to introduce harsher penalties. Discovery of Illegal Crypto Activity– Everything You Need to Know On Wednesday, Russian Inspectors found 95 mining devices and a transformer substation, capable of powering an entire village. While the officials were reaching the scene, two unidentified individuals fled the scene in an SUV without a trace. This illegal crypto operation was found during a line inspection in the Pribaikalsky District, marking the sixth case of electricity theft linked to crypto mining in Buryatia. What Actions Did the Russian authorities take? Russian authorities present at the scene have seized the mining rigs, and the equipment has been confiscated while pursuing legal action against the activity. The authorities are taking important steps to dismantle the illegal mining operations while promoting the legal pathway. An analyst stated – “It will be cheapest to carry out this type of activity within the limits allocated [by law] in 2025 in the Republic of Khakassia. In total, monthly consumption of 6,000 kWh in an apartment with an electric stove will cost 162 thousand rubles per year, and 157 thousand rubles in a house with electric heating.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Tornado Cash Developer Says DOJ Is Blocking Fair Trial , Penalty for Illegal Crypto Mining in Russia Russian authorities are preparing new harsh penalties for illegal cryptocurrency mining . It includes fines ranging from 100,000 to 2 million rubles (approx $1,272–$25,456). This penalty fee is applied to solo entrepreneurs, officials, and corporations, while industrial offenders see their mined crypto confiscated by the state. Besides this, Authorities are also targeting crypto payments made outside the Central Bank’s sandbox and imposing a fine up to 1 million rubles ($12,718). Final Thought This illegal crypto in a KAMAZ truck is not the only discovery of the day, as another unauthorized crypto mining operation in an abandoned building in Russia was discovered on the same Wednesday. The illegal farm in the building in Taksimo was connected to a power grid without permission and was operating without a meter. These illegal crypto mining and trading have cost millions of rubles to the russian government, prompting them to take severe actions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In an email to Cryptonews, he said that the increase in corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin is “significant.” However, “it shouldn’t be about chasing trends or building oversized positions,” Rocca added. “It’s about allocating what a business can afford to hold over a five-to-ten-year horizon, without being forced to sell into volatility.” Further, he said that firms like Strategy and Metaplanet “represent high-conviction outliers,” with bold strategies that align with their unique business plans. “In this space, patience and discipline can be underrated virtues,” he told Cryptonews. “Our view has been, and remains, that Bitcoin deserves serious consideration—but with a disciplined, long-term framework: focus on the asset itself, avoid speculative trading, and size positions responsibly.” Company Adapts Strategy Amid Yen Depreciation Metaplanet’s recent announcement to issue $210 million in 0% ordinary bonds comes at a time when Japan is facing economic challenges, characterized by high debt levels and yen depreciation. As a result, the strategy underscores Metaplanet’s commitment to leveraging Bitcoin’s potential for long-term appreciation. The Japanese Yen kicked off the week on a weaker note. However, the anticipation that the Bank of Japan might push for tighter monetary conditions, along with trade-related uncertainties, lends some support to the safe-haven Japanese Yen.

With rising adoption, TVL, and institutional interest, SUI could be eyeing long-term price targets of $5, $10, or even higher in the coming months. SUI started the year strong as it briefly crossed the $5 mark. But it further dropped over 65% as the selling pressure kicked in. Despite the drop, the buyers quickly stepped in and helped the price recover. The interest is growing again now and the momentum looks set to continue. SUI is currently trading at $3.07, up 2.9% in the last 24 hours. It is showing mixed technical signals with most moving averages bearish. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 41, indicating that momentum has cooled, and the MACD also points to a slowdown. If SUI holds above $3.10, it could climb to $3.50 this week. A rise above $3.50 may trigger a bigger rally; but if it drops below $3.00, then more selling could follow. Will SUI End June at $4? SUI started off the month slow and is stuck in a tight range as bears tried to push the price down. However, buying pressure is expected to rise in the next few days breaking past its resistance levels. The outlook for June remains bullish, with SUI likely to end the month between $3.80 and $4.00. Analysts said that SUI is shaping up to be a major player in the next bull run. The network now ranks 8th in total value locked (TVL) across all blockchains. A big part of this momentum comes from Suilend, Sui’s leading lending platform, which recently saw its TVL surge by 90% to $700 million in just one month. $SUI remains to be one of the core pillars of the upcoming bull cycle. Interesting metrics: – 8th highest TVL across chains – Suilend has become the largest lending protocol with a 90% increase in the past month –> $700M in TVL. – Over 10% of SUI's TVL is in #Bitcoin -related… pic.twitter.com/t8kypcZeQd — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 9, 2025 Additionally, over 10% of SUI’s TVL is now in Bitcoin-related assets. This kind of cross-chain functionality is drawing in new users and liquidity. The institutional interest in SUI is also on rise as several firms have filed for SUI ETF. With all these factors in play, a new all-time high for SUI may not be too far. SUI Outperforms SOL SUI is also outperforming Solana, and the trend may continue over the next 12 to 24 months.

Solana (SOL) has surged back into the spotlight with its lightning-fast performance and expanding DeFi activity, making it a strong coin for those tracking crypto coins for June 2025. But the real noise is coming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a viral new DeFi token still going at $0.03. Priced at just $0.03, MUTM is rapidly gaining momentum across social media and crypto circles, with growing whispers of reaching $1 before summer ends. Already, more than $10.6 million has been raised in the presale of Mutuum Finance, with 12,100 people participating so far. As the market heats up, smart investors are deciding what to buy before June ends, and these two tokens are quickly becoming the top tokens of the summer. Solana Holds Firm Amid ETF Buzz and Technical Range Solana (SOL) is trading around $152 showing a modest daily uptick of 0.73% and a weekly gain near 4.9%. The token recently broke out of a descending channel retested support in the $165 zone and is now navigating resistance just over $180 a critical level identified by technical analysts. Market sentiment is further buoyed by growing institutional interest including optimistic ETF approvals by the SEC. While long-term holder activity and occasional liquidity dips warrant caution the current structure suggests consolidation ahead of a possible breakout. Amid these developments attention is also shifting toward newer entrants like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for early-stage upside potential. $10.6M Raised and Counting: Mutuum Finance Presale is Breaking Records Mutuum Finance is on fire. With over $10.6 million raised and 12,100+ investors already in this DeFi powerhouse is performing really well. Right now MUTM tokens are just $0.03 but that won’t last. The next presale round jumps to $0.035 and at launch they’re expected to hit $0.06. That’s a potential 100% ROI for early movers. Early access is equal to massive gains. Certik Audited and Ready to Soar Security is a top priority for Mutuum Finance. A full Certik audit puts its smart contracts in the clear, giving you the kind of confidence most projects can’t offer. Mutuum’s new leaderboard system rewards the top 50 holders with bonus MUTM tokens, creating a high-stakes race to the top. $100,000 Giveaway LIVE: 10 Winners Will Bank $10K in MUTM Tokens To thank its early believers, Mutuum Finance has a $100,000 giveaway , and 10 lucky winners will walk away with $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. No strings and gimmicks, just serious rewards for getting into the project early. This won’t last. The community is exploding, and your shot at the prize is slipping away by the minute. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rewriting the DeFi playbook and showing why it deserves to be on every serious investor’s radar this June. With over $10.6 million raised and a fast-growing community of 12,100+ participants the project is quickly outpacing expectations. Currently priced at $0.03, early buyers could lock in 100% gains once it hits its $0.06 launch price, and that’s just the beginning. Backed by a Certik audit, a gamified leaderboard rewards system, and a $100,000 giveaway, MUTM offers real utility and real upside. Don’t miss your shot to get in before the next price jump and secure your position now.

46116719,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=747265,1750051980,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46116719.jpeg,Why Neo Pepe Protocol Isn’t Actually Competing with Bitcoin Bull,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-neo-pepe-protocol-isnt-actually-competing-with-bitcoin-bull/,"In the cryptocurrency industry, there have been countless presales with the promise of new and transformative potential. According to records, only a few have been able to make it into big projects, using their features to reshape the market. Ethereum changed things when it entered the market, using its presale to alter the decentralized finance sector. As crypto investors continue to look for the next crypto presale to patronize, Neo Pepe looks to fill that space, capturing market attention with its approach, community support, and features. Could Neo Pepe Protocol, with its presale and impressive governance, stand next to Ethereum as the best presale? The indicators are there and cannot be denied. Crypto markets are volatile, and ruthless when it comes to picking projects with quality from the others. Only true projects would withstand market scrutiny, emerging victorious. Neo Pepe promises new features and is prepared to deliver them through its ecosystem and methodical approach. As the crypto space develops, investors will continue to demand projects with substance that combine financial freedom with technological improvements. Neo Pepe’s architecture and community governance puts it in a position to fulfill those expectations. Countdown to Crypto History: Neo Pepe’s Unique Presale Blueprint Neo Pepe’s presale is different from others that have been conducted in the crypto market, with the developers designing it to run through 16 stages. The presale is expected to promote excitement, and urgency while rewarding investors. Each stage is important, as it pushes the price of the token higher, offering value to early investors. The token’s availability is capped per stage, making sure it uses scarcity as a catalyst to make quick decisions. This scarcity contrasts with the usual activities of presales in the market, setting Neo Pepe apart as a better investment opportunity. Early investors who purchase Neo Pepe Coin will benefit from the advantage of its price, building anticipation across different stages. Built for Stability: The Ingenious Auto-Liquidity Solution One of the disadvantages of the crypto market is the price swings that happen, with such activities reducing investor confidence in the projects and overall market. Neo Pepe Coin addresses this issue through its auto-liquidity mechanism. With every transaction involving $NEOP, a 2.5% liquidity fee is used to improve Uniswap liquidity pools, aiding the immediate burning of liquidity provider (LP) tokens. This model sustains the system, enhances price stability, and assures investors about the long-term potential of the project. Unlike some digital assets suffering from liquidity issues, Neo Pepe sets itself apart using this economic foundation. Empowerment Unchained: Neo Pepe’s Revolutionary DAO Governance Most crypto projects have encountered issues due to the use of a centralized system of governance on their platforms. Unlike tokens like XRP and Solana, Neo Pepe Protocol pushes decentralization, putting the governance of its platform in the hands of its community. Neo Pepe’s governance approach is as follows: A requirement of holding one million $NEOP tokens to ensure impactful community proposals. A seven-day voting period with the requirements set at 5% of the total supply. A timelock delay mechanism to prevent sudden governance shifts. These defined rules are expected to help Neo Pepe as a decentralized platform, empowering its community, as it addresses governance weaknesses in previous projects in the market. Digital Revolutionaries: Neo Pepe’s Symbolic Appeal Aside from its technical edge, Neo Pepe Coin establishes itself as a leader. The project has positioned itself as a digital platform that is challenging centralized financial control and regulatory powers. Using its Memetrix origin, Neo Pepe uses images and storytelling to rally community support and participation. Such a move was last seen in Ethereum when it began, with Neo Pepe trying to adopt the same. Using its powers of change, Neo Pepe Coin positions itself as a token that could change things in the crypto market. Unmatched Clarity: Transparent and Trustworthy Tokenomics Over the last few years, most crypto projects have been derailed by unclear financial structures and hidden interests. Neo Pepe Protocol provides transparency and trust. The protocol’s defined token allocation is as follows: 45% reserved for presale participants 25% dedicated to marketing efforts 10% will be used to maintain liquidity pool 10% allocate towards development 5% dedicated to giveaways 5% reserved for community rewards Neo Pepe’s architecture in addition to integrations like Chainlink oracle pricing will ensure transparency and community participation, establishing trust for long-term success. Roadmap to Renown: Charting Neo Pepe’s Path to Crypto Greatness Neo Pepe Protocol’s roadmap shows that the team calculated its execution. The roadmap begins with initiatives to build the community, before moving to enabling cross-chain interoperability. After that, it underwent global marketing efforts, before inking partnerships with popular crypto platforms. The decision to align with popular platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain shows that Neo Pepe values long-term relevance. Such planning sets Neo Pepe apart, showing its commitment to both short-term success and adoption in the long term. The Power of Community: Neo Pepe’s Ultimate Currency Community engagement remains an important aspect of a successful presale. Neo Pepe Protocol prioritizes an inclusive, active community, establishing its goal of transparency and shared governance across platforms like Telegram and Twitter. Unlike other meme coins without substance, Neo Pepe integrates viral culture with the best governance structure. This combination also ensures the community is engaged, transforming Neo Pepe into a crypto legend. Your Moment in Crypto History Awaits Neo Pepe ($NEOP) is emerging as an opportunity in the crypto industry, combining its structured presale, liquidity solutions, and decentralization. It also promises transparent tokenomics, a good roadmap execution, and community engagement. With the crypto sector still growing, investors are increasingly searching for the best opportunities to make gains. Neo Pepe with its blend of clarity and other features meets this criteria, making it the clear candidate to surpass Ethereum’s presale. This is not just another presale, it is an opportunity to participate in what could define the future of the crypto industry. The next presale like that of Ethereum is here and its name is Neo Pepe ($NEOP). Will you take your place in this presale? Acr now to join the Neo Pepe community, secure your spot in the presale, and be a part of the platform changing the future of decentralized finance.

Ripple and the SEC have requested that the court modify Judge Torres’ previous orders—but not everyone agrees with the logic. Pro-XRP Lawyer Bill Morgan shared his thoughts, raising doubts about whether this request truly meets the court’s high standard of “exceptional circumstances.” So, is this a clever shortcut to peace, or just Ripple asking for too much? Ripple’s Last-Minute Ask Ripple and the SEC have come together in a joint motion asking Judge Torres to adjust the final settlement terms. Specifically, Ripple wants the penalty amount reduced from $125 million to $50 million, with the remaining $75 million of the escrowed funds returned to Ripple. The motion also requests that the court lift the injunction that has restricted Ripple’s institutional XRP sales since August 2024 According to Bill Morgan, this request is what’s holding up the appeal and cross-appeal from moving forward. If the judge agrees, the case wraps up completely, saving court time and effort. But there’s one problem—it’s not guaranteed. The Court’s Standard: “Exceptional” or Just Convenient? Morgan points out that while both sides claim that the modification is in everyone’s best interest, the court requires more than convenience. The judge must see “exceptional circumstances” to change a final court order. Critics argue Ripple and the SEC didn’t need to make this part of the settlement. It was their own decision—especially Ripple’s—to push for more. The judge previously rejected a similar motion in May 2025 due to insufficient justification, but the June 12 filing addresses those concerns more directly. Will the Judge Say Yes? While Morgan says he feels Judge Torres might grant the request, he also warns not to be too sure. The court could just as easily say no, forcing both sides to stick with the original rulings or withdraw the settlement altogether. All eyes are now on June 16, 2025, the day the SEC must submit a status report to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-16 05:35:15

This could mean that miners have long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value. Meanwhile, institutional players like Strategy and its co-founder Michael Saylor also continue accumulating. Market sentiment is also still bullish, supported by strong ETF inflows and the growing recognition of Bitcoin as an alternative to gold and Treasuries. Analysts warn, however, that geopolitical shocks could still challenge this momentum. Mining Difficulty Slips but Bitcoin Miners Still Battle Bitcoin's mining difficulty saw a slight decline, dropping to approximately 126.4 trillion after reaching a record high of 126.9 trillion on May 31. This adjustment, while minor, happened amid increasing financial pressure on miners due to reduced block rewards after the April 2024 halving, rising energy costs, and sustained high network hashrate. These combined factors are pushing up competition and production costs, testing the profitability and resilience of mining operations. Bitcoin mining difficulty (Source: CryptoQuant ) Despite these headwinds, some publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies are not only managing to stay afloat but are expanding aggressively and adopting a new approach by holding onto their mined Bitcoin instead of selling it. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is a major player in this trend. In May, the company boosted its Bitcoin output by 35% by mining 950 BTC during a month that was marked by record hashrate levels and heightened market volatility. MARA’s decision to keep all the Bitcoin it mined pushed its corporate treasury to 49,179 BTC, which made it one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin globally. “Record production month for MARA — and we sold zero Bitcoin,” CFO Salman Khan said in a post on June 3. CleanSpark, another publicly listed mining company focused on sustainable energy, also reported gains . The firm produced 694 BTC in May, which was up 9% from April, and now holds 12,502 BTC in reserves. According to CEO Zack Bradford, CleanSpark increased its operational hashrate to 45.6 exahashes per second by the end of May, representing a 7.5% increase from the previous month. Bitcoin miners are some of the top Bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The shift in strategy by companies like MARA and CleanSpark could mean that there is a deeper confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. Saylor Signals New BTC Buy Mining companies are not the only institutions interested in hoarding Bitcoin. For now, BTC is holding steady above $105,000 despite escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, including Israeli airstrikes on Tehran and concerns over potential disruptions to global oil supply. The relative price stability of Bitcoin comes at a time when global financial markets are bracing for increased volatility when trading resumes on Monday. In a move that suggests continued confidence in Bitcoin, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor posted a BTC chart that many see as a sign of another imminent Bitcoin purchase by the company. Strategy’s most recent acquisition took place on June 9, when it bought 1,045 BTC worth around $110 million. This brought the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings to 582,000 BTC. According to data from SaylorTracker, Strategy is now up more than 50% on its Bitcoin investment, which translates into over $20 billion in unrealized gains. Saylor’s timing is interesting, as the announcement was made during a weekend of heightened conflict between Israel and Iran. Despite these geopolitical developments, Bitcoin only experienced a minor 3% dip since the conflict escalated. This price stability has been supported by strong investor interest in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which recorded more than $1.3 billion in net inflows over the past week. According to Farside Investors , BTC ETFs saw five straight days of capital inflows, which means that there is sustained demand for exposure to Bitcoin. Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Source: Alternative ) Market sentiment is also still bullish, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index standing at 61 . This suggests that investors are still optimistic in the face of global uncertainty. However, not all analysts share this confidence. Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin warned that if Iran were to close the Strait of Hormuz—a crucial passage for 20% of the world’s oil shipments—it could cause a spike in energy prices. Such a development would have huge ripple effects across global markets, and could potentially drag down risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, due to increased economic pressures. While Bitcoin’s current performance points to its role as a hedge against geopolitical turmoil, the events in the Middle East and their broader economic consequences will still be key variables influencing market sentiment over the next few days. Woes Push Investors Toward Bitcoin Overall, Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a viable alternative to traditional stores of value like gold and US Treasuries, according to Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley . In a recent statement, Horsley shed some light on Bitcoin’s total addressable market as not only the $16 trillion gold market but also the $30 trillion-plus held in US Treasury securities by institutions and individual investors. His comments came in response to economist Mohamed El-Erian , who explained that US Treasury flows are no longer a reliable indicator of investor sentiment during times of market stress. Instead, El-Erian suggested that analysts look to flows into gold and silver, traditional safe havens, for clues about where capital is moving during rising uncertainty. Bitcoin’s positioning as a digital alternative to gold has gained momentum, especially as investors seek tools to hedge against geopolitical risks, inflation, and market instability. With its decentralized design and capped supply, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a savings technology that offers protection from the risks tied to fiat currencies and government-managed financial systems. The recent geopolitical developments and fiscal concerns have only strengthened this narrative. In the United States, President Trump’s “ Big Beautiful Bill ” has come under scrutiny for its projected $2.5 trillion in deficit spending, which adds to the country’s already staggering $37 trillion national debt. Critics, including Elon Musk and other fiscal conservatives, argue that the bill undermines the long-term financial stability of the country. The bond market reacted sharply to these concerns in April of 2025, particularly after Trump’s proposed trade tariffs and the growing debt load. Investors dumped government bonds, which led to a spike in yields as they demanded higher returns to offset the perceived risk of holding US debt. Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, said that the market was clearly rattled by Trump’s fiscal policies and that calming the situation would require a major shift in economic strategy. Against this backdrop of fiscal instability and geopolitical tension, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as a potential safe haven.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-16 05:38:22

Investors digested a batch of mixed Chinese economic data. Geopolitical risks also lingered, with Israel and Iran exchanging fresh attacks over the weekend, with both sides targeting energy infrastructure and pushing oil prices higher. Iran also threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital artery for global oil shipments, adding to market uncertainty. With key central bank meetings dominating the agenda this week, all eyes are on the Bank of Japan's Tuesday announcement, followed by rate decisions from the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank, and the People's Bank of China. Markets will also be closely watching any progress on trade negotiations between the US and its key partners. Gold rose to around $3,440 per ounce on Monday, hovering near all-time highs reached in April.

China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.14% to around 3,380 while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.4% to 10,160 on Monday, with mainland stocks recouping some losses from the previous session as investors assessed a batch of mixed domestic economic data while monitoring heightened geopolitical tensions, and the offshore yuan held steady to around 7.18 per dollar on Monday. China's May’s activity data was mixed : retail sales posted strong growth, increased by 6.4% yoy in May 2025 and the jobless rate eased, but industrial output slowed, rose by 5.8% yoy in May 2025. China’s surveyed unemployment rate inched down to 5% in May 2025, slightly below both market forecasts and April’s figure of 5.1%. China’s fixed-asset investment increased by 3.7% year-on-year in the January–May 2025 period, falling short of market expectations for a 3.9% rise. China’s new home prices in 70 cities dropped 3.5% year-on-year in May 2025, easing from a 4.0% decline in the previous month. The People’s Bank of China injected 400 billion yuan into the banking system via six-month reverse repos, following a record 1 trillion yuan operation the previous week. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.06% to 23,869 by midday Monday, down for the third session as traders assessed mixed data from China. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.49% rose 169 points or 0.2% to 81,284 on Monday morning, snapping a two-session losing streak. Australia ( AS51 ) flat to around 8,530 in early trading on Monday. The Australian dollar extended its recent decline to around $0.648 on Monday, as heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East continued to weigh on market sentiment. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended lower as risk appetite faded after Iran denounced Israel’s airstrikes as a “declaration of war” and responded with missile attacks late Friday local time. Markets are signaling a clear message: the central bank will likely keep rates unchanged on Wednesday, with no reduction foreseen in July. All eyes are now on upcoming economic indicators—manufacturing data, retail sales, and weekly jobless claims—for further insight into the Fed's path forward.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by value is trading at $2,575, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours. Over the last week, its price has moved between $2,473 and $2,869, during a time when global markets have been uneasy due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. Trading activity around Ethereum ( ETH ) has picked up sharply. In the past day, daily spot trading volume rose over 32% to $14.27 billion. At the same time, data from Coinglass shows that futures trading volume is up 26.46% to $53.09 billion. Open interest, or money locked into ETH futures, has gone up by 1.20% to $35.13 billion. This shows that more traders are placing new bets, likely expecting a bigger move in price. On-chain data also points to growing interest. According to a June 14 post by Santiment, wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH have been buying heavily. These larger holders, often called whales and sharks, have added 1.49 million ETH in the past month. Their total share of the ETH supply is now 26.98%. At the same time, many smaller holders appear to have sold for profit, meaning large players are buying while others cash out. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1933662569954164978?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw You might also like: Will Ethereum price reach $3,000 in June? Institutional demand is also strong. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust has picked up more than 1.5 million ETH, worth about $4 billion. It purchased almost $240 million worth of Ethereum between June 3 and June 6. This month alone, BlackRock has added more than $500 million in Ethereum. Other companies, such as Cumberland and Galaxy Digital, are also expanding their holdings, indicating strong interest from big institutional players. On the technical side, Ethereum is trading just below its 20-day average and moving within a tighter price range. Bollinger Bands are starting to narrow, a sign that volatility is compressing ahead of a potential breakout . The relative strength index is neutral at 52, but increasing volume and whale activity may help push the price higher. ETH price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Although they continue to show some weakness, momentum indicators like the 10-period momentum and the moving average convergence divergence seem to be bottoming out. If the MACD line crosses above the signal line in the coming sessions, it would be a bullish sign of renewed upward momentum. The next major resistance zone is located around $2,870 if bulls are able to push the price above $2,600 with volume confirmation. A close above that would open the door toward $3,000. On the downside, a retest of the lower Bollinger Band around $2,400 might occur if the price is unable to stay above the 20-day average.

In a recent post , Lubin highlighted the increasing demand for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) coming from institutional investors. He believes that the spike in corporations that stock up on ETH and BTC by adopting a digital asset treasury strategy is a big indicator that the financial system is shifting to DeFi . Therefore, he predicts that Wall Street will soon dive into decentralized protocols and digital assets as more and more companies join the race. This is because he believes Wall Street figureheads care about financial instruments that are consistently climbing higher in value. And right now, crypto is on their watchlist. “They will be motivated to deep dive and learn what’s up with these strategies. They will have to deeply understand the details of Bitcoin and Ethereum and the strategies of MSTR and SBET. They will have do go deep on DeFi on Ethereum,” said Lubis. In addition, he believes it is up to the crypto space builders and developers to get Wall Street “excited” about decentralized finance by continuing to grow innovation within the space and aim to widen mainstream adoption of DeFi alongside crypto. You might also like: Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury firm plans to raise $340m to buy more BTC Wall Street to spearhead accelerated shift to DeFi Lubin sees the shift already beginning with financial regulators like the SEC no longer chasing after crypto firms as they once did during the Biden administration under Gary Gensler . Ever since Trump came into office, Lubin has seen a major shift in financial watchdogs’ attitudes towards builders in the crypto space. “The best and brightest builders are now entering the ecosystem to build on our tech without fear of politically motivated enforcement actions from the SEC and being debanked,” said Lubin. Despite the major advancements already made, he believes that the shift has only just begun and is on its way towards an acceleration fueled by institutional demand. In early June, Ethereum’s price movements showed signs of an incoming rally as Wall Street demand signaled a potential comeback for the token. According to recent data from SoSoValue, Wall Street investors have been buying more spot Ethereum ETFs , generating a cumulative inflow of $3.85 billion as of June 13.

Dogecoin, a meme-based token, has recently broken key resistance levels, sparking discussions about its potential for substantial gains. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance, focused on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, is approaching the final stages of its presale, with strong investor interest fueling predictions of a 7x upside. Dogecoin’s Recent Market Breakout Over the past seven days, Dogecoin has dropped 13.62%, now trading at $0.2025, because of a tough market. Even so, it has managed to rise past a major resistance level, making investors hopeful. After the token could not hold above $0.22 and was rejected at $0.25146, it is now testing support at $0.195 and $0.200. If Dogecoin fails to hold this range, prices might drop further, but a recovery could see it reach its earlier highs. Some analysts expect Dogecoin to increase by 7 times, which could lead it to reach its highest price ever, thanks to a strong market and loyal community. The success of the token after the breakout will be influenced by its support and the state of the broader market. Rexas Finance’s Presale Momentum The Rexas Finance (RXS) platform, which uses Ethereum to tokenize real estate, gold and art, has sold 93.34% of its tokens during its Stage 12 presale and is nearing completion. The fact that $49,342,123 was collected against a goal of $56,000,000 and that 466,708,328 tokens were sold at $0.20 each proves that investors believe in RXS. Being listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, along with a CertiK audit, increases the platform’s credibility. With presale success, RXS is set to see strong growth as it approaches its market debut on June 19, 2025, at $0.25. RXS’s Unique Asset Tokenization Utility The main advantage of Rexas Finance is that it allows people to own a fraction of valuable assets, thanks to real-world asset tokenization. When real estate, gold and art are turned into digital tokens, RXS makes them easier for investors to buy and sell. Since 93.34% of the platform’s presale has been completed, raising $49,342,123, its new approach is drawing attention from both retail and institutional investors. Because these assets can be traded on a blockchain, RXS is different from speculative cryptocurrencies and offers greater transparency and efficiency. The expected utility is the main reason for forecasts that the token’s value could rise by 7x as its listing date of June 19, 2025, approaches. Market Dynamics Favoring RXS Growth The wider market’s enthusiasm for asset-backed tokens suggests RXS could rise by 7x. The presale was very successful, completing at 93.34% and raising $49,342,123, while 466,708,328 tokens were sold. Being listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and having Certik review its framework, makes RXS a trusted place for trading. The combination of a well-planned tokenization model and strong interest in DeFi solutions means RXS could experience major price growth after its launch on June 19, 2025, at $0.25. Comparing Dogecoin and RXS Trajectories Dogecoin’s potential 7x upside is tied to its market momentum and community-driven appeal, despite its recent 13.62% weekly decline and current price of $0.2025. In contrast, RXS’s growth is underpinned by its tangible utility in tokenizing high-value assets and a successful presale, with 93.34% of tokens sold and $49,342,123 raised. While Dogecoin relies on market sentiment, RXS’s value proposition is rooted in real-world applications, making it a compelling option for investors seeking long-term potential.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/worlds-first-spot-xrp-etf-sinks-20-amid-market-uncertainty/,"The world’s first spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), listed under the ticker XRPH11 on Brazil’s B3 stock exchange, has recorded a significant downturn since its debut. Issued by Brazilian asset manager Hashdex, the ETF is now down over 20% from its recent highs, reflecting broader weakness in XRP’s market performance. As of June 13, XRPH11 ended trading at 18.65 BRL, approximately $3.37. This marked a 6.33% daily loss and a 6.75% drop from the fund’s highest recorded price. Over the past 30 days, the product has declined by 20.6%, despite initial enthusiasm surrounding its late-April launch Market observers note that while spot ETFs typically provide upward momentum for the associated digital asset, XRPH11 has so far failed to establish a stable growth pattern. Since its introduction, XRPH11 has mirrored XRP’s volatile trajectory. Although the asset has experienced brief price recoveries, it continues to struggle with maintaining any sustained move beyond the $2 threshold. These price fluctuations have directly impacted the ETF’s value, reducing its potential appeal to institutional and retail investors in the short term. Limited Market Scope May Curb Impact Analysts tracking the ETF’s early performance have suggested that the fund’s limited influence could be attributed to Brazil’s relatively modest capital market compared to those in more dominant jurisdictions, such as the United States. While the launch marked a milestone for XRP-focused financial products, the overall reach and liquidity of XRPH11 remain constrained by local investor participation and exchange dynamics. The lack of consistent upward movement in XRP’s price has also contributed to diminished interest in the ETF, reinforcing the argument that broader market conditions and jurisdictional limitations are playing a central role in the fund’s early underperformance. Attention Shifts to U.S. Regulatory Decisions With XRPH11 faltering, market attention is now turning toward the United States, where several applications for spot XRP ETFs are currently under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Among the most closely watched is the Franklin XRP Fund by Franklin Templeton, with a decision expected on June 17 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another application under review involves the WisdomTree XRP Trust, submitted by the Cboe BZX Exchange. This proposed fund is designed to give traditional investors direct access to XRP through standard brokerage platforms. The SEC began evaluating both proposals in May and has since opened a public comment period, aiming to determine whether the funds meet the regulator’s criteria for investor protection and market integrity. The timing and outcome of the SEC’s decision could depend in part on developments in the agency’s ongoing legal dispute with Ripple. A recent court filing on June 12 saw both parties request an indicative ruling from Judge Analisa Torres, seeking to lift restrictions on XRP sales to institutional investors and reduce the existing $125 million civil penalty . Any resolution on this front may influence the regulator’s approach to XRP-linked investment products. Current XRP Market Outlook XRP is currently priced at $2.16, representing a marginal 0.6% increase over the past 24 hours, but a 4.3% decrease on the weekly chart. Technical analysts believe that approval of a U.S.-based XRP ETF could push the asset toward a near-term target of $2.50. However, without a decisive regulatory breakthrough or positive market driver, the risk of falling below the $2 support level remains present. While XRPH11 marked a historic step for XRP’s integration into traditional financial markets, its weak performance since launch highlights the importance of regulatory clarity and broader market participation. The coming weeks, particularly with the SEC’s June 17 decision, may determine whether investor sentiment around XRP ETFs can rebound meaningfully.

Saylor praised Pakistan’s progressive approach to cryptocurrency adoption and urged the country to consider Bitcoin as a sovereign reserve asset for monetary resilience. “Bitcoin is the strongest asset for long-term national resilience,” he said , adding, “Emerging markets like Pakistan have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to leapfrog into the future of finance.” Pakistan’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In March, the country launched the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), which aims to regulate and integrate blockchain technology into its financial system. Aurangzeb expressed ambitions for Pakistan to lead the Global South in digital asset development and adoption. “Pakistan aspires to lead the Global South in the development and adoption of digital assets, setting a benchmark for innovation, regulation, and inclusive growth in the digital economy.” Bitcoin pioneer Michael Saylor hails Pakistan’s crypto leap after key pact with US firm Chainalysis!

We have the talent, the story, and the energy.” According to the Ministry of Finance press release on Sunday, the dialogue was hailed as a “milestone” in Pakistan’s effort to build a robust digital assets policy framework, attract global institutional interest, and “position itself as a Web3 and Bitcoin-ready emerging market.” The PCC is set to play a pivotal role in “formulating policies, fostering innovation, and ensuring a secure and forward-thinking approach to crypto adoption in Pakistan,” the Finance Division said.

That’s why a recent development is creating a buzz among US community banks and credit unions. Fintech innovators Beam and Braid have joined forces to offer a crucial piece of the future financial puzzle: stablecoin infrastructure . Why is Stablecoin Infrastructure a Game Changer for Community Banks? For years, larger financial institutions have been exploring and investing heavily in digital assets. This has created a potential competitive gap, leaving smaller banks and credit unions potentially behind in offering modern, efficient services to their customers. The partnership between Beam and Braid aims to bridge this gap. Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, offer unique advantages: Faster Settlements: Transactions can settle much quicker than traditional methods. Lower Costs: Potential for reduced transaction fees. 24/7 Access: Digital assets operate around the clock. Programmability: Can be integrated into automated financial processes. By providing the necessary infrastructure, Beam and Braid are enabling these institutions to directly engage with this technology. This isn’t just about offering stablecoins; it’s about providing the core systems needed to issue, manage, and integrate them securely and compliantly within existing banking operations. What Does the Beam and Braid Partnership Offer? According to reports, the collaboration focuses on delivering a comprehensive solution. Think of it as a toolkit that allows community banks and credit unions to easily and safely participate in the digital asset ecosystem. This includes the technical backbone required for managing stablecoin transactions and potentially other forms of digital assets in the future. The initiative is starting with a focused approach. Seven partner banks located in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. are set to be the first to implement this new infrastructure. This initial rollout will likely serve as a testing ground, allowing Beam and Braid to refine their offering based on real-world banking needs and regulatory considerations. How Does This Help US Community Banks Compete? In an increasingly digital economy, customers expect seamless and modern financial services. Large banks have the resources to build or acquire the technology needed for digital asset services.

Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved significantly during this period, reaching above $8 billion, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On May 26, 2025, HYPE discovered an all-time high of $39.68 and has corrected to the $31 range at the start of June.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-16 07:30:00

The status of Iran nuclear talks has taken a dramatic turn, with Tehran issuing a stark declaration that casts serious doubt on the future of diplomatic efforts. Why Are Iran Nuclear Talks Now Considered “Meaningless”? According to reports citing Iran’s Foreign Ministry, the country has declared that diplomatic talks with the United States aimed at resolving the nuclear crisis are now considered “meaningless.” This significant shift in stance comes directly from Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei. Baghaei elaborated on the reasoning behind this declaration, highlighting a fundamental contradiction he sees in the US Iran relations . While the U.S. publicly states its openness to negotiation, Iran claims that Washington has simultaneously enabled attacks carried out by what it refers to as the “Zionist regime” (Israel) on Iranian territory. The spokesperson asserted that such actions could not have occurred without U.S. approval, implying a double standard or active complicity that undermines the basis for trust and negotiation. This accusation directly links the stalled nuclear diplomacy to the ongoing, often covert, conflict between Iran and Israel. Tehran views U.S. support for Israel as a direct impediment to constructive dialogue regarding its nuclear program. What Was the Status of Diplomatic Negotiations Before This? Prior to this declaration, there were indications that diplomatic negotiations were set to continue. Reports had noted that the U.S. and Iran were scheduled to hold a sixth round of indirect talks in Oman on June 15. Oman has often served as a neutral ground for facilitating discussions between the two long-standing adversaries. The fact that a specific date and location were reportedly set for the next round underscores how abruptly the situation has changed. Iran’s latest comments have effectively cast significant doubt on whether those planned talks in Oman will proceed as scheduled. The declaration that talks are “meaningless” suggests a potential withdrawal or indefinite postponement from Iran’s side unless the underlying issues it has raised regarding U.S. actions are addressed. How Do Israel-Iran Tensions Impact These Discussions? The relationship between Iran and Israel is deeply antagonistic, often characterized as a ‘shadow war’ involving cyberattacks, targeted killings, and military strikes in third countries or on each other’s soil. Iran frequently blames Israel for attacks on its nuclear facilities and military personnel. The Iranian Foreign Ministry’s statement explicitly ties these Israel Iran tensions to the viability of nuclear talks. By alleging U.S. complicity in Israeli attacks, Iran is essentially stating that it cannot negotiate in good faith with a partner it believes is facilitating hostile actions against it. This linkage makes resolving the nuclear issue significantly more complicated, as it becomes intertwined with the broader, volatile regional security dynamic. Key aspects of this complex interplay include: Attacks on Iranian Territory: Allegations of Israeli strikes targeting nuclear sites, military bases, or individuals within Iran. Proxy Conflicts: Iran’s support for various non-state actors in the region (like Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthi rebels) who are opposed to Israel and U.S. interests. U.S. Military Presence: The significant U.S. military footprint in the Middle East, often seen by Iran as a direct threat and support for its regional rivals, including Israel. Sanctions: U.S. sanctions on Iran, which Tehran views as economic warfare and a barrier to trust. This intricate web of conflicts and resentments makes isolating the nuclear issue for negotiation incredibly difficult. What Are the Implications for Middle East Stability? The potential collapse or indefinite suspension of Iran nuclear talks carries significant implications for Middle East stability . Without a diplomatic channel to address concerns about Iran’s nuclear program, the risk of escalation through other means increases. Here are some potential consequences: Challenges: Increased Nuclear Risk: If diplomacy fails, Iran might accelerate its nuclear activities, potentially shortening its ‘breakout time’ to developing a nuclear weapon, which Israel and the U.S. have vowed to prevent. Higher Risk of Military Confrontation: The failure of talks could increase the likelihood of preventative military action by Israel or the U.S. to curb Iran’s nuclear program. Regional Proxy Escalation: Tensions between Iran and its regional rivals (like Saudi Arabia and Israel), often played out through proxy groups, could intensify. Economic Uncertainty: Increased instability in the region, a major oil producer, could lead to volatility in energy markets, impacting the global economy. Why Diplomacy Matters (Benefits of Talks, even stalled ones): De-escalation Channel: Even indirect talks provide a line of communication that can help prevent miscalculation and unintended escalation. Information Exchange: Negotiations allow parties to understand each other’s positions and red lines, even if they disagree. Potential Path Forward: Diplomacy, however difficult, remains the preferred route to a peaceful resolution compared to military conflict. The current impasse underscores the fragility of the security situation in the region and the complex factors that influence US Iran relations beyond the nuclear file. Looking Ahead: What Happens Next? With Iran’s declaration, the immediate future of the planned Oman talks is uncertain. The ball appears to be in the U.S.’s court to respond to Iran’s accusations regarding enabling Israeli attacks. Any path forward would likely require significant diplomatic maneuvering and potentially concessions or assurances from either side. Experts are watching closely to see if any back-channel communications continue or if other intermediaries might step in. The risk of a dangerous escalation remains palpable if diplomatic avenues are fully closed off. Actionable Insight (for observers): Stay informed about developments not just in nuclear diplomacy but also regarding regional security dynamics, particularly involving Israel and Iran, as these are clearly intertwined. Summary: A Dangerous Crossroads for Nuclear Diplomacy Iran’s declaration that nuclear talks with the U.S. are “meaningless” marks a critical moment in the long-running saga of its nuclear program and its fraught relationship with the West and Israel. By directly linking the stalled diplomatic negotiations to perceived U.S. complicity in Israeli attacks on Iranian soil, Tehran has raised the stakes and introduced a major obstacle to resuming dialogue. This development casts a dark shadow over the previously planned talks in Oman and significantly increases concerns about Middle East stability . The failure of diplomacy risks pushing the region closer to confrontation, making the need for careful de-escalation and a potential reframing of the negotiation parameters more urgent than ever. The complex interplay of US Iran relations and Israel Iran tensions continues to make finding a peaceful resolution exceptionally challenging.

This comes as the digital asset failed to break above new all-time highs during last week’s rallies and, with the Israel-Iran conflict, saw a sharp plunge, erasing its weekly gains. Amid this, the bears have gained even more ground and are now more in control of the cryptocurrency’s price. Thus, the probability of a deep crash is heightened during this time. Bitcoin Price Could Crash Below $90,000 In a TradingView post, pseudonymous crypto analyst MIRZA has called for a possible Bitcoin price crash that could send the market spiraling even more. The crypto analyst points to the rising weakness of the Bitcoin price and the formation of bearish patterns on its price chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Descending Triangle Pattern Amid Israel-Iran Tensions The first notable bearish development was the fact that the Bitcoin price had been unable to break above $111,000 despite coming close last week. Since this is where the resistance for the previous all-time high lies, it shows that there is still not enough strength in the digital asset to continue its ascent. The result of this was the decline that sent it back toward the $103,000 as bears took a stand once more. This bearish drop suggests that the asset is now forming a potential double top or a lower high structure. Both of this are bad signs for any asset as it suggests that the upward momentum has ended and there is nowhere to go but down. This change in momentum toward the negative suggests that there could be a liquidity grab at lower levels. The crypto analyst predicts that there is a possibility that the upward trend could continue if the Bitcoin price is able to break above $107,000 and maintain it. Otherwise, the Bitcoin price is expected to crash by more than 15%, pushing it below $90,000 and as low as $85,000 before a bottom is established. BTC Bearish Sentiment Grows MIRZA is not the only crypto analyst who has called a possible price crash for Bitcoin. RLinda, also took to the platform to share what she expects next for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. She points out that the Israel-Iran conflict was the reason that the Bitcoin price lost its bullish trend and was trending back downward at this point. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance However, Bitcoin continues to hold support above $100,000 so far, which has shown some strength. As a result, the analyst explains that the BTC price could end up ranging between $102,500 and $106,200 for a while as a result. The end of this, however, could end up going two ways. If Bitcoin breaks above $106,200, then it has a shot to rise above $110,000 again. However, if it loses the $102,500 support, then the next crash would send it toward $100,000 again.

Key Takeaways: Liverpool leads the UK in crypto and stock market engagement, with 13% of residents actively investing. Regional online habits vary widely, with London favoring dating apps and Sheffield dominating TikTok and streaming. Despite growing digital engagement, many Britons report feeling fatigued by excessive screen time. According to a report commissioned by telecommunications firm Openreach , 13% of Liverpool residents regularly invest in cryptocurrencies and monitor stock markets, more than any other city in the country. The study, which explored the online behavior of Britons, paints a picture of a nation increasingly plugged into the financial and digital world. Liverpool Leads UK in Bitcoin Interest, Becoming Crypto Capital While London may lead in dating app usage and Sheffield dominates in TikTok and streaming, Liverpool stands out for its enthusiasm toward financial markets, especially Bitcoin. The data underscores how regional differences shape online activity across the UK. In contrast to Liverpool’s investment focus, Manchester showed a clear preference for Instagram, while Leeds leaned heavily into Facebook. Sheffield residents led the country in both TikTok engagement and hours spent online, with 32% spending more than five hours a day connected, far surpassing the 11% figure in Brighton. The national average time spent online sits at three and a half hours daily, though 20% of respondents admitted to clocking more than five hours. Nighttime browsing was a common habit, with 64% going online between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., and 19% of users turning to YouTube during those hours. The survey was released to mark the 25th anniversary of the UK’s first home broadband installation in Basildon, Essex.

Around 43% of respondents felt they wasted time online, while 37% cited concerns over “doom-scrolling.” A third of those surveyed believed they would feel more relaxed if they spent less time on the internet. “It’s fascinating to see how different parts of the UK are embracing the online world and adapting to it in unique ways,” said Katie Milligan, deputy CEO of Openreach. “At the same time, it’s encouraging that many recognise the importance of taking time away from devices and digital connectivity.” UK to Enforce Mandatory Crypto Trade Reporting The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen tax compliance and oversight in the digital asset sector. According to a recent statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred. The reporting obligation extends beyond individual users to include companies, trusts, and charities engaged in crypto activity. Firms that fail to comply or submit inaccurate data may face penalties of up to £300 ($398) per user.

If such a fund comes to fruition, what could it mean for the value of SOL by 2025? As anticipation grows, investors are speculating on how this new financial product might impact Solana's price in the years ahead. This article explores the potential outcomes and implications. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Solana (SOL) Source: TradingView Over the past week, Solana (SOL) experienced slight stability with a marginal price increase of 0.4%, trading between $141 and $164. Despite this, SOL has faced significant declines over longer periods, dropping 21% in the past month and 34% over six months, highlighting considerable selling pressure. Technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook. The RSI is at 28.89, indicating oversold conditions that could precede a reversal. The 10-day Simple Moving Average of $146 is below the 100-day SMA of $158, signaling downward momentum. A negative MACD at -4.259 and low Stochastic at 19.27 reinforce this negative trend unless market sentiment shifts. SOL's nearest support is at $130, approximately 14% below current levels. Continued bearish momentum could test this or the second support at $108, a total decline of about 29%. Conversely, increased buying could target resistance at $175, about 15% above current prices, and potentially $198, suggesting a 30% gain. Traders will watch these levels closely to gauge SOL's potential direction in the near future. Conclusion While SOL shows strong potential with ETF developments, emerging tokens like XYZVerse (XYZ) may offer greater growth due to their unique blend of sports and meme culture.

The concept of a Solana ETF is particularly intriguing given the blockchain's capabilities and growing market presence. Understanding the Influence of an ETF on Cryptocurrencies The creation of a cryptocurrency ETF can lead to increased legitimacy and market entry of institutional investors. For Solana, a cryptocurrency known for its fast transaction speeds and lower costs, the establishment of an ETF could broaden its investor base, potentially stabilizing and increasing its market price. Market Trends and Regulatory Environment The cryptocurrency market's volatility is legendary, with prices heavily influenced by regulatory news, market sentiment, and technological advancements. For Solana’s price forecast leading up to 2025, these factors are exceedingly relevant. Regulatory approvals or disapprovals can heavily sway investor confidence and affect the pricing dynamics of all associated assets, including potential ETFs. The Case of XYZVerse and Market Speculations Similar speculative assets like XYZVerse ($XYZ) showcase how market sentiment can drive prices. Initially launched as a meme coin, XYZVerse has demonstrated that with strong marketing, community support, and strategic partnerships, lesser-known cryptocurrencies can achieve substantial valuation increases. Market Positioning of XYZVerse With strategic marketing and a focus on community-driven growth, XYZVerse has positioned itself advantageously within the meme coin market. Supported by its engagement strategies and deflationary tactics, such as a 17.13% token burn and a 15% liquidity allocation, XYZVerse aims for a stable yet promising growth trajectory. The Growth Potential of XYZVerse XYZVerse’s growth potential is highlighted by its ambitious price targets and the underlying strategies to achieve them. From a presale price of $0.003333 to a projected post-presale target of $0.10, the goals set by the XYZVerse team reflect their confidence in the token's market appeal and investor interest. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Current Valuation and Future Projections for Solana (SOL) Looking at the recent market performance, Solana has shown signs of stability along with typical market fluctuations. Observing its price trends and technical indicators can give us insights into its short-term movements and possible long-term positioning. Concluding Thoughts While the cryptocurrency market remains unpredictable, the introduction of ETFs for cryptocurrencies like Solana could potentially stabilize and increase their market value. Keeping an eye on regulatory developments and market acceptance will be critical for investors interested in Solana and similar digital assets heading towards 2025.

In a recent post, Zhou announced to his followers that the exchange is gearing up to release its first on-chain liquidity DEX which will be built on the Solana ( SOL ) ecosystem. According to the official announcement, the on-chain DEX is set to go live by the end of this month. “Announcing Byreal — our first on-chain DEX incubated by BB, will be LIVE by end of the month.

Starting from scratch and now born on Solana. what's special: 1/ CEX + DEX synergy Byreal isn’t “just another DEX.” It’s combining CEX-grade liquidity with DeFi-native transparency.… https://t.co/JU60e4zHQ4 — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) June 15, 2025 Zhou highlighted several elements of the new liquidity network that he believes sets it apart from other DEXs on-chain. The first is how it is able to bridge the gap between CEX and DEX by deploying centralized liquidity mechanism on the protocol while boasting what it calls “DeFi-native transparency.” “This is what real hybrid finance looks like. Future Cex + Dex project launch coming soon,” said Zhou. Zhou seems to be hinting at an upcoming product or feature from the exchange —possibly integrated with Byreal— that will further integrate centralized and decentralized trading. Based on the main post, traders can look forward to Byreal’s beta testing phase which is set to take place within the month. You might also like: CZ suggests building a ‘dark pool’ for DEX perpetual futures after James Wynn’s major loss Another point that the Bybit CEO emphasized is how the platform facilitates unified liquidity alongside processing speed. He explained that the protocol’s liquidity mechanism is built upon a hybrid of RFQ and CLMM. Request for Quote or RFQ is a liquidity mechanism that is usually used in OTC or pro-grade trading. RFQ allows market makers to quote prices dynamically, leading to more efficient execution for larger orders. Meanwhile, Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker or CLMM is a mechanism that was made popular through protocols like Uniswap version 3. CLMM lets liquidity providers concentrate capital within specific price ranges, making liquidity deeper in areas that need it most. By combining the two mechanisms, Byreal may able to route trades based on optimal pricing with dynamic quote pricing. Zhou also stated that the protocol offers its users “low-slippage, MEV-protected swaps at serious speed.” Earlier this year, Bybit became the victim of one of the largest crypto heists in history, when a group of hackers stole $1.4 billion in Ethereum ( ETH ) from the exchange’s reserves. At the end of May, on-chain data showed that it least half of the stolen funds have become untraceable.

Ripple made waves by targeting banks. But in 2025, it’s not about who’s loudest or most connected, it’s about who’s moving with the culture. That’s where Little Pepe enters the spotlight. Born from the heart of internet humor and supercharged with crypto energy, LILPEPE has tapped into the magic of meme coins in a way that feels organic, unstoppable, and incredibly fun. While DOGE and XRP continue to fight over regulatory battles and market stagnation, LILPEPE is focused on community and virality. It isn’t trying to be the next bank. It’s trying to be the next sensation — and that’s a winning strategy in the current climate. History shows that when meme coins catch fire, they can burn brighter than anything else in the market. The team behind LILPEPE is keeping things simple, meme-centric, and authentic. There’s no overcomplication, no vague promises – just a clean path forward that rewards believers. This project isn’t trying to replace banking systems or launch layer-2 protocols. It’s aiming for mass adoption through fun, hype, and thoughtful execution, and so far, it’s delivering. And this isn’t just hype, it’s paired with smart tokenomics, transparency, and a community-first roadmap. LILPEPE has all the signs of a coin with staying power. What a $500 Investment Looks Like Let’s crunch the numbers at the current price of $0.0011, a $500 investment yields approximately 454,545 tokens. If LILPEPE hits even $0.01, you’re looking at $4,545. A 10x move to $0.011 would turn your $500 into over $5,000. Push that to $0.05, and now we’re talking $22,727. This is precisely how fortunes have been made in past meme coin booms. The key is getting in early, before the big jumps happen. With the price rising to $0.0012 after this presale stage, the next wave of investors will already be paying more. Early birds aren’t catching worms; they’re catching rockets. Stage two won’t last forever; once it fills up, the price ticks upward. Conclusion: Catch the Wave or Watch It Pass In crypto, timing is everything. DOGE had its moment. XRP had its moment. Now, LILPEPE is having its moment, and you’re standing at the starting line. Every token bought today is a ticket to what could be the subsequent big meme coin explosion of 2025. The presale stage is active, the price is still low, and the hype is very real. With just $500, you could be placing yourself in front of a financial tidal wave that turns underdogs into overnight legends. Don’t wait until you see headlines about LILPEPE mooning. By then, it’ll be too late. Grab your tokens now, and ride the meme wave to the top.

The report claimed that Bitcoin has diverged “abnormally” from its historical correlation with US bond yields, which could indicate that BTC’s role in the macroeconomic system is undergoing a structural change. According to CryptoQuant analysts, macroeconomics has become the dominant trend in today’s cryptocurrency markets. For this reason, investors are closely following macro indicators, especially the US Dollar Index (DXY) and US Treasury yields. These indicators provide important signals about the state of global liquidity and institutional investor sentiment. Related News: List of the 15 Altcoins Developers Focused on Most in the Last Week Published In the published analysis, a chart comparing Bitcoin with DXY and 5, 10 and 30-year US bond yields draws attention. According to historical data; When DXY and bond yields rise, capital flows out of riskier assets, often leading to corrections for assets like Bitcoin. Bear cycles in the crypto market often coincide with such bullish periods. When DXY and bond yields weaken, risk appetite increases. These periods usually coincide with periods of easing monetary policy or rising expectations of a rate cut from the Fed, triggering an upward trend in crypto markets. However, what is striking in the current cycle is that Bitcoin is diverging from this traditional macro model. Despite bond yields reaching the highest levels in Bitcoin history, the BTC price continues to rise. Bitcoin seems to be gaining momentum, especially when the DXY starts to fall. This “abnormal” divergence may indicate that Bitcoin’s role in macroeconomic dynamics is reshaping. According to CryptoQuant analysts, this is due to Bitcoin now being perceived more as a store of value. *This is not investment advice.

The chat is rolled out to a small group of users for testing, but ZachXBT believes more filters are needed to protect users from malicious phishing attempts and files. On-chain investigator ZachXBT discovered bugs on the newly rolled out feature called XChat. The social media platform is testing chat capabilities, where XChat will replace the current DM system. XChat will not change DMs completely, but update and improve the existing messaging system. ZachXBT noted that currently, anyone can add users to a group chat, opening up another vector for phishing attacks. He notified Elon Musk, who responded immediately. Please update DMs & XChat by adding a filter to choose who can add you to group chats. Currently any user can add you to a group unless you turn off your messages entirely. pic.twitter.com/Nbp21BhsrF — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 16, 2025 ZachXBT discovered another potential threat, where anyone can send files though XChat. Musk’s quick reaction showed crypto influencers are one of the significant voices on X, attempting to combine privacy with protection against attackers and scammers. End-to-end encryption may increase the security of legitimate users, yet disguise attackers. Disappearing messages also undermine efforts to track and prove fraud. ZachXBT also called for filters to remove unknown users. Flawed files or links have been one of the attack vectors for crypto heists. Solicitation through DMs is also poses a risk of malicious links to smart contracts, wallet drainers, fake tokens, or other attacks. The on-chain researcher has not pointed out any specific attacks through XChat, but it may share some features with general DM scams, solicitations and attempts at hacking. The initial XChat version may also be open to spam bots sending out DMs or organizing chats. Instead of the wave of visible promotion on social media, the scams or token shilling may move on to closed chats. As XChat was rolled in 2025, the crypto community already noted it had the potential to become a crypto scam hub. Some of the potential solicitations and phishing may be similar to Discord servers, with fake token sales or dishonest OTC deals. XChat aims to turn X into an ‘everything app’ XChat has been rolled only to a selected group of premium users from May 30 onward. The group chat will include encrypted messages, timed vanishing messages, file sharing and audio and video calls without a phone number registration. All premium subscribers gained access to XChat in June, but there is no specific timeline for spreading the feature to all users. The chat aims for greater privacy, but the privacy may become a convenient feature for online scammers. Phishing has accelerated in 2025, with over $47M lost in May, based on Certik data. In April, phishing took up to $337M . X is also a venue for account thefts, a common form of attack in the past two years. Compromised accounts often posted meme tokens or malicious smart contracts. X has extended its integration with crypto projects, recently naming Polymarket as its official partner in predictive pairs on current events. So far, X has not integrated any specific cryptocurrency, though there are third-party solutions for sending crypto through social media.

While this news primarily concerns international relations and security, it’s crucial for investors and enthusiasts in the digital asset space to understand how such developments can ripple through global financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. How Do Geopolitical Tensions Influence the Crypto Market? The relationship between geopolitical instability and the cryptocurrency market is complex and often debated. Historically, periods of global uncertainty have led investors to seek perceived ‘safe haven’ assets. Traditionally, gold has fulfilled this role, but in recent years, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have sometimes exhibited similar behavior. The primary way Geopolitical Tensions exert a Crypto Market Impact is through their effect on investor sentiment and risk appetite. When global risks rise, investors may: Move away from riskier assets (like stocks, and sometimes, unfortunately, crypto) towards perceived safer ones. Increase demand for assets seen as outside the control of traditional financial systems, potentially benefiting decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. React to potential economic consequences, such as changes in oil prices, inflation expectations, or central bank policies, which can indirectly affect crypto valuations. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the potential volatility that can arise from international conflicts. Is Bitcoin a True Bitcoin Safe Haven? The concept of Bitcoin serving as a Bitcoin Safe Haven asset during times of crisis is a hotly debated topic within the crypto community and traditional finance. Proponents argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, limited supply, and independence from any single government or central bank make it an ideal store of value when traditional systems face stress. Arguments for Bitcoin as a safe haven: Decentralization: Not controlled by any single entity, making it resistant to confiscation or manipulation by governments. Global Accessibility: Can be accessed and transferred across borders, potentially useful in regions experiencing capital controls or economic instability. Limited Supply: The fixed supply of 21 million Bitcoin is often compared to precious metals like gold. Arguments against Bitcoin as a safe haven: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be extremely volatile, which contradicts the traditional definition of a stable safe haven asset. Correlation with Tech Stocks: At times, Bitcoin has shown correlation with risk-on tech stocks, suggesting it’s still viewed as a growth asset rather than purely defensive. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape adds another layer of risk. Past events have shown mixed results. During some crises, Bitcoin’s price has surged, while in others, it has dropped along with broader markets. The current situation involving Iran and the US could serve as another test case for Bitcoin’s safe haven narrative. Understanding Market Volatility Amidst Middle East Tensions Increased Geopolitical Tensions , particularly in a strategically important region like the Middle East, almost invariably lead to increased Market Volatility across global financial markets. The crypto market, known for its inherent volatility, is particularly susceptible to sharp price swings in response to significant external events. Why does geopolitical news cause volatility? Uncertainty: The primary driver is uncertainty about the potential scale, duration, and economic consequences of the conflict. Investor Fear: Fear can trigger panic selling or rapid shifts in portfolio allocation. Liquidity Shifts: Large investors or institutions may move significant capital, causing price dislocations. News Cycles: Rapidly developing news can lead to knee-jerk reactions from traders. For those holding Middle East Crypto assets or operating within the region, volatility can be amplified by local factors, though the global nature of major cryptocurrencies means the impact is felt worldwide. Middle East Crypto Landscape and Regional Impact The Middle East Crypto landscape is diverse and rapidly evolving. Countries in the region have varying stances on digital assets, from outright bans to active promotion of blockchain technology and crypto adoption. Geopolitical instability can influence this landscape in several ways: Increased Adoption (Potentially): In areas facing economic instability or sanctions, there can be increased interest in using cryptocurrencies as an alternative store of value or means of transaction, though this often operates in grey areas. Regulatory Responses: Governments might tighten regulations on crypto to prevent illicit use or capital flight, or conversely, explore digital currencies as a strategic tool. Infrastructure Development: Investment in crypto and blockchain infrastructure might slow down or accelerate depending on the perceived risks and opportunities. While the news focuses on military plans, the broader economic and financial implications for the region’s growing engagement with digital assets are worth monitoring. Any escalation could influence local crypto markets and user behavior. Potential Scenarios and Crypto Market Impact Analyzing potential scenarios helps us understand the range of possible outcomes for the Crypto Market Impact . While predicting market movements is impossible, we can consider how different levels of escalation might affect digital asset prices and sentiment: Scenario 1: De-escalation or Containment If tensions ease or remain contained without direct conflict, the initial market reaction might reverse. Risk appetite could return, potentially benefiting growth assets, including some cryptocurrencies. Market volatility might decrease. Scenario 2: Limited Escalation Specific, limited incidents could cause temporary spikes in volatility. Bitcoin might see a brief rally if perceived as a safe haven, but this could be short-lived if broader market panic sets in. Altcoins, often considered riskier, might experience sharper declines. Scenario 3: Significant Escalation A major conflict would likely trigger significant global financial turmoil. Initial reaction could be a flight to safety, potentially boosting traditional assets like gold and possibly testing Bitcoin’s safe haven narrative on a larger scale. However, widespread economic disruption and fear could also lead to a sell-off across all asset classes, including crypto, as investors prioritize liquidity. Long-term Crypto Market Impact would depend on the duration and economic consequences of the conflict. Investors should remain vigilant, avoid making impulsive decisions based on headlines, and consider how potential geopolitical shifts align with their long-term investment strategy in digital assets. Conclusion Reports of Iran’s potential plans targeting U.S. military bases underscore the ever-present risk of Geopolitical Tensions impacting global markets. While the direct implications are strategic and humanitarian, the indirect effects on the Crypto Market Impact are undeniable. Whether Bitcoin truly acts as a reliable Bitcoin Safe Haven during such events remains a subject of ongoing observation, but increased Market Volatility is a likely consequence. The developing situation in the Middle East Crypto landscape adds another layer of complexity. Staying informed about global events and understanding their potential ripple effects on digital assets is crucial for navigating the unpredictable nature of both geopolitics and the cryptocurrency market.

Starting June 12, a 17.5% capital gains tax applies to all crypto transactions, regardless of the value or volume, as part of Provisional Measure 1303 , introduced by the federal government to increase revenue from financial market activities. Under the new regulations, taxation applies to crypto assets held in self-custody wallets and digital assets stored overseas. Brazilian investors must now declare all gains quarterly, with the ability to offset losses from the previous five quarters. However, this offset window will be reduced from 2026 onward. Previously, Brazilians could sell up to 35,000 reais (approximately $6,300) worth of crypto per month without paying income tax. Larger transactions activated a tiered tax structure starting at 15% and topping out at 22.5% for those moving over 30 million reais annually.

This tax overhaul arrives at a time when Brazil, already Latin America’s largest crypto market and ranked among the world’s top 10 in terms of adoption, is actively pursuing broader crypto integration, from regulated salary payments to a proposed sovereign Bitcoin reserve. In March, lawmakers introduced Bill PL 957/2025 to permit employees to receive part of their salaries in cryptocurrency. At least 50% of wages must still be paid in reals, but expatriates and foreign remote workers may receive full payment in digital assets under Central Bank oversight. Employers opting for crypto-based payrolls would be required to issue detailed statements and provide educational material on virtual asset use, risks, fraud prevention, and conversion procedures. Separately, Brazil is advancing Bill PL 4501/2024 , which would authorize the allocation of up to 5% of the country’s $370 billion treasury into a Bitcoin strategic reserve. The proposal, currently under review in the Chamber of Deputies, seeks to diversify national reserves and position Bitcoin as a sovereign hedge. If passed, Brazil would become the first G20 nation to formalize Bitcoin into law as a reserve asset through legislative channels rather than executive action.

Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Alphabet, has announced significant limitations to its service across multiple US cities today. This decision comes in anticipation of nationwide ‘No Kings’ protests scheduled against President Donald Trump and his administration’s policies. How Waymo Service is Affected by Protests A spokesperson for Waymo confirmed the operational changes to news outlets. The company is limiting its robotaxi service in key operational areas. This includes reduced service in San Francisco, Austin, Atlanta, and Phoenix. More drastically, service has been entirely suspended in Los Angeles. The duration of these service limitations remains unclear, depending on the scale and impact of the planned demonstrations. The company is prioritizing the safety of its vehicles, employees, and the public in response to the potential for civil unrest associated with the protests . Recent Incidents Highlight Risks for Autonomous Vehicles This preemptive measure follows incidents during previous protests . Last weekend in Los Angeles, demonstrations against the Trump administration’s immigration policies saw five Waymo vehicles targeted. These vehicles were reportedly set on fire and spray painted with messages critical of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). While the exact reasons for protestors targeting the vehicles are not definitively known, there is speculation. One potential factor is the perception of these autonomous vehicles as surveillance tools. There have been instances where police departments have requested footage from robotaxi operators for investigations. Waymo has stated that it challenges requests it deems overly broad or lacking a legal basis, aiming to protect user privacy. Operational Challenges During Civil Unrest The challenges of operating autonomous vehicles during periods of civil unrest extend beyond direct targeting. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the city’s fire chief informed officials that during civil unrest, they might not attempt to extinguish vehicle fires unless they threaten nearby buildings. This highlights the broader operational environment and safety concerns that companies like Waymo must consider when deploying technology in public spaces. The decision by Waymo to limit service underscores the complex environment in which autonomous vehicles operate. Beyond navigating traffic and technical challenges, they must contend with unpredictable human behavior, political climates, and the potential for their technology to be perceived negatively or become targets during times of heightened tension related to Trump policies and other governmental actions. Navigating the Future: Waymo and Public Perception The ‘No Kings’ protests and the response from Waymo serve as a reminder that the integration of autonomous vehicles into daily life involves more than just technological readiness. Public perception, political events, and the potential for vehicles to be caught in the middle of societal conflicts are critical factors. For companies like Waymo , understanding and mitigating these risks is essential for long-term viability and public acceptance of robotaxi services. Summary: Waymo has proactively limited its robotaxi service in several major US cities, including a full suspension in Los Angeles, in response to planned nationwide protests against Trump policies . This decision is influenced by recent incidents where Waymo vehicles were targeted during demonstrations. The situation highlights the significant operational and safety challenges autonomous vehicles face during periods of civil unrest and underscores the need for companies to navigate complex societal dynamics.

Deaton explained that while the crypto world is moving forward, with talks about making America a crypto leader and new stablecoin regulations on the way — Ripple is still stuck under a legal cloud. The SEC previously accused Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security, and although Ripple won a partial victory last year, there’s still an old court order (called an injunction) hanging over the company. Ripple wants this issue cleared up for good because it affects their business deals and partnerships. Big companies and banks might choose to work with other firms like Circle instead of Ripple just to avoid legal headaches. What’s Holding It Up? Deaton says there’s about a 70% chance the judge will eventually approve Ripple’s request to end the case and reduce its fine from $125 million to $50 million. But it’s not a sure thing. Judges have to follow the law carefully, and asking a judge to change a ruling isn’t easy, especially when the SEC had originally pushed for harsh penalties against Ripple. Another worry is politics. Deaton pointed out that if future elections swing power back to anti-crypto lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren, new regulators could bring fresh problems for Ripple and the crypto industry. Why Deaton Expected More From Ripple’s Lawyers Deaton said he thought Ripple’s legal team would fight harder to highlight how unfair it is to let this case drag on. He expected them to remind the judge about the public’s interest in crypto and how over 75,000 XRP holders had spoken up in court. He was surprised they didn’t focus more on how Ripple’s situation affects everyday investors and the wider market. Even Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently admitted he’s a little uneasy, even though lawyers keep telling him not to worry. Final Thoughts In the end, Deaton said that Judge Torres will probably approve Ripple’s request — mainly to avoid wasting court time and resources if Ripple continues appealing. But he also admitted it’s a tricky situation, and while Ripple’s legal team seems confident, he personally would have pushed harder.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-16 07:57:15

While analysts continue to eye a return to the $1 zone as a key psychological threshold if current support breaks, sentiment has clearly cooled following repeated failures to clear the $2.33 resistance. With investor confidence in large-cap assets faltering, the spotlight is shifting toward new cryptocurrency projects showing early breakout potential. One such name drawing serious attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rapidly growing DeFi crypto token still trading under $1, but already generating buzz among traders watching for the next big crypto to emerge in 2025. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, ahead of an increase in Phase 6 to $0.035. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when the presale started, Mutuum Finance will officially go live at $0.06, giving current buyers a minimum 100% return on investment. The projected is predicting to hit $1 soon after launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Picks Up Steam, Raises Over $10.5M as Excitement Builds Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining traction in the altcoin scene, and investors are taking notice. With its official launch set for 2025, momentum around the project is growing fast. The presale has already crossed a major milestone, Phase 4 sold out quicker than expected. Now in Phase 5, the token is priced at $0.03, giving early buyers an instant 16.67% gain when the next price jump hits. So far, over 12,100 investors have joined in, helping the project raise more than $10.6 million. With strong community backing and a clear roadmap, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be one of the more promising altcoin investments heading into next year. Smart Tokenomics Set Mutuum Apart Compared to most other crypto projects which are purely based on hype in the market, Mutuum Finance is different. Its Buy-and-Distribute system implies that the project will routinely purchase its tokens back on the market and reward it to users who lock their MUTM. This not only encourages holding but also helps support the token’s value over time, something that could give long-term investors a real advantage. Rewarding Early Supporters with a $100K Giveaway To thank the early community, the Mutuum team has launched a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will be chosen to receive 10,000 MUTM tokens each. It’s a nice gesture, and a smart way to reward those who believed in the project from the start. Stablecoin Launch and Certik Audit Add Legitimacy On top of everything else, Mutuum is developing a fully backed, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Designed to hold its value even in tough market conditions, it aims to be a safer alternative to some of the unstable algorithmic stablecoins we’ve seen in the past. Security-wise, Mutuum Finance has passed a comprehensive audit by Certik, a respected name in blockchain safety. That kind of stamp of approval goes a long way in showing investors that the project takes protection and transparency seriously. As large-cap tokens like Ripple (XRP) struggle to reclaim momentum, investor attention is quickly shifting to breakout projects like Mutuum Finance, which has already raised over $10.6 million from 12,000+ early participants. Still priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale, MUTM is set to launch at $0.06, locking in a 100% return for current buyers, with bullish projections targeting $1 and beyond post-launch. Backed by a Certik audit, a USD-pegged stablecoin, and an innovative Buy-and-Distribute tokenomics system, Mutuum Finance offers real utility in a DeFi market hungry for secure, growth-driven platforms. Don’t wait for the next price to join the presale before the next wave of investors floods in.

Traders are being cautious, and many are protecting their positions by buying more BTC puts, which now cost more than calls, showing increased fear of a market drop. Over $1 billion in long positions have been liquidated recently, including a massive $200 million loss on Binance. Still, Bitcoin has stayed steady, helped by strong institutional buying . Ethereum is also showing strength, up 2% and trading around $2,550. It found good support near $2,510 and is also seeing institutional inflows. Glassnode Says BTC Is Still in a Healthy Bull Cycle According to on-chain data from Glassnode , Bitcoin’s current cycle gain is 656%. While this is lower than past bull runs, over 1,000% in 2015–2018 and 2018–2022, it’s still impressive, especially now that Bitcoin’s market cap is much bigger. This suggests demand is still solid, even if short-term volatility is causing worry. While the Bitcoin price is still below the last ATH of $112K, the demand is not going down, though there is a slight caution in the market as of now. What’s Happening in Crypto? Amid rising geopolitical tensions and market uncertainty, several positive developments helped stabilize Bitcoin’s price this week. Michael Saylor’s advisory role in Pakistan’s crypto policy sparked optimism, as the country looks to create its own Bitcoin reserve and launch a national crypto council, boosting confidence, especially in Asia. At the same time, Galaxy Research cooled fears over Bitcoin’s OP_Return spam concerns, with Alex Thorn calling the panic exaggerated and instead pushing focus toward meaningful upgrades like CheckTemplateVerify. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Illegal Crypto Mining Discovered In Russia As Authorities Prepare for New Penalties , Adding to the positive momentum, Bybit announced its new decentralized exchange, Byreal, built on Solana, highlighting growing innovation in the DeFi space.

The crypto market is showing resilience. Bitcoin is stable above $105,000, Ethereum is up 2% around $2,550, and institutional interest remains strong despite geopolitical tensions and recent liquidations. How is market sentiment impacting Bitcoin traders? Traders are cautious, buying more BTC puts (showing fear of a drop) following over $1 billion in long liquidations. However, strong institutional buying is providing support. Is Bitcoin still in a bull cycle? Yes, Glassnode data indicates Bitcoin is in a healthy bull cycle with a 656% cyclical gain. Despite being lower than past runs, it shows solid demand given its larger market cap. Is it worth buying crypto now? The decision to buy crypto depends on individual risk tolerance and investment goals. While the market shows resilience with institutional interest and growth, it remains volatile due to geopolitical tensions and regulatory uncertainties. Many analysts suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook for Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2025, with potential for long-term growth.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-16 08:00:26
46123553,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=169264,1750060850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46123553.jpeg,Scale AI Faces Partnership Shakeup as Google AI Plans Cut,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/scale-ai-google-ties/,"BitcoinWorld Scale AI Faces Partnership Shakeup as Google AI Plans Cut In the fast-evolving landscape where major tech players intersect with cutting-edge AI development, news of shifting alliances can significantly impact the market. Recent reports suggest a notable change involving Scale AI , a key player in data annotation services critical for training advanced AI models, particularly in the realm of Generative AI . This development is drawing attention across the tech world, including those observing the broader implications for digital infrastructure and investments. Why is Google AI Reportedly Cutting Ties with Scale AI? Reports indicate that Google is planning to significantly reduce or potentially cut its business relationship with Scale AI . This move comes amidst a period of intense competition and strategic maneuvering among tech giants in the artificial intelligence space. According to sources, Google had anticipated spending around $200 million with Scale AI this year, suggesting a substantial existing relationship. However, internal conversations are now reportedly focused on shifting this business to Scale AI’s competitors. The primary catalyst for this potential separation appears to be Meta’s reported substantial investment in Scale AI. While the exact details of Meta’s investment vary in early reports, one suggests a massive $14.3 billion investment for a 49% stake, with Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang also reportedly taking a leadership role at Meta focused on ‘superintelligence’ development. Such a deep integration with a direct competitor like Meta could raise concerns for other major tech clients regarding data security, competitive advantages, and strategic alignment. How Are Other Tech Giants Responding to the Scale AI Situation? It’s not just Google re-evaluating its relationship with Scale AI . Other major tech companies are also reportedly considering their positions: Microsoft: Similar to Google, Microsoft is reportedly looking at pulling back its business with Scale AI. OpenAI: Reports suggest OpenAI made a similar decision months prior. However, a spokesperson for OpenAI mentioned that the company continues to work with Scale AI as one of its many vendors, indicating a potentially more nuanced or reduced engagement rather than a complete halt. These reported actions from multiple large AI developers underscore the sensitivity surrounding strategic partnerships and potential conflicts of interest in the highly competitive AI development environment. For companies heavily reliant on external data annotation services, ensuring neutrality and data safeguarding from vendors is paramount. Understanding Scale AI’s Business and Its Generative AI Focus Scale AI is known for providing high-quality data annotation services. This involves labeling, categorizing, and structuring vast amounts of data, which is a crucial step in training machine learning models. While Scale AI serves various industries, including self-driving cars and government projects, Reuters highlights that its largest clients are companies developing Generative AI models. These models require massive, meticulously labeled datasets to learn how to create text, images, code, and other forms of content. The need for specialized workers with specific domain knowledge to accurately annotate complex data makes Scale AI’s services valuable. The potential loss of major clients like Google and Microsoft could significantly impact Scale AI’s revenue streams, although the company’s spokesperson maintained that their business remains strong and they will continue to operate as an independent entity that safeguards customer data. What Do These Changing AI Partnerships Mean for the Industry? The reported shifts in relationships between major tech firms and Scale AI highlight the dynamic nature of AI partnerships . As companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI race to build more advanced AI capabilities, the role of data infrastructure providers and annotators becomes critical. Key takeaways from this situation include: Strategic Alignment: Deep investments by one tech giant in a key vendor used by competitors can trigger re-evaluation of those vendor relationships. Data Privacy and Security: Concerns about data access, competitive intelligence, and security become more pronounced when a vendor is closely tied to a direct competitor. Market Competition: This could lead to increased competition among data annotation providers as companies seek alternative vendors, or encourage larger tech firms to build more in-house data labeling capabilities. Impact on Scale AI: While Scale AI asserts its independence and data security, losing major clients would necessitate adapting its business strategy, potentially leaning more heavily into its relationship with Meta while assuring other clients of its neutrality. The situation underscores the complexities of collaboration and competition in the AI race, where even essential service providers like Scale AI can become entangled in the strategic moves of their largest clients. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving AI Landscape The reported plans by Google AI and others to potentially scale back their business with Scale AI , seemingly triggered by Meta’s significant investment, signal a period of adjustment in key AI partnerships . This development highlights the strategic importance of data annotation for Generative AI and the potential challenges faced by vendors caught between competing tech giants. While Scale AI maintains its business strength and commitment to data security, the coming months will reveal how these shifting alliances reshape the market for AI training data and related services.

In a X post on June 16, Sigel warned that continued share issuance near net asset value could harm shareholders rather than benefit them. NAV refers to the net value of a company’s entire Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings is divided by the total number of outstanding. It helps investors understand how much Bitcoin backs each share. A company may issue shares and use the money received to purchase more Bitcoin if a stock trades above NAV, increasing the value of each share. But once the stock trades at or near NAV, new share issuance stops being accretive and can instead dilute shareholders’ stake in the company’s Bitcoin. No public BTC treasury company has traded below its Bitcoin NAV for a sustained period. But at least one is now approaching parity. As some of these companies raise capital through large at-the-market (ATM) programs to buy BTC, a risk is emerging: If the stock trades at or near… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) June 16, 2025 Sigel noted that no public Bitcoin treasury company has traded below NAV for an extended period, but some are now approaching that level. He highlighted several steps for companies to protect value if this gap closes further.

He also argued that executive compensation should focus on growing NAV per share, rather than the size of the Bitcoin position or share count. “Once you are trading at NAV, shareholder dilution is no longer strategic. It is extractive,” he warned. The warning comes at a time of rapid adoption of Bitcoin treasury strategies. A June 2025 report by Standard Chartered found that 61 public companies now hold 673,897 BTC or 3.2% of Bitcoin’s total supply . Among those, 58 companies are trading above their NAV, a figure referred to as mNAV, showing continued investor interest in the strategy. mNAV is a metric that measures a company’s market value divided by its Bitcoin NAV. An mNAV greater than 1.0 indicates are paying a premium to access equity-based Bitcoin exposure. An mNAV below 1.0, on the other hand, indicates that the company’s shares are trading below its Bitcoin holdings. Strategy is still the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with over 582,000 Bitcoin. In June, its mNAV stands at 1.91. The business recently added 74,000 Bitcoin in just two months and issued $250 million in preferred stock to finance further purchases. The two companies with the lowest sentiment are Semler Scientific and Trump Media & Technology Group, whose equity premiums to NAV are -10% and -16%, respectively.

BlackRock is planning to raise $400 billion from its clients in the next five years in an effort to double its operating income and stock price by 2030, the Wall Street Journal reports . The capital will be allocated to funds that invest in private equity, private credit, real estate, infrastructure and other alternative investments. BlackRock also revealed its plans to make technology and private markets comprise 30% or more of its total revenue by 2030. The move would mark a 100% growth in the amount of revenue it collects from those sectors. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is currently hoping for a doubling in shares of BlackRock as well (BLK), which are currently trading at $971 with a market cap of around $150 billion. Says Fink, “We’re singularly focused on executing these integrations to bring the breadth of BlackRock to each and every client… And with the execution, doubling operating income and stock prices, I believe is very achievable.” The CEO compares BlackRock’s current market setup to 2009, when it acquired Barclays’s iShares index-fund business. Shares of BLK have since gone up 619%. “It feels a bit like it did after we acquired BGI… I wasn’t happy with the stock price after we did that transaction. But once we proved that our whole was exponentially stronger than the parts, the stock broke out, and I believe that is going to be the case here today.” Fink also said that by 2030, BlackRock is looking to raise its revenue from $20 billion to $35 billion or more.

This comes after the recent hype around a new government-backed stablecoin linked to the Korean won. Low-Cap Tokens See Explosive Volume Biz Watch, a local media outlet, reports that the won stablecoin has emerged as a new trending topic. While major coins like Bitcoin and XRP remain flat, the low-cap Korean altcoins like MEVerse (MEV), fanC (FANC), BORA, and STMX have seen massive gains on local exchanges. MEV even outpaced Ethereum and Solana in volume on Bithumb. Many of these tokens were ignored due to their low prices and little activity. But they are now back in the spotlight despite limited updates on their tech or progress. Low Ratings, High Hypes Spark Doubts But experts warn that the rally may not last. Ratings firm Apywa also gave many of these coins low scores. There is no confirmed link between these coins and the government’s stablecoin plans, but the rumors of their ties to USDT, USDC, or payment use may be driving the prices. A securities firm official said, “With the government’s push to issue won-denominated stablecoins, fintech and blockchain companies are announcing business plans one after another, claiming relevance, and raising their stock prices.” An expert warned that coins rising on won stablecoin hype could crash anytime, just like Paycoin did, and advised investors to be careful and check the project’s fundamentals before jumping in. Kimchi Premium Traders Sentenced In a related news, a South Korean appeals court has upheld jail sentences for traders who exploited the kimchi premium to make illegal profits.

The dollar’s strength or weakness significantly impacts global liquidity, risk appetite, and ultimately, the flow of capital into and out of risk assets like crypto. So, when we look at the USD outlook for the next three to six months, we’re really asking a question that affects nearly every investment decision. Deciding whether to buy or sell the US dollar over a three-to-six month horizon involves weighing numerous complex variables. This isn’t a simple yes or no answer; it requires analyzing prevailing Forex market trends and anticipating shifts in global macroeconomic factors . Let’s break down what’s currently influencing the dollar and what you should consider. Understanding the Current US Dollar Forecast Landscape The US dollar, measured by the Dollar Index (DXY) against a basket of major currencies, has experienced significant volatility over recent years. After a period of substantial strength, driven largely by aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, the picture has become more nuanced. The current US dollar forecast from many institutions suggests a period of potential consolidation or even moderate weakening, depending on how certain key economic indicators unfold. Here are some points to consider about the present situation: The Federal Reserve appears to be nearing the end, or perhaps already at the peak, of its tightening cycle. This removes a major tailwind for the dollar. Other central banks are also navigating their own inflation battles and potential rate adjustments, narrowing interest rate differentials that previously favored the USD. Market sentiment is constantly shifting between ‘risk-on’ (favoring growth assets and potentially weakening the dollar) and ‘risk-off’ (favoring safe havens like the dollar). Key Macroeconomic Factors Shaping the USD Outlook The USD outlook for the coming months is heavily dependent on how key economic data and central bank policies evolve. These macroeconomic factors are the primary drivers of currency movements. Primary factors include: Federal Reserve Monetary Policy: Will the Fed cut rates? When and how fast? Expectations around these decisions are perhaps the single biggest influence on the short-to-medium term dollar outlook. Rate cuts generally weaken a currency, while maintaining or raising rates strengthens it. Inflation Trends: Is inflation cooling consistently towards central bank targets? Persistent inflation could force central banks, including the Fed, to keep rates higher for longer, supporting the dollar. Economic Growth Differentials: How is the US economy performing relative to other major economies (Eurozone, Japan, UK, China)? Stronger US growth can attract capital, boosting the dollar. Weaker growth might signal impending rate cuts. Geopolitical Events: Global conflicts, political instability, and trade disputes can increase demand for the dollar as a safe-haven asset, regardless of economic fundamentals. Analyzing Dollar Strength Outlook: What to Watch Predicting the precise direction of the dollar requires close observation of specific indicators and market dynamics. The dollar strength outlook is not determined by one factor alone but by the interplay of many. Look out for: Interest Rate Expectations: Monitor bond yields, particularly the difference between US yields and those in other countries (yield differentials). Widening positive differentials favor the dollar. Economic Data Releases: Pay attention to Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), GDP growth reports, and retail sales figures. Strong data can support the dollar, while weak data can weigh on it. Central Bank Communications: Speeches and statements from Fed officials, press conferences, and meeting minutes provide crucial clues about future policy intentions. Market Positioning: The Commitments of Traders (COT) report shows how large speculators are positioned in currency futures. Extreme positioning can sometimes signal a potential reversal. Forex Market Trends and the Dollar’s Path Beyond the fundamental macroeconomic factors , technical analysis and prevailing Forex market trends also play a role in the dollar’s movement. Traders and investors react to chart patterns, support and resistance levels, and momentum indicators. Current trends might show the dollar trading within a range, attempting to break above or below key technical levels. For example, if the DXY is testing a significant support level that has held previously, it might suggest potential for a bounce (dollar strengthening). Conversely, if it’s struggling to break through resistance, it could signal potential weakness. Furthermore, observing major currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY provides insight into the dollar’s performance against its peers. A falling EUR/USD typically indicates dollar strengthening against the Euro, while a rising pair indicates dollar weakening. Actionable Insights for Trading the US Dollar Given the complex landscape, what are the actionable steps you can take when considering the US dollar forecast for the next 3-6 months? Whether you’re directly trading Forex or simply assessing the broader market environment, an informed approach is key. Consider these insights: Define Your Thesis: Based on your analysis of the factors discussed, do you lean bullish (expecting dollar strength) or bearish (expecting dollar weakness)? Your stance will dictate your potential strategy. Identify Key Scenarios: What are the potential catalysts that could dramatically alter the outlook? For example, an unexpected spike in inflation, a sudden shift in Fed rhetoric, or a major geopolitical event. How would you react in each scenario? Risk Management: Currency markets can be volatile. If trading directly, use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Position sizing is crucial – don’t risk more capital than you can afford to lose on a single trade. Stay Informed: The economic calendar is your friend. Keep track of major data releases and central bank meetings. Market expectations can shift rapidly based on new information. Consider Diversification: For investors, the dollar’s movement impacts the value of international assets. Understanding the USD outlook helps in managing currency risk within a diversified portfolio. Example Scenario: If you believe inflation is stickier than the market expects and the Fed will therefore keep rates higher for longer, your dollar strength outlook might be bullish. This could lead you to consider positions that benefit from a stronger dollar. Example Scenario: If you believe the global economy is slowing rapidly and the Fed will be forced to cut rates sooner than anticipated, your USD outlook might be bearish. You might then look for opportunities where other currencies are expected to outperform the dollar. Compelling Summary: The Nuance of the Next 6 Months The question of whether to buy or sell the US dollar over the next three to six months has no single correct answer that applies to everyone. The US dollar forecast is a dynamic assessment influenced by a confluence of macroeconomic factors , central bank actions, and evolving Forex market trends . Analyzing the potential for continued dollar strength outlook requires careful consideration of interest rate paths, inflation data, growth prospects, and global risk sentiment. Ultimately, the decision rests on your own analysis, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Stay informed, understand the key drivers, and approach the market with a clear strategy. The next six months promise to be a period where navigating the dollar’s path will be crucial for market participants across asset classes, including cryptocurrencies.

The move reflects the company’s growing focus on blockchain and Web3 innovation. Hong Kong-listed MemeStrategy Acquires 2,440 Solanas as Part of Strategic Web3 Transformation In its official statement, the company positioned this investment as a strategic allocation to emerging digital ecosystems, highlighting Solana’s value proposition in supporting decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi infrastructure, and broader Web3 use cases. Following the announcement, MemeStrategy's share price rose nearly 21% to HK$2.42 per share in Monday's trading session. The company has also officially rebranded as “MemeStrategy,” with its ticker remaining unchanged. The name change reflects its ongoing strategic shift into the crypto and Web3 sectors. This change comes after 9GAG co-founder Ray Chan announced that he had successfully acquired another Hong Kong-listed company, Hypebeast Holdings, which he will rename to MemeStrategy and allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin and other crypto assets. MemeStrategy’s recent Solana acquisition reflects growing institutional interest in digital assets among publicly traded companies in Asia, particularly as the Web3 narrative continues to gain traction in global capital markets. *This is not investment advice.

Over the past week, speculation has intensified around what many believe could be the final major ruling in the long-running SEC vs. Ripple case. A ruling that may open the door to a complete settlement. The context began shifting on June 12, when Ripple and the SEC jointly refiled a motion asking Judge Analisa Torres to issue an indicative ruling. This request aims to vacate the injunction that blocks institutional XRP sales and to reduce the civil penalty from $125 million to $50 million. The parties also requested the release of the remaining $75 million still held in escrow, originally allocated for restitution. Both parties initially filed a joint motion in May. But Judge Analisa Torres rejected this due to procedural errors, as the parties styled their filing as an indicative ruling under Rule 62.1 (used for pending appeals). However, what they sought was to vacate a final judgment, which legally requires a Rule 60 motion, a far stricter standard. Legal Momentum Shifts Toward Resolution Unlike earlier filings, this new motion is structurally stronger . It follows procedural guidance previously laid out by the court. By addressing those concerns, the refiled request has introduced renewed confidence among legal analysts that the court could now rule in favor of the adjustments. If Judge Torres grants the motion, it would signal that she is inclined to modify her earlier final judgment. That, in turn, would allow the case to be remanded to the district court from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The result would be a clear path for both parties to withdraw their pending appeals and finalize a negotiated settlement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? While today was initially a deadline for filing a status update on a potential settlement, the crypto world is confident that Judge Torres will hand down her final ruling today, with one expert recently describing today as XRP’s judgment day . XRP’s price has already reflected this optimism. The token saw a modest increase of about 1.2% in the lead-up to today’s expected developments, suggesting that traders are pricing in the potential for a favorable court decision. While today’s decision is not guaranteed, the structure of the motion and the procedural history make it a critical inflection point. A positive ruling would likely mark the beginning of the end for a legal battle that has spanned over four years.

With only four days left in the Solaxy presale, concerns over clarity and post-sale token availability have caused a shift. Investors are moving toward projects that offer simpler user experiences and more transparent rollout processes. Pepeto Draws Attention With User-Friendly Approach Pepeto , a memecoin project built for interoperability and utility, is gaining interest due to its easy-to-use features. Its presale, now past $5.3 million, offers clear token purchasing and staking options directly on its website. At press time, Pepeto is valued at $0.000000134. Users can connect wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet and participate without facing any complex claim process. – Updates on $PEPETO exchange soon; once done, the day of judgement (Date of listing) would be days after – $PEPETO , The God of Frogs. pic.twitter.com/Aay4Tv5HCb — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) June 1, 2025 The Pepeto platform includes a zero-fee trading model, a cross-chain bridge, and plans for a meme token exchange. These offerings are designed to serve the growing demand for memecoins while also addressing challenges like transaction costs and accessibility. Pepeto’s interface and clear instructions make it attractive to users who want a fast and simple way to get involved. Solaxy Raises Millions but Faces Confusion Solaxy has raised over $48 million during its presale and recently burned $62 million worth of SOLX tokens. The token burn removed 25% of the total supply to boost scarcity and investor interest. The project has also shared major updates, such as a cross-chain partnership with Hyperlane and an upcoming Layer-2 launch. However, despite strong fundraising numbers, many users report unclear steps on how to claim their tokens. Questions about distribution timing and wallet compatibility have caused frustration in online forums and investor groups. While the Solaxy team promotes high-speed development, some early backers are waiting for precise guidance on how and when they can use their tokens. Pepeto Offers Seamless Cross-Chain Access Pepeto is building a system that supports memecoins across chains without trading fees. Its bridge connects Ethereum, BNB Chain, and others, allowing for smoother token movement. This interoperability aims to solve the common problem of limited access between different blockchain networks. The project’s swap solution allows users to trade tokens directly through its platform, reducing the need for outside tools. This direct and smooth access contrasts with platforms that rely on third-party interfaces and slower network integration. Pepeto’s design helps users keep control while staying within the ecosystem. In addition, Pepeto supports token creators with a listing platform. New and existing projects can gain exposure and liquidity, adding more utility to the platform. This feature aims to create an ecosystem where users and developers can grow together under one shared system. Pepeto’s Ecosystem Growth Supports Staking and Development To support ongoing growth, Pepeto uses a token model that balances rewards and long-term planning. 30% of tokens are for staking, allowing holders to earn rewards and encourage holding. This strategy also helps secure the platform by involving the community in the process. Another 30% of the supply is allocated for presale, while 20% supports marketing and promotional activities. Liquidity takes up 12.5% of tokens to ensure stability across exchanges. Project development is backed by the remaining 7.5%, helping fund technology and innovation. Pepeto has also announced a beta version of its swap platform. It is designed to support fast transactions and bring a better user experience. The project also confirmed that it will list its token on multiple exchanges and host public AMA sessions for transparency. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful, utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) price recently bounced from a confluence support zone, formed by the rising trendline and a horizontal support range around $0.0088–$0.0090. Momentum indicators are showing early signs of a potential reversal, with a bullish divergence on the RSI and flattening MACD histogram with the signal lines nearing a potential bullish crossover. However, PENGU price remains below the 20-day EMA and 50-day SMA, and the broader downtrend from May is still intact as the price hasn’t yet made a higher high above the last significant swing high.

The memecoin ‘s price has recently bounced off the lower trendline of the wedge, establishing support in the $0.00001370–$0.00001410 zone. The upper trendline resistance currently intersects around the $0.00001650–$0.00001680 range, aligning with the 20-day EMA — creating a zone of confluence that strengthens its significance as a potential breakout level. Technically, there’s a slight bullish divergence on the RSI — while BONK price made a lower low during the most recent pullback, the RSI formed a higher low, suggesting weakening bearish momentum. Additionally, the MACD histogram is contracting toward the zero line, supporting the case for a possible upside move. The next major resistance lies around $0.00001860, aligning with the 50-day SMA and a previous support-turned-resistance level. The next level to watch is $0.00002100, a key horizontal resistance from late May as well as a swing high in late April. The final target, near $0.00002580, represents the full measured move of the wedge and coincides with a major swing high from the beginning of the wedge’s upper trendline.

Technically, there’s bullish divergence forming on the RSI. The MACD histogram is also gradually contracting toward the zero line, hinting at a possible bullish crossover in the near term. Looking ahead, the immediate major target is around $0.42, which aligns with the 50-day SMA and the previous swing high.

Within hours of the theft being discovered, the stolen cryptocurrency had been laundered through Huiwang, a Cambodian-based network operated by the Huione Group that facilitates illicit financial activities, including crypto exchange services and darknet marketplace operations. How Chinese Crypto Hardware Stole Millions in Crypto Criminals are now adopting a growing, dangerous trend where traditional phishing techniques are targeted at hardware wallets, which users trust implicitly for enhanced security features.

Unlike software-based scams that rely on users making mistakes during transactions, this hardware compromise occurred at the fundamental level of private key generation. When the victim initialized their new wallet, the pre-compromised device generated keys already known to the attackers. This created an illusion of security while providing criminals complete access to funds transferred to the wallet. Within hours of the theft, the criminals had successfully moved the stolen cryptocurrency through multiple layers of obfuscation, making recovery virtually impossible. This speed and efficiency suggest coordination between hardware scammers and money laundering networks. North Korea hackers are well known for these types of large-scale organized crimes.

Beyond charts and news headlines, a powerful force is at play: human emotion . Fear and greed are the twin engines that can push prices to extremes. Understanding this underlying crypto market sentiment is crucial, and that’s where tools like the Crypto Fear and Greed Index come into play. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index ? Think of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index as a barometer for the emotional state of the crypto market. Developed by Alternative, this index aggregates data from various sources to provide a single number between 0 (representing Extreme Fear) and 100 (representing Extreme Greed). It’s designed to help investors gauge whether the market is currently dominated by panic selling (fear) or exuberant buying (greed). Why is this important? Historically, extreme fear can signal a potential buying opportunity (when others are panicking), while extreme greed might indicate the market is due for a correction (when everyone is overly optimistic). As of June 16, the index stands at 61, marking a slight increase from the previous day and firmly placing it in the ‘Greed’ zone. This reading suggests that market participants are feeling generally positive and confident. How is the Index Calculated? Breaking Down the Factors The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn’t just a random number. It’s a composite score derived from six different weighted factors. Understanding these components gives you a deeper insight into what influences the overall sentiment: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average corresponding values of the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially on the downside, often signals fear. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): This compares the current volume and market momentum to the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market indicates greed, while high selling volume during a dip reflects fear. Social Media (15%): This factor analyzes posts on various social media platforms, focusing on specific crypto-related hashtags and sentiment analysis of those posts. High levels of discussion and positive sentiment can contribute to a greed score. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this component previously involved weekly polls asking people about their market sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear (people moving from altcoins to the relative safety of Bitcoin), while falling dominance might suggest increasing greed (people speculating on riskier altcoins). Google Trends (10%): This analyzes Google search data for crypto-related search terms. Spikes in search queries like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” often correlate with fear, while searches for terms like “buy crypto” or specific altcoins during a rally can signal greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a holistic view of the prevailing crypto market sentiment . Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 61 Mean for Crypto Market Sentiment ? A reading of 61 firmly places the market in the ‘Greed’ territory, though not yet at the ‘Extreme Greed’ levels (typically above 75-80). This suggests a generally positive outlook among investors. People are more inclined to buy, hold, or even speculate, driven by positive price action or optimistic news. In the ‘Greed’ zone, you might observe: Increased buying pressure and rising prices. More discussion about potential profits and price targets on social media. Decreased perceived risk among retail investors. Higher trading volume as more participants enter or increase their positions. However, it’s important to remember that ‘Greed’ isn’t necessarily a signal to blindly buy. While positive sentiment can fuel rallies, the ‘Greed’ zone is also where caution becomes increasingly important. Markets driven by excessive greed can become overheated and prone to sudden pullbacks or corrections. Understanding Crypto Volatility in the Context of Sentiment Crypto volatility is a double-edged sword heavily influenced by sentiment. In periods of fear, volatility spikes downwards as panic selling ensues. Sharp, rapid price drops increase the volatility component of the index, pushing it towards ‘Fear’. Conversely, during periods of rising greed, volatility can also increase upwards as FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) drives rapid price pumps. The index’s volatility component captures these movements, reflecting how stable or erratic price action is, which is often a direct result of market emotions. The Role of Market Momentum and Volume Market momentum , closely tied to trading volume, is a significant contributor to the index. When there’s strong positive momentum – prices rising quickly on high volume – it’s a clear sign of buying pressure, indicative of greed. Conversely, negative momentum with high selling volume signals fear. The index uses this data to see if recent price movements are supported by significant trading activity, validating the strength of the prevailing sentiment. A rising index often correlates with increasing positive market momentum . Actionable Insights: Using the Index in Your Crypto Trading So, how can you actually use the Crypto Fear and Greed Index ? It’s best used as one tool among many, not as a standalone trading signal. As a Contrary Indicator: Some experienced traders use the index contrarianly. Extreme Fear (low values) might be seen as a potential buying opportunity when others are panicking. Extreme Greed (high values) might be a signal to take profits or be cautious about entering new positions. The current level at 61 is ‘Greed’, suggesting increased caution might be warranted compared to when the index was in ‘Fear’. To Gauge Market Psychology: The index provides a quick snapshot of the market’s emotional state. Is there widespread panic or euphoria? This can help you assess the general mood and avoid getting swept up in emotional trading decisions. Combine with Other Analysis: Never rely solely on the index. Use it alongside technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators), fundamental analysis (project news, adoption), and macroeconomic factors. For example, if technical indicators show a potential resistance level while the index is in ‘Greed’, it might reinforce a decision to be cautious. Understand the Zones: Pay attention to the shifts between zones (Fear to Neutral, Neutral to Greed, etc.) and the extremes (Extreme Fear/Greed). These transitions can sometimes precede significant market moves. Remember, the index reflects *current* sentiment based on recent data. The market can change rapidly. Limitations of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index : It’s Not a Crystal Ball While useful, the index has limitations: It’s a Lagging or Coincident Indicator: It reflects sentiment based on what has already happened (price moves, search trends, social posts), not what *will* happen. Simplification: Reducing complex market dynamics to a single number is a simplification. It doesn’t account for nuanced market conditions or specific asset performance (beyond Bitcoin dominance). Potential for Manipulation: Some components, like social media or Google Trends, could potentially be influenced, although the index tries to mitigate this. Doesn’t Predict Magnitude or Timing: A high ‘Greed’ score doesn’t tell you *when* a correction will happen or *how large* it will be. Similarly, ‘Fear’ doesn’t guarantee a bottom. Therefore, it’s a valuable tool for context but should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Conclusion: Staying Informed on Crypto Market Sentiment The rise of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 61, keeping it within the ‘Greed’ zone, is a clear signal of current positive crypto market sentiment . Driven by factors like price action, market momentum , and potentially shifts in Bitcoin dominance or changes in crypto volatility , this reading suggests investors are feeling optimistic. While ‘Greed’ can accompany upward price movements, it’s also a time for increased vigilance. Using the index as a gauge for prevailing emotions, combined with thorough analysis, can help you navigate the market more effectively. Understanding the underlying fear and greed dynamics, as reflected by this index, is a powerful step towards making more informed, less emotional trading and investment decisions in the volatile world of crypto.

On Monday, Treasurer Jim Chalmers told ABC TV that the combination of Israel’s airstrikes on Iran and Iran’s counterattack has made things even worse in an already unstable global climate. “The global economy is a pretty dangerous place right now,” Jim said, describing the moment as “perilous.” He pointed to rising oil prices since the Friday strikes as one major signal that trouble is coming fast. Traders in Australia have started betting harder on rate cuts—not because inflation’s over, but because the risk to growth now looks worse. The military fight between Israel and Iran hit its fourth day on Monday, and fears are now growing about a broader war erupting in the Middle East, especially with Iran being one of the biggest oil producers. Oil shock pushes interest rate cut bets higher Oil jumped right after the Israeli attacks hit Iranian nuclear sites. With Iran being the ninth-largest oil producer in 2023, any interruption in supply was enough to rattle energy markets. The global oil supply is now at risk, and that directly impacts prices of everything that depends on energy—from shipping to food. Traders responded immediately. Betting markets are now assigning a 90% chance that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will deliver a third 0.25% rate cut this year, which would push the cash rate to 3.6%. After that, two more rate cuts are expected, eventually bringing it down to 3.1%. Jim also said that central banks like the RBA are trying to look beyond just short-term price spikes. “Typically what Reserve Banks do, central banks, not just our own, but they try and look through temporary spikes in prices, and to consider the broader implications,” he said. But those implications are starting to pile up fast. The Treasury is now tracking not just the Iran-Israel fight but other triggers too. Jim listed US tariff tensions, the Ukraine-Russia war, and China’s slowdown—which matters a lot since China is still Australia’s largest trade partner. “Australia is well-placed and well prepared to deal with all of this uncertainty and volatility,” Jim said. “But we won’t be immune from it.” Most economists in the region aren’t as aggressive as markets. They expect two more cuts—likely in August and November—with a year-end cash rate at 3.35%. That still puts Australia in a rate-cutting cycle, driven by concerns that the economy could stall under external pressure. Global markets react as fear spreads fast The conflict didn’t just hurt oil. It dragged down financial markets globally. Stocks dropped across every major index as investors moved out of risky assets. Gold prices climbed, as expected. Whenever geopolitical fears take over, investors move into gold for safety. It’s a hedge they trust during inflation, wars, or market collapses. The US dollar also surged. Investors ran to the greenback like they always do during a crisis. The so-called “dollar smile” effect played out once again—either when things are great, or when things are really bad, the dollar wins. This time, it gained against currencies usually seen as safe too, like the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen, which just reinforces how strong the dollar still is, even as talk of de-dollarization continues. Jim is set to give a full speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday, outlining the government’s second-term plans in an address titled “Our Second Term Economic Agenda.” The ruling Labor Party, which won big on May 3, now has full control to roll out its economic strategy. But all eyes are on how they’ll handle the external shocks that are piling up faster than expected.

The numbers suggest their power is far from fading. With social virality, community force, and presale-driven scarcity fueling growth, meme coins continue to outperform expectations. From their grassroots origins to commanding billion-dollar market caps, meme assets have matured into serious wealth generators. And this year, a new lineup of top performers is building serious traction. Among the most talked-about names: Troller Cat , AI Companions, Comedian, and SLERF. Troller Cat ($TCAT) is especially making waves with a structured presale model, staking mechanics, and high-deflation potential. The presale is live now, already hitting significant milestones. For those looking to buy TCAT, this moment could deliver unmatched advantages. Join early for maximum perks—and be part of one of the best cryptos to buy today. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT): Where Viral Hype Meets Precision-Engineered Profit Troller Cat’s presale is already proving itself a breakout opportunity. Starting at just $0.000005, the presale has progressed through multiple stages, now at Stage 9 with a price of $0.00002834. That’s a 466.8% gain from its original value, and with a final listing price of $0.0005309, the projected ROI stands at over 1773.32%. With over $250,000 raised and 1,100+ holders onboard, it’s gaining remarkable traction. Presale stages define financial turning points, and Troller Cat’s Stage 9 is one such threshold. A $30,000 entry now grants 1.06 billion tokens, with projections soaring beyond $561.9K at launch. This is not just a high-reward opportunity—it’s a closing one. As the price inches toward its next increase, decisive action separates future winners from watchers. Unlike many presales, Troller Cat is built on real, rewarding mechanics. With 26 carefully structured stages and a GameFi engine that drives token burns through a play-to-earn Game Center, $TCAT is deflationary by design. Add to that a staking APY of 69%, and the coin becomes not just a speculation play but a passive income stream. Its smart contract has passed full audits, and the project is KYC-verified—a critical trust signal for newcomers. This rare blend of credibility and high reward places Troller Cat among the best cryptos to buy today. No Masks, Just Moves: Troller Cat Is KYC-Certified and Fully Transparent In a space crowded with shadows and anonymous devs, Troller Cat steps forward with receipts. The team behind $TCAT is fully KYC-verified—meaning their identities have been confirmed, their intent is clear, and their commitment to transparency is locked in. This isn’t another meme coin hiding behind whiskers and pixel art. It’s a project led by real people with real accountability. While others vanish into the void, Troller Cat builds with credibility, making trust a core feature, not an afterthought. 2. AI Companions ($AIC): Reimagining Meme Coins Through Artificial Intelligence AI Companions fuses AI with meme culture to deliver a new kind of interactive digital experience. Each token unlocks access to evolving AI-driven avatars that adapt to user behavior. These AI personalities can participate in games, generate content, or provide productivity boosts in decentralized environments. The project’s roadmap includes integrating neural networks and supporting voice-interactive NFTs. With Web3 adoption growing and AI interest surging, AI Companions could be uniquely positioned at the intersection of two breakout sectors. Its innovation in user engagement and personalization is why AI Companions earns its place on this list. 3. Comedian ($BAN): Turning Laughs Into Liquidity Comedian is more than a token—it’s a digital platform for emerging comedy creators. Built on blockchain, it allows token-based tipping, gated content access, and voting for performance showcases. It transforms viral moments into monetized opportunities. By decentralizing entertainment curation and support, Comedian empowers both creators and fans. Plans for NFT-based ticketing and creator DAOs make it one of the more practical use cases in the meme coin world. Its creator-first design and real-world utility earn Comedian a strong position among top-performing newcomers. 4. SLERF ($SLERF): An Enigma With Explosive Community Backing SLERF thrives on ambiguity. This meme coin launched without revealing its team, utility, or roadmap—yet gained instant momentum across TikTok and crypto forums. The scarcity model, limited token supply, and mysterious narrative created cult-like engagement. With strategic NFT drops and staged reveals planned, SLERF has created an ecosystem based entirely on curiosity and viral energy. Its trading volume continues to climb without traditional marketing or utility. Its unpredictable nature and social magnetism have cemented SLERF as one of the most buzz-worthy meme tokens of 2025. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the best cryptos to buy today include Troller Cat , AI Companions, Comedian, and SLERF. Each project presents a unique narrative—from Troller Cat’s high-ROI presale and staking structure to Housecoin’s tangible property-driven model. However, Troller Cat's presale momentum, audited transparency, and built-in deflationary mechanics make it the most compelling opportunity. For those looking to buy TCAT, the current stage may represent the last low-price entry into one of the year’s most promising crypto launches.

While internal crypto developments are key, savvy investors know that the broader financial world, especially major economic events , holds significant sway. This week presents a classic example of how macroeconomic forces, particularly actions from the Federal Reserve , can send ripples through the digital asset space. Why US Economic Events Matter for Crypto The United States remains a global financial powerhouse, and decisions made by its central bank, the Federal Reserve , have far-reaching consequences. Cryptocurrencies, while often seen as an alternative to traditional finance, are not immune to these effects. Think of crypto as a risk-on asset; when the overall economic outlook tightens or uncertainty rises, investors often pull back from riskier holdings, which can include digital currencies. Key announcements regarding monetary policy, inflation, and employment can dramatically shift market sentiment. This is why keeping an eye on the economic calendar is crucial for anyone navigating the crypto landscape. Key Economic Events This Week: What’s on the Calendar? This week features several high-impact events originating from the U.S., with a particular focus on the Federal Reserve’s activities. Here’s a breakdown of what’s scheduled (All listed times are in UTC): Wednesday, June 18: 18:00 U.S. FOMC Statement: This document provides the Federal Open Market Committee’s assessment of the economy and the factors influencing their monetary policy decisions. It’s dissected by analysts for clues about future actions. 18:00 U.S. Fed Interest Rate Decision: This is arguably the most anticipated event. The Federal Reserve announces whether it will raise, lower, or maintain its target interest rate. Interest rates are a primary tool for controlling inflation and influencing economic activity. 18:30 U.S. FOMC Press Conference: Following the statement and rate decision, the Fed Chair holds a press conference. The tone and specific wording used here can provide further context and clarity on the Fed’s outlook and policy path, often causing significant market volatility. Thursday, June 19: All day U.S. holiday (Juneteenth National Independence Day): While not a direct policy event, a U.S. market holiday can lead to reduced trading volume and potentially more volatile price swings in thinner markets. These events, especially the Fed interest rate decision and subsequent press conference, are circled on the calendars of global investors, including those in the crypto space. Understanding the Fed Interest Rate Decision and its Crypto Market Impact How does a change in the Fed interest rate affect cryptocurrencies? It’s primarily through liquidity and investor appetite for risk. Higher Rates: When the Fed raises interest rates, borrowing becomes more expensive. This can slow down economic activity, reduce the amount of money flowing into the economy (liquidity), and make safer investments (like bonds) more attractive compared to riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. This often leads to downward pressure on crypto prices. Lower Rates: Conversely, cutting interest rates or keeping them low makes borrowing cheaper, injects liquidity, and makes riskier assets relatively more appealing as investors seek higher returns than traditional savings can offer. This tends to be bullish for crypto. The Tone (Forward Guidance): Beyond the rate itself, the Fed’s language about future policy is critical. If the FOMC meeting statement or press conference signals a more aggressive stance (hawkish) or a more relaxed stance (dovish), markets react accordingly, often before the actual rate changes occur. The market doesn’t just react to the decision itself but also to how it compares to expectations. A decision or statement that surprises the market can cause significant and rapid price movements. Navigating Potential Volatility Triggered by the FOMC Meeting With the FOMC meeting and rate decision looming, crypto investors should prepare for potential volatility. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Monitor the news closely around the scheduled times. Pay attention not just to the rate decision but also to the language in the statement and the Fed Chair’s comments. Manage Risk: Consider adjusting position sizes or setting stop-loss orders to protect against sharp, unexpected price swings. Avoid Leveraged Trading: High leverage can be particularly risky during periods of high volatility driven by major economic news. Look for Clarity: Sometimes, markets react strongly to initial uncertainty. As analysts digest the information from the Federal Reserve , clearer trends may emerge. Challenges and Opportunities The primary challenge during such weeks is the inherent uncertainty. Predicting market reactions to economic data is difficult, as sentiment and external factors also play significant roles. However, for those prepared, volatility can also present opportunities. Sharp dips might be seen as buying opportunities by some, while rapid pumps could be moments to take profits. Understanding the potential crypto market impact of these fundamental economic forces is key to making informed decisions, rather than being caught off guard. Conclusion: Stay Alert to Economic Signals This week’s calendar, highlighted by the Fed interest rate decision and the FOMC meeting , serves as a potent reminder that the cryptocurrency market operates within a larger global financial ecosystem. While crypto has its unique drivers, macroeconomic events, particularly those concerning monetary policy from the Federal Reserve , can significantly influence liquidity, investor sentiment, and ultimately, price action. Staying informed about these critical economic events is not just good practice; it’s essential for navigating the potentially volatile waters of the digital asset market.

46129346,https://invezz.com/?p=2763745,1750066449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"ETH sees 15% weekly surge, but all eyes turn to this project ahead of beta launch",https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/16/eth-sees-15-weekly-surge-but-all-eyes-turn-to-this-project-ahead-of-beta-launch/,"Ethereum (ETH) recently delivered a strong 15% weekly performance, reinvigorating bullish sentiment across the crypto space. As Layer-1 giants reclaim momentum, attention is naturally turning toward projects innovating around Ethereum (ETH)’s infrastructure, especially those about to launch. One of the most anticipated of these is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—a decentralized protocol preparing for its beta debut and introducing features that address long-standing DeFi challenges. While Ethereum (ETH) continues to lead in market cap and adoption, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are building utility that will define the next evolution of decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): DeFi lending, reimagined Mutuum Finance (MUTM) won’t be just another lending protocol—it will be a multi-model platform built for flexibility, inclusivity, and scale. Unlike many traditional DeFi platforms that will only offer pooled lending with rigid parameters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will combine both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. This dual-lending architecture will open the doors to diverse strategies, whether users want simple passive returns from popular tokens like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), or Avalanche (AVAX), or prefer to lend directly to peers using custom terms—even on volatile assets like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB). With the P2C model, depositors will earn dynamic interest directly tied to borrower demand. When borrowing activity spikes, lender returns will increase as well. Meanwhile, the P2P feature will give experienced users the ability to set rates and negotiate terms with specific borrowers—adding a level of control and customization rarely seen in the DeFi space. The engine driving the Mutuum ecosystem is its native token, MUTM. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and a current presale price of $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $10.60 million during its Phase 5 presale, attracting more than 12,100 holders. Holders of MUTM won’t just benefit from potential price appreciation—they will participate in revenue-sharing mechanisms through the protocol. Users can stake their mtTokens (representing deposits in the protocol) to receive passive dividends. These dividends will be funded by a buyback system where protocol revenues are used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market—creating steady demand and rewarding long-term contributors with additional income. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. Layer-2 integration: DeFi, accelerated One of the major developments that sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its planned integration with Layer-2 scaling solutions. High gas fees and sluggish transaction times have long plagued Ethereum (ETH)-based protocols. By incorporating Layer-2 infrastructure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer faster and more cost-efficient transactions while maintaining the security guarantees of the Ethereum (ETH) network. This move improves user experience, makes micro-lending viable, and opens the door for wider adoption. For a lending protocol that relies on efficient borrowing and repayment mechanics, this upgrade gives Mutuum a vital edge in usability and accessibility. Adding to its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently developing its own decentralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized stablecoins that depend on fiat reserves and opaque banking relationships, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be fully backed by on-chain collateral—assets already held within the protocol. This ensures transparency, overcollateralization, and an algorithmic supply system that adjusts in real time. According to the official roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch the beta version of its platform alongside the token go-live. This timing is critical—it ensures that early adopters not only acquire the token at presale rates but can immediately put their MUTM to work within a functional ecosystem as soon as the platform goes live. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also completed a thorough smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security firms in the space. With a Token Scan Score of 80 and comprehensive checks via manual review and static analysis, the platform enters its next phase with robust security credibility. A generous giveaway to celebrate community growth To support community expansion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running an ongoing $100K giveaway . This initiative is not only building awareness but rewarding early participants, strengthening the foundation of a committed user base. As the project scales toward launch, such campaigns are helping to accelerate the distribution of MUTM tokens across a wide and engaged audience. Ethereum (ETH)’s recent price action has reaffirmed its role as the heartbeat of the decentralized economy. But every bull cycle brings a new wave of innovation—and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently among the few upcoming platforms with both a solid tokenomic structure and a feature set that solves multiple DeFi pain points. From dynamic interest lending and overcollateralized stablecoins to Layer-2 scalability and real-time dividend rewards, every aspect of Mutuum’s roadmap is engineered for utility and performance. Investors looking for more than just another speculative token now have an alternative that blends practicality with long-term ecosystem sustainability. With over $10.60 million already raised, a thriving community of 12,100+ holders, and a fully-audited codebase, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to become a foundational piece of the next DeFi growth wave.

According to sources, Winklevoss Twins-led Gemini is on the verge of obtaining a license in Malta. The crypto giant had already secured a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) license from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) last month. Malta, the smallest country in the European Union, earlier approved licenses to exchanges, including OKX and Crypto.com . EU member states were allowed to issue licenses for crypto firms under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation that was implemented last year. The rollout has been one of the most significant regulatory shifts in Europe’s crypto landscape. Malta’s Rapid License Approvals Raise Concerns Among EU Regulators An unidentified senior regulatory official told Reuters that the pace of approvals from Malta and other nations, where there are fewer staff, is concerning. However, per a spokesperson for Malta’s FSA noted that the “expedited processing” was due to “in-depth understanding acquired over these years.” Malta has so far granted licenses to four crypto asset service providers, the representative added. Besides, OKX previously said that Malta’s licensing process was “rigorous” and its local money laundering standards were strict. Luxembourg to Grant License to Coinbase Luxembourg, which recently labelled crypto firms as “high-risk” entities for money laundering, is gearing up to grant a license to Coinbase. One source pointed out that the size of the largest US-based crypto exchange’s intended operations in Luxembourg is relatively less. With over 200 Coinbase employees in Europe, the exchange’s license application has been in progress for months. Coinbase has invested in staff to ensure smooth and safe operations in the EU region, a representative from the exchange noted. Further, Luxembourg was a “high-bar, well-respected global financial centre,” the spokesperson said, adding that Coinbase plans to hire more people this year, at least 20.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is surging in its presale, raising $10,600,000 with over 550 million tokens sold to 12,100 holders. Dogecoin (DOGE), a familiar memecoin, hovers near key price levels, hinting at a potential breakout. Both tokens offer unique opportunities, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its DeFi utility and guaranteed 100% ROI at launch. As phase 5 unfolds, investors are eyeing these altcoins for massive gains. Which one will hit $2 in 2025? Let’s explore their potential. Dogecoin’s breakout potential Dogecoin (DOGE) is teasing a breakout on its weekly charts. Historical patterns show small rallies often precede sharp surges. Currently priced at $0.1883, DOGE faces resistance at $0.45. Breaking this could spark a 30–50% jump, with $1 as a possible target. However, declining volume signals uncertainty in crypto prices today. DOGE’s volatility, driven by social media hype, keeps it unpredictable. Investors watching crypto charts note $0.22 as key support. While DOGE’s meme-driven spikes excite, its inflationary tokenomics limit long-term scarcity. Consequently, its path to $2 in 2025 remains speculative. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a more structured opportunity. Mutuum Finance presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is accelerating through phase 5 of its 11-phase presale. Tokens sell at $0.03, a 200% rise from the opening phase’s $0.01. Phase 6 will increase prices by 16.7% to $0.035, making now a prime entry point. The project’s $10,600,000 raise and 12,100 holders reflect strong demand in crypto investment. Buying now secures a 100% ROI at the $0.06 launch price. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $3, offering a 9,900% gain from today’s price. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently completed a Certik audit, scoring 80.00 with no vulnerabilities, boosting its reliability. This solid foundation fuels investor confidence. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining crypto lending with a dual-model system. Its Peer-to-Contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contracts, earning passive income. Borrowers access funds instantly, with automated rates ensuring fair returns. The Peer-to-Peer model fosters direct lending, enhancing transparency and control. A forthcoming Ethereum-based stablecoin, pegged to USD, strengthens transaction security. Layer-2 integration ensures fast, low-cost transactions, addressing crypto prices today concerns like high fees. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. This incentivizes loyalty, making crypto investing more engaging. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised for growth. Mutuum Finance giveaway excitement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is celebrating its presale with a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Participation requires a $50 presale investment and completing simple quests, like submitting a wallet address. This initiative boosts community engagement, aligning with active social media monitoring noted in the Certik audit. Moreover, the project’s beta platform will launch alongside its listing, allowing immediate access to lending features. This hands-on approach sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart in crypto predictions for 2025. Investors are drawn to its tangible utility and rewards, solidifying its position in crypto coins. Picking the $2 winner Cheapest cryptos ready to explode in 2025 offer thrilling prospects. Dogecoin (DOGE) relies on momentum and hype, with $1 possible but $2 a stretch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, combines affordability, utility, and a clear roadmap. Its $3 post-launch prediction far surpasses $2, driven by DeFi demand and Layer-2 scalability. The 100% ROI at launch and potential 9,900% gains make it a standout in crypto investment. Act now to join phase 5 before prices rise.

Yet, in the structured reality we inhabit, macroeconomic stability is an almost certain outcome instead. MSTR stock can still thrive amid macroeconomic order. Bitcoin halving and digital-asset sentiment factors position the company to continue benefiting from global cryptocurrency adoption. Instead of treating the Company as a dollar-crisis hedge, treat it as a low-weight cyclical momentum and long-term volatility investment. Be aware of the impending, natural downturn for Bitcoin in 2026. Since my last Strategy ( MSTR ) analysis , the stock has gained 11% in price. Evidently, the consensus has been brewing in the market that an impending U.S. dollar crisis is on the horizon. This has been dubbed a ""debt death spiral,"" and even, more ominously, ""the end of the current world order."" Amid a rising China and more general geopolitical uncertainty, many are beginning to look for asymmetric assets to provide returns in the case of widespread federal debt default. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is one of the most favored assets in the modern age. Gold ( GLD ), also, is gaining strong momentum. Strategy offers a unique high-beta leveraged Bitcoin exposure. In a world where the U.S. dollar collapsed amid the feared-of ""debt death spiral,"" Strategy stock would boom. Yet, a closer look at the macroeconomy and at the details of Strategy's investment case shows that this isn't a bet worth making. Instead, bet on continued U.S. leadership, a robust and strong macroeconomy evolving through robotics-enabled high GDP growth, and more peaceful relations with the U.S. and China leading to stabilized geopolitical conditions in the Western-led, but multipolar world order we are already firmly placed within. Strategy's Investment Case is Strong Even Without Calamity The good news is, that even under normal macroeconomic conditions, Bitcoin is positioned to continue to prosper. This means Strategy is positioned for success in a ""rain or shine"" macro environment. As of Q1 2025, Strategy held approximately 528,185 bitcoins on its balance sheet; this was acquired for about $35.6 billion in total. At the time of this writing, that stash is worth over $55 billion. Bitcoin trends in approximately four-year cycles, most typically catalyzed by ""halvings"" (where the reward that Bitcoin miners get is cut in half). As a result, it requires surgical discipline and evaluation of these cycles to attain strong trading returns. Alternatively, Bitcoin or Strategy stock can be bought at a low valuation and held unswervingly through all periods of volatility. Over 70 public companies across the globe now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a "" treasury standard. "" None of these tailwinds require hyperinflation or economic calamity. What makes Strategy clever is its capital-raising and Bitcoin-acquisition strategy. The company uses stock sales, convertible notes, and preferred equity offerings to expand its Bitcoin holdings. In Q4 2024 , the company issued over $15 billion in new equity, and in Q1 2025 it executed an At-The-Market stock offering worth $21 billion. With the proceeds, it bought hundreds of thousands of additional bitcoins. Critically, management has obtained favorable terms (like 0% coupon convertible notes) to minimize interest burden while maximizing treasury firepower. Even though the company continues to focus on Bitcoin, its enterprise software division remains operational. Whether this is a necessary component of the business anymore remains up for debate. There is certainly credence to the notion that Strategy should simply go ""all in"" on its Bitcoin strategy. Revenue from this segment is essentially flat to down, with total revenue of $463.5 million in Fiscal 2024 compared to $496.3 million in Fiscal 2023. However, the revenue-generating enterprise software division does provide cash flow for funding operating expenses, allowing the company to continue its long-term Bitcoin holding strategy without interruption from liquidation for expense reasons. A U.S. Dollar Collapse is Unlikely I believe it is important to put Strategy in perspective with current macroeconomic uncertainties. Most notably, the looming ""debt death spiral"" that figures like Dalio posed a couple of years ago as increasingly imminent amid the federal debt load and unmanageable interest payments. Dalio also warned that such destabilizing economic conditions often lead to reactive global conflicts amid a financial power vacuum. At this time, the dollar still accounts for approximately 60% of global foreign exchange reserves. China's renminbi isn't a realistic challenger because it's connected to insufficiently open financial markets. Although there is ongoing discussion among industry experts of weakness in the dollar, a lot of this appears to be narrative-based fear to me. A return to visible strength in the U.S. government and America's sustained military-security alliances continue to fortify the dollar-centric order. Given the deep structural factors that tie our world order together, a sudden collapse is highly unlikely. On the dark side of the equation is that U.S. public debt is widely projected to reach about 156% of GDP by 2055. That's up starkly from about 100% in 2025. However, AI, robotics, and automation in general are poised to significantly alleviate this burden. Goldman Sachs ( GS ) has forecasted that AI could boost U.S. productivity growth by about 1.5% annually over the next decade. Also, McKinsey has forecasted that AI and automation could raise GDP growth in developed economies by 1.5-3.4% annually over the next decade. I'm more bullish, viewing U.S. real GDP growth of 5% annually as a very conservative estimate for the end of the next 10 years. This could mean 7-8% nominal GDP growth, well above the around 4.5% average interest rate on federal debt. 2025 real GDP growth is likely to be about 1.5-2% . This outlook, although still uncertain, does significantly withdraw credibility from the thesis of an impending fiat collapse. That affects the long-term return thesis for Strategy, which would (unfortunately) thrive most under exacerbated negative macro-financial conditions. However, the dollar is not on the brink of hyperinflation or collapse. In fact, the dollar is still globally dominant and backed by a dynamic economy. U.S. debt is high and rising, but stronger geopolitical relations and significant (presently undervalued) productivity gains from robotics could prevent the kind of runaway inflation or currency crisis that Bitcoin maximalists invest in light of. In essence, the ""fiat endgame"" thesis for Strategy stock is unlikely. This is true not only because of secular advanced tech trends, but also because of Western political activism in the White House and abroad to strengthen the current world order. Strategy Stock Offers Short-term Momentum Before Cyclical Downside I am quite certain that Strategy will continue to perform very well over the long term and achieve strong (likely market-beating) returns, even from the present high valuation. Bitcoin has become a dominant store of value, and it is now benefiting from substantial sentiment-driven tailwinds due to broad global, institutional, and retail adoption. That said, the cyclical dynamics of Bitcoin need to be clearly acknowledged. Given we have only recently had the Bitcoin halving in April 2024 , and Strategy stock is close to all-time highs, it's prudent to be careful of an impending valuation down-cycle before the next major breakout to greater new highs some years later around the next halving. Due to these cyclical factors, I think it's best to avoid buying Strategy stock or Bitcoin at this time if you're a long-term holder. While there are short-term momentum factors at play that are bolstered by immediate geopolitical pressures and macro-fiscal concerns, I expect that come 2026 these will ease significantly. Bitcoin may rise to $550 in the near term, but this is essentially a short-term trade and should include a defensive take-profit target. Once interest rates are cut more substantially to allow a proper bull run in 2026 to unfold, the Bitcoin price will likely stabilize and then begin its periodic downturn in late H1 2026. My thesis is essentially hinged on the notion that short-term macroeconomic uncertainty will keep sentiment for Bitcoin elevated post-halving, but once more pronounced equity market bullishness sets in due to stabilized and persistently positive economic indicators and lower geopolitical pressure (cooling of Iran-Israel conflict, peace outlined in Ukraine, a more co-operative and gradually evolving China), Bitcoin will enter its next down-cycle. I am bullish on Strategy stock for now, but my Buy rating will become a Hold soon. Strategy 1-Week-Period Price Chart ( Author's Chart, Using Seeking Alpha) Holding Cash is the Best Strategy to Protect From All Tail Risks Instead of buying Strategy stock as a hedge against U.S. fiscal collapse, which is an unlikely scenario, I believe it more prudent to hold a cash position to protect from all tail risks. Holding a high number of Bitcoin or Bitcoin-connected assets like Strategy elevates portfolio volatility and can lead to prolonged periods of underperformance, especially if the asset is bought at an unfavorable valuation just before a cyclical downturn, like in the next nine months or so. Instead, the cash strategy is agile and allows for opportunistic value investing without being heavily depleted in certain macro environments. U.S. Treasuries remain the most prudent, and secure, way to hold cash right now. The U.S. is still strong, the dollar is still the global reserve currency, and robotics will likely significantly shift the current ""debt death spiral"" narrative. In other words, it's business as usual in my book, and the timeless value principles of Buffett remain true. Long-term holding, value investing, and a strong cash position; and ""never bet against America"". I understand the fear of the looming debt crisis, but we should not forget that with the right focus on AI, robotics, energy, and strong geopolitical relations (with allies and ""adversaries"" alike), the U.S. can continue to lead and stabilize the present world order, even if it is multipolar. In such an environment, Strategy stock works as a high-beta, periodic high-alpha investment that should be bought at low valuations (like in 2023) and sold near peaks (like in the next nine months). Alternatively, you could take Strategy's approach and hold Bitcoin or Strategy stock itself through all volatility, but expect significant periods of decline and you must ensure you buy during periods of low sentiment, not high. The risk that Bitcoin will lose positive sentiment traction over the long term appears very unlikely to me. Volatility should be expected, but other than risks with Strategy's management not executing well-timed buys of the cryptocurrency, Strategy stock is actually a low-risk investment based on my analysis. Conclusion: Moderate Buy I do admire what Strategy has done. Not only is the investment model working (and quite simple in actuality), but it is also brave. Management will have to watch its equity value go through many periods of immense volatility, and as such, there will be moments where the company will be a market star and others where its light periodically fades. Even so, the long-term Bitcoin narrative is not going away, and sentiment for the cryptocurrency appears both robust and enduring to me. In light of this, and the dynamics of halving events, there's reason to be long-term bullish on Strategy, but just watch for the impending downturn in the next year or so.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-16 09:39:03

Despite weak user growth and competition, XYZ's core businesses show resilience, with steady per-user engagement and strong brand stickiness in SMBs. Operating margins are improving, and the balance sheet is healthy, despite high stock-based compensation and Bitcoin-driven revenue volatility. Significant crypto exposure adds risk but also hidden upside; if sentiment turns, Block's multi-narrative model could unlock asymmetric long-term gains. Since the tariff selloff, Block ( XYZ ) has not meaningfully recovered along with the wider market bounce back. Valuations are looking reasonable to initiate a contra buy! The core thesis is that while the valuations are discounted structurally on real weakness in both consumer and SMB segments, the markets have priced much of the downside and hidden optionality could now provide long-term upside potential. In a highly disruptor-friendly and competitive space, Block is facing near-term headwinds and does not seem to have the right narratives that are likely to be rewarded right now. It does not seem to be quite the defensive you are looking for to ride the macro headwinds, nor the innovation-friendly positioning that is drawing risk capital. But that is exactly what opens up a contrarian window - the multi-narrative model of crypto fintech, consumer app, banking solution as well as a PoS may seem divergent now, but offers deep embedded optionality. Core Weaknesses With Hidden Optionality Poor growth in the Cash App active user base has been plaguing Block well before the recent tariff uncertainties and consumer spending headwinds - there is nothing new about a stagnating user base. In fact, there are green shoots being ignored by the markets. The historical financials data from Block show a steady inflow per user growth though (8% YoY in Q1 2025) suggesting underlying engagement is holding up. There are limitations to scaling monetization due to a customer base with lower income levels, but this is also a segment with room for digital financial inclusion, a longer-term structural theme to which Block remains exposed. The revenue stream is still heavily bitcoin reliant, which adds volatility to earnings, but also offers optionality if crypto sentiment stabilizes. Newer forays like Afterpay and micro lending are yet to show topline support, but the optionality of new offerings is still very much in play, particularly as the ecosystem matures. Active User Growth Cash App - XYZ (Image created by author using data from XYZ Financials) Block's Square merchant business is witnessing rising competition from platforms like Toast, Stripe, and Shopify. All three peers are targeting small and medium-sized businesses with payment processing and associated services (core areas where Square previously held a clear lead). While not identical in terms of the business segments they serve, all of them overlap with Square's target segments. This competitive pressure is real, but so is Block's brand equity and product stickiness in its core SMB user base. Block's concentrated exposure to small businesses does make it vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks like tariffs and cuts in consumer discretionary spend. But the valuations seem to have baked those headwinds in, investors willing to ride out the temporary drags will likely see eventual easing in consumer stress rerating Block quickly. Operating Margins Improving, but SBC Remains a Drag A key drag on margins is persistently high stock-based compensation, accounting for ~15% of gross profits. All is not gloom and doom, though. The operating margin is showing improved numbers in the past few years, supporting leverage in XYZ's business model as it scales. Block's balance sheet remains healthy, with sufficient liquidity to weather short-term volatility. Data by YCharts Data by YCharts Data by YCharts Valuation Bottom Forming? Block's current valuation looks reasonably cheap on a metric like EV/Revenue. Although significant revenue comes in from Bitcoins, the contribution has been relatively stable throughout. While the EV/Revenue ratio in isolation may look more discounted than it is due to the Bitcoin revenues, its steep discount relative to its own history is still valid. The market appears to be assigning a structural discount to reflect concerns around user monetization cap and competition in both consumer and merchant ecosystems. Short term macro headwinds make the story unfavorable to deserve a rerating soon, but the discounted valuations look like having priced in much of the downside already. Contra buys now could gain asymmetrically if there is a narrative change or even minor investor confidence comes back on better than anticipated growth. Data by YCharts The P/Gross Profit Ratio underlines the multi-year valuation discount even better. Recent corrections have brought the P/GP ratio down from 6.3x to ~4x, near the trough of all-time lows. P/GP ratio - XYZ (Image generated by author using data from Seeking Alpha and XYZ Financial Files) The Bitcoin Distraction Comes With Optionality Block has an outsized exposure to crypto, particularly Bitcoin. Trades through Cash App are recorded fully as revenue but with minimal contribution to gross profit. In Q1 2025, Bitcoin revenue was again a dominant share of total reported topline (in the typical range of ~40%), yet contributed ~2% in gross profit on revenues generated from Bitcoin. However, it takes getting used to the structure to see the hidden optionality beneath. Beyond trading platforms in the Cash App, Block has further crypto ambitions, including its self custody wallet (Bitkey) and open-source platform (TBD). Although these remain early-stage and non monetized. That along with a decentralized finance (DeFi) focus for the future opens up optionality. I think the crypto narrative is a double-edged sword and particularly concerning when we look at peer fintechs like PayPal downsizing their crypto bets, shifting focus back to core payments and engagement. However, if the crypto cycle turns decisively bullish, Block stands to gain from its contra positioning. Contra Buy on Valuation Alone Block isn't an obvious buy in today's market, but that's the point. While narratives are divergent and risks real, the stock is trading as if none of its embedded optionality matters. With valuations trading at multi-year low, particularly after the tariff sell-off, this feels like a setup where even small tailwinds on macro, crypto or product could reprice the story quickly. For those willing to be early and patient, the contrarian reward risk looks compelling for a Buy.",XYZ,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-16 09:39:38

According to Huang, AI should not be controlled by a few global corporations or rely solely on data from foreign societies. Instead, he believes nations should own the technologies that drive their economies and ensure the benefits directly serve their people. On a glitzy European tour last week, Huang stopped in London, Paris, and Berlin. He held meetings with government officials, tech leaders, and the media in his bid to promote a more robust AI infrastructure on the continent. The time could not be better for Huang. As US tech companies tighten their grip on the biggest markets for smartphones, search engines, and social media, Europe’s shift marks a strategic change. Now, the policy of digital sovereignty, building and overseeing AI systems locally, is being echoed in the highest positions of politics. Meanwhile, newly appointed Prime Minister Keir Starmer unveiled a £1 billion (approximately $1.35 billion) investment to increase national computing capacity in the UK. But he underlined the importance of Britain being a creator of the advances in AI rather than a passive consumer. President Emmanuel Macron, at the VivaTech conference in France, declared that AI infrastructure represented “our fight for sovereignty.” His comments drew strong applause from the audience of global tech leaders and innovators in a reflection of the rising momentum for local AI creation. New tech deals shape Europe’s digital future Nvidia is backing its vision with real action, not just words. The company has partnered with Deutsche Telekom in Germany to build a large-scale AI cloud platform to provide European businesses with advanced computing power—independent of US cloud giants like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. The German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the project and associated it with national security and economic independence. He emphasized that Germany must master important digital technologies like AI to remain prosperous. In France, Nvidia has partnered with Mistral, a rapidly rising AI startup, to build a data center that provides a homegrown alternative to foreign cloud infrastructure. The initial phase will run on 18,000 of Nvidia’s latest AI chips, with plans to expand across multiple locations by 2026. The vision is also gaining traction at the EU level. In February, the European Commission announced a $20 billion initiative to establish four “AI gigafactories” across the continent. Despite boasting a rich pool of talent and success in research, Europe has long trailed the US and China in the push to develop and deploy large-scale AI systems. The lack of a computing base at home is a big part of the explanation. American firms currently dominate Europe’s cloud services. Only a few homegrown AI startups, such as Mistral in France and Aleph Alpha in Germany, are trying to compete globally. Huang’s call for a sovereign AI, once dismissed as a naïve or utopian goal, is now informing actual policy. It’s pushing Europe to move beyond regulating and start constructing.

Ever wondered if it’s a good time to buy Bitcoin, or if altcoins are about to explode? Understanding the different phases of the crypto market can be a game-changer. One popular tool that helps gauge this is the Altcoin Season Index . As of June 16, 2024, the Altcoin Season Index , tracked by CoinMarketCap, registered a reading of 25. This specific number isn’t just a random data point; it signals a particular phase in the market cycle: we are currently in what’s known as Bitcoin Season . Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 25 Mean? So, what exactly is the Altcoin Season Index , and why should you care that it’s sitting at 25? This index is a simple yet insightful metric designed to tell us whether the broader market is favoring Bitcoin or the myriad of other cryptocurrencies, collectively known as altcoins. Here’s the breakdown: The index looks at the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization over the past 90 days. Crucially, it excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to give a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. It compares how these top 100 altcoins have performed relative to Bitcoin during that 90-day window. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. The thresholds are key to interpreting the score: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index would typically be 75 or higher. This is the period where many altcoins see significant gains, often outpacing Bitcoin’s growth. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index would typically be 25 or lower. This is the period where Bitcoin tends to perform relatively better than most altcoins, or altcoins might even be losing value while Bitcoin holds steady or gains. Neither (Transition Period): A score between 25 and 75 suggests a transitional period where there isn’t a clear dominance of either Bitcoin or altcoins across the board. Performance might be mixed. With the index currently at 25, it firmly places the market in Bitcoin Season . This indicates that over the past three months, a significant majority of the top 100 altcoins have underperformed compared to Bitcoin. Navigating the Market: What is Bitcoin Season Like? Being in Bitcoin Season means that, on average, your altcoin portfolio is likely struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. This phase is characterized by several potential dynamics: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s market capitalization makes up a larger percentage of the total crypto market cap. Investors might be rotating capital into Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer or more stable asset compared to riskier altcoins. Accumulation Phase: For some investors, Bitcoin Season can be seen as an accumulation phase for altcoins. Prices may be depressed relative to Bitcoin, offering potential entry points if you believe in the long-term prospects of specific altcoin projects. Lower Risk Appetite: Often, Bitcoin Season coincides with periods of uncertainty in the broader financial markets or specific FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) within the crypto space. Investors tend to flock to Bitcoin, perceived as the ‘blue chip’ or less volatile asset compared to the vast landscape of altcoins. Capital Flow: Capital tends to flow into Bitcoin first during market uptrends, or it retreats into Bitcoin during downtrends before potentially flowing back into altcoins. Understanding this phase is crucial for setting realistic expectations for your portfolio and making informed decisions based on current crypto trends . The Flip Side: What Triggers Altcoin Season? While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , the market is cyclical, and the shift to Altcoin Season is what many investors eagerly anticipate. So, what typically needs to happen for the index to climb towards that 75+ mark? Altcoin Season often kicks off after a significant move or period of consolidation in Bitcoin’s price. Here are some common triggers: Bitcoin Price Stability or Consolidation: Once Bitcoin has made a large move (up or down) and enters a period of relative stability or trades sideways, investors might start looking for higher returns elsewhere. Increased Risk Appetite: Improved macroeconomic conditions, positive regulatory news, or growing confidence in the crypto space can increase investor appetite for riskier assets like altcoins. Capital Rotation: Profits made from Bitcoin’s run are often rotated into promising altcoin projects, especially those with strong fundamentals, upcoming developments (like mainnet launches, significant partnerships), or compelling narratives (like DeFi, NFTs, AI, Layer 2 solutions). Specific Altcoin Narratives Gain Traction: Sometimes, a strong performance in a few key altcoin sectors or individual projects can start pulling the index higher as capital flows into those areas. During Altcoin Season , it’s common to see many altcoins post gains of 50%, 100%, or even significantly more in relatively short periods, while Bitcoin’s gains might be more modest in comparison. This is where the potential for exponential returns lies, but also where risk is significantly higher. Historical Context: Looking Back at Past Crypto Trends The concept of Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season isn’t new; it’s a pattern observed across multiple market cycles. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, looking at historical crypto trends can provide valuable perspective. Major bull markets often start with a strong run in Bitcoin, followed by capital flowing into large-cap altcoins, and finally into smaller, more speculative altcoins. Bear markets or periods of uncertainty typically see capital flow back into Bitcoin or out of the market entirely, leading to extended periods of Bitcoin Season or general market downturns where everything struggles. For example, late 2017 and early 2018 saw a massive Altcoin Season following Bitcoin’s parabolic rise. Similarly, parts of 2020 and early 2021 featured strong altcoin runs after Bitcoin broke previous all-time highs. Conversely, the bear market of 2018 and much of 2022 were largely periods of Bitcoin Season or general market decline. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Consider During Bitcoin Season? The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 25, signaling Bitcoin Season , provides context for investors. It doesn’t dictate strategy, but it informs it. Here are some potential considerations: Focus on Bitcoin: If you believe Bitcoin will continue to outperform, this phase supports a strategy heavily weighted towards BTC. Strategic Altcoin Accumulation: For those bullish on altcoins, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate specific altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin. Research is paramount here; focus on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Risk Management: During Bitcoin Season , altcoins are generally more volatile and susceptible to larger percentage drops than Bitcoin. This is a time to be extra cautious with position sizing and stop-loss orders. Portfolio Rebalancing: If your portfolio became heavily skewed towards altcoins during the last run, Bitcoin Season might be a signal to rebalance and increase your Bitcoin holdings. Research and Education: Use this period to deep dive into potential altcoin investments for the next cycle. Understand the technology, team, tokenomics, and community of projects you are interested in. Remember, the index is a lagging indicator (based on the last 90 days). It tells you where we’ve been, which helps understand where we are, but it doesn’t predict the future with certainty. Challenges and Limitations of the Index While a useful tool for understanding broad crypto trends , the Altcoin Season Index has limitations: Top 100 Bias: It only considers the top 100 coins. Performance of smaller cap altcoins isn’t included, and these can sometimes have their own micro-seasons. 90-Day Window: The 90-day lookback period is somewhat arbitrary. Market dynamics can shift faster or slower than this window captures perfectly. Exclusions: While excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens makes sense for measuring speculative performance, it still leaves out a significant portion of the overall crypto market value and activity. Correlation vs. Causation: The index shows correlation in performance but doesn’t explain *why* it’s happening. The underlying reasons for Bitcoin Season (macro, sentiment, etc.) are more complex. Therefore, the index should be used as one tool among many when analyzing the market, not as the sole determinant of your investment strategy. Connecting the Index to the Current Crypto Market Landscape The current Bitcoin Season indicated by the index reading of 25 aligns with several observable factors in the broader crypto market . We’ve seen periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, shifts in inflation expectations, and varying levels of institutional inflow into Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin has shown relative resilience compared to many altcoins, which have faced headwinds, including regulatory scrutiny on some projects and a general cooling off of speculative fervor after previous rallies. This environment naturally favors Bitcoin as investors potentially de-risk or consolidate positions in the market leader. The index simply provides a quantifiable measure of this trend over the recent past. What Could Signal a Shift Away from Bitcoin Season? For the Altcoin Season Index to start climbing back towards ‘Neither’ or even ‘Altcoin Season’, we would likely need to see a sustained period where altcoins begin to consistently outperform Bitcoin. This could be driven by: A strong, convincing breakout in Bitcoin’s price followed by consolidation. Positive macroeconomic shifts that increase overall risk appetite. Major positive developments within specific altcoin ecosystems (e.g., successful network upgrades, significant adoption news). A general increase in trading volume and liquidity across the altcoin market. Monitoring these factors, alongside the index itself, can help investors anticipate potential shifts in crypto trends .

In a concise message, BarriC stated, “$XRP $2 to $1,000 will happen a lot sooner than people realise.” The assertion reinforces a dramatic forecast about the future price appreciation of XRP , a digital asset that continues to divide opinion among retail investors, analysts, and critics. Although no specific timeframe or methodology was provided in the tweet, the suggestion that XRP could experience such exponential growth in the near term drew a wide range of responses, particularly from within the XRP community . $XRP $2 to $1,000 will happen a lot sooner than people realise — BarriC (@B_arri_C) June 13, 2025 Contrasting Opinions From Supporters and Critics Shortly after BarriC’s post, various XRP community members reacted to the statement, expressing both support for and skepticism of the prediction. One user, XRPAMAHC, acknowledged their support for the asset but raised concerns about the feasibility of the $1,000 price point. “Big fan of XRP, but how $1000? gives me ur logic explanation,” they wrote. They added that if XRP were to reach the market capitalization of Bitcoin, a price around $35 per token would be more realistic, describing the $1,000 valuation as a “unicorn dream.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another community member, James Rejoin, responded with sarcasm, suggesting that such a price milestone would take many decades to materialize. He remarked, “Yes. It will happen in 100 years rather than 150. So that’s good news,” expressing doubt regarding the timeframe implied in BarriC’s original comment. Meanwhile, Robert Smith responded more directly and with strong opposition. He said he has “been seeing and hearing this since XRP came about, and it hasn’t gotten anywhere near it.” He further stated that “If it does hit 1k it will be in 100+ years from now.” Smith’s remarks reflect the long-standing frustration among segments of the community that have observed XRP’s historical performance fail to meet such bullish targets. No Supporting Data Provided BarriC’s tweet did not provide a breakdown of the economic model, utility projections, or supply-demand dynamics that might substantiate the predicted price range. This absence of data has led observers to view the statement as speculative. Without referencing institutional adoption metrics, on-chain analytics, or macroeconomic catalysts, the projection stands as a bold expression of belief rather than a supported forecast.

While the Pi Core Team introduced a new app to manage domain bids, with features like stats tracking and email alerts, many in the community feel this isn’t the major progress they were waiting for, especially ahead of Pi2Day 2025 . No Major Update? Pioneers, who support and use the Pi Network, had hoped for stronger announcements that could help the Pi token gain real value . Instead, many see this domain auction update as underwhelming and out of touch with what users actually want. However, Pi network failed to impress the crypto community, and now they doubt Pi’s future, which seems bleak and dark. Users also see a severe bloodbath in Pi price if they don’t come up with new announcements. If the Pi2Day announcement consists only of Pi domains and there is no further major news on #Pi2Day , a very dark cloud will arise over Pi Network. Pi domains are not a bad thing, but it would be very bad if it stayed with this outdated announcement. Just give us the smart… — Pi Network News Global 𝛑 (@PiNewsGlobal) June 15, 2025 Auction Sees Low Interest Amid Price Crash Since the auction began three months ago, around 3 million PI tokens (worth $1.8 million) have been spent on domain bids, according to Piscan . But this is small compared to Pi’s daily trading volume of over $100 million. The update hasn’t done much to boost interest or price. Pi is now trading at around $0.60, down 35% in the last week and 60% for the month. Early hopes that businesses would rush to buy branded .pi domains have faded. Even Pi’s founder Nicolas Kokkalis once compared them to regular internet domains, but that excitement hasn’t shown up in real numbers. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Can Pi Network Price Hit $100? , Calls for Real Updates Grow Louder Users are now demanding more meaningful progress.

Over 248 million PI tokens will unlock next month, which could lead to even more selling.

46128699,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=169290,1750067452,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46128699.jpeg,Metaplanet Bitcoin: Japanese Firm Announces Massive $210M Bond Issue for More BTC,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/metaplanet-bitcoin-bond-issue/,"BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Bitcoin: Japanese Firm Announces Massive $210M Bond Issue for More BTC Big news from the Land of the Rising Sun! Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy is taking a significant leap forward. The publicly listed Japanese Firm Bitcoin investor, Metaplanet, recently made waves with an announcement on X (formerly Twitter). Their board has given the green light to issue a substantial $210 million (35 billion Japanese Yen) in 0% ordinary bonds. The clear purpose? To fuel further purchases of the world’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC). This move isn’t just another corporate transaction; it signals a growing trend of companies looking to integrate Bitcoin into their long-term financial strategy, particularly in the Asian market. Metaplanet has been increasingly vocal about its pro-Bitcoin stance, positioning itself as a ‘Bitcoin company’ similar to how MicroStrategy has in the West. This latest action solidifies that commitment in a major way. What Does This Metaplanet Bitcoin Bond Issuance Mean? Let’s break down the key aspects of Metaplanet’s decision to issue $210 million in bonds specifically for buying Bitcoin: Significant Capital Injection: $210 million is a considerable amount, especially for a company like Metaplanet. This isn’t a small, speculative bet; it’s a strategic allocation of significant capital towards Bitcoin. 0% Interest Bonds: Issuing bonds at 0% interest is noteworthy. It suggests favorable market conditions for Metaplanet to raise funds and potentially indicates investor confidence in the company’s overall strategy, including its Bitcoin holdings, or perhaps specific terms related to the bond structure itself (though the announcement is brief). Directly for BTC Purchases: The stated purpose is unambiguous – the funds are earmarked for acquiring more Bitcoin. This transparency is crucial for investors and the market to understand the company’s financial direction. Expanding the Bitcoin Treasury: This issuance will dramatically increase Metaplanet’s existing Bitcoin Treasury holdings, further cementing its position as a public company with a significant portion of its balance sheet in BTC. This action mirrors the strategy pioneered by companies like MicroStrategy, which has used various financing methods, including debt and equity, to accumulate a large amount of Bitcoin. Metaplanet appears to be adopting a similar playbook tailored to the Japanese market. Why Are Companies Like Metaplanet Investing in Institutional Bitcoin? The trend of publicly traded companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, often referred to as Institutional Bitcoin adoption, is driven by several factors: Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against currency debasement and inflation, especially in an era of expansive monetary policies globally. Store of Value: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature are seen by proponents as characteristics that make it a superior long-term store of value compared to traditional assets or fiat currencies. Potential Appreciation: The hope for significant price appreciation remains a primary driver, offering the potential for substantial returns on corporate treasury funds that might otherwise yield little in low-interest environments. Attracting Investment: For some companies, adopting a Bitcoin strategy can attract a new class of investors interested in exposure to the digital asset space through traditional equity markets. Challenges and Risks: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which can introduce significant fluctuations in a company’s reported earnings and balance sheet value. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential risks regarding future restrictions, taxation, or legal challenges. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and vary by jurisdiction, sometimes requiring impairments that negatively impact financial statements even if the market price recovers later. Public Perception: While growing, institutional adoption of Bitcoin is still relatively new, and some traditional investors or stakeholders may view it as a risky or speculative corporate strategy. Metaplanet and Japan Bitcoin Adoption: A Growing Trend? Metaplanet’s aggressive move highlights the increasing interest in Japan Bitcoin adoption among corporations. While Japan has a well-established cryptocurrency trading market, corporate treasury adoption has been slower compared to North America. Metaplanet is positioning itself at the forefront of this trend in the Japanese market. This could potentially serve as an example for other Japanese Firm Bitcoin curious entities. As more companies see Metaplanet successfully navigate holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet, it might reduce the perceived risk for others considering a similar strategy. Japan’s supportive stance on Web3 and digital innovation could also create a more favorable environment for such corporate strategies in the future. Actionable Insights from Metaplanet’s Move What can investors and market watchers take away from Metaplanet’s significant bond issuance for Bitcoin?

Layer-2 chains were supposed to be the next evolution of blockchain scalability, and in some ways, they delivered. They made transactions faster and cheaper, helped projects scale rapidly, and gave Ethereum ( ETH ) room to breathe amid a surge in network activity. But as the dust settles, one uncomfortable truth has become hard to ignore: L2s don’t retain the value they generate. Instead, they leak it back to the parent chain, back to the liquidity hubs, and back to governance structures that were never really theirs to begin with. You might also like: Math meets humanity where web3 needs it most | Opinion This might not have been a problem in 2021, when projects raced to achieve speed and scale above all else. But we’re in a different cycle now, and the number of projects competing for users has increased exponentially. Projects now have to think long-term. They’re optimizing for sustainability, sovereignty, and alignment. And increasingly, they’re turning to app-specific “appchain” layer 1s—not as a novelty, but as a necessity. L2s: Fast, cheap—and economically hollow Let’s call it like it is: L2s are downstream environments. They inherit security, settle transactions, and rely on Ethereum (or another L1) to finalize everything that matters. That dependency has economic consequences. Every time a transaction is processed on an L2, it eventually gets rolled up and settled on the L1. The result? Fees flow back to Ethereum. Data availability fees flow back to Ethereum. MEV value—also upstream. It’s a one-way transfer of value, from the L2’s economy back to the L1 that secures it. If you’re building a project on an L2, you’re not compounding value in your own ecosystem—you’re subsidizing someone else’s. While these charges may seem trivial—after all, they’re just a tiny percent of the network’s revenue—they add up quickly, endlessly sapping away liquidity. For any project trying to scale, these persistent overheads can seriously limit growth and long-term sustainability. While these fees may appear minor—just a small fraction of overall revenue—they accumulate fast, quietly draining liquidity from the ecosystem. Over time, costs from the data availability and restaking layers become substantial. For any project approaching scale, these persistent overheads can seriously limit growth and long-term sustainability. And it doesn’t stop with fees. Liquidity and governance are also rooted in the parent chain. Most DeFi protocols still rely on liquidity pools and bridges based on the Ethereum mainnet. Token holders often stake or vote using systems built upstream. Even when L2s have their own tokens, they’re often structurally tied to Ethereum’s economic and political dynamics. Put differently: L2s give you speed, but they take away your independence and slowly drain your token economy of resources. Appchain L1s: Keeping the value you create Appchains, in contrast, are built to retain the value they generate. When you launch your own sovereign chain, you’re not settling elsewhere. You’re not leaking fees or depending on another network’s validator set. The economic activity you generate—transaction fees, staking rewards, MEV, governance power—it all stays local. That creates a fundamentally different growth model. Instead of value flowing out of your ecosystem, it compounds internally. Your token captures more utility. Your community has a direct stake in your chain’s success. Your infrastructure becomes an engine for growth, not a cost center feeding another chain’s economy. You also get full-stack control, no longer bound by a parent chain’s limitations. Want to set custom validator incentives? Go for it. Want to experiment with gasless transactions or dynamic tokenomics? Do it. L1s let you build infrastructure that matches your application’s needs, not the other way around. But what about fragmentation? For years, the biggest knock against appchains was that they’d create isolated ecosystems. That criticism used to hold weight, but not anymore. Thanks to interoperability solutions like LayerZero, Avalanche Warp Messaging, and IBC, we now have reliable ways to move data and assets across chains. Appchains can plug into broader ecosystems while still keeping their sovereignty. They can be both connected and independent—no longer forced to choose between integration and control. The fragmentation argument is outdated. In practice, appchains are becoming a natural extension of the multichain world, and the tooling around them is improving fast. The market is catching on More and more projects are choosing to go the appchain route, and the trend will continue to gain steam. Builders want autonomy, they want economic sustainability, and they want the freedom to design their infrastructure around their users, not around Ethereum’s bottlenecks. That’s not to say L2s are going away. For many early-stage projects, they’re a decent starting point. But they’re not built for scale. They’re not designed to retain value. And they’re definitely not built for projects that want sovereignty over their infrastructure and their economy. If you’re trying to build something enduring—something that’s not just fast and cheap, but aligned, sovereign, and sustainable—you shouldn’t be settling for a Layer 2. You should be thinking like an ecosystem manager. You should be owning your stack. You should commit to building a chain that meets your own custom needs, without siphoning resources. Spinning up an L2 may seem like the simplest go-to-market strategy, offloading responsibilities so you can get to market faster, but investing in L1 infrastructure is a crucial step to long-term success. Before long, every project will be racing to build its own appchain.

With a stunning 13,200% ROI forecast for 2025, analysts are hailing this AI-driven blockchain project as one of the top tokens investors should watch. Combining real-world utility, a structured growth roadmap, and focus on transparency, Ruvi AI is making waves as both a secure and highly lucrative option. Why Analysts Predict a 13,200% ROI Ruvi AI’s rise to prominence is grounded in its ability to blend artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology to address practical, scalable applications. This innovation goes beyond what many traditional assets or speculative cryptocurrencies can offer, giving Ruvi AI a solid foundation for sustained growth. At its current Phase 2 presale price of $0.015 per token , Ruvi AI offers an accessible entry point, especially for early adopters. The token’s built-in price progression takes it to $0.07 after the presale , guaranteeing 50% immediate returns for presale investors. Analysts predict Ruvi AI could soar to $1 post-listing , translating to 13,200% growth by the end of 2025 for those investing now, while showcasing its potential to disrupt the crypto space. Record-Breaking Presale Performance Ruvi AI’s presale success underlines its appeal. The project has already raised over $1.7 million and sold more than 150 million tokens , signaling strong investor confidence. What separates Ruvi AI from less reliable projects is its consistent price trajectory . Unlike speculative tokens prone to sudden drops, Ruvi AI’s increase to $0.07 post-presale is part of its pre-designed roadmap. This structural growth not only assures investors of near-term gains but also sets the stage for significant long-term success as it edges closer to its projected $1 valuation . Maximize Returns With Ruvi AI’s VIP Tiers Ruvi AI rewards its early adopters further with VIP investment tiers , which provide substantial bonus allocations to amplify returns. Here’s a clear breakdown of the return structures: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers offer a chance for investors to secure six-figure returns before the token even hits public trading platforms. Building Trust With Security and Transparency Investor trust is paramount, and Ruvi AI is raising the bar through its dedication to transparency and safety . The platform is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a top blockchain security firm, to ensure its technical infrastructure is robust and reliable. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange guarantees liquidity after its presale concludes. Trading on a globally recognized platform like WEEX ensures token holders can access a seamless, reliable marketplace post-listing. Such collaborations amplify Ruvi AI’s credibility and reliability among its growing investor base. Real-World Applications Ensure Long-Term Potential Ruvi AI’s strength lies in its ability to address pressing challenges across diverse industries. Its integration of AI and blockchain delivers value in sectors including: Marketing Businesses leverage Ruvi AI’s AI-powered tools for better customer targeting, optimized ad campaigns, and enhanced engagement metrics. Entertainment The platform elevates consumer experiences via personalized content suggestions and blockchain-powered secure payments, benefiting both users and content creators. Finance Ruvi AI emerges as a game-changer by refining fraud detection processes, increasing operational transparency, and streamlining efficiency in financial operations. These scalable, practical solutions highlight Ruvi AI’s role in driving lasting demand for its tokens, cementing its place in a competitive market. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out as 2025’s Top Pick Analysts’ predictions of a 13,200% ROI stem from Ruvi AI’s ability to offer investment security alongside massive potential returns. Its strategic design, which includes a presale price of $0.015 , a guaranteed rise to $0.07 , and a forecasted $1 valuation , creates the perfect blend of stability and opportunity. Backed by a CyberScope audit , a WEEX Exchange partnership , and revolutionary integrations of AI and blockchain, Ruvi AI is establishing itself as one of 2025’s best crypto investments.

Solana (SOL) Investors Are Pivoting Toward This Lending Protocol,https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-to-watch-this-2025-summer-solana-sol-investors/,"As the crypto market gears up for another high-energy summer, a shift is beginning to form among seasoned Solana (SOL) investors. Known for favoring speed, scalability, and low fees, many of these investors are now pivoting toward decentralized finance protocols that aim to do more than just offer fast transactions—they’re looking for platforms that unlock sustainable earning power. And as the summer heat builds, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is appearing on more watchlists than ever before. With over $10.60 million raised in its presale so far and more than 12,200 holders already participating and growing with an ongoing $100K giveaway , Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to become a standout name in 2025’s DeFi ecosystem. The Solana (SOL) Crowd Is Watching More Than Speed Solana (SOL) has long held its reputation as the go-to chain for high-speed traders and NFT activity. But as the market matures, even its loyal investors are expanding their portfolios toward protocols with deeper DeFi capabilities. This summer, lending-based income strategies are gaining traction again—particularly among those who want greater control, transparency, and real yield without depending on token inflation. This is exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to shine. The project is preparing to offer both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models, giving users the flexibility to earn interest through pooled liquidity or through direct loans with customized terms. Unlike traditional staking models or inflation-driven rewards, this earning system is set to be fueled by actual borrower demand within the protocol itself. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will aim to solve one of the most persistent problems in DeFi: reward inflation. Many existing platforms flood the market with tokens as rewards, leading to price suppression and unsustainable yield cycles. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will focus on rewarding users through mechanisms based on borrower-driven interest, which is directly tied to the utilization of its liquidity pools. In the P2C model, users will deposit assets such as USDC, USDT, ETH, BTC, SOL, or AVAX into shared liquidity pools and earn interest that adjusts dynamically. The higher the demand for borrowing, the higher the annual percentage yield (APY) will become. For users looking for more flexibility and higher earning potential, the P2P model will allow direct lending to other users—with custom terms for assets that are often excluded from centralized platforms, including tokens like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB. Why SOL Investors Are Turning to MUTM Solana (SOL) doesn’t offer native lending mechanics or real yield through borrower demand. While the network provides transaction speed, investors who want to earn from capital deployment and maintain liquidity while doing so will need to look elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), through its mtTokens, will provide precisely this functionality. When a user deposits crypto assets into Mutuum’s smart contracts, they will receive mtTokens representing their deposit plus accrued interest. These mtTokens are expected to appreciate over time, offering both on-chain liquidity and earning power without the need to lock assets permanently. This is a level of fluidity and utility that native Solana (SOL) staking does not currently provide. According to the team’s roadmap, a beta version of the platform is planned to go live around the time of token launch. This milestone will provide early access to the protocol’s lending and borrowing mechanics, giving users the chance to experience both the P2P and P2C earning models firsthand. With over 4 billion MUTM tokens as total supply and Phase 5 of the presale currently live at $0.03, entry into the ecosystem remains accessible. Each phase has been gradually increasing in token price, with Phase 6 expected to follow at $0.035. This phased model, combined with rapid holder growth, continues to drive new attention toward the project during the critical summer investment season. Passive Income with Long-Term Rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will not only reward lenders with interest but also plans to deliver passive dividends to long-term participants. A portion of the protocol’s revenue will be used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. By combining real usage-based income with platform-level buybacks, the protocol is expected to create a sustainable incentive loop for users. Security is always a top concern in DeFi, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already taken significant steps in this area. The project underwent a CertiK audit involving static analysis and manual review. As of the latest revision on May 20, 2025, the token’s scan score stands at 80.00, underscoring the team’s commitment to secure contract deployment before launch. To further strengthen its technical edge, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built with Layer-2 scaling integration. This infrastructure choice is designed to improve transaction speeds and reduce gas costs, tackling the high-fee, slow-confirmation issues that still plague some DeFi environments. Stablecoin Innovation On the Horizon Another feature being developed within the Mutuum ecosystem is its overcollateralized decentralized stablecoin. Backed entirely by assets already held within the protocol, this stablecoin will be minted from on-chain collateral, not fiat. It will allow borrowers to access more reliable debt instruments while simultaneously boosting protocol revenue, as interest payments will feed directly back into the ecosystem. This 2025 summer cycle is poised to highlight projects that combine decentralization, utility, and income generation in one place. As more Solana (SOL) investors seek out new earning opportunities, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly capturing their attention for its dual lending models, tokenized earnings via mtTokens, and fast-growing holder base.

The parties discussed the potential use of Bitcoin as part of the national reserve and the development of crypto policy frameworks. Saqib urged Pakistan to consider Saylor’s example of turning Strategy into a Bitcoin-buying vehicle. He believes that if private individuals can build that in the U.S., Pakistan, with the talent, story, and energy, can do the same. Pakistan advances its crypto pivot strategy Michael Saylor talked with 🇵🇰 Pakistan’s Finance Minister and State Minister for Crypto, Bilal, about #Bitcoin . An interesting move, especially since Bitcoin is still not recognised as legal tender in Pakistan. pic.twitter.com/v99XuQUvNs — Zia ul Haque (@ImZiaulHaque) June 16, 2025 Pakistan has greatly advanced in supporting its crypto pivot after Strategy’s executive chair, Michael Saylor, met with the country’s officials to laud its crypto efforts. During a meeting on Sunday with Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Minister of Blockchain and Crypto Affairs Bilal Bin Saqib, Saylor discussed how Bitcoin can function in a state reserve and the country’s planned crypto policies. In a video posted on June 15 by a Finance Ministry official, Saylor told the duo that Pakistan has many brilliant people and many individuals who do business with the country. He also used his Bitcoin-buying company as an example of how the country can show intellectual leadership. According to Bitbo, Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has the largest Bitcoin holdings among public companies, with 582,000 BTC worth over $61 billion. The crypto company has sold billions of dollars worth of debt and shares to fund its BTC purchases, and its share price has soared over 3,000% since its first buy in mid-2020. “Bitcoin is the strongest asset for long-term national resilience. Emerging markets like Pakistan have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to leapfrog into the future of finance.” -Michael Saylor, Former CEO and Co-founder of Strategy. Saqib noted that the country has shifted to become more crypto-friendly, with the government setting up a crypto authority last month to regulate the sector. Pakistan’s Minister of Blockchain and Crypto Affairs also acknowledged that the country will create a Bitcoin reserve. Saylor told Saqib and Aurangzeb that the markets gave him billions of dollars because they trusted his company. He also argued that intellectual leadership was the most important thing that bolsters trust in people. The American billionaire added that when the market decides who is leading in a particular area, they stand behind the leader and invest with them, which he believes they’ll do for Pakistan. Saylor argued that Pakistan had the most important things, which are commitment and clarity, and he said that he is looking forward to working with the country. Pakistan seeks to build a robust crypto policy framework Saqib’s office said in a statement that its talk with Saylor was a milestone in Pakistan’s effort to build a robust digital assets policy framework for the country. Aurangzeb also maintained that Pakistan aspires to lead the Global South in developing and adopting digital assets. He referred to the group of nations typically regarded as having a lower level of economic development. On June 6, Pakistan’s government-backed Crypto Council presented a draft legal framework, for which the Finance Ministry agreed to fast-track the approval process. The council was established in March to regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets into the country’s financial landscape. The Finance Division said the council is set to play a pivotal role in formulating policies, fostering innovation, and ensuring a secure and forward-thinking approach to crypto adoption in Pakistan . Saqib was installed as CEO, and he also acts as an adviser to World Liberty Financial, the crypto project linked to U.S. President Donald Trump and his family.

The nation is taking a significant step towards clarifying its stance on digital assets and fostering technological advancement. A new comprehensive piece of legislation, the Law on Digital Technology Industry, has been passed and is set to dramatically reshape the landscape, particularly for the burgeoning Vietnam crypto market . Taking effect on January 1, 2026, this law is poised to bring much-needed structure and formalize Vietnam crypto regulation , integrating digital assets firmly into the legal framework. What Exactly Does Vietnam’s New Digital Law Cover? At its core, Vietnam’s new digital law aims to provide a clear legal foundation for the digital economy. One of the most anticipated aspects is its approach to digital assets. According to reports citing local news, the law makes a crucial distinction, formally separating digital assets into two main categories: Virtual Assets: These are digital representations of value that can be traded or transferred digitally. Think of things like loyalty points, digital collectibles, or certain types of tokens that aren’t necessarily cryptocurrencies but exist purely in digital form. Crypto Assets: This category specifically refers to assets that use encryption and decentralized ledger technologies (like blockchain) to function. This is where cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum would fall. It’s important to note that the law explicitly excludes traditional financial instruments like securities, digital fiat currency (like a potential digital VND issued by the central bank), and other conventional financial products from these definitions. This focus ensures the law targets the unique characteristics of crypto and virtual assets without overlapping with existing financial regulations. The law also mandates that the government will establish detailed rules regarding the classification, oversight, and business operations involving these assets. This indicates a phased approach, with the broad legal framework laid out now and specific regulations to follow, providing clarity on how the Vietnam digital law will be implemented in practice. How Does This Law Tackle Crypto Risks and FATF Concerns? One of the key drivers behind formalizing Vietnam crypto regulation is undoubtedly the need to address potential risks associated with digital assets, particularly concerning illicit finance. The new law places a strong emphasis on security and compliance, mandating robust cybersecurity measures and strict anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. These requirements are specifically designed to align with international guidelines. This focus on AML is particularly relevant given Vietnam’s current status. In 2023, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, placed Vietnam on its ‘gray list’. This signifies that while Vietnam has committed to addressing strategic deficiencies in its AML/CFT (Countering the Financing of Terrorism) regime, it needs to demonstrate progress. By incorporating stringent AML measures for crypto and virtual assets, the new Vietnam digital law directly addresses these international concerns, signaling Vietnam’s commitment to improving its financial integrity framework. This move is crucial for building trust and facilitating smoother international financial interactions, potentially helping Vietnam move off the FATF gray list in the future. Is Vietnam Becoming a Hub for Tech Investment? Beyond digital assets, the Law on Digital Technology Industry is a clear statement of Vietnam’s ambition to become a leading player in the global digital economy. The legislation includes significant incentives aimed at stimulating growth and attracting investment in key technological areas. Companies operating in sectors deemed critical for the future, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), semiconductors, and digital infrastructure, stand to benefit from measures like tax breaks. This strategic focus aims to build a robust foundation for Vietnam’s technological future. By offering tangible support to these high-growth industries, the Vietnam digital law is actively working to cultivate the Vietnam tech sector . This not only encourages domestic innovation but also makes Vietnam a more attractive destination for foreign direct investment in technology. A thriving tech sector provides the infrastructure and talent pool necessary for the digital economy, including the responsible development and integration of digital assets and blockchain technology. The synergies between a strong tech sector and a regulated digital asset environment could create a powerful engine for economic growth. What Does This Mean for the Vietnam Crypto Market? The introduction of formal Vietnam crypto regulation through this new law is a game-changer for the Vietnam crypto market . For years, the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Vietnam has been somewhat ambiguous, operating in a gray area. This lack of clarity created uncertainty for businesses, investors, and everyday users. With the law taking effect in 2026, we can anticipate several potential impacts: Increased Legitimacy: Formal regulation can lend legitimacy to the crypto market, potentially encouraging broader adoption by individuals and traditional businesses who were previously hesitant due to the uncertain legal status. Compliance Burden: Businesses operating with crypto assets will need to comply with the new rules, including licensing requirements, reporting obligations, and strict AML/KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures. This will require investment in compliance infrastructure. Innovation vs. Regulation: Finding the right balance between fostering innovation in the Vietnam virtual assets space and implementing necessary safeguards will be crucial. Overly strict regulations could stifle growth, while insufficient rules could leave users exposed. Investor Confidence: A clear regulatory framework can increase investor confidence, potentially attracting both domestic and international capital into the Vietnam crypto market. The specifics of the operational rules are yet to be defined by the government, and these details will significantly shape the future trajectory of the market. However, the intent to regulate and integrate is clear. What’s Next on the Path to 2026 Implementation? While the Law on Digital Technology Industry has been passed, the effective date of January 1, 2026, provides a crucial transition period. During this time, the Vietnamese government is tasked with developing the specific decrees, circulars, and guidelines that will detail how the law will be implemented. This includes defining the exact criteria for classifying Vietnam virtual assets and crypto assets, establishing licensing requirements for crypto businesses (like exchanges and wallet providers), setting out the precise AML/CFT obligations, and clarifying the operational rules for the sector. This period is critical for engagement between regulators and industry stakeholders. Clear, practical, and forward-thinking subsidiary legislation will be essential for the success of the Vietnam digital law . Businesses and individuals involved in the crypto space in Vietnam should closely monitor developments and prepare for the upcoming changes, ensuring they understand the new compliance landscape well before the 2026 deadline. Conclusion: A Clearer Horizon for Vietnam’s Digital Future Vietnam’s new Law on Digital Technology Industry marks a pivotal moment for the nation’s digital economy. By formalizing Vietnam crypto regulation , categorizing digital assets, mandating robust AML measures, and offering incentives for the tech sector, the law lays a strategic foundation for growth while addressing critical risks. While the detailed rules are still in development, the commitment to a regulated and supportive environment signals a positive step towards integrating digital assets into the mainstream and positioning Vietnam as a competitive player in the global digital landscape. The path to 2026 will be one of refinement and adaptation, but the direction towards clarity and responsible growth is now firmly set.

His comments – clearly aimed at Cardano’s recent $100 million Bitcoin plan – have stirred strong reactions across the community. As major blockchain players weigh in, the clash reveals deeper questions about how altcoin projects should manage their treasuries in today’s unpredictable market. This is so dumb. Projects should keep 18-36 months of post kill list runway in short term tbills but that’s about it. Why would anyone want a team to buy and hold bitcoin for them when they can do it themselves? Why pay for all those coconuts. — toly (@aeyakovenko) June 16, 2025 Yakovenko Fires Back: “Why Pay for Coconuts?” Yakovenko didn’t hold back. In a post on X, he dismissed the idea of altcoin teams buying Bitcoin for their users, saying individuals can, and should, do it themselves. “This is so dumb… Why would anyone want a team to buy and hold Bitcoin for them when they can do it themselves? Why pay for all those coconuts?” he wrote. Instead of Bitcoin, he recommends projects hold enough low-risk assets, like U.S. Treasury bills, to cover three years of operating costs. Anything beyond that, he suggests, is unnecessary. Cardano’s $100M Bitcoin Plan Raises Eyebrows The drama began after Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson proposed converting $100 million worth of ADA into Bitcoin and stable assets. According to him, this wouldn’t hurt Cardano’s ecosystem. In fact, he says it could help grow the treasury over time through yield, eventually allowing the team to buy back even more ADA. “If successful, this strategy could create a stable floor for the ecosystem,” he said, expecting a sustainable financial model. However, his embrace of Bitcoin raised eyebrows, especially after he previously challenged Bitcoin’s “sound money” status, promising not to allow “ Bitcoin maxis ” to dominate. Crypto Community Weighs In The proposal drew mixed reactions in the crypto community. Jeff Park of Bitwise Invest on X , “Subpar altcoins ditching their assets to build a BTC treasury was not on my 2025 bingo card.” Others in the space had mixed reactions. DeFi platform Alva called Cardano’s move risky but said it could strengthen its position in decentralized finance. Meanwhile, traders remain cautious about a short-term dip in ADA, though some technical signals suggest a rebound may follow. Bigger Question: Is Bitcoin the Future of Altcoin Treasuries? This back-and-forth between the heads of Solana and Cardano highlights a growing divide in the crypto world: Should altcoin projects lean into Bitcoin, or focus on building value with their own assets? As market volatility continues, the choices these projects make now could shape their long-term success and how investors view their role in the broader crypto ecosystem.",News,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-16 10:03:28

The global crypto market cap has risen by 1.10% to $3.32 trillion, while the intraday trading volume zoomed past by 15.94% to $89.62 billion. Which is a clear sign of growing activity as traders anticipate potential market-moving events. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 50, reflecting neutrality across retail and institutional sentiment. While ETF inflows are seeing a revival, providing crucial support to market leaders, it’s Ethereum that’s stealing the spotlight with its institutional traction. XRP, too, is drawing attention thanks to its $1 billion in treasury commitments and anticipation surrounding the Ripple vs SEC case. I am sure that this has compelled you to look out for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP price prediction. Here’s how the top three assets are shaping up technically: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: Bitcoin price today is trading at $107,113, with a marginal 1.02% spike in the last 24 hours. The price remains in a narrow consolidation pattern on the daily chart, hovering just below its recent swing high. With ETF momentum fueling demand, a breakout above the $107,000 resistance could send BTC flying toward $110,000. On the flip side, if selling pressure intensifies below $105,000, a slide to the $102,800 support could follow. However, with volume up nearly 11%, bulls seem to be holding their ground for now. That being said, I believe, a sustained push above $106,800 would confirm bullish continuation. If you are keen on investing in BTC, then our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 is a must-read for you! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin this week, rallying 3.33% to trade at $2,627, with a notable $5 billion in ETF inflows and a 40% surge in trading volume. On the technical front, ETH is attempting to break out of a sideways channel. A clean break above $2,633 its recent high could fuel a rally toward $2,750–$2,800, especially with institutional backing on the rise. However, if ETH fails to hold above the $2,550 level, you can expect a retracement to $2,450. If you are an ETH hodler, this Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 is for you! Ripple XRP Price Prediction: XRP today is changing hands at $2.18, up 1.60%, but still below its 50-day SMA of $2.28, signaling short-term caution. The token is above the 200-day SMA of $1.91, reinforcing longer-term strength. With support near $2.0145, I believe that the downside seems limited in the short term. Interested in XRP, but concerned about its long term returns? Read our Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Immediate resistance lies at $2.45, and a weekly close above that could reignite hopes for a rally toward the psychological $3 level. Traders are closely watching the Ripple vs SEC case, with Judge Torres expected to deliver a verdict, an event that could dramatically shift price dynamics. FAQs 1. Is Bitcoin ready for a breakout this week? Yes, if Bitcoin can sustain above $106,800, the charts suggest a breakout toward $110,000 is likely, supported by ETF inflows and improving volume. 2. Why is Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin? Ethereum has seen stronger institutional inflows into its ETFs, and its technical structure is showing signs of a bullish breakout above key resistance. 3. Will XRP rally after the Ripple-SEC verdict? A favorable verdict could be a major catalyst, potentially propelling XRP above $2.45 and toward $3.00.

Shocking Math Reveals the Truth,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-xrp-ready-for-global-adoption-shocking-math-reveals-the-truth/,"The post Is XRP Ready for Global Adoption? Shocking Math Reveals the Truth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A viral analysis by X user Future XRP is catching serious attention in the crypto space. The claim? XRP could reach between $3,000 and $21,000—not based on hype, but on actual transaction data and an economic formula. The logic hinges on XRP Ledger’s transaction speed, circulating supply, and global utility potential. If XRP becomes the go-to settlement asset for trillions of dollars in payments, the price could skyrocket. Here’s a breakdown of the analysis and its implications for XRP’s future . How XRP’s Transaction Speed Could Boost Its Value The XRP Ledger is already one of the fastest blockchains, processing up to 1,500 transactions per second (TPS) in real-world conditions, with tests showing over 3,400 TPS. In theory, it could scale up to 10,000 TPS. The more frequently XRP is used to settle payments, the higher its velocity. Higher velocity means that fewer XRP are needed to move more money, increasing the value of each token. If XRP becomes the backbone for global payments, speed and usage will be critical drivers of its valuation. Why Circulating Supply Could Trigger a Supply Shock Although 100 billion XRP were created, many tokens are locked up in ETFs, institutional reserves , or long-term storage. This reduces the amount of XRP available in the open market. If supply is limited while demand grows, each token becomes more valuable. Future XRP highlights that less available XRP paired with higher usage means higher prices. The Formula Predicting XRP’s Future Price Future XRP uses the classic MV = PQ formula to calculate potential price levels. In this equation: M = XRP in circulation V = How often each XRP is used annually (velocity) P = Price of XRP Q = Total value of transactions XRP settles annually So, Price per XRP = Total Value Settled / (Circulating XRP * Velocity) Let’s explore three key scenarios. Scenario 1: High Speed, Low Supply TPS: 10,000 Circulating XRP: 20 billion Velocity: 15.8 times per year Settlement Volume: $1 quadrillion annually Predicted Price: $3,164.56 per XRP Scenario 2: High Speed, High Supply TPS: 10,000 Circulating XRP: 60 billion Velocity: 5.26 Predicted Price: $3,168.09 per XRP .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin Holds $105K as $1B in Longs Get Wiped Out , Scenario 3: Low Speed, High Supply TPS: 1,500 Circulating XRP: 60 billion Velocity: 0.79 Predicted Price: $21,097.04 per XRP This final case shows that if XRP is slower and less efficient, the price must rise dramatically to meet global demand. Can XRP Realistically Handle $1 Quadrillion in Payments? The global financial system processes anywhere from $500 trillion to $1 quadrillion each year. If XRP captures even 10 to 14 percent of this volume, the price must increase to support the scale of settlement. This means XRP’s future price depends not only on speculation but also on its actual utility, adoption, and velocity. Final Thoughts The bold prediction of XRP reaching $21,000 might seem extreme, but the math behind it is grounded in transaction velocity and global payment volume. If XRP becomes a core layer for settling massive amounts of value across the world, a high price per token is not just possible—it may be necessary. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Cardano struggles to break key resistance levels, investors are turning to early-stage tokens like Neo Pepe Protocol, where momentum, structure, and upside potential align. Table of Contents ADA faces strong resistance despite market recovery Neo Pepe Protocol: $0.05 alternative investors are watching Why investors are pivoting to Neo Pepe Coin in Q3 An intelligent ending to Q3 Cardano has seen modest gains recently, drawing attention due to its commitment to scalability and sustainability. However, despite ongoing technical advancements and renewed community interest, ADA’s price rally may soon encounter resistance. As investors closely monitor ADA’s trajectory, many are shifting their focus to tokens demonstrating stronger momentum, more efficient models, and significant early-stage growth potential. Among these alternatives, Neo Pepe Protocol is particularly attracting attention. Currently priced at $0.05423 during its presale phase, equipped with a robust DAO framework, and gaining notable traction in its early fundraising efforts, the Neo Pepe Coin offers investors more than mere potential. It presents a clearly defined structure and an attractive path forward. ADA faces strong resistance despite market recovery Cardano ( ADA ) has advanced alongside the broader market recovery, yet persistent resistance levels continue to limit its upward potential. Specifically, the $0.74-$0.75 zone remains the critical barrier, reinforced by the 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs on both the 4-hour and daily charts, along with historical channel highs. While ADA managed a bounce from recent lows around $0.66, key resistance points remain notably tough, particularly around the 200-day EMA near $0.71 and the top trend channel slightly below $0.76. Indicators currently highlight mixed sentiments: RSI is hovering in neutral territory. MACD presents ambiguous signals. Trading volumes remain slim, indicating a lack of strong bullish conviction. Should ADA fail to decisively break the $0.75–$0.76 resistance level, a retracement toward the $0.68 and $0.66 support zones appears increasingly probable. Neo Pepe Protocol: $0.05 alternative investors are watching Neo Pepe Protocol (NEOP) is a decentralized, meme-inspired protocol developed on Ethereum. It operates without centralized control, developer wallets, or upgradeable contracts, relying entirely on immutable smart contracts and public DAO voting, ensuring absolute transparency and fairness. The presale model is meticulously structured with 16 clearly defined stages, each featuring a hard cap and predetermined pricing. Upon completion of one stage, the subsequent stage activates automatically, preventing manual interference or price manipulation. Currently, Neo Pepe Protocol is in Stage 0 of its presale, priced attractively at $0.05423 per token. Already, $103,304.11 has been raised toward the stage cap of $121,415.98. Following Stage 0’s completion, the token price automatically rises to $0.061461.

Full DAO governance for transparent and democratic decision-making. Immutable smart contracts, providing security against edits or rollbacks. Complete decentralization, eliminating developer allocations for a truly community-driven project. Strong credibility, supported by CertiK and Coinsult audits, with an additional Cyberscope audit underway. Perks and incentives such as weekly rewards, bonuses for early buyers, and DAO-driven CEX listings. 5 reasons Neo Pepe protocol is set to outshine Cardano in Q3 Structured presale growth – Defined stages ensure clarity and avoid manipulation. Community-centric governance – DAO-driven decisions prioritize fairness and transparency. Immutable and secure – Audited smart contracts by CertiK and Coinsult bolster investor trust. Low entry point – Current presale price of $0.05423 offers attractive upside. Increasing investor momentum – Early presale success indicates robust future growth potential. An intelligent ending to Q3 ADA continues its development but lacks significant catalysts to sustain its current rally. Conversely, Neo Pepe Coin is emerging as an exciting alternative, low entry cost, fair access, and complete on-chain governance. Investors who previously missed early-stage opportunities now have another chance. At just $0.05423, Neo Pepe Protocol’s potential is set to sizzle further when the presale price increases to $0.061461 in the next phase.

Despite its seemingly counter-intuitive name, this particular memecoin has surged to a staggering $100 million market capitalization. This remarkable feat occurred shortly after its launch on LetsBONK.fun, a brand-new platform designed specifically for creating tokens within the vibrant BONK ecosystem . The rapid ascent of USELESS underscores the unique dynamics of the memecoin market, where community hype, viral trends, and speculative trading can propel assets to valuations that defy traditional financial logic. For many observers, the very idea of a token called ‘USELESS’ reaching such a valuation is a perfect encapsulation of the often-absurd nature of this niche within the broader crypto landscape. The Rapid Rise of USELESS Memecoin on LetsBONK.fun The journey of the USELESS memecoin to a nine-figure market cap has been swift and attention-grabbing. Launched on LetsBONK.fun, a platform that simplifies the creation of tokens leveraging the popularity and infrastructure of the BONK token, USELESS quickly found traction among traders and speculators. The news of its milestone was first reported by prominent crypto observer Wu Blockchain on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting the speed at which value can accumulate in this corner of the market. The LetsBONK.fun platform itself is a testament to the evolving nature of token launches, particularly within established crypto communities like BONK. By providing tools and infrastructure, it lowers the barrier to entry for creating new tokens, potentially leading to a proliferation of assets like USELESS. While this accessibility can foster innovation and community projects, it also inherently carries risks, as the utility and longevity of such tokens are often questionable. The $100 million memecoin market cap is a significant psychological and financial threshold. It signals that a substantial amount of capital has flowed into the token, driven primarily by speculation and the hope of future price increases. For a token with no stated utility beyond being a ‘memecoin,’ this valuation is purely a reflection of market sentiment and the collective belief (or gamble) of its holders. Witnessing Substantial Crypto Trading Profit : The Unipcs Story One of the most compelling narratives emerging from the USELESS surge is the story of a single trader who realized a substantial crypto trading profit . A member of the BONK community known online as Unipcs made a notable early investment in the USELESS token. According to reports, Unipcs purchased 28.1 million USELESS tokens for a sum of $381,900. This initial investment secured Unipcs a significant stake, representing 2.81% of the total USELESS token supply. As the USELESS memecoin market cap climbed to $100 million, the value of Unipcs’s holding skyrocketed. At the peak of this surge, Unipcs was sitting on an unrealized profit estimated to be around $1.9 million. This single example perfectly illustrates the high-reward potential that attracts traders to the memecoin space, despite the equally high risks involved. The Unipcs case highlights several aspects of successful (and often lucky) memecoin trading: Early Entry: Getting in early before widespread hype can lead to significant gains. Substantial Stake: A large initial investment, while risky, can yield massive profits if the token pumps. Community Connection: Being part of the underlying community (BONK in this case) might provide early insights or access. Unrealized vs. Realized Profit: It’s crucial to remember that $1.9 million was an *unrealized* profit. The actual profit depends on when and if Unipcs sells their tokens. While stories like Unipcs’s are enticing, they are the exception, not the rule, in the volatile world of memecoin trading . Exploring LetsBONK.fun and the Broader BONK Ecosystem The emergence of LetsBONK.fun is a direct consequence of the success and popularity of the BONK token itself. BONK, initially launched as a Solana-based memecoin, has grown into a significant player, fostering its own community and ecosystem. LetsBONK.fun positions itself as a user-friendly platform for launching new tokens that aim to ride the coattails of BONK’s momentum and leverage its network effects. Platforms like LetsBONK.fun streamline the technical process of creating and distributing tokens, making it accessible even to individuals or groups with limited development experience. This ease of creation means the market can quickly become flooded with new tokens, each hoping to be the next big hit. The success of a token like USELESS on this platform validates the LetsBONK.fun model, at least in terms of attracting initial liquidity and speculative interest. The BONK ecosystem benefits from such platforms by potentially increasing activity and attention within its sphere. However, it also introduces a layer of risk, as the proliferation of low-utility tokens could dilute the ecosystem or attract negative attention due to scams or rapid price crashes. Understanding the Significance of a $100M Memecoin Market Cap For many traditional investors, the concept of a token named ‘USELESS’ achieving a $100 million market capitalization is perplexing. In traditional finance, market cap is often tied to a company’s earnings, assets, or growth potential. In the memecoin world, the calculation is the same (total tokens multiplied by current price), but the underlying value drivers are entirely different. A $100 million memecoin market cap primarily signifies: Significant Hype and Attention: The token has captured the imagination (and capital) of a large number of traders. Momentum: There is strong buying pressure driving the price up rapidly. Network Effect: The community around the token is growing and actively promoting it. Liquidity: At this market cap, there is likely enough trading volume for larger players to enter and exit positions (though volatility remains extreme). However, unlike established cryptocurrencies or traditional assets, a memecoin’s market cap can be extremely fragile. It is heavily reliant on sustained hype and inflows of new capital. A shift in sentiment, a large holder selling, or the emergence of a newer, shinier memecoin can cause the price and market cap to plummet just as quickly as they rose. Is Memecoin Trading a Viable Strategy for Crypto Trading Profit ? The story of Unipcs and the rise of USELESS makes memecoin trading seem like a golden ticket to massive crypto trading profit . While it’s true that some individuals have made fortunes trading memecoins, it’s crucial to approach this space with extreme caution and a realistic understanding of the risks involved. Benefits of Memecoin Trading (for the lucky few): Exponential Gains: The potential for 10x, 100x, or even 1000x returns is what draws many in. Community Engagement: Memecoin communities can be highly active and entertaining. Low Entry Price: Tokens often start trading at fractions of a cent, allowing small investors to buy large quantities (though this is often a psychological trap). Challenges and Risks of Memecoin Trading: Extreme Volatility: Prices can crash to zero in minutes. Lack of Fundamentals: Value is based almost entirely on speculation, not utility or adoption. Rug Pulls and Scams: Many memecoins are created with malicious intent by developers who disappear with invested funds. Market Manipulation: Large holders (‘whales’) can heavily influence prices. Psychological Toll: The intense volatility can be emotionally draining and lead to poor trading decisions. For most people, memecoin trading is akin to gambling. While a small, speculative allocation might be acceptable for those who understand and can afford to lose their entire investment, it is not a reliable or sustainable strategy for building long-term wealth. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Memecoin Mania Given the fascination and potential (however risky) of the memecoin market, what should potential participants consider? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand what you are buying, the platform it’s on (like LetsBONK.fun), the community behind it, and the risks involved. Look for red flags. Assume You Could Lose Everything: Only invest capital you are 100% prepared to lose. Memecoins are high-risk, high-reward assets. Start Small: If you must participate, allocate only a tiny percentage of your overall crypto portfolio to memecoins. Understand the Hype Cycle: Memecoins often follow a pattern of launch, rapid pump based on hype, and then a significant dump. Timing the market is extremely difficult. Be Wary of Unrealistic Promises: If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Focus on the Underlying Ecosystem: While USELESS is on LetsBONK.fun, understanding the broader BONK ecosystem might provide better context, though it doesn’t mitigate the specific risks of the memecoin itself. Trading memecoins requires a high tolerance for risk and a clear understanding that success stories like Unipcs are rare outcomes in a field littered with tokens that never gain traction or quickly collapse. Conclusion: The Paradox of USELESS and the Future of Memecoin Market Cap The rise of the USELESS memecoin to a $100 million market cap on the LetsBONK.fun platform is a striking example of the power of speculation and community-driven hype in the cryptocurrency space. It showcases the potential for significant crypto trading profit for early or fortunate participants, as highlighted by the Unipcs story. However, it also serves as a potent reminder of the inherent volatility and risks associated with memecoin trading . Platforms like LetsBONK.fun, by facilitating token creation within ecosystems like BONK, are likely to continue contributing to the memecoin phenomenon. As long as there is attention, liquidity, and the allure of quick riches, tokens with catchy names and little intrinsic value will likely continue to emerge and, occasionally, experience parabolic price movements. While the story of USELESS is fascinating, it reinforces the need for extreme caution. The $100 million market cap, while impressive, is built on a foundation of sentiment rather than utility. Investors venturing into this space should prioritize risk management and understand that for every success story, there are countless tokens that live up to the ‘useless’ part of their name, failing to gain traction or collapsing entirely.

And some of these memecoins are experiencing huge increases. The latest example of this is the memecoin Useless Coin (USELESS), launched by LetsBONK fun, a new platform for creating BONK-based tokens. According to the data, the memecoin named USELESS reached a market value of $ 100 million. Solana-based USELESS rose to $0.1 in recent days, according to gmgn data. USELESS, which later fell, is at $0.081. With this rise, USELESS left behind top memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), SHIB, PEPE, FARTCOIN and WIF. While USELESS is gaining all the attention with its rise, Bonk community figure Unipcs purchased 28.1 million tokens worth $381,900. With this acquisition, Unipcs retains 2.8% of the supply and realizes $2 million in unrealized profit. According to Lookonchain’s post, Unipcs purchased USELESS for $381.9k and has now raised $2.4m, making over $2m in unrealized profit. Despite USELESS’s profit, Unipcs’s wallet is still in the red. The whale traded 48 altcoins, but 44 of them are at a loss. According to the data, only USELESS brought him significant profits.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-doesnt-need-a-bull-run-to-see-a-high-price-heres-why/,"A growing number of voices within the XRP community are challenging conventional crypto narratives, arguing that XRP’s value is not dependent on the next bull run. Among them is Molt Media, who recently reignited the conversation on X with a bold statement: “XRP doesn’t need a bull run to see a high price. Those that truly understand XRP understand what I mean.” The remark sparked thoughtful responses from other users, including J5, who highlighted a broader political shift: “Honestly, the shift in Republican politics lately has been interesting to watch. They’re focusing more on economic policies that could impact markets like crypto… Not sure if that’s what you meant about XRP’s value being tied to utility rather than just market sentiment, but it’s a different approach than traditional bull run thinking.” Molt Media responded with clarity: “Yes, politics and market sentiment mean nothing long term for XRP. It’s about global liquidity and what XRP was designed to do—which is to facilitate trillions worth of value daily via transactions on the XRPL.” This assertion reinforces the view that XRP’s long-term potential lies not in hype, but in its core use case as a bridge currency powering seamless, global value transfer. $XRP doesn’t need a bull run to see a high price. Those that truly understand XRP understand what I mean. — MOLT MEDIA (@MoltMoney) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Value: Built on Utility, Not Speculation XRP was developed by Ripple Labs to address a critical flaw in the financial system—slow, expensive, and inefficient cross-border payments. Traditional systems like SWIFT can take days to settle international transfers, while XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) offer instant settlement with near-zero fees and high scalability. The token’s value proposition is fundamentally different from that of most cryptocurrencies. While many digital assets rise and fall with market sentiment, XRP is positioned as a utility-first asset meant to serve financial institutions, payment providers, and global remittance services. This distinction has shaped the XRP community’s strong belief that real-world utility, not hype, will ultimately drive price. Regulatory Climate and Political Shifts J5’s reference to political developments adds important context. Under the renewed leadership of President Donald Trump, the Republican Party has shown increasing interest in supporting crypto innovation. Their push for regulatory clarity stands in contrast to previous years of uncertainty, offering a more welcoming landscape for blockchain projects like XRP that prioritize compliance and integration into traditional finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As J5 noted, “The global financial landscape is shifting… The market will ultimately reward technology that solves real problems regardless of political winds.” This sentiment echoes the broader idea that long-term crypto success will be rooted in utility and problem-solving, not just market cycles. XRP’s Quiet Ascent Amid this evolving landscape, XRP remains a sleeping giant. Another X user, SJ, summed it up best: “XRP will moon in your sleep. In other words, when least expected. Have patience.” The comment reflects a belief held by many in the XRP community—that the token’s breakout will happen quietly, triggered not by social media hype but by real adoption. In a space where speculation often overshadows fundamentals, XRP continues to chart a different course. As Molt Media rightly asserts, the next bull run isn’t a requirement. For those who understand XRP’s true purpose, price appreciation is not a matter of if, but when. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In 2025, the meme coin category has exploded into a sprawling universe of ideologies, utilities, parodies, and politics. Behind the jokes are projects navigating serious questions: Who controls value? What gives a meme staying power? And can a decentralized joke evolve into a protocol that commands real influence? What’s even more remarkable is how these coins reflect broader economic, social, and political sentiment. While traditional investors may scoff, meme coins tap into a primal force: community belief amplified by digital culture. Some mimic blue-chip coins with an added punchline, while others forge entirely new economic systems disguised in meme wrappers. Many fail. A few go parabolic. But all reveal something about where blockchain, humor, and collective behavior intersect. This year, we’re seeing not just pump-and-dump tokens but entire ecosystems emerging under the banner of memetics. Tokenomics are sharper. Presale mechanics are more engineered. And governance—real community decision-making—is beginning to surface as the new meme frontier. This list doesn’t follow market caps—it follows momentum, community control, design sophistication, and memetic impact. From raw humor to multi-chain protocols, the following coins are changing what a meme coin can be. Scroll to the end to see why Neo Pepe ($NEOP) is redefining the genre entirely. Meme Momentum— Fire & Flash #10 DogWifHat (WIF) Solana’s top viral meme coin this cycle, WIF launched without complexity and thrived through pure aesthetic power. The branding—just a dog wearing a hat—struck a nerve with the Twitter-native retail crowd. It speaks to the minimalist meme culture that thrives on relatability over complexity. However, as newer tokens enter the scene with full DeFi frameworks, the simplicity that made WIF a breakout hit could also be its Achilles' heel. Without governance mechanisms, staking incentives, or protocol development, WIF faces the critical question all viral tokens must confront: What comes after the meme? #9 Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Fartcoin leaned into the most ridiculous meme imaginable—and it paid off. It exemplifies the kind of low-effort, high-virality coin that captures attention during bull markets. Its strength is in its audacity: a name that sparks laughter, an image that spreads fast, and branding that dares you not to talk about it. But beneath the noise, there’s no roadmap, no token utility, and no strategy beyond chaos. It thrives in volume, but fades fast if sentiment turns. It may not be built to last, but Fartcoin knows what it is—and that honesty fuels its short-term explosion. #8 Pepe (PEPE) When PEPE dropped on Ethereum, it was already famous. The meme was everywhere—from crypto chatrooms to political forums. The token became a lightning rod for meme power, capturing millions in trading volume within days. But unlike Dogecoin or SHIB, PEPE was unapologetically barebones. No supply cap, no governance, no project team. Just a name, a meme, and liquidity. It proved the point that memes alone can create markets. Still, without long-term development, PEPE’s dominance will be tested by coins with comparable virality but greater functional depth. Meme Narratives That Run Deep #7 SPX6900 (SPX) SPX6900 combines index parody with crypto satire. Named after a fictionalized version of the S&P 500, it mocks legacy finance while carving its own space in meme culture. It speaks to a generation disillusioned by traditional markets and intrigued by decentralized alternatives. What makes SPX compelling isn’t just its brand—it’s the irony laced with intent. It isn’t merely funny; it’s critical. While still in its early stages, SPX could transition from meme to movement if it anchors itself in DeFi or governance structures. For now, it’s a narrative coin with massive cultural resonance and room to grow. #6 Official Trump ($TRUMP) Launched on Solana, $TRUMP is a meme coin rooted in one of the most polarizing political figures of our time. It operates like a sentiment gauge for Trump-related news. Every tweet, headline, or court appearance has the power to swing its price. While it garners visibility, the token is highly centralized and lacks the decentralized values that crypto enthusiasts typically prioritize. It may succeed as a social trading vehicle, but without community control or utility, its long-term sustainability is in question. It's a risky, volatile meme coin that's more political instrument than crypto project. Legacy Holdouts #5 Shiba Inu (SHIB) Originally positioned as a Dogecoin killer, SHIB quickly grew into something far more ambitious. The launch of Shibarium (its Layer 2 blockchain), the expansion into NFTs, and ecosystem tokens like BONE and LEASH show intent to create a full-stack memecoin empire. Yet, despite the ambition, SHIB suffers from its massive token supply and unclear identity. Is it still a meme, or is it now a serious protocol? Conflicting marketing, diluted focus, and a bloated structure make it difficult to categorize. Still, its loyal community and strong infrastructure mean SHIB remains one of the few meme coins attempting to evolve into something larger. #4 Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin will always be the original. Its branding is eternal, and its cultural relevance is unmatched. It’s accepted by merchants, supported by major platforms, and often serves as the “gateway” coin for crypto newbies. But that’s also the problem. Dogecoin hasn’t changed. It still lacks a capped supply. It doesn’t have an ecosystem. It’s meme inertia—sustained by past glory, not future innovation. For DOGE to remain competitive, it needs more than nostalgia. Until then, it’s the mascot of memecoins—but no longer the leader. Meme Coins Evolving Into Infrastructure #3 Floki (FLOKI) Floki transformed itself from a Musk meme into a multi-pronged development project. Its biggest play is Valhalla, a metaverse with NFT gameplay and blockchain-backed economies. Beyond that, FLOKI also launched FlokiFi, an ecosystem of DeFi products. It blends storytelling with technology, aiming to create an immersive world backed by real utility. FLOKI isn’t just building hype—it’s building tools. With consistent updates and ongoing development, Floki shows how meme culture can become infrastructure—provided the team can deliver on its promises. #2 Bonk (BONK) Bonk was initially distributed to the Solana community as an antidote to the bear market—and it worked. It reignited community activity and gave Solana a viral narrative to rally behind. But Bonk didn’t stop there. It's since become a default liquidity token across many Solana DEXs. Developers are building apps that integrate Bonk as a native currency. While it still leans into its meme status, Bonk’s quiet growth into a network utility token puts it in a rare category: a meme coin that builders actually use. It may have started as a joke, but Bonk is becoming a pillar. #1 Neo Pepe ($NEOP) Neo Pepe didn’t rise through virality alone—it structured itself for dominance. Its entire design is engineered for decentralization and resilience. Built on Ethereum, Neo Pepe launched with a 16-stage presale that raised $50M, leveraging tiered pricing to reward early believers and generate momentum. The presale structure alone was an industry statement: controlled, fair, and capped to ensure widespread participation. At its core lies a governance engine: Token holders with 1 million $NEOP propose and vote 7-day voting period 48-hour timelock for execution All treasury actions governed by smart contracts and multisig Neo Pepe’s transactional design is equally ambitious. Every buy and sell incurs a 2.5% fee that fuels auto-liquidity. Those LP tokens? Burned immediately. No dev wallet. No token manipulation. Just decentralized, contract-locked, self-sustaining value generation. But Neo Pepe’s greatest strength isn’t technical—it’s philosophical. The project embodies the Memetrix, a cultural framework that turns the meme into a symbol of digital resistance. It’s a challenge to centralized systems. An invitation to help govern—not just trade. The storytelling isn’t superficial—it’s foundational. In a space full of empty memes, Neo Pepe is a meme with depth. This is not another token with a frog. It’s a movement using memetics as a delivery system for sovereignty. Exit Joke Memes, Enter Neo Pepe Protocol The top meme coins of 2025 aren’t just viral—they’re evolving. The trend is clear: tokens with narrative alone are fading, while those embedding purpose and utility into the meme itself are rising. Neo Pepe leads this shift. It isn’t trying to be funny. It’s trying to be permanent. It represents a new frontier—where crypto culture meets operational legitimacy. As other tokens burn out in the meme spotlight, Neo Pepe stands to inherit what they never built: longevity. Break Out of the Memetrix Visit NeoPepe.ai to review its presale structure and DAO tools Explore its roadmap and vote on proposals via the governance dashboard Connect to the project through Neo Pepe’s Linktree This is the next frontier of meme assets.

BTC/USD is trading tightly around the $107,000 mark, and traders are preparing for a volatile stretch buoyed by inflation fears, the Israel-Iran feud, and the Wednesday FOMC meeting. Here are four developments the market is watching . Federal Reserve decision’s market influence All eyes are on the US Federal Reserve’s June 18 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which could more than likely send crypto markets deeper into volatile territory. The Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged, continuing its pause on cuts throughout 2025. However, inflation pressures are complicating the central bank’s position. “Powell’s language at the FOMC press conference will be keenly watched,” one strategist on X remarked, “especially with President Trump increasing pressure on the Fed to lower rates.” Fed rate cut probability. Source: CME Group Although May’s Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) rose just 2.4% year-over-year and core inflation increased by 2.8%, both readings came in below expectations. The Producer Price Index (PPI) also surprised economists to the downside, with a 3.0% increase in core prices, lower than April’s number. “Following the CPI and PPI reports, market-implied odds shifted to show two 0.25% cuts being priced this year,” explained analysts at Market Mosaic. Bitcoin trading range in favor of more price swings Per YouTuber Rananjay Singh, Bitcoin has traded within a narrow 10% range throughout June, a pattern seen in past cycles that often preceded significant price swings. The largest coin by market cap closed the previous week above $104,500, a strong position that provided some optimism for bulls. $BTC is moving in a small range this month, just 10% between high and low. But in the last 4 years, every month moved more than this. This tells us a big move is coming, up or down. And the next move will likely be real, not a fake one. Stay ready.👍 #BTC #Bitcoin #Crypto pic.twitter.com/jpfQq5s98F — Rananjay Singh (@TodayCryptoRj) June 16, 2025 “In the last 4 years, every month moved more than this. This tells us a big move is coming, up or down. And the next move will likely be real, not a fake one,” Singh told his followers on X. Several market watchers warned that if BTC fails to maintain current levels, the market could witness a reversal of the current positive momentum. “Losing $107K and most definitely $105K more than a wick and my bias changes back to a sub $100K correction before anything else,” argued market analyst Mark Cullen. Cullen mentioned that the coin’s “ask liquidity” is already being tested during Wall Street’s Monday open, and that he sees a strong chance of an “up and down” movement cycle as the day continues. Oil and commodities heighten inflation worries Missile exchanges between Israel and Iran have pushed oil prices higher, feeding fears of inflationary spillovers. According to data from Trading Economics, WTI crude oil futures traded near $73 per barrel on Monday, pulling back slightly after climbing more than 5.5% earlier in the session and building on a 7% surge from Friday. The iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust ETF Chart. Source: The Market Mosaic The iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust ETF (GSG), which tracks a basket of raw materials, is now trading near the $23 resistance level, a threshold it has failed to breach for three years. “Commodities have the highest beta to rising inflation,” Market Mosaic analysts reckoned, pointing to oil derivatives like gas, which are heavily weighted in indexes. The energy sector, comprising just 3% of the S&P 500, is trading at a forward P/E ratio of just 14.6x. Some economists see potential for a short-term rally driven by rising prices even in the presence of long-term structural headwinds. Binance derivatives: Institutional hedging in play Investment data analytics platform Alphractal revealed on X that Bitcoin perpetual futures on Binance are currently trading $40 to $50 below the spot price. It asserted that in 2021–2022, this kind of discount “signaled a Bear Market.” “Today the scenario is different: we are at all-time highs and the discount in derivatives persists,” the platform concluded. Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson supported the sentiment, adding that: “If the BTC perpetual price difference on Binance turns positive again, it’s a sign that the price is about to explode.” He also propounded that institutions may be placing shorts to hedge or arbitrage, predicting it could lead to a market short squeeze. “Many institutions are already putting pressure through Shorts, which could be good for a possible short squeeze since they’re going against the OG Whales,” the CEO said.

Meanwhile, the Polyhedra Network's ZKJ token experienced a sharp and sudden 83% decline on Binance following a series of irregular transactions, prompting the exchange to adjust its Alpha Points rewards system. French Crypto TikToker Kidnapped and Released After Failing to Meet €50K Ransom Demand France's growing concerns over cryptocurrency-linked criminal activity intensified this week after a 26-year-old TikTok crypto trader was kidnapped in Juvisy-sur-Orge, a suburb of Paris, on Friday evening. The young trader, who reportedly has over 40,000 followers on TikTok, was abducted by a group of four assailants who demanded €50,000 (around $57,000) in cryptocurrency. The incident marks the latest in a disturbing series of crypto-related kidnappings across France. According to a report published Sunday by French radio station Europe 1, the trader was returning home when the group forced him into a stolen vehicle. The kidnappers physically assaulted him while attempting to extort crypto assets they believed he had access to. However, their plan quickly unraveled when they discovered that their victim lacked the funds to meet their demand. After showing the low balance in his wallet, the abductors released him the following day. The French Organized and Specialized Crime Division is now investigating the case, which adds to a growing list of violent incidents targeting individuals involved in the cryptocurrency sector. This incident is not isolated. Over the past several months, France has witnessed an alarming rise in kidnappings and extortion schemes targeting crypto entrepreneurs and their families. On May 13, a more audacious attempt was made against the family of Pierre Noizat , co-founder and CEO of French cryptocurrency exchange Paymium. Assailants tried to kidnap Noizat’s daughter and grandson in what authorities believe was another crypto-related extortion effort. Just ten days earlier, on May 3, Paris police intervened in a chilling case where the father of a crypto entrepreneur was held hostage for several days. The perpetrators reportedly severed one of the victim’s fingers in a horrific attempt to pressure the family into paying a €7 million ($7.8 million) ransom in crypto. French authorities later made multiple arrests in connection to the case, as confirmed by France 24. Crackdown Underway: Arrests and Charges Mount Authorities have been moving swiftly in recent weeks to dismantle the networks behind these crimes. On June 4, one of the alleged ringleaders of the kidnapping plots was arrested in Morocco. The man is suspected of coordinating multiple extortion attempts on French soil. More significantly, the Paris public prosecutor’s office charged 25 individuals on May 31 in relation to a series of crypto-focused abduction and extortion plots. Many of these suspects are believed to have direct ties to organized crime groups operating within and beyond France’s borders. The escalating violence has prompted the French government to take action. France’s interior minister reportedly held meetings with leaders in the country’s crypto industry to discuss improved security protocols and law enforcement coordination. There is growing recognition among French authorities that crypto entrepreneurs and influencers—especially those with a public profile—are becoming lucrative targets for criminal groups. Chainalysis CEO Michael Gronager recently commented on the wave of attacks in Paris, noting that criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated in tracking public blockchain wallets and monitoring social media posts to identify potential targets. A Cautionary Tale for Crypto Influencers The kidnapping of the TikTok crypto trader underscores a pressing reality for public-facing figures in the crypto space: visibility comes with risk. Many influencers regularly display their investment gains, portfolio snapshots, or wallet addresses in a bid to build trust and credibility with followers—but such transparency can attract the wrong kind of attention. Security experts urge crypto influencers to adopt strict privacy measures, avoid disclosing asset holdings publicly, and consider the use of cold storage wallets. Moreover, law enforcement agencies are encouraging victims or potential targets to report suspicious activity and seek guidance on personal security enhancements. Polyhedra Network (ZKJ) Crashes 83% in Hours Amid On-Chain Chaos and Liquidity Meltdown Meanwhile, the Polyhedra Network’s native token ZKJ suffered a dramatic collapse of over 83% on Sunday, June 15, after what Binance and project officials described as “abnormal on-chain transactions” and a liquidity crisis on the ZKJ/KOGE trading pair. The token's market cap was slashed by nearly $500 million in just a few hours, sending shockwaves across the crypto community and forcing Binance to revise rules around its Alpha Points rewards program. According to a public statement from the Polyhedra Network posted to X, the price drop occurred due to “a series of abnormal on-chain transactions within a very short period.” The incident, which took place on the ZKJ/KOGE pair, rapidly drained liquidity and set off a cascading liquidation of positions as large holders exited their positions. CoinGecko data shows ZKJ trading at $1.92 just before 2:00 am UTC on June 15. Within 90 minutes, the token had plunged 60% to $0.76. A brief rebound to $1.41 offered temporary relief before the price reversed again and continued downward. The most severe drop occurred around 9:25 pm UTC, when ZKJ nosedived from $0.77 to $0.32 — where it now trades flat, signaling a lack of renewed buying interest. ZKJ’s change in price (Source: CoinGecko ) The collapse not only wiped out nearly $500 million in market capitalization, but also ignited a flurry of speculation among traders and observers. Some pointed fingers at a recent token unlock, suggesting that insiders may have dumped their holdings. Others accused Polyhedra of engineering a rug pull, though no on-chain data or analysis from reputable platforms has substantiated these allegations so far. Binance Blames Liquidity Crunch, Adjusts Alpha Points Rules Binance responded swiftly to the turmoil, attributing the collapse of both ZKJ and KOGE to a “liquidation cascade” that was triggered when large token holders removed substantial amounts of liquidity. These actions reportedly destabilized the pair’s order book, causing rapid price slippage and margin calls across leveraged positions. To prevent further instability, Binance announced a critical change to its Alpha Points rewards program — a system designed to reward active participation in the Binance Wallet and Alpha ecosystem. The update, effective June 17, will exclude any trading volume between Alpha token pairs — such as ZKJ/KOGE — from contributing to Alpha Points calculations. According to Binance, the change aims to “reduce systemic risks of concentration” and promote market fairness. The Polyhedra Network, an interoperability protocol that leverages zero-knowledge proof technology for cross-chain messaging and identity verification, assured users that the incident had no bearing on the project’s core infrastructure or roadmap. In a statement, the team said they are “closely reviewing the situation” and will provide a full post-mortem in due course. Despite this assurance, investors remain shaken. The project’s social media pages and community channels have been flooded with concerned users demanding clarity about the suspected exploit or mismanagement. The Risks of On-Chain Volatility and Tokenomics While the full details behind the price collapse remain unclear, the situation highlights persistent vulnerabilities in low-liquidity trading pairs and the inherent risks of poorly timed token unlocks. Crypto traders and investors are increasingly vocal about the need for transparent tokenomics, better safeguards against wash trading, and more responsible incentive programs from exchanges. ZKJ’s pairing with KOGE, a relatively niche governance token tied to the BNB48 Club within the Binance ecosystem, may have further compounded the fragility of the trading pair. With few market makers and limited liquidity pools, the pair was susceptible to manipulation or panic exits by large whales.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-16 12:00:00

Ever wonder how the big players are moving their money in the digital asset space? Well, the latest data from CoinShares gives us a pretty clear picture, and it’s looking incredibly positive. We’re talking about a massive surge in crypto inflows that’s hitting significant milestones. What’s Driving These Massive Crypto Inflows? According to CoinShares’ latest fund flows report, digital asset investment products attracted a staggering $1.9 billion in inflows just last week. But that’s not the whole story – this marks the ninth consecutive week where we’ve seen positive momentum in these products. Think about that for a second: nine weeks straight of investors pouring money into crypto funds. This consistent trend suggests a deep-seated confidence that’s building in the market, extending beyond short-term pumps. This isn’t just a ripple; it’s a wave of capital entering the ecosystem through regulated and traditional investment vehicles, indicating growing institutional and accredited investor participation. The sheer volume underscores a significant shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. Bitcoin Inflows Lead the Charge – But How Much? Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin (BTC) remains the king of the crypto market, and its dominance is clearly reflected in the recent inflows. Of the $1.9 billion total, a whopping $1.3 billion was directed into Bitcoin investment products. This consistent demand for BTC is a powerful indicator. It suggests that many investors see Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but potentially as a long-term store of value or a hedge in the current economic climate. What could be fueling this continued appetite for Bitcoin? Several factors are likely at play: Spot ETF Success: The performance and accessibility of Bitcoin spot ETFs in various regions continue to attract significant capital from traditional investors. Halving Narrative: While the halving is behind us, the long-term supply shock narrative still resonates with investors looking at Bitcoin’s future scarcity. Macro Uncertainty: Despite geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed by some as an uncorrelated asset or ‘digital gold’. The sustained level of Bitcoin inflows highlights its position as the primary gateway for institutional capital entering the crypto space. Ethereum Inflows Hit a Major Milestone – What Does it Mean? While Bitcoin took the lion’s share, Ethereum (ETH) also had an exceptional week. The report shows Ethereum products attracted $583 million in inflows. This figure is particularly noteworthy because it represents Ethereum’s largest weekly inflow since February. This isn’t a small bump; it’s a significant surge that signals renewed interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency. Why the sudden spike in Ethereum inflows ? A major catalyst is likely the growing anticipation and regulatory progress surrounding potential spot Ethereum ETFs, particularly in the United States. The recent shifts in regulatory stance have injected significant optimism into the market regarding Ethereum’s future accessibility for traditional investors. Beyond ETF speculation, the strength of the Ethereum ecosystem itself continues to be a draw. Its role as the foundational layer for DeFi, NFTs, and numerous dApps makes it a crucial piece of the digital asset landscape. Increased Ethereum inflows suggest investors are betting not just on the token, but on the continued growth and utility of its network. Understanding Digital Asset Investment Trends Through CoinShares CoinShares is a prominent digital asset investment firm that regularly publishes reports tracking capital flows into various crypto investment products globally. Their CoinShares Report is widely watched by investors and analysts because it provides valuable insights into the sentiment and actions of institutional and sophisticated investors. The consistent positive flow captured in the latest CoinShares Report paints a picture of robust demand for digital assets, even amidst broader market volatility and rising geopolitical tensions. The fact that investors are choosing to increase their exposure to crypto and even traditional safe havens like gold simultaneously is an interesting dynamic worth observing. It suggests a complex risk assessment where digital assets are increasingly seen as part of a diversified portfolio strategy, potentially offering protection or growth uncorrelated with traditional markets. Here’s a quick look at the breakdown, based on the report’s highlights: Total Weekly Inflows: $1.9 Billion Consecutive Positive Weeks: 9 Bitcoin (BTC) Inflows: $1.3 Billion Ethereum (ETH) Inflows: $583 Million (Largest weekly inflow since February) Other Assets: While BTC and ETH dominate, other altcoins often see flows, though the report highlights these two significantly for the past week. This sustained positive trend in Digital Asset Investment products is a powerful signal of maturing market infrastructure and increasing investor comfort with crypto as an asset class. What Are the Implications and Actionable Insights? These consistent, large-scale inflows have several key implications: Bullish Sentiment Confirmation: The data strongly supports a prevailing bullish sentiment among larger investors. They are not just holding; they are actively increasing their positions. Market Stability: Sustained inflows can provide a level of support to the market, potentially absorbing selling pressure and contributing to price stability or upward movement. Mainstream Adoption: Money flowing into regulated products is a clear sign of increasing mainstream adoption by traditional investment circles. For individual investors, this data can be viewed as a confirmation of positive market trends, but it’s crucial to remember that inflows don’t guarantee future price movements. However, they do indicate strong underlying demand. Are There Any Challenges or Risks to Consider? While the inflow data is exciting, it’s important to remain balanced. Potential challenges include: Regulatory Headwinds: Changes in regulation could still impact the accessibility and appeal of digital asset products. Macroeconomic Shifts: Unexpected economic downturns or aggressive monetary policy changes could dampen investor enthusiasm. Market Volatility: Despite inflows, the crypto market remains inherently volatile and subject to sharp price swings. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Concluding Thoughts: A Streak Worth Watching The nine-week streak of positive Crypto Inflows , highlighted by the significant figures for Bitcoin and Ethereum in the latest CoinShares Report , is a compelling narrative for the digital asset space. It underscores robust and growing interest from a segment of the market that often represents larger pools of capital. As Digital Asset Investment continues to evolve, these inflow trends will remain a critical metric for understanding market sentiment and potential future movements. The resilience shown by investors, even when faced with global uncertainties, speaks volumes about the perceived value and potential of cryptocurrencies in today’s financial landscape.

Analyst Says $8 Breakout Is ‘Just Waiting’,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/still-sleeping-on-xrp-8-breakout-just-waiting/,"In a livestream on June 15, crypto analyst Cantonese Cat delivered a firm verdict on XRP’s prolonged consolidation: don’t be fooled by the sideways drift. Despite trading in a tight range for over half a year, the chart veteran argued XRP is building energy for a powerful move, one that could take it as high as $6 to $8 once it breaks out of its multi-month technical cage. XRP To $8? “This thing has been going sideways for seven months,” he said. “But the entire time, it’s just hugging this GAN line.” He referred to a long-standing monthly Gann arc structure that XRP has been grinding against since late 2024. In his interpretation, the repeated tests of that arc—combined with price holding above key support zones—signal strength rather than weakness. “It’s just waiting for its thing,” he added, implying that the eventual move could be sharp and sudden. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance Cantonese Cat highlighted that the current price action is sitting just beneath the next major Gann resistance level, which aligns closely with a Fibonacci extension target between $6 and $8. That arc, he believes, will be the trigger. “I think the next level is going to end up breaking up to the GAN arc up above,” he said, adding that a clean breach of this level could mark the start of XRP’s long-awaited parabolic run. He also pulled up the monthly Ichimoku Cloud, pointing out that XRP had already broken above it—a significant bullish milestone in Ichimoku analysis. “Initially it had a rejection of the Ichimoku cloud,” he explained, “and now we have a true breakout.” Most importantly, XRP has held the Tenkan and Kijun without falling back into the cloud. “This is basically a look of bullishness,” he noted, citing the textbook structure of a confirmed trend reversal. The broader structure, according to his analysis, is a classic breakout setup: a horizontal level was cleared, back-tested, and is now serving as support. “You’re basically breaking above a horizontal level here and back testing it. And so far, you’re holding it pretty convincingly.” To reinforce his thesis, he pointed to Fibonacci retracements—specifically, XRP’s behavior around the 0.86 level, which the asset has been flirting with. “If you’re able to convincingly break above 0.86 here,” he said, “then all-time high stuff could happen.” Asked by viewers why the market isn’t moving yet, he dismissed the apparent stagnation as noise. “It’s just going sideways, guys,” he said. “It’s just waiting for its thing.” In his view, the lack of momentum is not a sign of weakness, but rather a signal that XRP is compressing in a low-volatility zone—a typical prelude to a high-volatility expansion. “Whenever it decides to get done with this shenanigans,” he added, “it’s probably going to go up.” Despite XRP’s muted performance while other assets like Bitcoin and Solana have captured headlines, Cantonese Cat made clear that he sees no structural damage on the chart. Quite the opposite: he views the persistent adherence to long-term support levels, especially on the monthly timeframe, as an indication that XRP is simply coiling beneath resistance. Related Reading: XRP Has A 70% Shot To Beat Bitcoin, Says Analyst In a cycle increasingly defined by breakout-driven flows and rotational capital, he framed XRP’s dormancy not as a failure, but as a delayed opportunity. “Still holding the Tenkan and Kijun just fine,” he said. “This is what bullish looks like.” The analyst didn’t offer a date, but was blunt about the price levels to watch. If XRP clears the monthly Gann arc and maintains strength above the 0.86 Fibonacci zone, the $6–$8 range comes into play—levels that would not only exceed previous all-time highs, but also flip sentiment from apathy to euphoria in a matter of weeks. Until then, he warned, XRP’s breakout might not announce itself loudly. But when it comes, few will be positioned. “Still sleeping on XRP?” he asked. “You might want to wake up soon.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.20 Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",XRP News|xrp|xrp news|XRP Price|XRP Price Analysis|XRP Technical Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-06-16 12:00:38

A recent survey offers fascinating insights into their market expectations, overall sentiment, and notably, their views on the potential introduction of a won-backed stablecoin in the South Korea crypto market. Understanding the Latest Crypto Market Sentiment Conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos between June 10 and 13, this survey tracks weekly trends among South Korean cryptocurrency holders. The latest results indicate a slight shift in expectations compared to the previous week. When asked about the expected movement of Bitcoin (BTC) value this week: 37.0% expect an increase or significant jump (down from 41.7% last week). 36.0% predict a stable market (up significantly from 25.3% last week). 27.0% anticipate a decline or sharp drop (down from 33.0% previously). This data suggests a move towards cautious stability rather than strong bullishness among those providing a Bitcoin price forecast . Delving deeper into the overall crypto market sentiment , the survey found: 41.4% expressed optimism or extreme optimism. 39.0% felt neutral. 19.6% indicated fear or extreme fear. While optimism still holds the largest share, the significant portion feeling neutral or fearful highlights the current uncertainty prevalent in the market, despite a tempered outlook on price declines. Why the Interest in a Won-Backed Stablecoin? Perhaps one of the most interesting findings revolves around the potential launch of a won-backed stablecoin . This type of digital currency would be pegged in value to the South Korean Won (KRW), aiming to provide price stability. The survey asked Korean crypto investors for their opinions on this concept, revealing a divided but notably supportive response: Support: The largest group, 34.9%, stated they support the idea. This suggests a significant portion of the market sees value in a stable digital asset tied to their local currency. Opposition: 28.1% dismissed the idea, viewing it as unnecessary and potentially harmful to the existing market dynamics. Concerns might include potential over-regulation or competition with existing crypto assets. Indifference: 25.2% were indifferent, primarily focusing on whether crypto prices would rise regardless of a stablecoin’s existence. For this group, the stablecoin’s utility is secondary to speculative gains. No Interest: 11.8% had no interest in the issue at all, perhaps indicating a focus purely on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether. The fact that over a third of respondents support the creation of a won-backed stablecoin is a compelling data point for regulators and potential issuers considering such a move in the South Korea crypto space. What Do These Results Tell Us? The survey paints a picture of a maturing South Korea crypto market where participants are adjusting their expectations. The decreased bullishness on Bitcoin and the increased prediction for stability could reflect recent market consolidation. The mixed but significant support for a won-backed stablecoin indicates a potential demand for stable, locally-pegged digital assets, which could facilitate easier entry and exit from the crypto market using the Won, or provide a safe haven during volatility without leaving the crypto ecosystem entirely. This data provides valuable insights for exchanges, project developers, and policymakers operating within or looking to enter the Korean market. Understanding the nuanced sentiment and specific desires, like the interest in a won-backed stablecoin , is crucial for navigating this dynamic landscape. Conclusion The latest survey of Korean crypto investors highlights a market that is cautiously optimistic, with a significant portion predicting stability for Bitcoin this week. Crucially, it reveals a notable level of support for the concept of a won-backed stablecoin , suggesting potential demand for stable digital assets tied to the local currency. As the South Korea crypto market continues to evolve, these insights into investor sentiment and specific interests, like the desire for a reliable Bitcoin price forecast and stable local alternatives, will be key drivers of future developments.

Per CoinShares’ most recent digital asset funds report , crypto investment products recorded $1.9 billion in inflows over the past week, marking their ninth consecutive week of gains. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominated with $1.3 billion in inflows, staging a comeback following two weeks of underperformance and despite the sharp dip it suffered in the wake of the Iran-Israel geopolitical tensions . Ethereum ( ETH ) followed suit, albeit with a more modest $583 million, which marked its largest record since February. Altcoins also saw renewed interest. XRP ( XRP ) registered $11.8 million in fresh inflows after several weeks of declines, likely driven by the recent streak of wins across the ecosystem. Similarly, Sui ( SUI ) pulled in approximately $3.5 million in a positive display, followed by Solana ( SOL ) with $1.3 million. You might also like: Bitcoin nears all-time highs, but Google search interest is near a 5-year low. Why? Regionally, the United States dominated the inflows, accounting for majority of the $1.9 billion total. Smaller but still notable inflows were also seen in Switzerland, Germany, and Canada. In contrast, Brazil and Hong Kong recorded minor outflows, signaling more cautious sentiment in those markets. Meanwhile, derivatives data shows that traders are growing increasingly bullish on near-term price action. According to Glassnode’s analytics, Bitcoin’s 25 Delta Skew, a key measure of sentiment in the options market, has flipped positive. https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1934525675509297594?s=46 Short-dated options recorded the biggest swing, with the 1-week skew jumping from -2.6% to +10.1%, and the 1-month skew rising from -2.2% to +4.9%. The data suggests traders are positioning for an upside in the near term, anticipating that Bitcoin’s price could continue climbing. If this momentum holds, the crypto king could soon climb back to its $110,000 level. The market’s optimism aligns with the broader positive outlook for Bitcoin, fueled by growing adoption and its recent strong performance. BTC trades slightly over $106,800 at press time, a 1.6% increase in the last 24 hours as it continues to rebound from its recent pullback.

AMetaplanet Inc., a Japanese firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin ( BTC ) accumulation strategy, has overtaken chipmaker Kioxia Holdings Corp. in market capitalization, hitting over ¥1 trillion ($6.9 billion) after its stock surged nearly 400% in under two months. This surge has also pushed the firm ahead of prominent Japanese companies like Screen Holdings and Tokyo Metro in terms of valuation. The latest 26% jump came Monday after Metaplanet disclosed it purchased ¥16.9 billion in Bitcoin. The acquisition was funded by a newly issued \$210 million bond to EVO Fund, as announced on June 16.

The token remained elevated throughout the past week, attracting over 25% gains. The market conditions surrounding the token hint towards a bullish continuation, as the traders have shown huge optimism about the upcoming HYPE price action. Besides, the technicals and the chart patterns suggest the token will remain within the discovery phase for a long time. Hyperliquid CEX: Open Interest Marks New Highs Open interest is one of the important indicators that reflect the mindset of the market participants who bet on the upcoming price action, i.e., the futures. The open interest has marked a new ATH, suggesting a steep rise in the trading activity and new money entering the platform. More traders are entering positions, either long or short, while the market is becoming more active and potentially more liquid. As per the data from Coinglass, the OI has been rising along with the price and has reached over $1.83 billion. The OI has been on a steady rise, which suggests a consistent rise in the traders’ interest in the token. The rise in the OI combined with the rise in the price suggests the traders are bullish on HYPE which could keep the levels elevated. Future Trade Count & Volume Raises Concerns The future trade count is the number of trades for HYPE on the exchanges, while the future volume refers to the USD volume. Both of them have been dropping extensively over the past couple of days, which could raise some concerns. The data from Messari.io displays a massive drop just before the price rose high to mark a new ATH above $44. Despite a new ATH, the levels failed to rebound, which suggests the future trades may have halted, placing their bets. This also indicates that the traders may be done with placing their bets, and as a result, the levels have dropped back to the initial levels. What’s Next? Will HYPE Price Reach $50 in the Next 24 Hours? Hyperliquid price has broken all the barriers and has officially entered the discovery phase. The token has also withstood a significant correction, which suggests the price is now under an acute bullish influence. While the technicals remain bullish, the Hyperliquid price is now believed to maintain a steep upswing and eventually continue to discover new highs. As seen in the above chart, the price has maintained a steep ascending trend and surpassed the 1 FIB level at $43.6. With this, the token has unlocked the possibility of reaching the 1.2 FIB at $52.99, crossing the pivotal resistance at $50. The MACD displays a bullish divergence while the CMF has entered the positive range after rebounding from the interim lows. With this, the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price is expected to maintain a healthy upswing, while the drop in volume could raise some concerns.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-16 12:16:35

As per data from CoinShares, this performance brings year-to-date inflows to a record $13.2 billion despite ongoing geopolitical concerns weighing on global risk assets during the period. Bitcoin leads crypto inflows with $1.3 billion recovery Bitcoin recorded $1.3 billion in inflows last week and has shown a strong recovery after experiencing two weeks of minor outflows. This substantial inflow helped drive the overall positive performance across digital asset investment products during the period. Short-bitcoin products also saw small inflows of $3.7 million. However, the total assets under management for these products remain low at $96 million. Bitcoin inflows helped the cryptocurrency rebound from weekly lows of $102,800 to $107,000, despite initial market instability. Ethereum maintained positive momentum with $583 million in inflows and recorded its largest weekly inflow since February. The performance included Ethereum’s strongest single-day inflow during that timeframe. This has brought its cumulative inflows during the recent run to $2 billion, which accounts for 14% of assets under management. Crypto asset flow rate.

Multi-asset products lost $14 million, while Solana had moderate inflows of $1.8 million. XRP attracted $11.8 million, and Sui continued its pace with $3.5 million in weekly inflows. Litecoin had a little outflow of $0.1 million, while Cardano received $0.4 million in inflows. The week’s inflows helped to lift the nine-week run total to $12.9 billion. As per the data , year-to-date flows reached the $13.2 billion level across all digital asset investment products. United States dominates regional inflows The United States led global cryptocurrency investment flows with $1.921 billion in inflows during the week and accounted for the majority of total digital asset investment activity. Canada recorded $12.1 million in inflows, with month-to-date flows reaching $21.8 million and year-to-date totals of $157 million. Germany attracted $39.2 million weekly inflows and has contributed to $88.3 million month-to-date and $908 million year-to-date flows. Switzerland saw $20.7 million in weekly inflows and has brought month-to-date flows to $40.5 million. Australia maintained positive momentum with $9.2 million in weekly inflows and $15.8 million month-to-date, reaching $123 million year-to-date.

Hong Kong faced outflows of $56.8 million during the week, with month-to-date outflows reaching $97.3 million and year-to-date outflows of $24 million. Brazil also recorded outflows of $8.5 million weekly and $17.1 million month-to-date. However, it maintained positive year-to-date flows of $44 million.

Total global flows reached $1.917 billion for the week, $2.121 billion month-to-date, and $13.238 billion year-to-date across all regions and investment products. Bitcoin’s resilience amid geopolitical tensions supports institutional narrative Bitcoin remained resilient amid escalating tensions in the Middle East, shunning pure panic selling typical of geopolitical tensions. A QCP report indicated that, after initial market jitters over Iran-Israel headlines, Bitcoin rebounded from weekly lows of $102,800 to $107,000. The report further indicated the same bounces for leading large-cap tokens and US equity futures. Institutional demand was behind Bitcoin’s stubborn price action amid the chaotic period. Firms like Strategy and Metaplanet kept buying on dips, while spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their seventh straight week of inflows. The cryptocurrency maintained its position above the crucial psychological level of $100,000 despite initial shock at geopolitical events. Friday’s modest 3% loss was a far cry from April 2024, when Bitcoin fell more than 8% following similar Iran-Israel tensions. The continued comparison helped reinforce Bitcoin’s enhanced stability in the face of geopolitical tensions compared to previous cycles. Volatility measures were subdued in the face of rising geopolitical risk. Implied volatility in the Bitcoin frontend was below 40, with the VIX at approximately 20, both all-time lows in the context of what is transpiring. US Treasuries and Asian government bonds experienced inflows, indicating that markets were not entirely in risk-off. Possible risks are Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz potentially inducing oil price shocks, or explicit US military action potentially significantly displacing global risk assets. But other commentators think that those risks are also likely to prove structurally bullish for Bitcoin. QCP observed that Bitcoin’s recent price action is favorable to the narratives that Bitcoin adoption is enabled by macro dislocation, increasing sovereign debt, and geopolitical tension.

Understanding local sentiment can offer unique insights. This week, we’re diving into the fascinating world of the Korean crypto market , specifically looking at which digital assets captured the most attention. What’s Driving Conversation in the Korean Crypto Community? The Korean crypto community is known for its active participation and influence on certain token prices. Keeping an eye on their interests can be incredibly insightful. Data from Bitcoin World between June 6 and 12 gives us a snapshot of which tokens were at the forefront of discussions and research. We’re looking at two key metrics: Top 10 Searched Tokens: What are people actively researching or looking up? This often indicates potential new interest or investigation into a project. Top 10 Mentioned Tokens: What are people talking about? This can reflect recent news, price movements, or general sentiment within the community. Exploring Top Crypto Searches in South Korea When it comes to actively searching for information, the data from South Korea crypto users on Bitcoin World reveals some familiar faces alongside a few surprises. Here are the tokens that saw the highest search volumes during the specified week: Rank Token Search Volume 1 XRP 49,175 2 ETH 21,087 3 BTC 15,217 4 RVN 11,528 5 ONDO 9,474 6 SOL 8,595 7 UXLINK 6,816 8 STX 5,721 9 MASK 5,442 10 BORA 4,781 It’s notable that XRP holds the top spot by a significant margin. While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) consistently rank high globally, XRP often sees amplified interest in the South Korea crypto scene. This could be due to various factors, including ongoing legal developments or specific community dynamics. RVN (Ravencoin) and ONDO appearing in the top 5 also highlights specific interests within this market, perhaps related to mining, RWA (Real World Assets), or recent news surrounding these projects. Beyond Search: Top Crypto Mentions in the K-Community Searches tell us what people are looking for, but mentions tell us what they are actively discussing. The list of crypto mentions Korea shows a slightly different picture within the K-Community crypto space: Rank Token Mention Count 1 BTC 1,515 2 ETH 755 3 XRP 225 4 TRUMP 194 5 SOL 161 6 ANIME 89 7 RVN 71 8 MASK 70 9 AXL 65 10 ONDO 52 Here, BTC and ETH reclaim their dominant positions, suggesting they are the foundational topics of discussion. XRP is still present but drops to third. The appearance of tokens like TRUMP, ANIME, and AXL in the mentions list, despite some not being in the top searches, indicates specific narratives, news events, or niche interests driving conversation within the Korean crypto community during this period. RVN and ONDO appear on both lists, showing consistent interest across both search and discussion. Understanding Top Crypto Trends Korea: Key Insights Analyzing both the top crypto searches Korea and the crypto mentions Korea gives us a more complete picture of the sentiment and focus within the South Korea crypto scene. While core assets like BTC and ETH are constant topics, regional factors and specific project developments clearly influence interest in tokens like XRP, RVN, and ONDO. The mentions list also reveals the impact of trending narratives, as seen with tokens like TRUMP and ANIME appearing prominently. For anyone interested in the dynamics of the Korean crypto market , monitoring these local trends is crucial. It highlights which projects are gaining traction and where community energy is being directed. Summary: What Did We Learn About the Korean Crypto Market Last Week?

The Byreal DEX will be built on the Solana blockchain, and its testnet version is expected to go live by the end of June. The blockchain selection appears to have been well-received by the market, as SOL , Solana’s native token, surged over 7% following the announcement. “Not Just Another DEX”: Bybit’s First-Ever Solana Exchange Coming Q3 2025 In a June 15 post on X, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou stated that Byreal isn’t “just another DEX,” explaining that it combines “CEX-grade liquidity with DeFi-native transparency.” Announcing Byreal — our first onchain DEX incubated by Bybit, will be LIVE by end of the month.

Request for Quote (RFQ) is a process whereby buyers or sellers request price quotations from potential suppliers or service providers to identify the best available price. With Byreal built on Solana, the DEX can request cryptocurrency prices from platforms like Raydium, Jupiter, and Meteora , enabling traders to select optimal pricing. Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) is a type of Automated Market Maker (AMM) used in decentralized finance (DeFi) that allows liquidity providers to allocate capital within specific price ranges rather than across the entire price spectrum. According to Zhou, Byreal is designed to provide users with low-slippage and MEV-protected swaps at high speed. The Byreal team stated that the upcoming DEX is built to “turn fragmented liquidity into unified opportunity.” 5/ Byreal is built to turn fragmented liquidity into unified opportunity.

The crypto exchange has now expanded beyond digital assets to offer trading in blue-chip U.S. stocks such as Apple and MicroStrategy, along with commodities such as gold and crude oil.

For Bitcoin Solaris, that moment is now. As the broader market warms up to innovation again, one project has managed to draw attention not just with promises, but with working systems, advanced tech, and explosive momentum. BTC-S isn’t positioning itself as a speculative meme, it’s aiming to become the ultimate alternative to Bitcoin. At just $8 today and a roadmap heading for $20 at launch, the window to act is rapidly shrinking. Why Bitcoin Solaris Could Surpass Expectations Bitcoin Solaris is not just a fork or another fast chain. It’s a purpose-built, dual-layer ecosystem combining Bitcoin-grade decentralization with Solana-level speed. While other projects offer singular improvements, BTC-S delivers a full-stack transformation. From universal mining to DeFi tools, it’s created for real users, not just whales or devs. At its core: Dual-layer architecture fuses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) Base Layer with a blazing-fast Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Solaris Layer. The network supports over 10,000 TPS with 2-second finality, rivaling the fastest blockchains in existence. Energy usage is reduced by 99.95% compared to Bitcoin, making it eco-friendly and accessible. Smart contracts are written in Rust and support advanced DeFi, NFT, and enterprise applications. And it’s more than specs, the upcoming Solaris Nova App allows mining from mobile, removing barriers to entry and making wealth-generation as simple as tapping a screen. Real Value, Not Just Hype While Bitcoin built the foundation, it never scaled for mainstream use. BTC-S picks up where Bitcoin left off: Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Consensus PoW PoW + DPoS Block Time 10 minutes 15 seconds (Solaris) TPS ~7 10,000+ Energy Usage High 99.95% lower Smart Contracts No Yes (Rust-based) Mining Accessibility Expensive hardware Mobile + desktop mining Beyond its tech, BTC-S also offers tiered user rewards via the integrated Bitcoin Solaris Casino , where users enjoy daily spins, token bonuses, and a shot at winning up to 0.5 BTC for high-tier purchases. It’s an engaging addition that merges crypto economics with fun, without straying from the ecosystem’s core mission. Why Crypto Veterans Are Quietly Loading Up on Bitcoin Solaris Tokenomics That Make Sense Bitcoin Solaris follows a deflationary, utility-driven model: Total Supply: 21 million BTC-S (same as Bitcoin) Mining Allocation: 66.66% Presale: 20% Ecosystem & Liquidity: 13.34% Such a distribution ensures long-term decentralization and rewards real contributors over speculators. It’s designed to grow with demand, not crash from unlock dumps. Why Everyone’s Talking About It Crypto Twitter, Telegram groups, and YouTube are already heating up around BTC-S. Influencers like 2Bit Crypto are publishing deep-dive reviews on why this may be the best altcoin bet before the next bull wave. Their consensus? It’s the rare blend of usability, innovation, and timing. Additionally, third-party audits by Cyberscope and Freshcoins confirm a high-security standard for the platform’s codebase and contracts adding credibility and attracting more serious capital into the ecosystem. Presale Phase: One of the Shortest in Crypto History We’re now in Phase 8, with the current price at $8. Just a step away from its launch price of $20. With only weeks left until the July 31 launch, this is one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the space. Next Price Tier: $9 Bonus: 8% additional tokens Current Raised: $4.5M+ User Base: 11,500+ participants already in If you’re waiting, the numbers say others aren’t. It’s rare to see such velocity and community traction before a token even hits exchanges. For those who missed the early Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Solaris presale might just be redemption. Final Verdict Bitcoin Solaris isn’t promising to replace Bitcoin, it’s evolving it. With blazing speed, eco-conscious design, real-world use cases, and mobile-first mining, BTC-S rewrites the playbook on what a modern crypto should look like. It’s already halfway through its presale climb, and the time to act is rapidly closing. This isn’t just about speculation. It’s about being part of a new financial layer before the world catches up.

Source: Cryptonews This remarkable ascent comes despite global market uncertainty stemming from the ongoing Israeli-Iran conflict , which has kept Bitcoin’s recovery modest at just 1.6% since hostilities began. Hyperliquid: One of The Fastest-Growing Crypto Companies The explosive growth reflects the broader success of Hyperliquid’s perpetual exchange ecosystem, which has processed over $4 billion daily perpetual trading volume while maintaining $1.888 billion in total value locked across its DeFi protocols. Source: DeFiLlama The token’s meteoric rise builds upon momentum established just six days earlier, when HYPE first breached the $40 threshold on June 10 . It climbed from a $3 billion market cap to its current $14.8 billion valuation faster than most analysts anticipated. The platform’s fundamental strength is evidenced by its dominant position in the decentralized perpetual trading space, having recorded $248 billion in trading activity during May 2025 alone . This volume represents nearly triple the combined activity of the next ten largest decentralized perpetual platforms, all because of its high leverage offerings of up to 40x. The ecosystem’s robust health is further demonstrated by its stablecoin market cap of $3.734 billion, daily application revenue of $1.11 million, and bridged total value locked of $4.684 billion. Hype All-Time High: Whale Games and Capital Magnet Drive Massive Rally The current price surge has been significantly influenced by sophisticated whale activity. On-chain data reveal strategic accumulation patterns that have created a feedback loop of demand and price appreciation. One notable whale purchased 259,367 HYPE tokens for $9.976 million at an average price of $38.46, with this investor reportedly realizing over $10 million in lifetime profits from HYPE trades. 2 whales bought 385,720 $HYPE ($14.9M) in the past 3 hours. 0x7E4E spent 9.97M $USDC to buy 259,367 $HYPE at $38.5. 0x5dE5 spent 4.94M $USDC to buy 126,353 $HYPE at $39.1 and staked it. https://t.co/PwHnsKCDhs https://t.co/YjRdr0ujwb pic.twitter.com/DGEjeQaBBX — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 10, 2025 Market sentiment analysis reveals overwhelming bullishness, with social media posts expressing unanimous confidence in HYPE’s trajectory toward the psychological $50 barrier and beyond. The Chaikin Money Flow indicator shows strong capital inflows following a period of outflows that had driven the metric to two-month lows, signaling renewed investor confidence. However, liquidation mapping reveals potential volatility ahead, with approximately $3.15 million in long positions vulnerable to liquidation should the price drop to $36.20 and break the critical $40.14 support level. Technical Analysis Points to Continued Upside Potential From a technical perspective, HYPE has confirmed multiple bullish breakout patterns that suggest substantial upside potential remains intact. On June 9, the token successfully broke out of a bullish pennant formation, followed by a rally above a bull flag pattern developed over the previous week. Most significantly, HYPE breached the critical resistance zone at $35.13, which represented the upper boundary of a long-term cup-and-handle pattern that began forming in December 2024. This marked a crucial technical milestone for sustained upward movement. The Elliott Wave analysis reveals a compelling narrative. HYPE appears to complete a five-wave impulse sequence, with current price action potentially representing the final wave 5 of the broader bullish cycle. The wave structure shows clean impulsive characteristics with minimal overlapping, indicating strong underlying demand and limited supply pressure. Momentum indicators strongly support the bullish outlook, with MACD and RSI lines trending higher on shorter timeframes. This suggests strengthening upward momentum and increased buying pressure. HYPE appears positioned for further upside potential given the successful breach of major resistance and the establishment of new all-time highs. The immediate target zone would likely be in the $50-55 range, representing a Fibonacci extension from the recent wave structure. However, traders should monitor for any signs of exhaustion near current levels, as the asset has experienced a parabolic move from the $12-15 support base established in March-April. More ambitious projections using the 161.80% extension target $67, while the 261.80% extension reaches toward $102, aligning with social media speculation about HYPE’s potential to reach $100 by year-end. However, risks remain as whale positioning data from Coinglass shows 49.09% of total positions and over 51.8% of margin currently allocated to shorts, indicating some institutional caution at current levels. This positioning may contribute to short-term volatility as whales often hedge exposure at key resistance levels. The key support level to monitor remains the $40.14 threshold, as any sustained break below this level would invalidate the current bullish outlook and potentially signal the start of a deeper correction phase.

That’s a massive 210K $BTC. This move underlines the larger adoption shift that we’ve been seeing in the last year: from Strategy to MARA and countries like El Salvador hoarding Bitcoin. And with yet another strong indicator of the financial market’s faith in Bitcoin, one presale might just become the focal point of investors all around the world. Bitcoin Hyper’s Bitcoin Layer-2 (L2) could be the next crypto to explode given its first-mover advantage, strong utility, and promising presale progress so far. Let’s dig into today’s news and see how it pans out for crypto. Metaplanet Becomes a Bitcoin Leader in Its Own Right Metaplanet announced on X that it bought an additional 1,112 $BTC for $117.2M , This means the company has reached its 2025 goal of increasing its holdings to 10K $BTC. Of course, 10K $BTC is still a far cry from 210K, which is going to take a lot of capital. However, Metaplanet’s board has also greenlit a $210M bond deal with Cayman Islands investment firm EVO Fund. The zero-interest bonds are set to mature in December and the cash from the sale is earmarked for more $BTC buys. The company has also announced plans to issue up to 555M new shares in a bid to raise $5.3B . Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet, describes this as ‘Asia’s largest-ever equity raise dedicated to Bitcoin.’ Through our 555 Million Plan, Metaplanet is doubling down on a high-conviction, equity-driven capital markets strategy to accelerate our Bitcoin accumulation trajectory. — Metaplanet, Bitcoin Plan Metaplanet also reafirrmed Strategy’s position that $BTC-backed securities are an essential link between old and new finances. The company also said that, as Bitcoin is ‘dematerializing’ the $300T store-of-value market, Metaplanet will capture 1% of it. The Future Is Looking Bright for Crypto In more good news for crypto, the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) has announced that the SEC has approved its Bitcoin Treasury plan. This means the company can use the $2.3B raised from 50 institutional investors to buy $BTC. According to the registration statement , this is ‘one of the largest Bitcoin treasury deals for a public company.’ The same statement allows investors to resell ~56M equity shares and 29M shares tied to convertible notes. Trump Media is the publicly listed company behind the Truth Social platform, streaming service Truth+, and the soon-to-be-launched fintech Truth.fi. What That Could Mean For Bitcoin Hyper You’ve no doubt heard it before – what’s good for Bitcoin is good for the entire crypto market. But one of the best altcoins of the year stands to benefit more than others. That’s Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the meme coin behind an innovative Bitcoin L2 platform. The Bitcoin blockchain scores top marks when it comes to security. But in terms of speed and transaction fees, it pales in comparison to the likes of Solana, which is renowned for its speed and low transaction costs. That’s exactly what $HYPER will tackle with its L2 ecosystem. Incorporating Bitcoin’s excellent security protocols, it adds further scalability to ensure speedy sub-second transactions and near-zero gas fees. Simply put, Bitcoin Hyper uses a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge to move a wrapped version of your $BTC to the L2 platform for trading, staking, or DeFi. All transactions are verified with zero-knowledge proofs, and you can withdraw your $BTC at any time. And because Bitcoin Hyper is built on the Solana Virtual Machine , that means seamless integration with Solana products. It’s a win-win for $HYPER holders. Whether you’re a dev, builder, or degen, that cross-chain compatibility means instant access to dApps and DeFi. Investor Frenzy For An L2 Solution The $HYPER presale kicked off in May, but it’s already raised $1.3M, signaling strong investor interest. Furthermore, the impressive staking rewards, which currently stand at 576%, are no doubt sweetening the deal. Right now 1 $HYPER costs $0.0119, but that will increase with each new presale stage (in less than 7 hours). If you want to buy $HYPER at its early-bird price, now’s the time. Once the presale ends, the project team plans to list $HYPER on DEXs and CEXs simultaneously – most likely towards the end of the year. And as is often the case, we expect a decent hike in value when $HYPER lists. Strong tokenomics (~55% of the total token supply allocated to development and treasury) are also a good sign of this coin’s long-term success. Be sure to check out our $HYPER price prediction to see what may lie in store for what could become one of the best new meme coins on presale . Bitcoin Has Everyone Watching Its Every Move The cryptoverse is an exciting place to be in at the moment, with Bitcoin’s price on the up. Buoyed by its growing recognition as a legitimate currency by the likes of Metaplanet and Trump Media, the crypto king is bound to push the market higher. And the knock-on effect of that positive market sentiment could also see the best new meme coins – among them Bitcoin Hyper – explode in the near future. Remember to DYOR first, though, before taking the plunge.

This bullish outlook comes as Bitcoin holds above the $100,000 mark, recovering from a brief sell-off triggered by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. As of press time, the leading digital currency was trading at $106,679, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours, although down nearly 3% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Prediction markets set Bitcoin price Regarding price prediction, the most likely scenario is that Bitcoin ends 2025 at around $120,000, with traders assigning a 76% probability of that outcome, according to data retrieved by Finbold from the crypto prediction platform Polymarket on June 16, Meanwhile, Polymarket traders are giving Bitcoin a 57% chance of reaching at least $130,000 and a 32% probability of hitting $150,000. For Bitcoin to reach $150,000, it would need to rally by about 40% from its current price. On the other hand, more aggressive price targets have attracted far less confidence. In this case, predictions for Bitcoin to trade at $200,000 or $250,000 stand at just 13% and 8%, respectively. The lowest confidence bet is a spike to $1 million, with only a 3% chance. On the other hand, the markets don’t seem to expect a severe correction. The odds of Bitcoin falling to $70,000 or lower are just 26%, while the probability of a plunge back to $20,000 is only 5%. Bitcoin price prediction for December 31, 2025. Source: Polymarket Institutions show more interest in Bitcoin For now, sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. Bitcoin appears to be regaining strength following Thursday’s sell-off linked to the Israel-Iran conflict. On Monday, the asset briefly reclaimed the $107,000 level, although traders remain cautious amid ongoing regional instability. Still, institutional demand is helping to support the price. Notably, Japan’s first and only publicly listed Bitcoin treasury company has added 1,100 BTC to its holdings. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) saw total inflows of $1.37 billion last week, signaling continued investor interest.

This surge supports Wintermute founder Evgeny Gaevoy’s earlier statement. In early June, he remarked that the debate between Jeff Yan and CZ on X was a clever promotion for Hyperliquid. This strategy has clearly paid off, boosting the HYPE price. Unlike many altcoins, Hyperliquid shows strong optimism. The HYPE price has gained significant momentum, especially after the Binance listing announcement on June 3rd. Currently, it has reached an all-time high of $44.80, marking a remarkable 385% gain in Q2 2025. In just ten days, the price action surpassed May’s high of $39 and is now in price discovery mode. This upward trend aligns with a notable increase in USDC inflows, rising from $2.72 billion to $2.957 billion, per DUNE analytics . Even, Hyperliquid’s overall metrics are improving. In H1 2025, it has emerged as the top DEX based on derivatives volume. Keep reading to know more. Intraday 12% Blast In HYPE Price Explained In the intraday session, the HYPE price surged nearly 12%, reaching a new all-time high of $44.80. This price movement has entered a price discovery phase, benefiting a whale with a 4x leveraged long position. According to OnChain Lens, the whale’s floating profit exceeded $13.7 million at that time. Just In: $HYPE hits a new ATH, surpassing $44.4. The whale holding a $HYPE long position with 4x leverage now enjoys a floating profit of over $13.7M. https://t.co/MFqAOlP7BF pic.twitter.com/znnq9zZ79S — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) June 16, 2025 With this whale activity, HYPE crypto is now targeting the 10th spot held by Cardano, which has a market cap of $22 billion. Is $100 The Big Goal? Currently, HYPE crypto ranks 11th with nearly $14 billion. This makes a gap between HYPE and ADA around $8 billion, but if the bullish trend continues, this gap could close quickly by year end. Looking ahead, HYPE price has been on a high-hgh structure in Q2 with recent symmetrical breakout pushed for a new journey ahead. Similarly, the potential to rally further in 2025 has higher odds, driven by increased adoption of its decentralized applications and appealing financial incentives. In a bullish scenario, the price could decisively break above $50, possibly reaching the fibonacci level of 1.618 at $65 level, and more efforts could push it to Fibonacci 2.618 targets, which aligns with the psychological $100 mark. However, profit-taking could prompt bulls to defend key support levels at $39 and $30.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-16 12:28:35

These scalability issues prevent Ethereum to support high-throughput decentralized applications (dApps), and investors are looking forward to the best Layer 1 alternatives that can offer better performance and cost-effectiveness. Although it is a major improvement, the Pectra upgrade does not solve the scalability problem in Ethereum completely, which is why new platforms such as Kaanch Network can take the crown as the best Layer 1 blockchain. Kaanch Network: The Best Layer 1 Contender Kaanch Network is becoming the most promising Layer 1 blockchain, and it will be more successful than Ethereum due to its superior infrastructure and orientation towards the tokenization of real-world assets. Kaanch tokens are currently in stage 6 of its presale and are currently selling at a price of 0.32 and will increase to 0.64 in the next stage. With a presale of more than 2,220,190, the presale is an indication of how investors trust Kaanch as the most promising Layer 1 investment. Kaanch has a fixed supply of 58 million tokens, which makes it scarce, and therefore, more valuable. Tokens may be bought with ETH or USDT, and live staking provides up to 30 percent annual percentage yield (APY). Kaanch smart contracts have been audited by SpyWolf and VerifyLab, which guarantees transparency and safety, which makes it the most suitable Layer 1 blockchain to use as a developer and investor. Unmatched Performance Makes Kaanch the Best Layer 1 Kaanch Network is the fastest and most scalable blockchain that makes it the most suitable Layer 1 blockchain. It supports 1.4 million transactions per second (TPS) and 0.8-second finality, which allows trading instantly and running smart contracts smoothly. Kaanch also provides the near-zero gas fees unlike Ethereum, which is a cost-efficient solution to dApps, microtransactions, and payments. With 3,600 decentralized nodes, Kaanch guarantees secure and real-time transactions, and it has attracted the best traders who have seen its potential to transform Layer 1 performance. All these technical merits put Kaanch on the top of Layer 1 blockchain to use in high-performance applications. Real World Asset Tokenization: Kaanch is the Best Layer 1 Kaanch Network is the most promising Layer 1 blockchain because it has chosen to tokenize real-world assets such as gold and real estate, which is the trend in decentralized finance (DeFi) and enterprise adoption. This hands-on strategy places Kaanch to seize major market opportunities in regulated finance and digital identity solutions. It has an enterprise- and developer-friendly architecture that allows it to integrate with large blockchains, such as Ethereum and Solana, to improve interoperability. The community-based approach of Kaanch, where the governance is open, and the staking dashboard is user-friendly, makes the token holders the creators of its future, which further proves its statement of being the most sustainable Layer 1 blockchain to grow. BitMart Listing is an indication of the growth of Kaanch as the Best Layer 1 The future listing of Kaanch Network on Bitmart , at a fixed price of 30 dollars per token, is a great jump as compared to its current presale price of 0.32 dollars, which makes it the best Layer 1 blockchain. This listing will increase liquidity and market presence, which will attract more investors. Listing on a large exchange such as BitMart is an important step that can help Kaanch take over the Layer 1 market. The investors who want to get the best Layer 1 opportunity are advised to visit the Kaanch presale site to purchase the tokens before the price doubles in the next phase and the BitMart listing goes live.

With over 275 million clients, the exchange remains a prime target, and this is not the only recent threat to its community. The New Tricks The world’s largest crypto exchange warned that bad actors have been impersonating Binance support to steal people’s personal information or trick them into scanning malicious QR codes. “Scammers pretend to be “Binance support” and ask for a face video to “verify” your account. Their ultimate goal is to access your funds, bypassing Binance’s real verification systems using stolen data. Criminals send QR codes via WhatsApp, Telegram, or Facebook, claiming they’re for “rewards” or “updates.” Scanning these codes logs them into your Binance account instantly,” the alert reads . The exchange stated that anyone can fall for the aforementioned scams ; however, users on popular social media platforms, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook, appear to be prime targets. It also cautioned that areas with high rates of device theft, like crowded cities, are particularly vulnerable – especially when phones are not locked down. Binance assured that its teams are constantly on the lookout for such threats, but in the end, it’s up to the users to stay away from such dangers. It urged people to trust only official channels, stating that anything else is likely a scam. Other Recent Threats Binance claims to have surpassed a user base of 275 million people, a scale that may help explain why its community is such a frequent target for wrongdoers. Earlier this year, some users reported falling victim to an SMS spoofing attack. Specifically, people received messages that appeared to come from the same Binance number, where they typically got verification codes. The SMS insisted that their accounts had been accessed from North Korea, instructing them to set up a dubious wallet and transfer all their funds there. Needless to say, that account was malicious, and anyone moving assets there saw them embezzled. Last month, Binance’s CEO Richard Teng also sounded the alarm about phishing scams targeting the exchange’s client base. He noted that while the team is available around the clock, people’s vigilance remains “the first line of defense.” The post Binance Issues a Crucial Scam Warning Involving All Users: Details appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Binance|Crypto Scams,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-16 13:25:39

Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to make headlines, but the true alpha may lie in low-cost tokens with considerable room for growth and expanding ecosystems. As Q4 2025 approaches, four tokens — Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , TRON (TRX), Hedera (HBAR), and Arbitrum (ARB)—that are currently selling for less than $0.50 are poised to become the best bets, potentially increasing in value by up to 15 times. However, one of them, LILPEPE, has experts and traders quite excited, as it is a next-generation meme coin and a potential alternative to Dogecoin. Let's examine why these four assets are gaining popularity and why one of them may be the best. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Viral DOGE Killer Ready to Go Up 15x Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is still in its early stages, but this is what makes it the most promising of the four tokens. LILPEPE is currently in presale for only $0.0011. It is constructing the first Layer-2 blockchain designed to create and trade meme coins. Dogecoin is just a meme, whereas TRX is all about usefulness. LILPEPE combines the two: No tax on buying or selling Transactions that are almost free and very fast Pepe's Pump Pad: A place to launch meme tokens that won't break your rug 100 billion tokens available, including awards and staking options CEX listings are already being worked on. The project is currently in Stage 2 of its presale and has already sold more than 124 million tokens. It has only raised $719,508, leaving considerable room for growth. Traders call it the next SHIB or DOGE, but it has real infrastructure and developer tools that might lead to creating a whole meme economy. In a market where meme ventures have consistently yielded 100x returns, a structured, utility-oriented platform such as LILPEPE might spearhead the forthcoming memecoin surge, particularly as the majority of investors remain unaware of it. LILPEPE is the fastest horse in the race since it has a small market cap and a framework that is ready to become viral. Larger-cap tokens may take longer to advance. How to Buy LILPEPE Right Now Before the Price Goes Up To get an early-stage position in LILPEPE before the price goes up to the next level: Visit littlepepe.com , the official website. Link your wallet (MetaMask is best) You can buy straight with ETH, USDT, or a credit card. After the presale is over, you will be able to claim your tokens. If you invest at $0.0011, you could outperform centralized exchange listings and potentially receive up to 15 times your investment back by the end of 2025. TRON (TRX): Focuses on utility. TRON (TRX) is one of the most active Layer 1 blockchain networks, particularly in terms of stablecoin transfers and decentralized finance (DeFi). TRON has a market cap of slightly over $25.6 billion and is worth $0.2704. It delivers fast, cheap transactions and is still growing in Southeast Asia and Africa. Justin Sun, the founder, remains a contentious yet important figure who frequently enters into strategic agreements and mergers. TRX may quietly generate substantial profits if network development aligns with an increase in retail activity over the next bull cycle, particularly as real-world use expands, primarily through USDT transactions. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise-Grade Adoption at Penny Prices Hedera (HBAR) is one of the most advanced Layer-1 blockchain systems in terms of technology. Right now, it costs only $0.1539. Hedera is built on its own Hashgraph consensus, which makes it ideal for enterprise-grade applications, as it can handle a large number of users, process transactions quickly, and is highly secure. It is much more credible because it works with big companies like Google, IBM, and Boeing. Hedera's architecture is well-suited to support real-world tokenization, DeFi, and stablecoin infrastructure as blockchain adoption speeds up in finance, logistics, and government. HBAR is worth significantly less than it is now, as it focuses primarily on institutional-grade utility and real-world integration. Analysts believe that if adoption continues at this rate, the price could reach $2.30 by the end of 2025, representing a 15-fold increase from the current price. Arbitrum (ARB): The Layer-2 Sleeper with Scaling Power Arbitrum (ARB) is another token flying under the radar. Priced at just $0.3303, ARB is the governance token of one of the largest Ethereum Layer‑2 solutions in existence. It handles billions in total value locked (TVL) and enables fast, low-fee transactions—exactly what Ethereum has long struggled to provide on Layer-1. Despite its importance in the Ethereum scaling roadmap, Arbitrum’s token has yet to have its moment in the spotlight. However, as Layer‑2s become more integral to the DeFi and NFT ecosystems, ARB is likely to see a massive revaluation. Its relatively low market cap of $1.6 billion means a 15x surge would place it around $24 billion, which is not unreasonable considering its role in Ethereum’s future. Conclusion TRX, HBAR, and ARB all have good reasons to grow, but LILPEPE is in a unique position as a meme-meets-utility hybrid with the most room to grow. The token with the best technology and the most viral appeal might be the one that rules the 2025 cycle. That token is LILPEPE. Savvy investors are scooping up before the market catches up. Will you?

Developing nations are becoming key crypto drivers, with Vietnam and Pakistan emerging in recent days as potential leaders. Establishing country-level crypto standards like Vietnam has done, or developing frameworks and planning a national Bitcoin reserve, the way Pakistan is doing, can only boost crypto adoption at home and abroad. It also showcases how Bitcoin and broader blockchain technology can help emerging economies fuel growth and innovation. As we’ll discuss later, it could also add rocket fuel to some of the top altcoins . Vietnam, Saylor, Pakistan: 4 Takeaways What do the moves in Pakistan and Vietnam mean for the broader crypto economy? Here are four takeaways: Groundbreaking Legal Clarity in Vietnam On June 14, 2025, Vietnam passed its Law on Digital Technology Industry, effective January 1, 2026, categorizing crypto as a distinct, regulated asset class. This law affects 17M crypto holders and $105B in inflows over 2023–24, and provides much-needed stability, boosting investor confidence. Frameworks that Foster Innovation Vietnam’s approach goes beyond crypto legalization. The law introduces incentives, such as tax breaks, R&D support, and land-use benefits for sectors like AI and blockchain infrastructure, signaling a national pivot toward a tech-first economy. Pakistan’s Strategic Crypto Pivot Pakistan followed Vietnam’s lead a day later, on June 15, 2025, when Michael Saylor engaged with Pakistan’s finance leadership to champion Bitcoin as a sovereign reserve asset. Pakistan launched the Pakistan Crypto Council in March 2025, developing frameworks and planning a national Bitcoin reserve, along with crypto mining infrastructure. Emerging Economies Leading the Way? Vietnam and Pakistan’s moves reflect a global trend: emerging economies are leveraging digital assets to level up economically, rather than merely following Western nations. Demonstrating a greater appetite for crypto’s revolutionary potential, Pakistan, Vietnam, and others are pushing the limits of crypto’s potential in ways that could send leading altcoins soaring. Let’s investigate how top altcoins like Bitcoin Hyper , Uniswap, and Snorter Token could fare as global adoption grows. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin’s First-Ever Layer 2 Launches with SVM Bitcoin’s great, we can all agree – 230% AAR, a $2T+ market cap, etc. But could that be just the start? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) unleashes Bitcoin’s full potential. While right now, $BTC is one of the world’s best store-of-value assets, when it comes to crypto applications, it’s somewhat limited due to its original architecture. Bitcoin Hyper builds a Layer 2 on top of Bitcoin, leveraging the Bitcoin Relay Program on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to verify Bitcoin block headers and transaction proofs for any $BTC deposited to Bitcoin Hyper’s Canonical Bridge. The result is lightning-fast transaction resolution and the ability to build out an entire DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin. There’s a growing interest in Layer 2 solutions; another hot crypto presale – Solaxy ($SOLX) – just smashed through $50M raised with a Solana Layer-2. Could $HYPER surpass that with its Layer-2 solution for the world’s largest crypto asset? $HYPER tokens cost $0.0119, with $1.3M raised in the presale so far. Check out the whitepaper , or learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper , and see why we think the token could go from $0.0119 to $0.02595 for 118% gains. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale page . 2. Uniswap ($UNI) – Utility Token for Leading DeFi Protocol Seeks to Regain Previous Highs It’s a leading DEX, with over $1.78B traded in the past 24 hours. But Uniswap is also the 27th-largest crypto token, with a market cap of $4.91B . That’s impressive enough, but could $UNI be ready to make another run? The token trades well below its all-time high of $44.97 in the heady days of the 2021 bull run. But $UNI is on the list of assets currently held by the US government – and therefore eligible for the US Digital Assets Stockpile. Uniswap officials have also been involved in talks with the US Congress over pending legislation and decentralized finance. Add in global shifts towards more formal, organized crypto frameworks, and $UNI might be ready to make big moves. 3. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Dominate the New World of Solana Meme Coins with Snorter Bot With new meme coins launching on Solana daily, some of the best opportunities to 10x your investment live underground. Finding and trading them takes time and effort, but $SNORT and the Snorter Bot make the process easy. The Snorter Bot sniffs out the best trading opportunities. Find them, snipe them, and stay safe from rug pulls and honeypots – all with the Snorter Bot. The $SNORT token facilitates lightning-fast swapping with the lowest fees possible on Solana. As DeFi grows alongside crypto adoption, it could set the stage for tokens like $SNORT. The meme coin market is flourishing, even as traders get more and more sophisticated. Give your meme coin trading a leg up with $SNORT, currently priced at $0.0953. The presale has raised over $1M so far, showing rapid investor interest. Visit the Snorter Token ($SNORT) presale page. Vietnam, Pakistan Embrace Crypto, Set Stage for Altcoins As countries like Vietnam and Pakistan take the lead in embracing crypto, the message is clear: digital assets are no longer just speculative tools, but strategic economic levers. Vietnam’s legislative clarity and Pakistan’s sovereign Bitcoin ambitions show that emerging economies are helping define the future of finance. Whether it’s foundational DeFi tokens like Uniswap, revolutionary Layer-2s like Bitcoin Hyper , or cutting-edge trading tools like Snorter Token , the next wave of growth could be here.

Global M2 Money Supply Shows What’s Next",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/will-bitcoin-move-above-110000/,"Bitcoin’s current trading range is all part of a consolidation move before a return above $110,000. Although the leading cryptocurrency has largely held above the $105,000 support zones in recent days, its rally has taken a hit in the past two weeks. Technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price action, when overlapped with the Global M2 Money Supply metric, shows that it is only a matter of time before it enters into a new all-time high. Global M2 Offset Models Says Something Interesting According to a detailed post by crypto analyst Colin, also known as “The M2 Guy,” on the social media platform X, Bitcoin’s price action appears to be tracking the global M2 money supply with a high degree of correlation when the data is offset by 68 to 76 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? Two separate charts presented by Colin reveal this trend vividly, showing how Bitcoin price movements have followed the trajectory of the Global M2 Money Supply when adjusted for time. The short-term 68-day offset chart aligns closely with Bitcoin’s behavior since April 2025, while the 76-day offset chart offers a longer-term view of the relationship. In both cases, the analyst highlighted that the M2 curve is pointing upward, where Bitcoin has yet to play out, implying a similarly bullish trajectory for its price action. Colin describes this as a form of confluence, noting that when two correlated indicators show the same directional outcome, the probability of that outcome increases. Particularly, the average correlation across both charts is around 76.6 to 76.9%, both of which are very high and lend statistical weight to the prediction. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? The 68-day offset chart shows Bitcoin trailing the M2 curve with high precision since April, with the highest 89.9% degree of accuracy on the 90-day timeframe. Similarly, the 76-day offset, while less accurate in the short term, displays a strong correlation over longer intervals of 92.2% over one and a half years and 86.2% across two years. These correlation values shows that Bitcoin is increasingly sensitive to global liquidity trends, especially now that its price movement is tied to inflows/outflows surrounding Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000? This relationship becomes even more notable considering the M2 money supply itself has been climbing within a rising channel. If the alignment continues, Bitcoin may soon follow suit, lifting it back above the $110,000 level and breaking above its all-time high. Bitcoin’s price action will be very interesting to follow in the next few days. In Colin’s view, this next move up is not only likely but could happen within days. If Bitcoin follows this alignment, the projection shows that Bitcoin will continue to move within a channel of higher highs and higher lows before eventually crossing above $150,000 in August. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,549, up by 1% in the past 24 hours.

Recent updates suggest ADA is navigating its technical resistance near $0.75, supported by upcoming ecosystem milestones like the Hydra scaling upgrades and ongoing staking growth. Though forecasts place Cardano’s moderate upside within the $0.80 zone by mid‑2025, it’s seen by many as a solid long‑term bet rather than a quick win. Meanwhile, all eyes in this week’s crypto news today are on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a cheap crypto at $0.03 with high-return potential that could disrupt traditional altcoin expectations before ADA attempts a new all-time high. The project has gained more than 12,000 investors who have contributed $10.6 million during the ongoing presale. Investors taking part in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will see a 100% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Next phase price will climb 16.67% to $0.035. Mutuum Finance Reinvents DeFi Lending with a Smart Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is disrupting decentralized lending by offering a non-custodial protocol that puts the power of control over assets directly in the hands of users. As a lender, passive income; or as a borrower, quick liquidity, the platform is a pleasure to use. Borrowers are capable of posting numerous types of collateral that surpass the value of their loan, and the interest rates will automatically readjust to make the ecosystem balanced and efficient. The system of Mutuum Finance is its robust dual-lending model: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. The model P2C employs smart contracts to operate lending pools, but the interest rates are dynamically adjusted in response to market trends. This provides a stable source of revenues to lenders and more secure borrowing conditions to users. At the same time, the P2P model involves the complete removal of intermediaries, as it links borrowers and lenders. It works best with volatile assets and provides ultimate flexibility and actual decentralization, which are the essential components of the future of lending. Presale Phase 5 in Full Swing as Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance is in Phase 5 of presale, and the enthusiasm of investors is growing. Over 12,000 members have already enrolled and the total sales have gone beyond $10.6 million. Mutuum Finance is a long-term, useful DeFi solution meant to be utilized. It is highly scalable and has a bright future due to the increasing support, which makes it one of the most anticipated crypto launches to observe in the coming year 2025. Stablecoin Launch Backed by CertiK Audit In order to introduce further stability to the platform, Mutuum Finance will also introduce a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. The stablecoin was created with durability as its main aspect, preventing the drawbacks of unsuccessful algorithmic models since it always keeps its peg, even during volatile markets. CertiK, which is one of the most trusted blockchain security companies, has independently audited the entire platform and stablecoin. This validation reinforces Mutuum as security-driven, transparent, and long-term value. Early Investors Reap Rewards as Community Expands As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway prize, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as the breakout star of 2025, raising over $10.6 million from more than 12,000 early backers during its presale and setting the stage for a powerful market debut. Priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, with a confirmed launch value of $0.06, current participants are positioned for 100% gains, with further upside expected as adoption grows. Backed by a Certik-verified audit, a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, and a revolutionary dual-lending model, Mutuum Finance is challenging the status quo in DeFi. Forget waiting on Cardano’s slow climb, visit the official website to join the presale now and lock in your position before the next phase kicks in.

The HK-listed company’s stock surged 20% after the announcement, showing a positive market reception. Solana trades at $156.39, with a market capitalization of $82.66 billion. The company owns a 2.49% market share, and its 24-hour trading volume reached $4.47 billion. The recent market shifts show a 6.29% change in 24 hours and a 25.95% change over 90 days. HK-listed company acquires 2,440 SOL valued at HKD 2.9 million Ray Chan, CEO of MemeStrategy, said Solana is a key player in decentralized applications, DeFi infrastructure, and Web3 innovations. He added that the acquisition of 2,440 SOL reflected the company’s confidence in the long-term potential of the Solana cryptocurrency platform. The HK-listed company stock traded at HKD 2.42 per share in the open market. The funds for the acquisition were sourced from internal resources. OSL Group, a licensed digital asset platform by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, facilitated the transaction, which was executed at an average price of HKD 1,191. MemeStrategy aims to create a presence in the digital asset sector and join the growing trend among global companies like Metaplanet . According to MemeStrategy, the acquisition will help them tap into a rapidly growing Web3 ecosystem due to Solana’s expanding community of developers, individual users, and institutional participants. The investment positioned the HK-listed company to benefit from secure critical resources for future Web3 infrastructure. By participating in Solana’s Proof of Stake architecture and contributing to network security and validation, MemeStrategy gains from generated returns through blockchain validation and earns a consistent stake reward, balancing asset growth with risk management. Chan, Chairman and CEO of MemeStrategy, said the acquisition will enhance asset allocation and diversification and align with the company’s long-term strategic goals. He added that Solana is a leading blockchain project with wide-ranging applications, from decentralized platforms and real-world asset tokenization to AI-driven Web3 solutions. He revealed that the acquisition aligns with the company’s focus on AI, blockchain, validation technologies, and next-generation tech development, marking a significant step forward in MemeStrategy’s expansion into digital assets and the Web3 ecosystem. OSL Group facilitates MemeStrategy’s Solana acquisition The acquisition was completed by OSL Group, the first digital asset platform licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, which is also listed on the main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. OSL provides a secure and reliable environment for digital asset transactions and custody. MemeStrategy ensures the safety and reliability of its asset investments and custody by transacting through OSL Group and has gained access to the tokenized economy, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), memecoins, and real-world assets. “ It is a pleasure to announce that another Hong Kong-listed company, has chosen OSL Digital Securities as a partner for digital asset trading and custody. In a market first initiative OSL is proud to facilitate MemeStrategy, to invest in the Solana ecosystem marking OSL’s expansion beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.” – Ryan Miller , Head of Sales at OSLDS Miller said the partnership with MemeStrategy reflected a growing market recognition and commitment to high-potential cryptocurrency investments. He added that OSL has established a strong track record in providing regulated entities with secure and compliant digital asset infrastructure since onboarding its first listed client in 2021. DeFi Development Corporation, Upex Inc., Sol Strategies, and Classover have recently adopted Solana as their primary reserve asset, contributing to the growing trend of publicly traded companies using Solana as their treasury reserve strategy. Miller believes that Solana drives Web3 development and asset allocation while emerging as a new option for an enterprise-level asset management platform.

However, ticker symbols and other details like share price have not yet been announced. This setup makes it one of the few funds that combine both top cryptocurrencies into one package. And, the goal is to let investors gain exposure to these cryptocurrencies through traditional stock markets, without needing to own the digital assets themselves. Crypto.com Takes the Lead on Custody Backing the fund is Crypto.com, which will handle all asset custody. It will also manage trade execution, staking, and liquidity. This means that everything from storing the digital coins to handling buy/sell orders and staking will be done through a single, trusted crypto platform. What’s Next? Now, all eyes are on the SEC to approve both the S-1 registration and a separate 19b-4 form, which proposes a rule change to allow the listing. This process can take several months, and there is no guarantee of approval.

The report states that XRP is still in a downtrend and that tests at critical support levels are ongoing. MakroVision emphasized that XRP is stuck in a narrow price range and the bearish structure (red trend line) is still dominant. Currently, the 0.5 Fibonacci level of $2.13 is being tested for the third time. However, it was stated that there are no strong signals of a permanent trend reversal yet. Related News: List of the 15 Altcoins Developers Focused on Most in the Last Week Published Here are the highlights from the latest notes published by the analytics company: XRP has been trading within a clear bearish structure since the $2.65 level. The $2.35–$2.38 range is notable as both the region of high liquidity and the location of the last falling top. Upward attempts to this region have so far been limited to corrections. $2.13 (0.5 Fibonacci level): Tested for the third time, with each retest increasing the likelihood of a breakout. $2.03–$1.95 range: The area where horizontal support intersects with the region known as the “golden pocket.” In case of a break below these supports, the XRP price is likely to drop to the $1.55–$1.40 range. A strong break above $2.38 could revive bullish momentum for XRP, otherwise the risk of a drop to lower levels remains on the agenda. *This is not investment advice.

One X user speculated that Ripple might secure a banking license, spreading additional enthusiasm across the community. Explosion Brewing? The price of Ripple’s cross-border token might be down on a weekly and monthly scale, but multiple analysts remain optimistic that a bull run could be on the way. The popular X user CRYPTOWZRD claimed that an explosion might be “brewing,” envisioning a bullish breakout to as high as $2.80. Currently, XRP trades at around $2.23 (according to CoinGecko’s data), and such a move would represent a 25% increase. Several hours later, the analyst chipped in again. They suggested that the asset’s price dynamics would be heavily influenced by Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming week, adding that geopolitical conditions will continue to play a key role. Crypto Beast, who has over 700,000 followers on the social media platform X, argued that XRP hasn’t yet reached its market peak, setting a minimum target of $8. They reminded about the developments in the case between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing they might cause a further price spike for XRP. “XRP holders are about to make A LOT of money. When it’s time to sell, I will announce it here publicly,” they added. Awaiting These News The legal battle between Ripple and the US SEC has seemingly reached its final point , but an official conclusion is yet to be announced . Last week, both sides announced a proposed deal to settle the remaining financial aspects of the case. Under the deal, Ripple would pay $50 million to the SEC, while $75 million held in escrow would be returned to the crypto firm. To finalize the matter, the entities requested that the magistrates remove the August 2024 injunction tied to the original $125 million penalty. Back then, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple had breached certain securities laws. Some XRP proponents have speculated that the case could finally become history today (June 16). However, as of this writing, there isn’t anything official yet. The X user John Squire spread another rumor. He suggested that Ripple might secure a banking license and turn into “a full-on bank.” Such a development would likely have a positive impact on the company’s native cryptocurrency, with Squire wondering whether it could become “the new financial backbone.” The post Interesting Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions as of Late appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-16 13:43:09

Investors are punishing firms that trade below their Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Japan’s Metaplanet is succeeding after acquiring 10,000 BTC with sharp execution. A stark divide is emerging among public companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheets. As BTC hovers near all-time highs, investors are rewarding firms with aggressive yet well-aligned BTC strategies, while penalizing those perceived to be mismanaging treasury growth or shareholder value. The divergence is being reflected not just in price charts, but in company fundamentals, most notably in the growing focus on market cap to net asset value (NAV) ratios. Case Study in Dilution: Semler Scientific Trades Below Its Bitcoin Value Semler Scientific , a medical tech company that pivoted to a Bitcoin treasury strategy in May 2024, has found itself in a troubling position.

These features are designed to simplify and speed up content creation for brands on the platform. The new tools allow marketers to upload a product photo or enter a brief text description of the desired video ad. The company said that the popular video app’s AI tools will automatically generate a variety of five-second clips that can be used for advertising. AI-generated ads are gaining traction as the ByteDance-owned app and Meta Platforms Inc.—the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp—explore ways to lower production costs. This shift is helping small businesses stretch their budgets and invest more in advertising. TikTok vows to boost the marketing ecosystem using generative AI The new text- and image-to-video features are actually part of TikTok’s existing Symphony product, launched in 2024, to help brands assemble ads with the help of generative AI . The social media platform presented Symphony Digital Avatars, AI Dubbing for translations worldwide, and their Symphony Collective, making TikTok-first content that stands out. According to TikTok, when brands embrace creative courage and try new things, they can connect directly with their community and encourage them to participate in the discussion. Interestingly, TikTok, whose parent company is Chinese tech ByteDance Ltd., already permits advertisers to use AI-enhanced spokespeople (avatars) to assist with marketing and selling their products on the video app. In a statement , Andy Yang, who leads Creative Product at TikTok, stated that they want to help creators share their creativity with a worldwide audience using generative AI. Yang further stated that they aim to boost the creator economy by supporting creative ideas that inspire joy, imagination, and action. Research shows that creating ads specifically for TikTok increases purchase intent by 37% and brand favorability by 38%. Additionally, 79% of TikTok users prefer brands that clearly understand how to tailor content to the platform. An example of these TikTok users is TikTok creator O’Neil Thomas. He shared his view on the situation, mentioning that making content on TikTok has not only helped him keep his artistic spirit alive but has also allowed him to earn money worldwide. According to Thomas, it is because of TikTok that he has had the chance to connect and work with well-known brands in a fun and creative manner. He emphasized that with the new tools that TikTok keeps adding, he can find even more ways to develop exciting ideas for his brand collaborations. The announcement of TikTok’s new tools came alongside the Cannes Lions advertising festival, which is currently taking place this week in southern France. AI-made ads are poised to be a big theme at the conference. Mark Zuckerberg calls ‘generative AI’ a game-changer in the advertising world Mark Zuckerberg recently described a future where advertisers won’t need creative assets, audience targeting, or even performance measurement—signaling a bold, unapologetic shift toward fully automated advertising. In an interview , Zuckerberg shared his ideas about the future of advertising at Meta. He said businesses would soon come to them and tell them what they wanted to achieve. Zuckerberg highlighted that they would link their bank accounts and would not need any creative content or target specific groups. According to him, they will only need to understand the results they provide. Based on Zuckerberg’s argument, he believes this will be a game-changer and completely change how they think about advertising. Following this, brands and agencies raised concerns about whether Amazon will take the same approach with its quickly expanding retail media business. A careful look at Amazon’s latest advertising changes shows a more detailed approach that combines automation with control for advertisers. Zuckerberg’s vision is a multimillion-dollar wager on artificial intelligence that stands to redefine the relationship between advertisers and the platforms that distribute their messages.

Traders Aggressively Positioning for Upside or Volatility Analysts at Glassnode have found that BTC 25 Delta Skew (a metric focusing on option contracts expiring in one week) has turned bullish. “Traders are aggressively positioning for near-term upside or volatility,” they commented today. Over the past week, $BTC 25 Delta Skew has flipped decisively bullish – especially in short-dated options – despite a slight price decline. 1-week: -2.6% → +10.1% 1-month: -2.2% → +4.9% Traders are aggressively positioning for near-term upside or volatility. pic.twitter.com/8R3TvckxUp — glassnode (@glassnode) June 16, 2025 They also noted that demand growth is keeping pace with BTC’s maturation, describing it as “an impressive sign of sustained investor appetite.” Others were focused on the regulatory impacts. Przemysław Kral, the CEO of the zondacrypto exchange, commented on the regulations opening doors to massive players to enter the space – but also their drawbacks. “Regulations attract major players to the market,” he said. MiCA is a major one. It does impose limitations, but these are necessary for crypto to go mainstream. “However, we’re already seeing one major systemic drawback of MiCA,” says the CEO. “If you wanted to start a crypto business from scratch today, MiCA makes that impossible. The directive’s requirements can only be met by large, established players. So, the resolution has eliminated my competition. MiCA cements and consolidates the market.” That said, MiCA offers a level playing field. Until now, any exchange in Europe could choose the “softest” jurisdiction and compete on cost rather than quality, he says. “Now, everyone must meet the same security standards, so users benefit.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $106,734. At the time of writing, this is the highest 24-hour point, up from the intraday low of $104,627. Also, it’s currently down 4.6% from the all-time high of $111,814. It’s trying to hold the current level so to attempt higher points. Notably, BTC’s overall stability holds despite headlines about retail and banking giants (potentially) launching stablecoins, which may be seen as bearish for BTC. Bitcoin Price Chart.

At the time of writing, it’s still rising to retake the $2,500 zone and possibly continue upwards. Moving above $2,630 would open doors for the $2,700 level. However, dropping below $2,570 could lead to further downside. Notably, it was revealed on Friday that SharpLink Gaming became the largest publicly traded ETH holder after purchasing 176,271 ETH. Moreover, Ethereum whales increased their exposure to the asset over the past month, while smaller investors decided to sell during price stagnation. Wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH added 1.49 million ETH over the past 30 days – a 3.72% increase. Also, as reported on Sunday, a whale purchased 48,825 ETH at an average price of nearly $2,605, taking advantage of the recent dip. There are currently 6,392 wallets holding between 1K and 100K Ethereum. Over the past month alone, these key whale and shark wallets have rapidly added more coins as retail traders have taken profit. During these past 30 days, a net of +1.49M more $ETH has been accumulated by… pic.twitter.com/1hPBTuAOrL — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 13, 2025 Furthermore, the crypto market sentiment has continued retreating towards the fear territory. Currently, it’s still standing within the neutral zone, but it has fallen from 54 seen on Friday to 50 today . If fear starts pushing prices down, it may create buying opportunities for both new and existing investors.

Of this amount, BlackRock saw $238.99 million. Others are in green as well, albeit with smaller amounts. However, US ETH spot ETFs broke their 19-day inflow streak on Friday with $2.18 million in outflows. Grayscale took in $6.67 million, and Fidelity bled out $8.85 million. Others saw no flows. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market turned another green corner over the past 24 hours. Stocks were down on their previous workday. The S&P 500 decreased by 1.13% by Friday closing time, the Nasdaq-100 was down 1.29%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.79%. This was the result of the tensions between Israel and Iran, and Israel’s subsequent attack on Iranian cities and population. Is this rally sustainable? The short answer is yes, but there are ‘buts’. This uptick is a continuation of the rally that led to BTC hitting an ATH in May. It will continue to see short-term pullbacks, as is typical. However, the prices may be more significantly hit by escalating geopolitical issues.

After a concerning doji on June 15th, BTC was exchanging hands near $107K, providing a relief rally for several altcoins. This hints that investors are not panicking over geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran , as well as ongoing tariff disputes with the U.S. Data from coinglass proves the point, as U.S. Bitcoin ETF inflows exceeded $380 million on June 12th and 13th, contributing to total weekly inflows of $1.37 billion. Despite it trading below its ATH, investor optimism remains strong, with a short-term target set at $120K in June. As a result, the altcoins are gaining momentum, and risk appetite is returning. Many are now asking, “Could a Bitcoin rise pull select altcoins higher?” This article explores these altcoins and explains why crypto experts could be looking into our top picks for June 2025. Hyperliquid Price Prediction ( HYPE) In June, it gave an asymmetrical triangle breakout and flipped the previous ATH of $39 and reached $42.50. Many thought the supply was about to be activated, as for 4 days it struggled at its high. Then, a neat intraday breakout appeared with a neat 12% spike pushing it to a new ATH of $44.80, fueled by a whale that made over $13 million. The altcoins have become extremely important in the crypto sector lately, as it has become the top DEX among other DEXs and are also giving a tough competition to Binance CEX despite being a DEX. Its utility is driving its users crazy. This love of investors and traders could be seen in HYPE’s price action of Q2 so far, which has been parabolic. Similarly, the potential to rally further next week is higher. In a bullish scenario, the price could target the $50 round level. However, profit-taking could prompt bulls to defend key support levels at $39 and $30 Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction (BCH) BCH’s price action has shown that, over the long term, it follows a multi-year trendline of resistance, and in 2025, it retested it in mid-June. In the past, the price lacked the strength to break above the multi-year trendline and faced rejection before, but this time the momentum seems strong. When writing, the BCH price has jumped nearly 17% from an important resistance zone after a liquidity wick from the 50-day EMA band. Where intraday gains were over 9%, which pushed it to $469. If next week it manages to break above this trendline and pushes new gains, then $522 could be the target. Flipping this would be a breakout from a multi-year descending triangle formation, and the breakout could come big. On the other hand, if the breakout fails, the $300 support is expected to absorb the downside once again. OKB Price Prediction (OKB) On the daily chart, OKB price is near a critical supply level, which strongly aligns with the falling channels’ upper border resistance, too. In this, it has been trading inside for several months. This week, buyers tried but fell short of strength, as bears were strong this week. However, the upper border has been tested several times, and this phenomenon makes the trendline weaker, raising the likelihood of breaking the upper border. If bulls renters and clears the resistance, then next week is crucial to monitor as a break would easily give a target of $60 or $63 in the short term. But if bears become dominant, then the 200-day EMA band support becomes vital, breaching this would shake its foundation. Furthermore, its long-term perspective remains optimistic, as in March 2025 it took support from the lower border of the ascending wedge, and bullish momentum could give higher targets that go upto $100 under bullish conditions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

MEMESTRATEGY JUST MADE THEIR FIRST CRYPTO MOVE VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT: STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN SOLANA Here's what just dropped: 1/ The Numbers – 2,440 SOL purchased (matching their stock code 2440HK – genius branding) – HK$2,907,465 (~$372,000 USD) invested – Average price:… pic.twitter.com/A7R61Nb0ON — Tat Thang (@Febers4) June 16, 2025 According to the official filing, the board sees Solana as a scalable, efficient infrastructure for developers and institutions alike. The firm cited three strategic reasons behind the investment: exposure to a fast-growing ecosystem, the opportunity to generate yield via staking, and diversification of its treasury holdings. The firm also sees this move as part of its treasury diversification strategy. By adding a high-growth digital asset like SOL to its reserves, MemeStrategy aims to hedge against macroeconomic volatility while positioning itself in a rapidly expanding blockchain ecosystem. The board described the move as voluntary and said it does not require a notifiable transaction under Hong Kong’s listing rules. However, the company noted it will comply with future disclosure requirements regarding digital asset investments. As corporate interest in alternative digital assets grows, MemeStrategy’s Solana bet could mark the beginning of a broader shift beyond Bitcoin in the public markets. Institutions Double Down on Solana as ETF Speculation Heats Up Following MemeStrategy’s bold HK$2.9 million Solana acquisition, institutional momentum around SOL is growing rapidly, fueling market optimism and reinforcing Solana’s status as a top-tier digital asset in 2025. @DeFiDevCorp now holds over 609,000 Solana tokens after shifting focus from real estate. #SEC #Solana https://t.co/GQQoonKVzr — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 12, 2025 DeFi Development Corp is taking a different route, securing a massive $5 billion equity line of credit to gradually expand its Solana reserves . The firm plans to draw from the credit strategically rather than all at once, allowing it to accumulate SOL when market conditions are favorable. Although DeFi Development recently withdrew its $1 billion SEC registration over filing issues, its SOL commitment remains firm. In April, the firm added $11.5 million worth of Solana to its treasury, joining a growing list of public companies pivoting to SOL instead of Bitcoin. Other public companies are also jumping in with firms such as SOL Strategies , Upexi, and Janover also beginning to accumulate SOL, either to complement existing operations or to pivot toward blockchain-focused strategies. For example, another firm, Classover Holdings, saw its shares surge nearly 40% after unveiling a recent plan to raise up to $500 million for a Solana (SOL)-based corporate treasury. Shares of Classover surged nearly 40% on Monday after unveiling a plan to raise up to $500 million for a Solana-based corporate treasury. #Solana #SOL https://t.co/CsnvPK4Ncu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 3, 2025 The move reflects rising confidence in Solana’s long-term value, especially with the token still trading 50% below its February highs. Meanwhile, Solana’s price surged 9.5% on June 16, hitting $157 with daily trading volume doubling to $4.5 billion, signaling strong demand. The rally has been partly fueled by speculation around a spot Solana ETF. Fueling the current rally is mounting speculation around a spot Solana ETF in the U.S. Seven asset managers, including VanEck, Grayscale, and Bitwise, have filed for approval , with Bloomberg analysts placing odds of an early green light at 90%.

If approved, the financial vehicle will hold BTC and ETH directly, with 75% of its AUM going toward the leading digital asset, while the remaining 25% will be for the largest altcoin. Today’s press release by the Trump Media Group confirms previous reports that Crypto.com will serve as the exclusive BTC and ETH custodian of the ETF. Moreover, the exchange will be “prime execution agent, as well as staking and liquidity provider.” Yorkville America Digital will be the ETF’s sponsor, which wil be listed on the NYSE Arca if approved by the US SEC. The announcement distinguished the proposed ETF from being called a “security,” as the Shares “may not be sold, nor may offers to buy be accepted, prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective.” The US securities watchdog has a new and friendlier leadership under the Trump administration, which raises the chances of a potential green light. The current POTUS has undertaken a highly different approach when it comes down to the crypto industry, and one of the companies linked to him filing to launch a joint Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF is just another addition to the growing pro-digital asset initiatives .

Neo Pepe ($NEOP) emerges as a revolutionary figurehead in this ongoing struggle, representing not merely another cryptocurrency, but a cultural insurgency that challenges the foundational principles of centralized finance, excessive regulatory practices, and the suffocating constraints of market saturation. By transcending traditional crypto paradigms, Neo Pepe has transformed its symbolic act of rebellion into a robust, technologically advanced, community-centric, and comprehensively governance-driven protocol, firmly rooted in Ethereum’s tested and reliable blockchain. Central to Neo Pepe's philosophy is the profound and engaging narrative of the Memetrix—an evocative metaphorical representation of the enduring conflict between the freedoms promised by true decentralization and the oppressive realities of financial tyranny. This striking narrative serves not just as a visual and ideological rallying point but as a powerful tool merging blockchain innovation with societal revolution.

This liquidity is permanently secured by burning liquidity pool tokens, reinforcing Neo Pepe's commitment to true decentralization and protecting the ecosystem from centralized control. Precision Presale StructureNeo Pepe's presale is uniquely structured into 16 meticulously planned stages, with incremental price increases from $0.05 to $0.16 per token.

The sequential activation of higher-priced stages is designed using strategic game theory principles, incentivizing community engagement and maximizing participatory momentum. Fully Decentralized On-Chain GovernanceGovernance at Neo Pepe is robustly implemented through the advanced NEOPGovernor contract in concert with the TimelockController, providing holders the power to propose, discuss, vote, and execute crucial decisions.

Key Takeaways: A TikTok crypto influencer was kidnapped in France but released after his wallet was found nearly empty. France is seeing a rise in “$5 wrench attacks”—physical assaults targeting crypto holders for ransom. Experts warn that crypto ransoms are often futile, as transactions are traceable and funds can be frozen. According to a report from Europe1 , four men abducted the influencer and demanded a ransom of €50,000 ($58,000), to be paid in cryptocurrency. However, after checking his digital wallet and finding it nearly empty, they let him go. Surge in “$5 Wrench Attacks” Targeting Crypto Holders The case adds to a growing trend of “$5 wrench attacks,” a term coined in crypto circles to describe the use of physical violence to bypass digital security. France has seen a surge in such crimes. MP Paul Midy recently introduced a bill aiming to prevent public figures in the crypto space from being easily located via official registries. This weekend’s attack follows a more brutal incident on May 1, when four masked men abducted the father of a crypto entrepreneur in Paris, cutting off one of his fingers before police intervened. Authorities arrested twelve suspects in that case, including individuals tied to other kidnapping attempts across the city. Earlier this month, police captured the alleged mastermind behind several crypto-targeted kidnappings. The man, wanted by Interpol, had been linked to multiple cases involving crypto ransom demands. Wallet manufacturer Trezor weighed in on the recent surge in crypto-motivated attacks, calling the kidnappers “misguided.” A 26 year old TikTok influencer was kidnapped by 4 men in… you guessed it… France but was released after they realized he didn’t have as much money as he said he did online. Fake PnL screenshots are never worth it pic.twitter.com/PMDmGbTYxG — Beau (@beausecurity) June 15, 2025 The company emphasized that Bitcoin transactions are traceable and that stablecoins like USDT can be frozen or reversed, offering little utility for criminals. Trezor cited the kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland, whose ransom was demanded in USDT. Authorities ultimately recovered 95% of the funds. France has become a hotspot for these crimes, with 14 out of 50 global wrench attacks recorded there over the past year. Moroccan police this week arrested a suspect accused of kidnapping crypto executives. In France, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials. Crypto Execs Hire Bodyguards Amid Influencer Kidnapping Concerns As reported, crypto executives are turning to personal security services as targeted kidnappings and ransom attempts continue to escalate, particularly in France. In May, private security firms such as Infinite Risks International, based in Amsterdam, reported a sharp increase in demand from crypto professionals seeking round-the-clock protection amid rising crypto kidnapping. The rise in inquiries came a after spate of violent attacks, including multiple kidnappings attempts that have alarmed both investors and law enforcement.

With consistent higher highs and higher lows, price action remains firmly bullish, and a Fibonacci extension now points to $50 as the next upside objective. Hyperliquid ( Hype ) has sustained an exceptionally clean uptrend since establishing a macro swing low. Price action has remained impulsive throughout, forming consecutive higher lows and higher highs on all timeframes. Now trading above both the $34 support region and ATH levels, technical indicators remain aligned for further upside, with $50 marked as the next key level if current strength continues. Key technical points Strong Support at $34: The $34 region, previously resistance, is now confirmed support with multiple counter-closes, aligning with the value area high. 20-Day MA Acting as Dynamic Support: The 20-day moving average is tracking below price and holding as support, offering structure for a higher low. Fibonacci Extension Targets $50: A trend-based 0.618 Fibonacci extension projects $50 as the next key level, assuming price holds above ATH. HYPEUSDT (2D) Chart, Source: TradingView After an aggressive rally off the swing low, Hyperliquid has reclaimed and held key levels, particularly the $34 zone, which has now flipped into support. This level is in confluence with the value area high from the prior trading range and has seen several daily candle closes above it. This signals clear buyer commitment and reaffirms the region as a structurally important floor. Adding strength to the bullish case is the 20-day moving average, which continues to rise in tandem with price. Price action is currently using this moving average as dynamic trend support, confirming that the uptrend remains intact. As long as this level is respected, the structural expectation leans toward another leg higher.

A 0.618 trend-based extension, measured from the most recent swing low to the ATH breakout, gives a clean upside target of $50. This aligns with the pace of the current rally and will remain valid as long as support levels, particularly $34, continue to hold. What to expect in the coming price action Hyperliquid remains technically strong. As long as price stays above the $34 support region and confirms daily closes above ATH, the path toward $50 becomes increasingly probable. Unless market structure shifts, the current rally appears poised to continue in the immediate short term.

The flagship cryptocurrency has risen marginally over the past 24 hours and trades around $106,020. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) continued to trade sideways over the weekend, hovering around $2,500. However, price action picked up early on Monday, with ETH trading around $2,578, up nearly 2% over the past 24 hours. Ripple (XRP) is up over 1%, trading around $2.18, while Solana (SOL) has surged over 7% in the past 24 hours to reclaim $150 and settle at $156.

Vietnam Legalizes Crypto Under New Law Vietnam’s National Assembly has approved the Law on Digital Technology Industry, effectively bringing digital assets under regulatory oversight. The legislation will come into effect January 1, 2026, and lays the groundwork for broader digital innovation across the country. It clarifies digital assets into two categories: virtual assets and crypto assets. Both asset types require encryption or digital technologies for validation and transfers. However, neither includes securities, digital fiat currencies, or other financial instruments. The government must outline specific business conditions, classifications, and oversight mechanisms for the asset types. The new law also mandates cybersecurity and anti-money laundering safeguards in line with international requirements, likely to address concerns raised by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The legislation also outlines Vietnam’s ambitions to become a global tech and digital powerhouse. It introduces incentives for companies working on AI, semiconductors, and digital infrastructure. These incentives include tax breaks, land-use benefits, and R&D support, particularly for firms building core technologies like chip design and AI data centers. The Vietnamese government released a statement saying, “With this move, Viet Nam has become the first country in the world to enact a standalone law specifically dedicated to the digital technology industry.” Michael Saylor Indicates Imminent Bitcoin Purchase Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has suggested a Bitcoin (BTC) purchase may be imminent. Saylor posted the Bitcoin chart that typically indicates the company is about to make a big BTC purchase. The move comes despite mounting geopolitical tensions and an escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Saylor posted the chart signaling an impending purchase with the following quote, “Bigger Dots are ₿etter.” Strategy currently holds 582,000 BTC, making it the largest corporate holder of the asset. Saylor’s intention to make another BTC purchase indicates growing investor confidence in the asset. The asset’s price has held steady at around $105,000 despite worsening market sentiment, suggesting strong support at lower levels. However, price action could be impacted if the conflict escalates and impacts energy prices. Invesco, Galaxy Register Solana ETF Trust Invesco and Galaxy Digital have confirmed the registration of a trust in Delaware for the proposed Solana ETF. The move marks the first steps towards launching a Solana ETF in the United States. However, the registration does not guarantee a listing or approval. The ETF structure mirrors filings by VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and others in recent months as asset managers expand to crypto ETFs beyond BTC and ETH. Delaware security trusts are generally used for commodity and digital asset funds. The registration sets the stage for an eventual S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a 19b-4 submission through a national exchange. A Solana ETF would give investors access to the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the market without the complexities of managing a private wallet. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Stays In Greed Territory The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks the overall sentiment in the crypto market, remained in “greed” despite rising geopolitical tensions and an escalation in the Iran-Israel conflict. The index registered a score of 60 on Sunday, maintaining its position in the greed territory despite BTC declining to $103,000 over the weekend. The update came after Israel launched strikes on Tehran, with Iran reportedly retaliating on Friday. While maintaining its position in the “greed” territory, the index has declined from 71 on Thursday. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week positively, with the price up over 1% during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency reclaimed $106,000 during the current session after a sluggish weekend during which BTC struggled to maintain its position above $105,000. BTC has traded mostly in the red since Thursday as it lost momentum after crossing $110,000. Despite sluggishness and bearish sentiment, BTC has maintained its position above $105,000, suggesting that traders are buying the dip. However, some analysts believe BTC will see a notable drop due to escalating tensions in the Middle East. With the prospect of a regional war increasing, BTC and other cryptocurrencies are feeling the pressure. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp decline on Friday and remained in bearish territory over the weekend as buyers struggled to gain a foothold. Meanwhile, crude oil prices rose over 14%, and gold rose nearly 2%, a typical trend during Middle East tensions. However, analysts expect BTC and the broader crypto market to bounce back after a decline. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder, and chief operating officer at RedStone, stated that the attack and market sell-off caught traders off-guard, highlighting significant liquidations across Bitcoin futures. “Bitcoin dropped as much as 5% to $102,900, falling below the psychologically important $103,000 level. Ethereum shed even more, declining almost 7.6% at its worst point.” However, he highlighted that similar incidents in the past were followed by strong rebounds, referring to a similar scenario in April 2024. “Those moments turned out to be great buying opportunities. However, the current situation carries higher stakes given Israel’s direct targeting of Iran’s nuclear program and vows to continue operations indefinitely.” Meanwhile, analysts at Bitunix have a different view and believe BTC will benefit from the conflict, with investors viewing it as a safe asset. An analyst explained in a note to investors, “The conflict between Israel and Iran has pushed up the demand for risk aversion, and short-term geopolitical conflict risk aversion capital may flow into the crypto asset market. If geopolitical conflicts continue to rise, we cannot rule out the possibility of Bitcoin challenging the $110,350 liquidity target.” However, traders and analysts are unanimous about a new all-time high, with many feeling BTC will surge to new highs after a consolidation phase. Popular trader Alan Tardigade stated on X, “Bitcoin is trending upward in an Ascending Broadening Wedge. This pattern has recently formed for weeks and is expected to reach $170k levels.” BTC’s price action turned bearish on Tuesday (June 3) when it fell 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price dropped almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, slipping to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. Bullish sentiment returned on Friday, with the price rising almost 3% to $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Source: TradingView BTC surged over 4% on Monday (June 10), racing past $110,000 and settling at $110,251. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, falling to a low of $108,335 before reclaiming $110,000 and settling at $110,253. BTC fell 1.42% on Wednesday, settling at $108,687 as selling pressure returned. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 3% to $105,828. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,832 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $106,106. BTC was back in the red on Saturday, dropping 0.59% to $105,482 before registering a marginal rise on Sunday to settle at $105,562. The current session sees BTC up 1.41%, having reclaimed $107,000 and trading around $107,074. If buyers retain control, the price could reach $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) performed relatively better than BTC over the weekend, making a stronger recovery on Sunday despite registering a substantial decline on Friday and Saturday. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has reclaimed $2,600 during the ongoing session and currently trades around $2,627. Despite ETH’s recent price action, on-chain data shows that whales have been scooping up the asset while retail investors are cashing out. According to data from Santiment, ETH wallets holding between 1000 ETH and 100,000 ETH have added 1.49 million ETH over the past 30 days. “Over the past month alone, these key whale and shark wallets have rapidly added more coins as retail traders have taken profit.” Whales and sharks now hold 41.61 million ETH, nearly 27% of ETH’s current supply. ETH registered a sharp drop on Thursday (June 5), as it plunged over 7%, slipping below $2,500 and settling at $2,415. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and settling at $2,479. The price registered an increase of almost 2% on Saturday to reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,525. However, it was back in bearish territory on Sunday, dropping 0.57% to end the weekend at $2,511. ETH started the previous week on a bullish note, surging nearly 7% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,680. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose over 5% to cross $2,800 and settle at $2,816. Source: TradingView ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,878 on Wednesday as buyers attempted a move past $2,900.

The message, recently shared by crypto analyst Riz about a 2024 Jungle Inc Crypto News post, underscores a fundamental principle: XRP was never designed to be the star of the show. Instead, it was built to act as the “hidden plumbing” of the global financial system. XRP: Invisible but Essential In the email dated November 20, 2013, Britto wrote, “I expect the majority of people who use the Ripple payment network to be able to ignore XRP.” This single line powerfully encapsulates the XRP Ledger’s intended architecture. While XRP is central to enabling seamless, low-cost transactions, its use is designed to be so seamless that end users wouldn’t even notice it. In other words, the infrastructure would quietly do its job in the background, without requiring people to understand or engage with the digital asset directly. Arthur Britto: XRP is the Hidden Plumbing https://t.co/SEbkA8XWtZ — RIZ.. (@RizXRP) June 15, 2025 Britto made it clear that the Ripple network supports payments using multiple currencies, and XRP serves as an optional bridge asset. It is only used when it’s the most efficient tool for the job—when speed, cost, or liquidity demand it. This optionality gives the network flexibility and reduces reliance on any single token or asset. Value vs. Spread: A Unique Liquidity Model One of Britto’s most insightful remarks was that “ the value of XRP is probably less important than the spread.” He was referring to the difference between the buy and sell prices that market makers capture as profit during a transaction. Because transactions are executed atomically, meaning they complete all at once or not at all, the focus is not on XRP’s market price, but on minimizing transaction costs for users. This means XRP’s price can remain relatively stable or even low, so long as market makers offer tight spreads and sufficient liquidity. It’s a model that turns conventional crypto investment thinking on its head: value isn’t driven by speculation but by transactional utility and network efficiency. The Dual Role of the Ripple Network Britto emphasized Ripple’s unique structure as both a currency exchange and a payment network. This dual role allows it to facilitate instant settlement of cross-currency payments, rather than relying on slow and error-prone netting systems. To thrive in this environment, market makers must offer the best possible rates to attract volume. This competition ensures low-cost transactions for end users and efficient global money movement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For XRP to be used more frequently, it simply needs to offer the best spread. “I would guess XRP would only have the best spread if network participants want it to,” Britto concluded. In essence, XRP adoption is not forced; it’s earned through superior performance. RLUSD and the Fulfillment of a Vision Riz aptly pointed out that Ripple’s 2024 launch of RLUSD, its native stablecoin on the XRPL , aligns perfectly with Britto’s original vision. Stablecoins like RLUSD allow institutions and users to transact within the XRPL ecosystem without direct exposure to XRP’s volatility, while still benefiting from its speed and reliability. By integrating stablecoins and expanding the liquidity options on XRPL, Ripple is reinforcing the original architecture envisioned over a decade ago. XRP remains at the core, not as a front-facing product, but as the infrastructure that keeps everything running smoothly. Summarily, Arthur Britto’s foresight from 2013 is proving more relevant than ever in today’s evolving digital payments landscape. As Riz highlighted, XRP was never meant to dominate headlines or serve as a consumer-facing asset. Instead, it was designed to function like the pipes behind the walls—vital, efficient, and unseen. That vision is quietly coming to life as Ripple pushes forward with stablecoin integration and institutional-grade liquidity solutions on the XRPL.

The flagship cryptocurrency maintained its position above $105,000 despite facing selling pressure, indicating that traders are buying the dip. Analysts have predicted that BTC will decline thanks to the ongoing Middle East crisis but will register a strong rebound if tensions de-escalate. Metaplanet Announces Latest Bitcoin Purchase Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has announced the purchase of 1,112 BTC , taking its total holdings past the 10,000 BTC mark. The company made its latest acquisition at an average price of $105,000 per coin, making the total purchase worth $117 million. The average purchase price for Metaplanet’s holdings is $96,000 per Bitcoin. The latest acquisition has taken the firm past Coinbase’s 9,627 BTC , according to data from Bitbo. The latest purchase comes after the firm became the eighth largest holder of the asset, and the same day it announced that its board of directors planned to raise $210 million via no-interest bonds to buy more Bitcoin . Metaplanet has drastically revised its Bitcoin strategy in recent months and plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. The company’s stock has also soared following the announcements, rallying over 22% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Metaplanet’s stock has seen an increase of over 417% year-to-date. Crypto ETPs Register Inflows As Bitcoin Rebounds Crypto investment products continued their inflow streak as Bitcoin (BTC) crossed $110,000 last week, while Ethereum (ETH) briefly crossed $2,800. Global crypto exchange-traded products registered inflows worth $1.9 billion the week ending Friday. The products have registered inflows for nine consecutive weeks, taking the total to $12.9 billion, according to data from CoinShares. The latest inflows mean crypto ETPs have registered a historic record of year-to-date inflows worth $13.2 billion. Meanwhile, the total assets under management in crypto ETPs rose from $175 billion to $179 billion. Bitcoin investment products led the inflows, registering $1.3 billion in inflows, while Short-Bitcoin products registered modest inflows of $3.7 million. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) started the week positively as the flagship cryptocurrency brushed off a sluggish weekend to rise above $107,000 on Monday, reaching an intraday high of $107,263. BTC has traded downwards since crossing $110,000 last week. While analysts and investors expected a move to new all-time highs, geopolitical tensions sent the price into bearish territory. BTC , which was already losing momentum on Wednesday, plunged nearly 3% on Thursday, dropping to $105,828. Despite growing bearish sentiment, BTC maintained its position above $105,000 over the weekend, indicating that traders are buying the dip. BTC registered a sharp decline on Friday as it plunged to a low of $102,832. Price action remained bearish and subdued over the weekend as buyers struggled to gain a foothold. On the other hand, crude oil prices rose over 14%, while gold rose nearly 2%. However, analysts expect BTC to bounce back after a period of decline. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder, and chief operating officer at RedStone, stated that the attack and market sell-off caught traders off-guard, highlighting significant liquidations across Bitcoin futures. “Bitcoin dropped as much as 5% to $102,900, falling below the psychologically important $103,000 level. Ethereum shed even more, declining almost 7.6% at its worst point.” However, he highlighted that similar incidents in the past were followed by strong rebounds, referring to a similar scenario in April 2024. “Those moments turned out to be great buying opportunities. However, the current situation carries higher stakes given Israel’s direct targeting of Iran’s nuclear program and vows to continue operations indefinitely.” While the flagship cryptocurrency is showing signs of a recovery, it is forming a Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart, suggesting growing indecision among buyers and sellers. However, while there is near-term uncertainty, analysts and traders are bullish on the long-term prospects of BTC , expecting the price to rally past $140,000 and higher. Popular trader Alan Tardigrade stated on X, “Bitcoin is trending upward in an Ascending Broadening Wedge. This pattern has recently formed for weeks and is expected to reach $170k levels.” BTC registered a marginal drop on Tuesday (June 3) and fell nearly 1% on Wednesday, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, falling to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. The price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and settling at $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. BTC rallied on Monday, surging over 4% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,251.

Risk assets were higher in early trading on Wall Street after the Israeli attack on Iran prompted Tehran to respond with missile strikes on Tel Aviv and other locations. Despite the initial negative reaction in the stock market , futures rose as the new week began with optimism that Middle East tensions would not escalate into a full-blown war. This sentiment saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average open 250 points, or 0.6%, higher, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite opened 1% higher. U.S. equities edging higher also coincided with a spike in Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the global crypto market capitalization increased 2.4% over $3.2 trillion.

Weak U.S. economic data also had not significantly disrupted the bullish setup. June, however, has seen the major U.S. indexes slide into bear territory over the past trading week. Investors are betting on a swift end to the escalation — something Trump has also commented on, albeit with the caveat that hostilities may yet “play out” before the two sides agree to end the attacks and counterattacks. Also on investors’ minds this week is the upcoming Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday. Consensus expects the Fed to hold rates steady despite Trump’s pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

The new addition followed Michael Saylor’s X message on preferring “bigger orange dots,” representing larger purchases. Strategy tapped over $1B for its weekly BTC purchase, acquiring 10,100 BTC after a few weeks of smaller inflows. The latest purchase is bigger than the entire treasury of Metaplanet . During a volatile week, Strategy acquired BTC at an average price of $104,080. The purchase followed a pre-announcement by Michael Saylor, in spite of the short-term volatility. Strategy has acquired 10,100 BTC for ~$1.05 billion at ~$104,080 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 19.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/15/2025, we hodl 592,100 $BTC acquired for ~$41.84 billion at ~$70,666 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/n7q77DmqCY — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 16, 2025 Saylor remains the most relevant corporate BTC accumulator The latest purchase raised the average purchase price for Strategy to $70,666, with the total BTC treasury expanding to 592,100 BTC. In total, Strategy has already spent over $41.8B for its treasury, remaining the leader in total holdings among corporate treasuries. Strategy still lags behind the holdings of BlackRock’s ETF, extending above 669K BTC. ETFs remain the more active and faster buyers, but the wallets are more volatile and also have days of rapid outflows. Saylor, on the other hand, is committed to long-term holding. In terms of BTC per share, Strategy is also ahead of other corporate buyers, with 20X the coins per share compared to Metaplanet . As usual, Saylor’s moves inspired other corporate buyers, increasing both the treasuries and the number of companies announcing acquisitions. It has also spilled over into altcoins, with small companies aiming to boost their shares by announcing SOL or XRP treasuries. Still, Strategy remains the undisputed leader with the most significant exposure to BTC. Bitcoin purchases help MSTR stabilize For companies building BTC treasuries, one of the effects is a positive move for the stock price. In the case of MSTR, the shares recovered above $382, retaining the higher baseline just under $400. MSTR shares recovered close to $400, though still waiting for a breakout to new highs. | Source: Google Finance MSTR is closely watched for a potential recovery and a stronger rally, as it now trades below the all-time high of $473.83 achieved on November 20, 2024. MSTR has seen lower volumes in the past few weeks, though the shares are still seen as outperforming. MSTR has also acquired partial meme status, with traders going long in expectation of ongoing rallies. Strategy is also making its structure more complex, with additional sales of convertible perpetual stock. Its BTC treasury approach continues to face criticism for creating systemic risk, which may spill over to the stock market. The latest purchase followed three rounds of share sales, with no new MSTR issued. Saylor raised $48.4M from STRK shares, and another $30M from STRF. The latest issue of preferred stock also means no new dilution for MSTR holders. Strategy has over $18B to deploy through common stock issuance, though the last few operations happened through preferred stock sales. Previously, Strategy also completed the round of its new convertible Stride (STRD) shares with 10% dividend, raising over $979M. The round allowed the firm to accelerate its buying, after two relatively slow weeks of BTC additions. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?
