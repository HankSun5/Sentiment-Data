While short-term traders aim for quick wins, those looking for the best crypto to invest in long-term know that real value lies in a project’s vision, utility, and adoption potential. As markets shift, attention is turning toward assets that show strength beyond price action. Monero (XMR), Aave (AAVE), Celestia (TIA), and BlockDAG have all emerged as key tokens this week. Each serves a different role, privacy, decentralized finance, modular scaling, and full-stack infrastructure. These projects are showing signs of resilience, making them worth watching. But one project is gaining momentum faster than the rest. BlockDAG is increasingly being viewed as the best crypto to invest in long-term wealth growth. Here’s what sets it apart from its peers and why it’s capturing the spotlight. 1. BlockDAG: Strong Fundamentals Fuel Long-Term Appeal Among newer projects, BlockDAG is quickly gaining ground as a strong candidate for the best crypto to invest in long-term. Its presale started at just $0.001 and has already climbed to $0.0276, a 2,660% increase. Even now, a limited $0.0018 entry is open until June 20, offering late buyers another chance before the official launch. With a confirmed listing at $0.05, those buying today could already expect a gain. However, some analysts are pointing to a longer-term target of $1, which represents a 35x increase from the current offer. The platform’s standout feature is its full EVM compatibility, allowing Ethereum dApps to move over without any code changes. It has already drawn over 2 million users to its X1 mobile mining app. In addition, it has raised $305 million and sold 22.6 billion BDAG coins. With 20 exchange listings confirmed and a U.S.-based partnership on the horizon, it’s building momentum fast. For those seeking the best crypto to invest in long-term with a solid use case, working infrastructure, and user growth, BlockDAG is increasingly difficult to ignore. As the final presale phase wraps up, this may be the last moment to enter before demand surges. 2. Aave (AAVE): DeFi Growth Supported by Tech & Governance Aave is one of the foundational names in DeFi and is proving its ability to grow in this space. Over the past week, AAVE has climbed 11–14%, recently reaching highs around $270. It has since seen a 4.6% pullback in the last 24 hours, but overall demand for its staking and governance features remains high. The protocol is built on a solid technical base and operates across 14 different blockchains. Developer activity is notable, with roughly 90 commits each week. The launch of v3.3 and zkEVM support further boosts its ability to scale. Its new GHO stablecoin has added more utility, strengthening its long-term outlook. Resistance near €270–280 is being tested, and a clear breakout could unlock more upside. For those interested in the best crypto to invest in long-term DeFi plays, Aave remains a strong choice based on innovation and sustained network activity. 3. Monero (XMR): Privacy & Resilience Under Pressure Monero continues to lead the privacy segment, trading between $309 and $312. Although it’s down by 3–7% this week, that move reflects wider market concerns rather than internal weakness. Monero’s base of long-term holders values its ability to support private, untraceable transactions. With a market cap of around $5.7 billion, XMR remains in the top 25 cryptos. It is currently consolidating between $306 and $322, after pulling back from a recent high of $338. Even as regulators increase scrutiny, the network’s resilience and growing use on decentralized exchanges continue to attract interest. Its privacy-first model gives it a durable advantage in a niche with few serious competitors. For those interested in the best crypto to invest in long-term privacy tools, Monero remains a consistent choice supported by a strong community and active developers. 4. Celestia (TIA): Modular Blockchain Shows Long-Term Promise Celestia’s focus on modular blockchain architecture has brought in both investors and builders. TIA is trading between $1.74 and $1.83 after a 2.5% 24-hour bounce. Even so, it is still down nearly 10% over the past week and over 38% this month. With a market cap of $1.23 billion, Celestia is ranked among the top 70 cryptocurrencies. Though it may dip toward $1.69 based on short-term chart patterns, the project’s modular structure remains its strongest asset. It allows developers to scale and deploy efficiently, separating consensus from execution. As interest in rollups and modular chains grows, Celestia may become an important part of Web3 infrastructure. For those searching for the best crypto to invest in long-term scalability solutions, Celestia’s role in blockchain architecture deserves continued observation. Why BlockDAG Is Drawing Attention from Long-Term Thinkers In a market full of speculation, choosing the best crypto to invest in long-term requires looking beyond price charts. Monero, Aave, and Celestia all deliver strong fundamentals in their respective areas, from privacy to DeFi and infrastructure. But BlockDAG is standing out for combining performance with usability. It already offers ROI, strong user participation, and complete compatibility with Ethereum’s development tools. With exchange listings secured and interest growing daily, it is moving from early-stage promise to real-world execution. As presale rounds near their end and more traders take notice, BDAG may go from under-the-radar to center stage. For those who aim to build long-term portfolios around solid technology and proven traction, BlockDAG looks like one of the smartest opportunities currently available. Now may be the time to act. If your goal is to identify the best crypto to invest in long-term before the next market breakout, BlockDAG deserves serious consideration.

The takedown was part of a broader international investigation, codenamed Operation RapTor, which targeted the darknet platform’s operators and financial infrastructure. Incognito Market Shut Down According to Binance’s official press release , Incognito Market enabled the sale of over 1,000 types of illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine, and relied heavily on cryptocurrencies to process transactions while obscuring users’ identities. Despite the platform’s use of encryption, privacy tools, and a custom-built internal payment system, investigators working with Binance’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) were able to trace transactions on the blockchain to individuals connected to the marketplace. Binance’s FIU assisted in mapping the flow of illicit funds and identified several crypto wallets tied to the platform’s operations. The investigation ultimately led to a Taiwanese national, identified by the surname Lin and known by the alias “Pharaoh,” who supervised the operation and reportedly earned millions in profits. Lin was arrested and later pleaded guilty in a US federal court to charges including narcotics conspiracy, money laundering, and the distribution of misbranded drugs. Meanwhile, Binance’s FIU also froze over $3.5 million in related crypto assets, which law enforcement said helped cripple the marketplace’s financial operations. Binance has assisted in similar investigations before, including efforts with Europol to dismantle a child exploitation platform by tracking internal payment systems and identifying users. In an official statement, Nils Andersen-Röed, Global Head of Binance’s Financial Intelligence Unit, stated, “This case is a powerful reminder that blockchain offers no safe haven for criminal activity. Even with sophisticated privacy tools, every crypto transaction leaves a digital trail, which is increasingly vital in today’s law enforcement investigations. Cross-border collaboration and public-private partnerships are no longer optional – they are essential.” T3 FCU Targets Crypto Crime Besides Binance, another major player in the digital asset space has reported similar enforcement success. The T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU), a joint initiative by Tether, Tron, and TRM Labs, announced in the March update that it has frozen over $100 million in illicit crypto assets since its launch in August 2024. Working with global law enforcement, the unit has targeted crimes including money laundering, fraud, and terrorism financing. T3 FCU has analyzed millions of transactions globally and monitored over $3 billion in USDT activity to disrupt financial crime in the crypto industry.

This new project, set to be released by 2029, aims to fix quantum computers’ high error rates and inability to run long, complex programs. Industry leaders say quantum computers might become strong enough to break today’s digital security systems. This could be dangerous for banks and might even breach inactive crypto wallets . While this is not an urgent threat, many worry it could happen sooner than expected. IBM’s Starling To Revolutionize Quantum Computers Quantum computers do not work like normal ones. Regular computers use bits, which can be either 0 or 1. Quantum computers use qubits, which can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This special ability makes quantum computers very fast, powerful, and efficient. They can solve problems much faster than regular computers, including breaking encryption. Encryption keeps online information safe, including the data in Bitcoin (BTC) and blockchain systems. However, today’s quantum computers are weak because qubits are very sensitive. Small changes in temperature or other conditions can make them stop working correctly. These errors prevent the computer from running large programs. As a result, IBM is focusing on building a fault-tolerant computer that can find and fix its own mistakes while running. This makes it more stable and allows it to handle longer and harder tasks. IBM’s Quantum Computer Starling and the 2029 Goal IBM’s new computer, Quantum Starling, will be able to run 100 million quantum operations using 200 corrected qubits. The computer will also use special hardware to fix errors in real time. IBM will install the system in its quantum data center in New York. This move is part of the company’s roadmap for building useful and scalable quantum computers by 2033. Over the next few years, IBM will test smaller systems and develop new software. These smaller machines will help IBM learn how to connect quantum chips, increase computing power, and prepare for larger builds like Starling. Crypto Community Panics, But Bitcoin Is Safe For Now IBM’s announcement has caused uproar in the crypto community. Experts say blockchains will not break overnight, but developers should start preparing now. Blockchain networks like Bitcoin use strong encryption to protect wallets and transactions, and today’s computers are not strong enough to crack these secret codes. Encryption methods that are safe from quantum attacks already exist; many believe it is time to use them. Meanwhile, some industry leaders like Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor say other systems, like banks and websites, could face quantum threats first. Bitcoin may be safer for a bit longer. Nevertheless, the risk to all digital systems will grow as quantum computers improve.

The resurgence coincides with the rise in activity on the network. According to Dragonfly data analyst Hildobby on X, the network first saw a surge in sandwich attacks around mid-May, and the number has continued to trend upward, particularly over the last week of May and the first week of June. The data shows that the number of sandwich DEX traders has exceeded 100,000 for two consecutive weeks, with trading volume exceeding $1 billion. 120k DEX traders were victims of sandwich attacks on BSC for the first week of June (Source: hildobby) Sandwich attacks are a form of on-chain market manipulation where the attackers front-run the victim’s trades by inserting their trades before and after to extract value from the victim’s transaction. The attacker artificially increases the price of a token by placing a buy order before the victim’s trade and then profits from the inflated value by placing a sell order right after the trade. This issue has long been a major problem for decentralized exchanges, with attackers automating the process using Maximum Extracted Value (MEV) bots. Interestingly, the attack happens due to the inherent nature of the DEX infrastructure. All submitted transactions go to the memory pool (mempool), which is visible to the public before miners select which transactions to execute. Attackers can manipulate transactions from here by offering higher fees to ensure miners reorder transactions to their advantage. The issue has long been an issue for BSC , with over a third of blocks on the network containing transactions impacted by the sandwich attacks on December 1, 2024. However, it is not peculiar to BSC, as other networks, such as Ethereum and Solana, also have to deal with it. One address in 2024, Jaredfromsubway.eth, made over $40 million in revenue with $6.3 million in profits in less than three months from sandwich attacks. BNB Chain tackled sandwich attacks before However, BNB Chain previously addressed the issue by introducing MEV protection for several wallets earlier this year. At the time, the network said there were three solutions: allowing users to have automatic or manual MEV protection, or even customizing the protection for advanced users. The automatic protection was available for select wallets, including Trust Wallet, Binance Wallet, OKX Wallet, TokenPocket Wallet, and SafePal, while other wallets could set up the feature manually. This solution appeared to have worked earlier, with sandwich attacks dropping significantly between late March and early May 2025. However, it appeared to have picked up again. Interestingly, the resurgence coincides with the increase in DEX transactions on BSC, with the network recording massive transaction volume. Dune data shows that the network recorded 69 million transactions in the first week of June, while the last week of May saw 58.45 million transactions. Interestingly, the impact of recent sandwich attacks is minimal, as they have affected only a small percentage of transactions within these two weeks. In the first week of June, over 776,000 transactions were sandwiched, while around 207,000 transactions were sandwich attacks. In the week before, total sandwich-related transactions were only around 1 million. Even more surprisingly, the number of sandwich bots on BSC has declined to less than 300 on average weekly since early April. This represents a major drop from the almost 9,000 sandwich bots in mid-February. BSC sees soaring transaction volume driven Meanwhile, the surge in BSC transaction volume is due to the Binance Alpha program introduced on May 20. The initiative, which spotlights early-stage Web3 projects for users to access tokens and airdrops, has driven tons of new users to the network, causing its DEX volume to soar. According to Defillama, BSC has been the leading network for DEX volume over the last 30 days, with $147.18 billion, far above Solana, which is in second place with $79.31 billion. The network is also leading in daily volume with $3.63 billion. BSC flips Solana in memecoin activity (Source: Jason Yanowitz) Interestingly, it has also flipped Solana in memecoin trading volume, showing how massively impactful the program has been. However, many observers believe the trading volume is inflated due to wash trading as users try to farm points through the Binance Alpha initiative.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi token priced at just $0.03, is quickly becoming the breakout story of summer 2025, with early investors speculating on a potential 30x+ surge before Q3 ends.

If you’re wondering what to buy before June ends, MUTM may be one of the top tokens quietly setting up for explosive growth, while others like SUI appear to be losing steam.

Mutuum Finance Turns Holding Into a High-Stakes Competition Mutuum Finance is rewarding participation. Through its new leaderboard system the top 50 MUTM holders are being spotlighted and will be rewarded. Those who climb the ranks will earn bonus tokens and community prestige transforming traditional token holding into a thrilling competitive experience.

Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To celebrate its early momentum and reward the community Mutuum Finance is hosting a massive $100,000 giveaway . Ten lucky early investors will be randomly selected to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Audited and Built for the Long Haul With so many DeFi projects falling short of their hype, Mutuum Finance is showing credibility to its hype. Certik has performed a full audit of its smart contracts which provides investors with assurance that the code is safe transparent and long-lasting. And to make its ecosystem even more stable Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum that will offer long-term stability liquidity and trust to retail and institutional customers.

However, a newcomer, Ruvi AI , is now stepping into the spotlight, drawing comparisons to Tron for its utility-focused innovation , structured roadmap , and incredible growth potential. With $1.7 million raised , over 150 million tokens sold , and a presale price set at $0.015 , Ruvi AI is positioning itself as not just another crypto token but a game-changer in the blockchain and AI sectors. Why Ruvi AI Is Drawing Comparisons to Tron Tron’s legacy lies in its impact on the entertainment industry, leveraging blockchain to decentralize content sharing and ownership. Similarly, Ruvi AI combines blockchain’s decentralization and artificial intelligence’s cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems across marketing , entertainment , and finance . This dual-focus approach makes Ruvi AI much more than a speculative token. It is a utility-driven project with broad applicability. Ruvi AI’s Phase 2 presale price of $0.015 per token makes it a highly accessible entry point for investors. This affordability allows early backers to secure meaningful positions without a significant upfront investment. Unlike speculative tokens, Ruvi AI follows a structured growth model with a transparent roadmap, boosting its credibility. Analysts are optimistic, projecting a post-listing valuation of $1 , which translates to an impressive 66x return for early participants. A Successful Presale Fuels Investor Optimism The buzz around Ruvi AI is supported by its stellar presale performance. Having already raised over $1.7 million and sold more than 150 million tokens , the project is quickly establishing itself as one of the most exciting opportunities in the market. Ruvi AI’s pricing strategy is a standout feature. Following the presale, the token’s price is set to increase to $0.07 , providing an immediate value boost for early participants. This price progression is a deliberate part of Ruvi AI’s planned development, underscoring its focus on sustainability and long-term growth . Earn More With VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers are designed to reward early contributors with substantial bonuses. This tiered system gives investors the chance to maximize their returns while supporting the project’s development. Here’s how it works: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. This tiered bonus structure is a testament to Ruvi AI’s commitment to fostering a loyal and engaged investor base, offering unmatched opportunities for financial growth. Built on Transparency and Security Ruvi AI’s focus on transparency and investor trust sets it apart from speculative projects. The platform is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a leading blockchain security firm. This ensures Ruvi AI meets high standards of reliability and technological soundness, giving investors peace of mind. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , a globally recognized trading platform. This strategic alliance ensures liquidity and smooth trading for token holders once the presale concludes. Combined, these measures highlight Ruvi AI’s efforts to establish a stable, trustworthy ecosystem. Solving Real-World Challenges Ruvi AI’s primary strength lies in its real-world applications , which make it more than just a financial asset. Here’s how it’s transforming industries: Marketing Ruvi AI empowers businesses to optimize their advertising strategies through AI-driven analytics, improving customer targeting and engagement for better ROI. Entertainment The platform enhances connections between creators and audiences by offering personalized content recommendations and integrating blockchain-backed payment systems to ensure secure, seamless transactions. Finance Ruvi AI addresses pain points such as fraud prevention and operational inefficiencies, simplifying financial processes for institutions and individuals. These practical applications establish Ruvi AI as a utility-first token with the potential to revolutionize multiple industries beyond the crypto space. Could Ruvi AI Rival Tron? While Tron solidified its position in decentralized entertainment, Ruvi AI is carving out a niche as a platform for scalable, real-world solutions . With a presale price of $0.015 , planned growth to $0.07 , and analysts projecting a $1 valuation , it offers investors a rare opportunity to achieve 13500% ROI . Backed by a CyberScope audit , a WEEX partnership , and strong presale traction, Ruvi AI is poised to emerge as a leader in blockchain innovation. For investors looking for the next groundbreaking project, Ruvi AI represents a chance to be part of something truly transformative.

Cloud mining has turned a once hardware‑heavy pursuit into something anyone can start with a smartphone, a modest budget, and a few taps. But can zero hardware really compound into nearly a million dollars? Absolutely—provided you choose the right provider. Below are five cloud‑mining services that have stood out this year for regulatory compliance, consistent payouts, and global scale. Together they show how US $100 can, in the right circumstances, snowball toward six—or even seven—figures. 1. HASHJ — Ultra-Short 1- to 3-Day Contracts for Rapid Gains Minimum deposit: US $100 • Peak daily return: Up to US $9,600 (investment‑dependent) • Payout mode: Daily auto‑credit in BTC or USDT, with zero hidden fees Licensed in multiple jurisdictions, HASHJ offers 2‑factor authentication, custodial wallets, and 24/7 live support. Its stripped‑down interface lets newcomers get started in under five minutes. How to begin: 1. Head to https://hashj.com and unlock an instant US $18 welcome bonus when you register. 2. Select a 1‑ to 3‑day contract. 3. Top up your account with crypto. 4. Let the platform handle the mining and watch daily revenue land in your wallet. 2. StormGain — Free Cloud Mining Plus Spot Trading in One App StormGain fuses zero‑cost cloud mining with a full spot‑trading terminal inside a single mobile app—no leverage, options, or other derivatives to complicate risk. The built‑in profit calculator, live price panel, and flexible contract lengths let users scale hash power up or down at will. Global, high‑efficiency data centers keep uptime high and temperatures low, making StormGain a one‑stop choice for miners who want the option to sell, HODL, or stake their freshly minted coins the moment they receive them. 3. Bitdeer — Enterprise‑Grade Hash Power, Retail‑Friendly Interface With heavyweight miner manufacturer Bitmain behind it, Bitdeer funnels data-center–level hash power directly into the hands of everyday crypto investors. Choose from shared mining pools, fixed‑term contracts, or large bespoke packages—perfect for everyone from small holders to institutions with deep capital. 4. hashj Mining — Legacy Stability for Conservative Investors A veteran of the cloud‑mining scene, hashj Mining (not to be confused with HASHJ’s ultra‑short product above) boasts years of operational history and a worldwide node network. Its yields are deliberately less aggressive than newer entrants, but its emphasis on rock‑solid uptime and stringent security standards makes it a favourite for risk‑averse users seeking reliable, predictable returns. 5. ViaBTC — Dual Engine of Mining Pool & Cloud Contracts ViaBTC operates one of the world’s largest public mining pools and offers cloud‑contract purchasing on the same platform. Investors can buy hash power outright or plug existing rigs into the pool for fee sharing. Comprehensive analytics and diverse withdrawal methods offer the perfect blend of instant liquidity and sustainable mining returns. The Bottom Line: Million‑Dollar Cloud Mining Isn’t Fantasy Turning a small stake into life‑changing capital may sound far‑fetched, but with a compliant provider, verifiable hash power, and transparent payout logic, it’s within reach. Actual results depend on contract choice, market cycles, and your reinvestment strategy—but these five names, especially the fast‑cycle model of HASHJ, prove that you don’t need hardware or coding skills to tap the digital gold rush.

Reports show that the digital collectible market had its most significant weekly gain in a long time. NFTs Market Sees Increased Trading Activity and Participation Notably, this happened as Bitcoin’s (BTC) price increased to $105,000, and Ethereum (ETH) also saw a slight increase. The global crypto market cap grew slightly from $3.28 trillion to $3.29 trillion. Activity in the NFT space has grown significantly. The number of buyers increased by over 50%, reaching over 1 million. Sellers also increased, and the number of trades increased by nearly 8%. This shows that more people are getting back into the NFT market. Immutable Surpasses Ethereum in NFT Blockchain Sales This rise in activity comes as Immutable (IMX), a blockchain used for NFTs, became the top-selling platform this week, beating the Ethereum blockchain for the first time in months. It made $41.7 million in sales, jumping over 150%. Ethereum dropped to second place but still grew by around 7%. The Bitcoin network stayed third with $19.4 million in sales after a 22% rise. Polygon also saw strong growth and is now close to Bitcoin. Other blockchains, like Mythos, BNB Chain, and Solana, also had more NFT buyers. Polygon had the biggest jump in buyers, followed by Solana and Bitcoin. New NFT Market Collections on the Rise Immutable’s growth has helped bring attention to fresh Non-Fungible Token collections. Guild of Guardians Heroes was the top-selling NFT collection this week. It made $24.7 million in sales, doubling its previous performance. This collection runs on Immutable, which helped it grow fast. On the Polygon network, Courtyard came second with $17.2 million in sales. Another Guild of Guardians collection, Avatars, came third with $10.3 million. DMarket held onto fourth place, and Bitcoin’s Ordinals, a new entry, made it into the top five with a massive increase in sales. These changes in rankings show that newer collections and platforms are gaining ground while older names, like CryptoPunks, are beginning to fade. Surprisingly, CryptoPunks dropped out of the top five collections, even though some NFTs sold for high prices. In late March, CryptoPunks saw the highest growth, as sales spiked by a staggering 141% to reach $6.3 million. Amid the collection’s success, CryptoPunk #2967 made the top individual NFT sale of the week, selling 420 ETH for $843,070. However, new NFT collections are taking over, and CryptoPunks are no longer in the spotlight.

This forms a build-up area that could lead to a strong move. If buyers step in, XRP may rise to $0.68 and then $0.75. But if it falls below $0.60, it could drop back to $0.55. Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) is approaching a breakout setup near $0.125. If it breaks cleanly, the price could rally to $0.14 or higher. Both XRP and XLM rely on technical cues. On the other hand, Web3 ai ($WAI) offers real utility, not just price charts. Stage 8 tokens are now priced at $0.000422, giving buyers access to actual tools they can use. XRP Trading Signals Point Toward Key Rally XRP continues to test the $0.60 support for the third time in ten days, creating a decisive zone for the next move. If buyers defend this level, the coin could rebound toward $0.68 and possibly reach $0.75. Though trading volume is falling, the Relative Strength Index is turning upward, signaling growing momentum. A close under $0.60 may send XRP down to $0.55, where the 200-day moving average lies. On-chain metrics remain stable, with active addresses holding steady. The current narrow trading range presents a defined risk-reward opportunity, especially with upcoming macroeconomic updates expected to increase market volatility. Stellar Nears Key Resistance Breakout Point XLM currently trades around $0.12 after maintaining support at $0.115 for three consecutive sessions. A descending resistance trendline from March is facing pressure, supported by increasing trading volume. A daily close above $0.125 may trigger movement toward $0.14, with $0.15 as a broader upside target. The Relative Strength Index has started rising, indicating a potential shift in buyer strength. Cross-border payment usage and smart contract activity are both growing, especially since the Soroban update. If XLM fails to hold the $0.115 level, the coin risks a decline to $0.10. Volume confirmation remains critical for short-term price direction. Web3 AI Offers Real Utility with 1747% ROI Potential Web3 ai stands apart by offering fully functional AI tools built for advanced decision-making. Unlike many platforms that rely on bots or static dashboards, Web3 ai uses deep neural networks for natural language understanding, alongside GARCH models to detect market risk shifts. It processes real-time blockchain data to inform decisions, prioritising actionable insights over predictions. The platform currently features many tools: sentiment analysis using both social and on-chain sources, risk modeling that detects early trend changes, smart contract scans to highlight risks or errors, coin screening for new asset reliability, portfolio insights to improve balance, trend identification rooted in fundamentals, live blockchain metrics, and a natural language interface for fast user interaction. All tools will be live upon launch and are built to deliver speed, clarity, and accurate insights. These services are powered by the $WAI coin, which fuels every query. Stage 8 coins are now available at $0.000422, with the final stage priced at $0.003276. Upon listing, $WAI will debut at $0.005242, offering a potential 1747% return for early buyers. With over $7.7 million already raised and all 50 presale stages progressing, Web3 ai moves toward a full launch. After listing, access costs will increase, making early acquisition of coins more valuable. Web3 ai focuses on practical usage, giving users immediate access to tools that assist in real tasks like smart contract checks or coin analysis. The platform does not rely on hype but on real, functional technology already in use. Summing Up! XRP relies on technical patterns; its trading signal remains bullish only as long as $0.60 holds. If it breaks, the setup fails. Stellar’s breakout at $0.125 must hold, or falls below $0.115 and undo everything. Web3 AI doesn’t rely on chart patterns. Stage 8 tokens are priced at $0.000422 and will list at $0.005242, offering a potential ROI of 1747%. Each query, whether a risk check or coin vet, uses up $WAI, creating real demand today. That means sooner or later, coin use translates into coin demand. The tools will be live upon launch, the funding stage is advancing, and the listing upsides are clear. For users seeking practical access and big potential gains, WAI stands out.

While many projects are still stuck in the planning phase, a handful are already making real progress before hitting major listings. That’s exactly where the Best Presale Crypto projects tend to shine, combining fast progress, working features, and low entry prices. Right now, Nexchain, Bittensor, and NEAR Protocol are showing solid performance with growing traction. All have unique features or active communities backing their rise. But BlockDAG is leading the charge. With more than $304 million raised, 2 million mobile miners running, and a presale price still under $0.03, it may be the most underpriced project on the market. Let’s break down four major projects and see why BlockDAG could end up as the Best Presale Crypto of the year. 1. BlockDAG: A Strong Presale Backed by Real Progress and Network Growth BlockDAG is flipping the script on how a presale should be done. Its price now sits at $0.0276 in Batch 29, after starting at only $0.001. Over 22.3 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, with more than $304 million raised. A $0.0018 special offer runs through June 20, giving early users a shot at up to 2,660 percent returns before its $0.05 exchange debut. With that confirmed $0.05 listing coming, there’s still time for a big pre-listing upside. But long-term growth looks even more exciting. Some analysts predict BlockDAG could reach $1, offering more than 3,500 percent ROI, thanks to strong foundations and clear use cases. This Best Presale Crypto has already secured 20 exchange listings and a major U.S.-based sponsorship. Technically, it delivers high speed and scalability using a hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work model that can handle up to 15,000 transactions per second. It is also EVM compatible, making it easy for Ethereum-based dApps to switch over. More than 2 million users have already joined the X1 mobile mining app, giving BlockDAG a live and growing network well ahead of launch. It also offers grants, no-code dApp development tools, and a clear roadmap. This is not just a coin, it’s a full system. For those after the Best Presale Crypto that delivers real features and big upside, BlockDAG ticks every box. 2. Nexchain: AI-Powered Speed with Yield and Utility Nexchain is becoming a serious contender among new Layer 1s focused on AI and blockchain. It is currently in Stage 18 of its presale, with over $4.2 million raised out of a $4.725 million target. Selling at $0.07, Nexchain aims to be the Best Presale Crypto through solid mechanics, anti-whale systems, vesting protections, and CertiK-verified contracts. Its hybrid consensus mixes Proof-of-Stake and AI, boasting an impressive 400,000 transactions per second. Users earn passive income from gas fees, with a 10 percent daily return. With frequent AMAs and product previews, Nexchain is executing well, building trust and interest across the board. 3. Bittensor (TAO): Price Bounce with Expanding AI Networks Bittensor’s TAO is making a solid comeback after dipping in early June, now trading between $395 and $430. With over $140 million in daily trading volume and strong movement past major EMAs, the mood is getting bullish. Resistance could soon be tested between $450 and $475. What makes Bittensor worth comparing with Best Presale Crypto projects is its growing AI ecosystem. Projects like AIX and StreetVision are already building on it. While TAO is not in presale, its success shows what early-stage networks should aim for. If growth keeps up, it may serve as a blueprint for what today’s Best Presale Crypto efforts can become. 4. NEAR Protocol: Solid Activity & Major Backing NEAR Protocol continues to prove why it’s among the strongest Layer 1s. Even with recent market tension, it bounced back 4 percent from $2.49 to around $2.63. It reached 46 million monthly users in May, second only to Solana. NEAR’s backers, including DWF Labs, are helping reduce its inflation rate from 5 percent to 2.5 percent. Tools like NEAR Intents are making DeFi easier, and its trading volume stays above $200 million daily. Though NEAR has already launched, it serves as a model for what a Best Presale Crypto can evolve into, especially for projects like BlockDAG that are focused on infrastructure and long-term growth. Top Projects to Keep an Eye On If you are hunting for the Best Presale Crypto that blends hype with real development, BlockDAG clearly stands out. It has a full product stack in place, over $304 million already raised, 2 million users actively mining on X1, and 20 confirmed exchange listings. Nexchain also brings strength through AI integration and income mechanics. Bittensor is gaining ground fast with its AI-backed growth. NEAR is already proving what this kind of momentum can turn into. But for those who want to get in early, BlockDAG’s pricing, active network, and potential for rapid growth make it the front-runner. With the $0.05 listing drawing near, this Best Presale Crypto might never dip under $0.03 again. Now is the time to get in.

Which Is The Best Crypto for 2025 Gains?",https://thecoinrise.com/sui-targets-breakout-pepe-jumps-15-and-unstaked-presale-hits-9-8m-which-is-the-best-crypto-for-2025-gains/,"SUI is lining up for a breakout as DeFi momentum builds, and PEPE is heating up again with fresh whale activity boosting short-term interest. Both are drawing eyes, but something else is quietly gaining serious ground, and this time, it’s not just another pump. Unstaked has crossed $9.8 million in its Stage 20 presale, and it’s starting to turn heads for the right reasons. At just $0.011397 per token, buyers aren’t chasing hype; they’re positioning early for what some believe could be a massive upside. The project’s focus on AI agent monetization gives $UNSD real-world utility, and the launch price target of $0.1819 offers a clear 27x potential out of the gate. But the buzz doesn’t stop there. With growing on-chain volume expectations, talk of 3000x returns isn’t just wild speculation; it’s becoming a serious forecast. For those looking beyond the usual names, Unstaked is emerging as a long-term play with real weight behind it. Unstaked Presale Buyers Are Thinking Long Game Unstaked is no longer a hidden gem; it’s fast becoming one of the most talked-about crypto presales of 2025. With over $9.8 million already raised in Stage 20 and more than 1.1 billion $UNSD tokens sold, momentum is clearly building. But this isn’t a typical presale frenzy. What’s happening here is strategic accumulation. Buyers aren’t chasing hype; they’re betting on strong fundamentals and long-term potential. Currently priced at $0.011397, $UNSD is targeting a launch value of $0.1819. That’s a projected 27x return from presale to listing, but the real story goes much further. Investors aren’t just focused on the launch day pump. They’re looking at what comes next: monetized AI agents that could drive serious on-chain volume and revenue. With that, some are predicting potential gains of up to 3000x over time. What’s helping Unstaked stand out is its no-nonsense approach, no private sales, no backdoor discounts, and liquidity locked from day one. It’s a fair launch model that’s becoming harder to find, especially in the crowded AI crypto space. $UNSD isn’t just another token; it powers everything from agent creation to governance and access within the platform. For those with an eye on the bigger picture, Unstaked is shaping up to be more than a presale win. It’s being viewed as one of the strongest long-term holds of the year, and those getting in early might just be catching the start of something massive. SUI’s DeFi Expansion Gains Momentum SUI is starting to grab serious attention as DeFi activity on the network picks up. With total value locked on the rise and daily users increasing, momentum is clearly building. Low gas fees and faster transaction finality are helping drive new interest, and analysts are now eyeing a potential push toward the $1.50 mark, provided current support levels hold. What’s adding fuel to this setup is the wave of new DeFi protocols launching on Sui. Yield chasers are starting to take notice, especially as other Layer 1s lose steam. Instead of stalling out, Sui is expanding, bringing in fresh projects and a growing user base at a steady pace. If this trend continues, SUI could quickly move out of the shadows and into serious mid-cap territory by Q3. With the ecosystem gaining traction and builders showing up, this isn’t just another short-term spike; it’s shaping up as a long-game play. Whale Activity Pushes PEPE Higher PEPE is back on the move, and this time it’s not just noise. Whale wallets are stacking up again, sending trading volume past key levels and lifting the price nearly 15% over the past week. After holding steady near its recent lows, the bounce has sparked real talk about whether PEPE is gearing up for another big meme coin run. What’s behind the move isn’t just hype; it’s fresh liquidity flowing into meme coins as traders start leaning back into risk. With PEPE’s market cap holding strong above $5.5 billion, this rally feels more grounded than speculative. The current surge looks like real demand, not just a quick flip. If momentum keeps building through the weekend, PEPE could easily punch through short-term resistance and lead a broader meme coin shift heading into Q3. Meme season might be heating up again, and PEPE is right at the front of the pack. Final Thoughts SUI is showing strength with growing DeFi activity fueling a potential breakout, while PEPE is gaining steam again as whale action and rising volume push it higher. Both are making solid moves, but neither offers the kind of setup Unstaked does right now. With over $9.8 million already raised and the presale price locked at $0.011397, Unstaked is still early, and that’s exactly what’s getting attention. The launch price is projected at $0.1819, setting up a 27x jump from current levels. But many see this as just the beginning. What’s driving the excitement? Real utility. The $UNSD token powers AI agent monetization, governance, and platform access, giving it serious long-term value. And with no private sales or early insider advantages, it’s one of the few presales that feels built for fairness. In a market full of short-term spikes, Unstaked is shaping up to be a long-term breakout.

The news, reported by Iranian state media and confirmed by The Jerusalem Post, showed two key South Pars gas facilities were hit Saturday by Israeli unmanned aerial vehicles, while another attack reportedly targeted an oil depot near Tehran. The response came just two days after Israel carried out air raids on Iran’s military leadership, missile sites, and nuclear infrastructure, raising fears that the conflict will spill into energy routes and supply systems. The attacks caused US crude oil to jump $2.72—a 3.7% gain—closing at $75.67 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent crude rose $3.67, up 4.94%, ending the day at $77.90. The rally followed a massive 7% surge on Friday, marking the most volatile move in the oil market since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Combined, last week saw a 13% gain in US crude alone. Iran retaliates, warns of shutting vital oil route The escalation didn’t stop at Israel’s offensive. According to The Times of Israel, Iranian missile strikes struck a major refinery in Haifa, worsening concerns over global oil supplies. Tensions remain high as the war enters day three, with no indication that either side will step back. On Saturday, a senior Iranian commander threatened to shut the Strait of Hormuz, the strategic chokepoint through which more than 20% of global oil exports move. If that happens, it could paralyze international energy logistics. Stock futures tumbled as soon as markets opened. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 92 points (or 0.2%), while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures both fell by 0.2% as well. This came on the heels of a brutal Friday session, when the Dow plunged over 700 points. All three indexes finished the week in the red—Dow down 1.3%, S&P 500 lower by 0.4%, and Nasdaq Composite closing with a 0.6% loss. Crypto stays largely muted as gold surges Investors ran to safety. Gold rallied hard, reaching $3,450. Global currencies took a hit. The euro fell to 1.1555 against the dollar, down 0.39%. The British pound dropped 0.45% to 1.3565, while the Japanese yen rose 0.66% to 144.14 per dollar. The Canadian dollar slid to 1.3587, and the Australian dollar dropped sharply to 0.6485, down 0.66%. The crypto market has managed to stay flat through it all. At press time, Bitcoin was worth $105,182, down 0.32%. Ethereum was up 0.15% to $2,538, while Cardano and XRP both rose 1%. Dogecoin dropped the most, falling 2.08% to $0.1751. Market watchers are now locked in on manufacturing survey data coming Monday morning, right before the Federal Reserve’s rate decision on Wednesday. With current expectations holding firm at a 97% probability of no change, the spike in oil prices is throwing a wrench into hopes for a pivot. As you may know, president Donald Trump has been publicly pressuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell for a rate cut. But with energy costs ballooning, odds of a policy shift are fading fast.

Institutional participation, once marked by caution, has now transformed into active engagement, with major entities embracing decentralized technologies at an accelerated pace. From the rise of innovative DeFi solutions to the growing adoption of real-world asset tokenization, the momentum across the digital finance landscape is substantial. As traditional financial systems progressively integrate decentralized models, a new wave of blockchain projects is emerging—many supported by highly informed and engaged communities. For buyers seeking near-term opportunities, the focus is increasingly shifting toward identifying the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term. This surge of adoption has led many to seek options outside of traditional financial systems, drawn by the appeal of transparency, control, and higher growth potential. Qubetics , a rising contender in this space, is one of the projects redefining what it means to participate in a secure, efficient, and user-first digital finance world. Let’s take a deeper dive into how it stacks up alongside established players like Algorand and Arweave. Qubetics – The Web3 Aggregator Reshaping Digital Finance One of Qubetics’ most talked-about features is its deep focus on fixing the Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet issue. Juggling four or five wallets, each tied to different chains—Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, you name it. That’s the reality today for many community members, especially freelancers managing cross-border payments, small businesses collecting multiple crypto payments, or Web3 devs jumping between testnets. Qubetics streamlines this process, offering a seamless and secure wallet that supports multi-chain operations without sacrificing custody or control. No third-party keys, no painful logins, no app-hopping. A freelance graphic designer getting paid in $USDT on Ethereum, then switching over to use Solana for gas-efficient NFT mints. Or an e-commerce store owner accepting crypto from backers across multiple blockchains. Qubetics puts that entire toolkit into one sleek interface. This practical functionality is precisely what makes it one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term, especially for buyers looking for real-world applications over hype. Qubetics Presale Heats Up: $TICS Gains Momentum as One of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold Short-Term That’s where Qubetics, the world’s first web3 aggregator, is winning attention. Currently in Presale Stage 37, Qubetics has already raised over $18 million, with more than 27,900 token holders and 515 million $TICS coins sold. Its presale token price is $0.3370, and analysts are making bold predictions about its trajectory. If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, we’re talking about a 197% return. If it reaches $10 or $15 after Mainnet, adopters could be looking at 2,867% to 4,350% ROI. Qubetics cut supply from over 4B to 1.36B $TICS—now just 10M tokens remain in the final sale at $0.3370. Listing will open at a 20% premium. Scarcity is real, and the clock is ticking. That’s the kind of growth projection that’s grabbing serious attention from the crypto-savvy crowd searching for the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term. On top of that, the project’s crypto presale has generated growing chatter thanks to its transparency and steady demand. Algorand – Consistency Meets Innovation Algorand’s reputation speaks for itself. Designed to be scalable and environmentally responsible, Algorand is known for its blazing transaction speed and near-zero fees. It’s built a strong base as a go-to blockchain for financial apps, especially where performance and trust matter. It’s no surprise then that Algorand is regularly included in discussions about the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term. The network’s structure enables smart contracts and token issuance with maximum security, making it a favorite for decentralized apps and institutions venturing into blockchain. Over the years, it’s maintained a solid market presence and loyal user base. ALGO tokens continue to move in sync with strategic developments, partnerships, and ecosystem upgrades, making them attractive for backers seeking both liquidity and dependability. Arweave – The Backbone of Decentralized Storage Arweave has established itself as a leading solution for long-term data storage on the blockchain through its innovative “permaweb” concept. By offering permanent data hosting via a one-time payment, Arweave eliminates the need for ongoing subscriptions or renewals, ensuring continuous access to stored information. This model is particularly valuable for decentralized applications, NFT metadata, and digital archives that require immutable, censorship-resistant storage. Over the past few years, the project has solidified its spot in the blockchain infrastructure club. Its native token, AR, is used to pay for storage, and the demand has been growing steadily. With Web3 developers prioritizing censorship-resistance and transparency, Arweave provides a vital layer of permanence. For anyone searching for alternative digital assets and wondering what the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term are, Arweave consistently lands on the radar. Conclusion – Which One Stands Out the Most? All three projects—Qubetics, Algorand, and Arweave—bring something valuable to the table. Algorand delivers steady, secure transactions. Arweave guarantees that your data is here to stay. But Qubetics? It’s solving real problems for real users, while actively shaping the future of Web3. Its crypto presale results, paired with clear technical purpose and real-life functionality, place it in the fast lane of adoption. So, if you’re seriously considering the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term , Qubetics should be top of mind. Its potential upside is massive, and the presale window is still open—for now. Do your research, weigh your options, and if it fits your strategy, consider joining thousands of backers who’ve already taken the plunge.

Qubetics stands out because it’s not just launching a token—it’s introducing the world’s first web3 aggregator with real utility, including a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet that solves daily crypto management issues for businesses and individuals. How does Qubetics offer short-term returns? With $TICS priced at $0.3370 and analyst predictions reaching $15 after Mainnet, Qubetics presents one of the highest ROI potentials in the short term, making it one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term. Can Qubetics’ wallet support multiple tokens across chains? Yes. It offers full support for multiple chains and tokens, solving a huge issue for buyers who use different platforms and don’t want to juggle multiple wallets.

The South Korean media outlet Biz Watch reported that the new government’s won-pegged stablecoin has become a “hot topic” in both the financial sector and blockchain industry, with “related” coins attracting attention. MEVerse (MEV) prices over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap) The outlet noted that while high-cap cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP are experiencing price stagnation, “only certain domestic coins have been showing abnormal price surges.” Examples include MEVerse (MEV), which shot up from around KRW 3 to KRW 20 won, as well as fanC (FANC), which rose from KRW 5 to KRW 13 won. fanC (FANC) prices over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap) In the same period, Wrapped Nine Chronicle Gold (WNCG) increased from around KRW 29 won to KRW 57 won. Tokens like BORA and Storm X (STMX) have also seen price rises of over 60% on domestic crypto exchanges. Coins Remain Popular in South Korea The outlet explained that MEV is a coin issued by the KOSDAQ-listed gaming and entertainment company Me2On.

In both cases, 99% or more of the coins’ global trading volume takes place on domestic exchanges like Bithumb and Coinone. Biz Watch wrote: “Many of these coins have been ignored by investors for a long time. Their trading volumes and market prices have been at rock bottom. As market interest has cooled, it has become harder to find information about project activity levels and technological capabilities.” Experts Issue Warning Apywa is a South Korean analyst that provides evaluation grades for domestic and international projects. It grades FANC at C- , with 41.48 points out of 100. By contrast, it rates BTC at A+ with almost 95 points. MEV scores 45.83 points (grade C), with STMX receiving a B- and BORA a B. Apywa deducts points for coins that show relatively low levels of community activity and development activity.

In other instances, these projects’ coins may have certain payment and/or settlement functions that have caught the eye of some traders. At the time of writing, MEV trading volumes on Bithumb were outstripping those of Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) . The top seven coins by trading volume on Bithumb over the past 24 hours.

An unnamed securities firm employee said: “With the government’s push to issue a won-denominated stablecoin, fintech and blockchain companies are announcing business plans, one after another. They are claiming relevance, and their prices are rising.” Nine Chronicles (WNCG) prices over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap) A crypto industry insider added: “In the past, projects like Paycoin (PCI) soared when local government stablecoins were a big thing. They then went on to drop by more than 30% in a few days. In the same way, coins related to won stablecoins could also plummet at any time. Investors should carefully consider the operational status and business viability of projects. People should invest with caution.” The post Kimchi Coins Booming on South Korean Stablecoin News – But Experts Urge Caution appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Altcoin|South Korea,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-15 23:30:00

Here’s the Timeline",https://timestabloid.com/investor-projects-462800-xrp-price-rally-heres-the-timeline/,"A crypto investor known as Remi Relief (@RemiRelierX) has predicted that XRP could reach $10,000 by 2029. According to him, the timeline is not arbitrary. It marks what would be Donald Trump’s final year in office following his re-election in 2024. In his post on X, Remi argued that Trump, now in his second and final term, will seek to establish a lasting economic legacy and that this could involve helping XRP reach extreme valuations. He claims the motivation isn’t to reward holders but to reinforce the U.S. government’s financial strength, which he says is increasingly tied to Ripple and the XRP Ledger (XRPL). In that context, a dramatic revaluation of XRP would serve broader national goals and support the long-term credibility of U.S.-led financial systems. XRP to $10,000 By 2029 … First let me preface this by saying XRP has a set price. I’ve been telling everyone this for months. How much is it? I don’t know but I think there will be a set “base price” of $10,000. I spoke about this in an earlier post which I’ll re-post… pic.twitter.com/1SbB2c5OFp — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) June 14, 2025 A Belief in a Fixed Price Model At the heart of Remi’s view is the belief that XRP has, or will soon have, a fixed or pre-determined base price. Though he acknowledges he does not know the exact number, he believes $10,000 is a realistic figure. This outlook stands in contrast to traditional market-based pricing, relying instead on the idea that price could be institutionally guided based on strategic utility. He has expressed this view previously and shares the explanation for his optimism. He referenced Quincy Jones, a developer for the XDC network, who once said XRP could theoretically reach $1 million depending on how much global debt it is used to settle. Remi agrees with that principle, stating he “100%” believes it. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Long-Term Strategy and Investor Discipline Remi cautions against selling too early. He warns that many retail investors will offload their holdings at $100 , $500, or even $1,000, thereby missing out on generational wealth, which he believes is XRP’s true potential. “$10,000 x 100 XRP = $1M,” he wrote, suggesting holders should aim to retain at least 100 XRP tokens if possible. He urges followers to store their assets securely, preferably off centralized exchanges. Other experts have advised token holders to store their XRP in cold wallets , and Remi Relief reveals that he uses around 15 cold wallets, two exchanges, and a dedicated crypto phone. His strategy stems from missed opportunities in earlier technological waves, such as the dot-com boom and Bitcoin’s rise, which he says he didn’t take seriously enough at the time. He shared tweets showing people who missed out on Bitcoin in the early days—a tweet from 2027 by someone complaining that they did not hold onto their XRP.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 248,500 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) looks very strong despite the recent marketwide correction. The trader sees HYPE consolidating close to the highs for now before igniting a fresh leg up en route to a new record high. “HYPE has insane strength right now, this one got bought up quickly. wouldn’t be surprised to see a bit more chop around here but $50+ is destined, even in these crazy times.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, HYPE is worth $40.44. While Altcoin Sherpa is bullish on HYPE, he says he’s bearish on two Solana ( SOL )-based memecoins. The trader notes that dogwifhat ( WIF ) and Popcat ( POPCAT ) are both in the midst of a downtrend and may drop to much lower levels if BTC fails to print new all-time highs. “Moment of truth for many of these [coins] soon; that could have just been a lower high formed.

At time of writing, POPCAT is worth $0.31. Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that WIF could plunge to $0.60. At time of writing, WIF is trading for $0.839.

The announcement came in a joint statement on Sunday as the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, paid his first official visit as head of government to Canada. Starmer held talks with Canadian counterpart Mark Carney as part of a series of bilateral discussions to deepen existing partnerships and forge new economic cooperation. The statement said the working group will recommend its suggestions to both PMs within six months. “We will establish a new structured UK-Canada Economic and Trade Working Group to deepen our existing trading relationship further,” the joint statement by the two prime ministers said. The move represents a fresh promise by the two countries to recast their trading relationship during changing global economic patterns and supply line disruptions. UK and Canada expand cooperation on digital trade and AI The new working group will tackle market access barriers and deepen cooperation in up-and-coming areas. It has identified as priorities digital trade, the building of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, and strategic alliances in critical minerals. Canada and the UK consider these sectors central to their future economic resilience . By coordinating efforts, they want to ensure their economies become even more competitive, inclusive, and innovative in a fast-paced world market. The move also addresses concerns inside Canada about too much reliance on US markets as Canadian industries — including steel, aluminum, and car manufacturing — continue to face tariffs and trade barriers to the US market. The Conference Board of Canada reports that the UK accounted for just 3.6% of Canada’s exports and 1.2% of its imports in 2024, making it a relatively minor trading partner. However, both governments are keen to explore untapped opportunities beyond the usual commodities trade. While Canada’s exports to the UK are largely dominated by gold and energy, the new plan seeks to broaden and diversify trade between the two nations. Leaders advance trade pacts and strengthen military cooperation Canada pledged to introduce legislation later in 2025 to ratify the United Kingdom’s accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and establish the new trade working group. The CPTPP is a broad trade agreement among 11 nations, including Japan, Australia, Mexico, and Singapore. The UK became a member of the trade bloc last year on a provisional basis, with benefits granted to it from nine Indo-Pacific markets. However, Canada and Mexico need final ratification to benefit fully from membership. The move reiterates Canada’s determination to multilateralism and its Indo-Pacific strategy and provides a stronger presence for the UK in the region following Brexit. In addition to their economic ties, the joint statement highlighted an expansion of defense cooperation between the two countries. Canada and the UK also reinforced the pledge to stand by Ukraine as part of wider G7 cooperation on global security. As geopolitical tensions mount and global supply chains are strained, governments seem to be coming together on common values and strategic objectives. The news comes as G7 leaders meet in Alberta this weekend for a three-day summit into global economic resilience, technological innovation, and international security. For Carney, the conference is an opportunity to promote Canada’s role in global trade and the green economy. It is Starmer’s first outing on the world stage since becoming leader, and he is focusing on wanting to reconnect internationally. This reinvigorated UK-Canada partnership is a timely testament that you can never have enough tried and trusted friends in today’s unsteady global economy.

But while the spotlight stays on this frog-themed token, investors are also turning eyes to under-the-radar DeFi token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) priced at $0.03. The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 12,000 investors. More than $10.6 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 2x profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. Pepe Coin Forecast: Steady Climb into Q3 Pepe Coin (PEPE) is trading around $0.000012, rebounding slightly, up about 2.1% in 24 hours, after a recent dip that left prices roughly 12% lower than the May highs. Technical indicators point to consolidation, with analysts projecting a short-term bounce toward 0.000016, a potential 25% upside, if current support holds. Beyond that, broader bullish scenarios suggest PEPE could reach as high as $0.00004 by late 2025, assuming meme-coin momentum reemerges and BTC continues its upward trend. This positions PEPE as a meme-coin contender to watch, while new DeFi plays like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly emerge on investors’ radars.
