It’s likely that short-term traders have taken some profits following the market’s rally over the weekend, although most coins are still up in the past seven days. This includes XRP, Pump.fun and Hyperliquid, which are all showing strong momentum despite correcting a little today. But if the FOMC does cut rates later this week, they could all rebound strongly, bringing traders more profits. Crypto Price Prediction Today 15 September XRP ($XRP): Ripple Expansion Means Altcoin Could Be Biggest Winner of Bull Market It’s down by 3.5% today, but XRP remains one of the most bullish tokens in the top-100 by quite some margin. At $2.98, it remains up by 1.5% in a week and by 6% in a fortnight, although it is down by 5% in the past month. This monthly decline is arguably bullish, however, since it indicates that XRP is due to correct upwards in the near future. Its chart also invites this suspicion, given that its had yet to reach an overbought position prior to its decline today. Source: TradingView In other words, today likely represents a blip within a medium-term upswing, which could get into motion as and when the much-hoped-for rate cut arrives on Wednesday. More fundamentally, XRP is in a great position to ride any end-of-year bull rally, given Ripple’s encouraging growth in recent weeks. It has signed partnerships with major banks , made important acquisitions, and also expanded into Dubai and Africa, so the future looks very bright for the firm. In view of this, the XRP price could hit $3.50 by the end of the month, and close 2025 at over $5. Pump.fun ($PUMP): Growth of Launchpad Could Push New Token to Record Highs by End of Week PUMP is currently priced at $0.007989, which marks a 1.5% loss today, having set a new ATH of $0.008819 within the past 24 hours. The altcoin is also up by an astonishing 129% in a month, making it one of the best-performing tokens in the market across this timeframe. And fundamentally, PUMP is in a strong position, given that Pump.fun remains the biggest token launchpad on Solana, with 8 million unique active wallets in the past month , as well as a volume of $1 billion. Looking at its chart, its indicators suggest that it may be close to peaking, yet it’s also possible that the FOMC meeting later this week could give it a second wind. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) has bounced up again after dipping from 80 over the weekend, suggesting that it has momentum left to spare. Some whales are continuing to invest more deeply in PUMP , despite the possibility that it could peak soon, indicating confidence in its long-term prospects. It has already bounced within the past hour, so we could see it testing new highs later in the week, potentially passing $0.0950 by the weekend. Hyperliquid ($HYPE): Altcoin Hitting New Highs As Native DEX Platform Continues to Grow HYPE has declined by 1.5% today, but its current price of $53.51 marks a 5% gain in a week, with the coin hitting a new ATH over the weekend. Hyperliquid is another token that has the advantage of having a strong platform behind it, with the Hyperliquid DEX now boasting a total value locked in of $2.6 billion . This makes it the eighth-biggest platform in crypto in terms of TVL, and its on-chain value only continues to grow. For this reason, we can expect the Hyperliquid price to keep climbing in the medium- and long-term. Source: TradingView Its indicators suggest that it may also be close to peaking, but given that the wider market is entering a bullish phase, it could continue to rise into Q4. We could therefore see the HYPE price reach $75 by the end of the month, $100 by the end of October, and $150 by 2026. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): L2 Network Raises $16 Million As Launch Quickly Approaches The crypto price prediction for these 3 tokens is very positive right now, but the incoming bull market will also see many other coins outperforming averages. This is likely to include presale tokens, with one of the most exciting presale coins right now being Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new L2 project for Bitcoin . Bitcoin, but faster. Introducing Bitcoin Hyper: the Layer-2 that brings speed & scalability back to BTC. pic.twitter.com/tPe1eQmYWv — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 14, 2025 Bitcoin Hyper has raised $16 million in its ongoing presale, with investors excited by its plans to launch a true layer-two network for Bitcoin. In its role as an L2, it will offer low transaction fees and fast confirmation times, provide an ecosystem in which BTC holders can put their holdings to work. It’s aiming to become a DeFi and trading layer for Bitcoin, tapping into its network’s huge value, and providing Bitcoin holders with opportunities to make additional profits. Using Solana’s Virtual Machine and zero-knowledge rollups, it will provide an unparalleled level of scalability and security. Its native token, HYPER, will be necessary to pay transaction fees, so it could witness lots of demand once the network launches. Investors can join its sale by heading over to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as MetaMask or Best Wallet. HYPER now costs $0.012925, but this will rise repeatedly as the sale progresses.

The Solana price is still drawing eyes, Chainlink is making headlines, but experts argue that only Remittix is positioned as the best crypto to buy now in Q3. With its wallet beta launch imminent, a $250,000 giveaway live, and a 15 per cent referral program already paying out daily in USDT, the window to act is closing. Find out more in this article. Solana Price Performance and Outlook Solana price is floating at around $246.91, which is an indicator of an unexpected stability in the market where there is volatility. Its blazing-fast blockchain and minimal gas charges are appreciated by analysts, which spur developers and DeFi projects need. In the recent past, there has been the deployment of new platforms on the network of Solana increasing the liquidity and adoption. However, as the Solana price looks healthy, traders are undecided whether the next upward move will be robust or temporary. Predictions are optimistic so long as the ecosystem continues to grow, although the gain might be limited relative to smaller tokens that have higher growth potential. Chainlink’s Latest Developments and Market Impact The latest Chainlink news has kept its token in the spotlight. Integrations across DeFi continue to multiply, reinforcing its position as the industry’s leading decentralized oracle provider. Secure data feeds are now more critical than ever, and Chainlink is a name institutions trust to deliver. As positive as these developments are, some question whether Chainlink has already priced in much of its growth. Why Remittix Stands Out As Best Crypto To Buy Now This is where Remittix changes the game. Unlike Solana and Chainlink, Remittix is targeting a global market worth trillions of dollars. It is not about speculation, it is about solving payments for businesses, freelancers, and everyday users. Remittix has sold over 662 million tokens, raised more than 25.6 million dollars, and is priced at just $0.1080. A BitMart listing was locked in after the 20 million milestone, LBANK followed after 22 million, and a third CEX is on deck. Momentum is undeniable. With the wallet beta launching on September 15 and a massive $250,000 giveaway underway, the race to accumulate RTX has never been hotter. Analysts are already calling it the best crypto to buy now , and for good reason: • RTX is solving a real world 19 trillion dollar payments problem. • Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries. • The tokenomics are deflationary and designed for long term growth. • Project momentum is accelerating ahead of the beta launch. • The referral program pays 15 percent in USDT, claimable daily via the dashboard. Every signal points to scarcity. The market is tightening, listings are lining up, and demand is accelerating. Investors who wait risk watching the value slip away to early movers. Remittix is not another speculative play. It is a payments solution backed by tech, listings, and adoption. That is why experts rank it as the best crypto to buy now, and why buyers are rushing in before the wallet launch activates its utility.

In a thread posted on September 12 and expanded over the weekend, analyst Nik Patel (@cointradernik) said the current positioning backdrop “is less like March and Dec ’24 crossovers and more like Dec ’23,” warning that the market is set up for a “multi-week whipsaw going into early/mid Oct.” He added a specific liquidation map: “Give me $1.5bn in shorts liqs on the weekly and then $2.8bn of long liqs into Oct 7th pls.” pic.twitter.com/LVsY4bU99o — Nik (@cointradernik) September 12, 2025 What Is Different This Time For Bitcoin? What makes this setup different, in his view, is the balance between spot and derivatives flows and the breadth of basis trades. “Spot vol as % of total vol [is] lower here than prior crossovers for Others OI vs BTC OI (March ’24 and Dec ’24),” he wrote, arguing that if spot demand were truly in the driver’s seat “we should expect spot vol as a % of total vol to be higher not lower.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Above Mid-Term Holder Breakeven – Is A Fresh Rally Brewing? Instead, he sees “a combination of basis trade across a broader range of markets than just BTC & ETH but also more directional levered shorts than prior occasions,” with the immediate “upside risk… even greater for a short liq cascade first.” Funding, he noted, is “benign” relative to those earlier peaks. Real-time funding data broadly corroborate the “benign” characterization. Across major venues, BTC perpetual funding hovered close to flat in recent sessions—generally in the +0.005% to +0.01% per-8-hour range—well below the overheated prints typical of euphoric tops. That keeps the door open to a squeeze without the need to first unwind extreme long leverage. Sentiment, Nik argued, is still closer to “disbelief” than euphoria. He contrasted March 2024’s ETF frenzy and December 2024’s post-election optimism with today’s more skeptical tone, pointing to a still-elevated pool of sidelined capital. “Both prior crossovers had stablecoin dominance trough at 5% ish. We are currently at 6.1% — imo this is textbook disbelief/Sidelined September positioning,” he wrote. In his base case, that war chest ultimately fuels year-end risk-taking once the whipsaw plays out: “We will almost certainly get the positioning whipsaw and bear trap during that quarterly end & monthly open window of weakness, but there are a lot more stables ready to be deployed here into year-end.” In a self-aware aside, Nik even shared a machine-generated distillation of his view: “ChatGPT coming to a similar conclusion here after I fed all these charts in, idk if that inspires confidence or concern about my view though lol.” Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is A Strong Buy If It Overcomes $118K — Here’s Why ChatGPT wrote: “Past crossovers: signaled end-phase altseason blowoffs, fueled by euphoric longs with no dry powder left. This crossover: signals pre-phase potential — leverage is already there, but it’s balanced/shorter, with capital still on the sidelines (stables). This is why the funding differential is so important: • High funding + low stables = top-like conditions. Low funding + high stables = squeeze-ready conditions.” Renowned crypto analyst CRG (@MacroCRG) consented: “Agree with him that a big short liq event is likely before a big long liq event still lots of positioning to unwind imo from ppl expecting a bearish September. In saying that, would like the coins to bounce soon, many are at/near key pivots.” As ever with path-dependent derivatives tape, the trigger matters. Nik cautioned that a “massive short liquidation event” in the coming week could flip the script if it invites “late longs” and spikes funding into October. But absent that sudden shift, his base case remains a two-step: an upside liquidation cascade that resets shorts, followed by a rug-pull on over-eager longs into the October 7 window. Traders watching for confirmation will focus on whether funding stays contained as price lifts, whether spot participation actually broadens rather than fades, and whether stablecoin deployment reduces the cash cushion he cites. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $114,852.

Over the weekend, the address acquired 3,976 ETH worth approximately $18.9 million, according to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence. The purchase was executed using 18.9 million DAI, a stablecoin, and split across multiple transactions before being consolidated into the buy. The transaction came just as Ethereum broke above $4,700, marking its highest level in more than two weeks. Currently, ETH trades at $4,538, down 2.9% in the past 24 hours. A Pattern of Bold Acquisitions This is not the first time the wallet has made waves. In July, it bought 4,863 ETH for $12.6 million and later added 649 ETH at $3,562 per token. Just last month, the same wallet scooped up $8 million worth of Solana (SOL), though that position has since slipped below entry price. Analysts say the strategy shows deliberate fund consolidation, often seen in money laundering tactics. Breaking transactions into smaller amounts and using privacy tools allows the hacker to mask movements, making tracking more difficult. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT previously estimated that the Coinbase-related social engineering scam drained at least $330 million from victims, warning that the real figure may be significantly higher. Growing Concerns Over Rising Crypto Hacks The latest Ethereum purchase shows broader concerns in the crypto industry, where hack-related losses reached $163 million in August alone, according to security firm PeckShield. With exploits shifting from smart contract bugs to social engineering and cross-chain bridge vulnerabilities, wallets like this continue to pose a major threat to investor confidence. Despite Coinbase offering a $20 million reward for information on the perpetrators and tightening security, the hacker remains unidentified. The latest $19M ETH grab proves the resilience and boldness of cybercriminals operating in the space. As crypto rallies and institutional inflows grow, the question remains: is the hacker simply riding bullish momentum, or is this part of a deeper strategy to launder stolen funds? Regulators and blockchain investigators are watching closely, but for now, the crypto world is left with more questions than answers.

Popular with retail investors, the trading platform revealed it filed plans with regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for this new fund dubbed Robinhood Ventures Fund I. Robinhood makes a shift towards inclusive venture capital According to the firm, the fund is meant to democratize access to private startups and potentially shape how everyday retail investors participate in high growth opportunities that have for long been a preserve of the elite – venture capital firms, institutions and the ultra-wealthy. This move also comes on the backdrop of rising interest in private markets where valuations have surged due to AI and digital innovations. Data cited by Robinhood’s newsroom post on Robinhood Newsroom shows that the number of listed domestic firms in the US has decreased, pushing more capital into private entities that often yield outsized returns for institutional players. “For decades, wealthy people and institutions have invested in private companies while retail investors have been unfairly locked out,” said Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev in a statement. “With Robinhood Ventures, everyday people will be able to invest in opportunities once reserved for the elite.” Tenev. If SEC approves the Robinhood Ventures Fund I, it will subsequently list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker RVI. According to a statement, its shares will be accessible to the public via various brokerages among them Robinhood’s own platform. The fund is expected to focus on investing in “a concentrated portfolio of private companies at the frontiers of their respective industries,” according to Robinhood. The Monday announcement is the latest in a series of strategic expansions by Robinhood as it recently coveted a spot on the S&P 500 and introduced a new social media feature known as Robinhood Social within its app during the past two weeks alone. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , the social media app will roll out next year with a select group of customers having invitations before rolling out to all users. The new fund aligns with the firm’s ecosystem The fund announcement also comes following the firm’s and controversial entry into tokenized equities in Europe, which offered exposure to private giants like the ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SpaceX. This initiative attracted criticism from OpenAI and scrutiny from European regulators, highlighting the complexities of innovating in the private market space. The filing also underscores the firm’s aggressive pivot from its origins as a commission-free stock trading app towards a more “diversified, multilane financial platform,” a transformation which has been significantly powered by the firm’s booming cryptocurrency business. Earlier this year, the firm revealed that transaction based revenues had climbed 77% year-over0year, largely driven by crypto trading. Its second quarter earnings also highlighted this momentum as revenue from crypto products surged 98% year-over-year to $160 million. According to the firm, total crypto trading volumes reached $35 billion. This growth, Robinhood said, was substantially driven by the June acquisition of the veteran European crypto exchange Bitstamp, which brought with it over 50 regulatory licenses and accounted for $7 billion in trading volume in second quarter alone from its institutional client base. Now, the introduction of the Robinhood Ventures Fund I marks a direct challenge to the traditional structures of private equity and represents a significant step in the company’s stated mission “to democratize finance for all.” Market watchers have also noted that this fund could lower barriers for retail investors, who have historically been left out due to high minimum investments and accreditation requirements. A report by WealthManagement.com shows how the fund, pending approval by SEC will enable ordinary users to gain exposure to startups before they can go public, potentially through tokenized assets or direct equity stakes.

Ever since SHIB’s legendary rally in 2021, investors have been searching for signs of another breakout moment. With its community-driven growth, the expansion of its Shibarium Layer 2 network, and broader developments in the meme coin sector, the question lingers: is SHIB preparing for its next big surge? At the same time, new entrants such as Layer Brett (LBRETT) are shifting the narrative, offering utility-backed alternatives that may influence how traders view meme tokens going forward. The current state of Shiba Inu Right now, Shiba Inu price prediction discussions focus on volatility, supply, and adoption. SHIB trades near $0.000014 , with a market capitalization in the $7–8 billion range . While far below its October 2021 all-time high of $0.00008845 , analysts note that new network developments could support a rebound. Shibarium, SHIB’s own Layer 2 solution, has introduced lower fees and faster transactions, a crucial element for long-term sustainability. These upgrades form the backbone of a more optimistic Shiba Inu price prediction. Still, headwinds remain: token supply remains enormous, transaction activity fluctuates, and competition from emerging meme coins is growing. Layer Brett: A rising contender While SHIB continues to capture attention, Layer Brett has become part of the same conversation. Its presale recently crossed $3.6 million , with tokens priced at $0.0058 Unlike many meme coins, Layer Brett is built as a Layer 2 solution on Ethereum, designed for scalability, speed, and low-cost transactions. For those tracking the Shiba Inu price prediction, Layer Brett presents a useful point of comparison. Where SHIB relies heavily on community strength and branding, Layer Brett layers in technical innovation, claiming gas fees as low as $0.0001 and offering staking rewards through its dApp. By combining meme appeal with utility, it is carving a different trajectory in the meme coin market. Comparing Forecasts: SHIB vs. Layer Brett A realistic Shiba Inu price prediction requires examining community behavior, on-chain activity, and network growth. Optimistic analysts suggest SHIB could double in price if Shibarium gains wider adoption. Others caution that without a major catalyst, SHIB may stay range-bound. Either way, its future rests on more than hype—it needs functional traction. In contrast, Layer Brett’s forecasts lean on its presale dynamics and tokenomics. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens and high staking incentives for early adopters, it attracts a different kind of speculation. Many commentators now mention Layer Brett in the same breath as the Shiba Inu price prediction, highlighting how new entrants may influence market sentiment. Conclusion The Shiba Inu price prediction remains a key topic in the meme coin sector. For SHIB, the path to another historic rally depends on adoption of Shibarium, reductions in transaction costs, and ongoing community engagement. For investors, this means keeping a close watch on SHIB’s technical developments as well as external market sentiment. Layer Brett, meanwhile, offers a contrasting approach—utility-driven growth layered onto meme culture. Its presale strength, low gas fees, and staking rewards give it momentum of its own. For some traders, balancing exposure between SHIB and Layer Brett could provide a hedge between history and innovation.

Japanese financial giant Credit Saison has just announced the launch of an ambitious blockchain fund , signaling a powerful new wave of institutional interest in the digital asset space. This move isn’t just about investing; it’s about pioneering the future of finance, specifically targeting the burgeoning real-world asset (RWA) sector. What is Onigiri Capital and its Blockchain Fund Focus? Credit Saison’s new venture, aptly named Onigiri Capital, is set to deploy up to $50 million into innovative startups. This dedicated blockchain fund will primarily concentrate on companies building solutions within the Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization domain. Imagine transforming traditional assets like real estate, commodities, or even intellectual property into digital tokens on a blockchain. This is precisely where Onigiri Capital sees immense potential. Investment Size: Up to $50 million. Primary Focus: Startups in the Real-World Asset (RWA) sector. Goal: Drive innovation and adoption of tokenized assets. Why Are Real-World Assets Crucial for a Blockchain Fund? The RWA sector is gaining incredible traction, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). Tokenizing RWAs offers numerous advantages, fundamentally changing how we perceive and interact with assets: Increased Liquidity: Assets that were once illiquid can be traded more easily on global markets. Fractional Ownership: Allows smaller investors to own a piece of high-value assets, democratizing access. Transparency: Blockchain records provide an immutable and transparent ownership trail, enhancing trust. Accessibility: Global access to investment opportunities, breaking down geographical barriers. Credit Saison’s strategic decision to focus its blockchain fund here highlights a forward-thinking approach, recognizing the massive untapped value in digitizing tangible and intangible assets. This move positions them at the forefront of financial innovation. Japan’s Growing Embrace of Blockchain Innovation This launch by Credit Saison isn’t an isolated event; it reflects a broader trend in Japan. The nation has been increasingly open to exploring blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, albeit with a cautious regulatory stance. Financial institutions are now actively looking for ways to integrate this technology into their core businesses. A dedicated blockchain fund from a firm of Credit Saison’s stature could inspire other traditional players to follow suit, further accelerating institutional adoption in Asia. The establishment of Onigiri Capital demonstrates a clear commitment to fostering growth in the Web3 ecosystem, particularly within a regulated financial framework. This institutional backing provides much-needed credibility and capital for promising startups, helping them scale and innovate. Navigating the Challenges and Seizing the Benefits of a Blockchain Fund While the potential of a blockchain fund focused on RWAs is immense, challenges certainly exist. Regulatory clarity, technological scalability, and market acceptance are all factors that need careful navigation. However, the benefits for early movers like Credit Saison are substantial: Pioneering Position: Establishing leadership in a rapidly evolving and competitive market. Diversification: Adding a new, high-growth asset class to their portfolio, reducing overall risk. Innovation Driver: Fostering new technologies that can benefit their existing financial services and create new revenue streams. Credit Saison’s move is a powerful statement about the future of finance, indicating a definitive shift towards a more digitized, transparent, and accessible financial system globally. This strategic investment solidifies their role as an innovator.

But moving away from Siberia and the North Caucuses is presenting miners with a new set of problems, media outlets in the nation have reported. Per a report from the Russian newspaper Vedomosti Yug , the B2B electrical equipment platform TenderPro has compiled a top 10 of areas where demand for crypto mining rigs and other related equipment is highest. Topping the table were Moscow and the Moscow Oblast (the region surrounding the capital). This area is now responsible for 21.9% of mining hardware purchases. Russian Crypto Miners: Relocating to Bigger Cities? The figure for the capital dwarfed demand figures (6.7%) in the Siberian oblast of Irkutsk. The latter is the birthplace of the Russian Bitcoin mining industry. A Russian crypto mining-related facility. (Source: Artemy Lebedev/VK) However, mining in much of Irkutsk is now illegal. Those mining farms that do have the right to operate in the Siberian region already reportedly “near full capacity.” The drift toward urban centers appears to be real: St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region took third spot with 4.7%. Krasnodar Krai, in the southwestern part of the North Caucasus region, took fourth place. Krasnodar is Russia’s third most populous federal subject. Kuban, also in the North Caucasus, rounded out the top five. The Total Hash Rate for the Bitcoin network over the past 12 months. (Source: Blockchain.com) The platform calculated that overall demand for mining equipment from commercial enterprises in the Russian South fell by 19.3% over the first eight months of 2025. A ‘Market Correction’ Olga Gorchitsyna, TenderPro’s Director of Digital Products Development, said that this fall in demand may be attributable to a market correction. She suggested that the Kremlin’s decision last year to legalize the crypto mining sector may have caused an exceptional spike in demand. Gorchitsyna explained: “A year ago, after the legalization of industrial mining, we saw a sharp increase in demand for crypto mining equipment. However, since the beginning of this year, the excitement around the sector has gradually begun to subside.” Russian prosecutors are targeting Denis Shtengelov's KDV Group, one of the country’s largest snack producers, for expropriation https://t.co/Ahk6oLYrm8 — Bloomberg (@business) September 15, 2025 In previous years, crypto miners made a beeline for the Northern Caucasus and Southern Siberia , attracted mainly to these areas’ famously low energy prices. But these areas are traditionally sparsely populated, meaning their generally more moderst power generation capabilities can easily be overloaded. The introduction of seasonal bans and police crackdowns on illegal miners in these regions has scared off many industrial miners. The statistics, it appears, now indicate that miners are preferring to set up shop in areas where power shortages are rare, and other mining firms are few and far between. Noise Concerns However, moving into the more densely populated European part of Russia is posting a new challenge for some Russian miners, as well as their international backers. Russia revives barter trade to dodge Western sanctions https://t.co/QnvdRaS1NU https://t.co/QnvdRaS1NU — Reuters (@Reuters) September 15, 2025 Some 260km southeast of Moscow, in the village of Kiritsy, Ryazan Region, a mining firm named Integral has faced a backlash after launching a crypto mining facility. The village has a population of over 3,000 people, who have complained bitterly about high noise levels since the firm turned on its rigs in April this year. Per the Ryazan branch of Top 24 News , Rospotrebnadzor, the Russian federal well-being and consumer rights agency, ordered Integral to suspend its operations for 30 days. The agency acted after residents complained that noise levels from the facility were rising above 50 decibels. Kiritsy residents said they were suffering from “headaches, hearing loss, and a general deterioration in health.” Watchdog Steps In, Russian Crypto Miners Face New Problems? Rospotrebnadzor told Integral it must install special equipment that will help suppress the noise. The firm has brought in “specialists from China” who will help install equipment aimed at reducing the farm’s noise levels. In August, Argumenti y Facti reported that residents say the mining facility uses gas piston turbine generators. One resident explained: “Two of these turbines are currently operational. But there are plans to install 20 more. These two turbines have already created unbearable living conditions for people here. It’s frightening to even imagine what will happen when there are 22 of them here.” Kiritsy residents complained that the turbine generators are “no more than 500 meters away” from some of their houses. They added that the village is home to a children’s tuberculosis healthcare center, where young people from all over the country come for treatment.

Behind every profitable trade lies a framework of discipline, consistency, and repeatable actions. In a market as volatile as digital assets, the traders who last are the ones who develop daily habits that keep them focused while others get distracted by noise. From Bitcoin whales to altcoin scalpers, veterans share a common truth: habits compound into results. In 2025, with ETFs driving institutional flows and altcoins preparing for their next cycle, the ability to sharpen habits may be the greatest edge a trader can have. Alongside proven methods, new opportunities are also entering conversations, one of them being MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could deliver 45× returns before major listings. Habit 1: Structured market research The first thing successful traders do daily is check the markets, but not just prices. They track macroeconomic events, ETF flows, on-chain data, and sentiment. By starting each day with structured research, they avoid reacting emotionally to sudden moves. Tools like CoinMarketCap, CryptoQuant, and Santiment provide context, whether it’s whale accumulation, exchange inflows, or funding rate shifts. This data-driven approach means they act from strategy, not impulse. Habit 2: Journaling trades A trading journal might sound old-fashioned, but it’s one of the most powerful tools for improvement. Successful traders log every position, entry, exit, rationale, and outcome. Over time, this builds a personal database that reveals patterns: strengths to lean on and weaknesses to avoid. Many beginners skip this step, but those who keep journals learn faster and cut losses earlier. As one professional once said, “Markets repeat themselves, your journal shows you how.” Habit 3: Mindset and discipline Psychology is half the battle. Top traders practice patience, emotional discipline, and resilience. They avoid revenge trading after losses and don’t let FOMO drive entries. Many have daily routines outside of charts, exercise, meditation, or reading, that sharpen focus. By grounding themselves, they bring stability into a market defined by chaos. This same principle of discipline applies to spotting new opportunities, where MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. With forecasts calling for a 45× move , the token is stirring global crypto communities. What makes MAGACOIN different is its balance of structure and energy. Traders describe it as the rare presale that blends smart tokenomics with cultural firepower, turning it into more than hype, it’s strategy in motion. Just as good habits compound in trading, presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE compound through momentum, and that synergy is why so many are watching closely. Habit 4: Continuous education Markets evolve, and traders evolve with them. The best spend at least 30–60 minutes a day studying new concepts: ETF mechanics, Layer-2 rollups, DeFi strategies, or simply reviewing macroeconomic reports. Crypto is one of the fastest-moving industries in finance; those who stop learning fall behind. Successful traders treat education as part of their routine, not an afterthought. Habit 5: Risk management rituals Every day, top traders reassess their risk. They set clear stop-loss levels, calculate position sizes, and ensure their exposure aligns with their capital plan. The traders who survive crashes are not the ones with the highest win rates, but the ones who never let a single loss wipe them out. Risk management isn’t glamorous, but it is the lifeline of every profitable career in crypto. Habit 6: Networking and community Crypto trading is no longer a solo sport. The best traders exchange ideas in private groups, Telegram channels, and Discord communities. They test strategies, share data, and learn from collective insights. Being part of a strong network keeps them updated and accountable. It also helps them spot early narratives, whether it’s ETF approvals, presale momentum, or altcoin rotations, that others miss until it’s too late. Habit 7: Reviewing and refining At the end of each day, successful traders review their performance. Did they stick to their plan? Did emotions interfere? Were entries timed correctly? This self-audit, repeated daily, builds discipline. It transforms trading from guesswork into a process. Over months and years, this refinement compounds into mastery. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is on Every Trader’s Radar Massive Upside Potential: Analysts are calling for up to 45× gains , giving it the kind of asymmetric return profile traders dream of. Deflationary Design: A scarcity-driven model ensures supply pressure favors early participants as the presale tightens. Balanced Strategy: Unlike hype-only plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE blends disciplined tokenomics with cultural firepower, making it both structured and energetic. Timing Advantage: Arriving before major exchange listings, it offers first-mover exposure that seasoned traders value for maximum upside. Conclusion: habits create longevity The crypto market rewards those who prepare, not those who gamble. The traders who thrive in 2025 are those who commit to daily habits: research, journaling, risk control, learning, and emotional discipline. These small steps add up to extraordinary results when applied consistently. At the same time, new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, forecasted for a potential 45× surge, are reminding traders that discipline isn’t just about risk; it’s also about recognizing projects with huge growth potential on time. For anyone aiming to trade successfully, combining solid habits with timely opportunities may be the most powerful strategy of all.

Remittix(RTX) , already being called “XRP 2.0,” is riding its own momentum with a 15% USDT referral program, a $250,000 giveaway, and the wallet beta launching in 24 hours, the first working product in the Remittix ecosystem. With XRP pushing toward $4 from just under $0.10, comparisons are everywhere. Will XRP’s newfound strength hold as Remittix sets the stage for its own breakout? XRP Price Prediction: Ripple’s Path to $4 Recent XRP price action shows strength. After clearing resistance near $3.01, XRP is setting up for further gains according to chart signals. Large wallet addresses have been steadily adding to their holdings, on-chain activity confirms growing participation from smaller investors, and technical analysts now view $3.66 as the next area that could attract strong buying interest. Even so, overhead barriers between $3.50 and $4 are expected to act as a real test. Catalysts such as approval of exchange-traded funds or more clarity from regulators could be what finally drives momentum past that zone. How Remittix Compares and Stands Out While XRP aims for $4, Remittix is already turning heads. Unlike XRP, whose strength depends on long-standing networks and regulatory wins, Remittix is being designed as an altcoin with working product features from the start. Its referral rewards, live utility, and near-term launch set it apart. On the funding side, Remittix has already sold more than 662 million tokens at $0.1080 each and raised over $25.6 million. Importantly, the project secured a BitMart listing right after surpassing $20 million raised, then announced an LBANK listing once the $22 million level was cleared, and is now preparing a third CEX. These milestones show how investor demand is translating into global exchange traction at a pace rarely seen in early-stage projects. Check what makes Remittix special right now: Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries Global payout rails are integrated already and expanding The project is audited by CertiK, which builds trust and transparency Early believers are already calling it “XRP 2.0” It is built for adoption, not speculation Comparing XRP’s Surge and Remittix’s Rise XRP is carving a path toward $4, pushing past key resistance and riding on institutional momentum and partnership news. Remittix, dubbed “XRP 2.0,” is not just whispering, it is building. Remittix is blending utility, community rewards, and real product rollout in a way that sets it apart. XRP may be closer to mainstream adoption and proven infrastructure, but Remittix is sprinting ahead in terms of early-stage opportunity. For those tracking XRP price prediction, keep one eye on Ripple’s charts. For those seeking high growth from low entry, Remittix offers something very different.

Analyst Projects $20+ In October 2025,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrps-biggest-rally-yet-analyst-projects-20-in-october-2025/,"XRP is trading close to $3 and has struggled to hold that level in recent sessions. According to a market analyst, a repeat of a past pattern tied to Bitcoin halvings could push XRP much higher, with a possible cycle top above $20 on Oct. 17, 2025. The timeline ties back to earlier halving cycles and a short lag that, she argues, has repeated before. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Odds, Jumps 21% Even As ETF Debut Gets Pushed Back Halving Dates And Follow-On Moves Based on reports, crypto expert Diana points to the 2016–2017 cycle as the clearest example. Bitcoin halved on July 9, 2016, and then reached a peak above $19,000 on Dec. 18, 2017 — 525 days later. XRP, she notes, followed with its high of $3.31 on Jan. 5, 2018, around 18 days after Bitcoin’s top. That sequence — Bitcoin first, XRP soon after — is central to her case. 🚨 XRP TO $15–$20? HISTORY SAYS OCT 2025 IS THE DATE ⏳🔥 History, math, and the end of SEC suppression all point to one window: mid-October 2025. This could be XRP’s most savage run yet — let’s break it down. 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/RJ6Z85b6pz — Diana (@InvestWithD) September 4, 2025 Losing Steam, Legal Pressure The pattern did not hold in the next cycle. Bitcoin halved on May 11, 2020, and then topped near $69,000 on Nov. 10, 2021, about 545 days later. XRP did not mirror that run. Reports show XRP hit $1.95 in April 2021, several months earlier than Bitcoin’s peak, after legal pressure and exchange delistings constrained its move. Diana describes that episode as a lost cycle for the token. Regulatory Clarity And Product Growth According to reports, the legal cloud around XRP eased after a July 2023 court outcome that cleared major parts of XRP’s past sales from being labeled as securities. Exchanges in the US resumed listings, and Ripple has been building out products like RLUSD and new payment corridors. Diana says those developments, together with multiple ETF filings, improve XRP’s chances this time. She puts forward three price scenarios: a modest run to $5–$7 if Bitcoin’s momentum is modest; a base case of $10–$15 assuming ETF inflows and stronger use cases; and a blow-off rally that could push XRP past $20 if big institutional liquidity arrives. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out With A 32% Surge: Time To Buy Or Too Late To Chase? XRP Forecasts Split: $12.25 Target Vs. Modest Growth Outlook Meanwhile, Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered expects XRP’s rally to continue, saying the token could take on a larger role in international finance. He also points to future XRP ETFs as a catalyst that could draw more investors. Kendrick places his price target at $12.25 by 2029, which would mean a 300%+ jump from today’s $2.95 and translate into annualized returns of about 43%. That outlook, however, is far from universal. Morningstar analysts forecast the broader crypto market to grow close to 10% per year through 2034, a rate in line with historical stock market performance.

According to on-chain data, the exchange’s cold wallets now hold only a fraction of the XRP they once did, and the decline is now more than 90%. This comes at a time when the XRP community has been closely monitoring institutional activity, with growing rumors of BlackRock and other heavyweight firms quietly building exposure to XRP. Coinbase’s XRP Holdings Crash By 90% Recent moves by Coinbase with its XRP holdings have taken most crypto investors by surprise. Previous data showed that Coinbase, which was once the fifth-largest holder of XRP, has trimmed its XRP reserve balance from approximately 780.13 million XRP to 199.47 million. This was a cutback of about 69% in its holdings since the second quarter of 2025. However, on-chain data tracked by the @XRPwallets account on the social media platform X shows that Coinbase hasn’t stepped back from slashing its XRP holdings. As recently revealed by @XRPwallets, Coinbase now has just six cold wallets holding about 16.5 million XRP each. This leaves the US-based exchange with an estimated 99 million XRP in total. By comparison, the exchange had 52 cold wallets as recently as June 9, with 10 wallets holding 26.8 million XRP each and another 42 wallets holding 16.8 million XRP each. Combined, that amounted to nearly 970 million XRP under Coinbase’s control. In other words, the most recent numbers mean that Coinbase has shed about 90% of its XRP reserves within the past three months. Such a strong reduction in the movement of XRP away from Coinbase has been linked to accumulation into institutional wallets in anticipation of the launch of a Spot XRP ETF in the US. It also corresponds with previous reports about BlackRock’s indirect involvement with XRP through Coinbase’s custodial services. What Does This Mean For XRP? The scale of outflows from Coinbase’s XRP reserves has taken many crypto investors by surprise, as seen by comments on social media platforms. For instance, XRPwallets hinted at the possibility of these huge movements being linked to BlackRock. An account on the social media platform X, known as Stern Drew , suggested that Coinbase’s sell-offs go with a deliberate strategy to suppress XRP’s price. This was met with a firm rejection by pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who was quick to push back on the manipulation claims. Although there has been no official confirmation, the most plausible explanation of these large XRP exits is mostly linked to the eventual launch of an XRP ETF. The odds of the SEC accepting an XRP ETF in 2025 are now at a 94% chance on Polymarket . Bloomberg analysts also place the odds at a 90% chance or higher. Large institutions could be accumulating XRP in anticipation of such a product, and the reduced supply on exchanges could contribute to buying pressure even before it is launched. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3, down by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.",XRP|BlackRock|coinbase|Polymarket|Spot XRP ETF|Stern Drew|US SEC|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-16 00:00:46

AllInCrypto (@RealAllinCrypto), a well-respected analyst, recently highlighted this research in a video on X, connecting Ripple and BlackRock through one of the most senior figures in digital assets today. Mitchnick’s career includes a period at Ripple before joining BlackRock in February 2018. At the time of his move, he co-authored a research report analyzing digital assets and their potential valuations. The analyst stressed that this document is significant not only for Bitcoin but also for XRP. According to him, it provided numerical scenarios that many in the community have overlooked. BlackRock's Managing Director, Robert Mitchnick, researched future possible trajectories of $BTC and $XRP . A price target of $32.91 was given to XRP based on legitimate value propositions. pic.twitter.com/hgnbFLfv1N — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) September 14, 2025 High Price Targets for XRP AllInCrypto explained that Mitchnick’s report modeled potential success and failure cases for XRP, with the double-digit estimate for the asset’s future price. According to his explanation, the same report set a low estimate of $6.37, still well above XRP’s current trading level. The report then narrowed the forecast into what it called a fundamental value range. “The resulting fundamental value range of between $1.59 to $8.23” was reached after assigning a 25% probability to the success case, with the failure case assuming XRP would be worth nothing. He contrasted this with XRP’s trading range of $0.49 to $3.72 at the time of publication. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 BlackRock Connection Adds Weight AllInCrypto emphasized the importance of Mitchnick’s role today. He noted that the same individual who contributed to that report now holds one of the most senior digital asset positions in global finance. Mitchnick has been at BlackRock for a long time, and AllInCrypto stated that the continuity of his influence makes the earlier valuations more noteworthy. While BlackRock has not filed specifically for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , its presence in the digital asset space has grown considerably. The fact that the firm’s digital asset strategy is overseen by a former Ripple employee has created natural interest around XRP among investors and market commentators. The analyst placed Mitchnick’s XRP estimates alongside his earlier views on Bitcoin. At the time of publication, the report suggested that Bitcoin was undervalued, with its trading range compressed relative to projected long-term value. By linking these assessments, AllInCrypto argued that the high estimate of $32.91 should be taken seriously.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a crucial barometer for market sentiment, currently stands at 52. This score places it squarely in neutral territory, a slight dip from yesterday but a consistent signal of balanced investor emotions. But what does this mean for your crypto strategy, and why should you pay attention to this single number? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is designed to help investors gauge the overall sentiment dominating the cryptocurrency market. It’s a powerful tool that quantifies emotions, moving from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). When the market is in ""Extreme Fear,"" it often suggests potential buying opportunities, as investors are overly cautious. Conversely, ""Extreme Greed"" might signal an impending correction, as the market could be overheating. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated composite of several key market indicators. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final score, offering a comprehensive snapshot of investor psychology: Volatility (25%): Measures the current market’s price fluctuations and drawdown relative to average values. Higher volatility can indicate fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volume and market momentum, often showing increased activity during periods of greed or panic. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related keywords, gauging public interest and sentiment. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls, providing a direct insight into individual perspectives. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors might be shifting away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to cryptocurrencies, with higher search interest often correlating with speculative greed. What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Score of 52 Imply? A score of 52, as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently shows, signifies a balanced market. It’s neither overwhelmingly fearful nor excessively greedy. This neutral zone suggests that investors are not making rash decisions based on extreme emotions. Instead, there’s a mix of caution and optimism, leading to a more stable environment compared to periods of extreme sentiment. In a neutral market, prices might consolidate, moving sideways without significant upward or downward trends. This can be a time for reflection rather than reaction. It allows investors to assess fundamentals, look for long-term value, and avoid getting swept up in short-term emotional trading. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from the Index Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be incredibly beneficial for your trading and investment decisions. It acts as a counter-indicator for many seasoned traders. Here’s how you might interpret different zones: Extreme Fear (0-24): Often seen as a potential buying opportunity. When others are fearful, smart money might be accumulating. Fear (25-49): A cautious period. Investors might be hesitant, but strong projects could still offer good entry points. Neutral (50-59): This is where we are now. It suggests a time for careful analysis. Avoid impulsive moves. Consider dollar-cost averaging or rebalancing your portfolio. Greed (60-74): A period of increasing optimism. While prices may rise, it’s also a time to be cautious about overextension. Extreme Greed (75-100): Often a signal for potential market tops or corrections. Many investors consider taking profits or reducing exposure during these times. However, it’s crucial to remember that the index is just one tool. It should always be used in conjunction with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a clear understanding of your own risk tolerance. Why the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Matters for Your Strategy This index provides a unique perspective on market psychology, which is a powerful driver of crypto prices. By understanding whether the collective sentiment leans towards fear or greed, you can potentially make more informed decisions. It helps you avoid emotional pitfalls, such as selling during a panic or buying into an unsustainable pump. For long-term investors, a neutral score might mean continuing to build positions steadily. For short-term traders, it might indicate a period of lower volatility, requiring different strategies. The index empowers you to think critically about market conditions rather than simply reacting to price movements. Conclusion: A Balanced Perspective in a Volatile Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently at 52, signals a moment of equilibrium in the often-turbulent crypto market. This neutral stance offers a valuable opportunity for investors to step back, assess their strategies, and make rational choices free from extreme emotional pressure. While not a standalone predictor, this index is an indispensable guide for understanding the underlying sentiment that shapes cryptocurrency valuations. Use it wisely to navigate the digital asset landscape with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index?

Recently, a significant indicator for many investors, the Altcoin Season Index , registered a notable drop. This key metric, provided by CoinMarketCap, now stands at 71, a decrease of two points from yesterday. But what exactly does this number signify for your crypto holdings and the broader market outlook? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index : What Does 71 Really Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool designed to help investors gauge the prevailing sentiment in the crypto market. It’s not just a random number; it’s calculated based on a very specific methodology: It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Crucially, stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from this analysis to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The comparison is made against Bitcoin’s performance over the last 90 days. An official “altcoin season” is declared when a remarkable 75% of these top altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day window. Conversely, if Bitcoin is outperforming the majority, it’s considered a “Bitcoin season.” A reading closer to 100 indicates a strong altcoin season, while a lower number points towards Bitcoin’s dominance. Why Did the Altcoin Season Index Dip to 71? The recent two-point fall in the Altcoin Season Index to 71 suggests a subtle yet important shift in market momentum. While 71 is still above the threshold typically associated with a full Bitcoin season (often considered below 50), it indicates that fewer altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin compared to very recently. This slight decrease could be attributed to several factors: Bitcoin’s Resurgence: Often, when Bitcoin experiences a strong price rally, it tends to pull capital from altcoins, as investors prioritize the perceived safety and liquidity of the leading cryptocurrency. Profit-Taking: After periods of altcoin strength, some investors may be taking profits, rotating back into Bitcoin or stablecoins. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news or global events can also influence investor sentiment, leading to a flight to quality, which often means Bitcoin. This dip serves as a reminder that market conditions are fluid and require constant monitoring. It’s not necessarily a sign of impending doom for altcoins, but rather an indication of a rebalancing act. Navigating the Current Crypto Climate: Strategies with the Altcoin Season Index For savvy investors, the Altcoin Season Index offers crucial insights, but it’s important not to view it as a standalone predictor. Instead, consider it as one piece of a larger puzzle. Here are some actionable insights: Diversification is Key: Even during a Bitcoin-dominant phase, some altcoins can still perform well due to specific project developments or niche market demand. Maintaining a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks. Monitor Trends: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index regularly. A sustained drop might suggest a prolonged period of Bitcoin strength, while a reversal could signal new opportunities in altcoins. Fundamental Analysis: Don’t solely rely on market indices. Always research the fundamentals of any altcoin you consider investing in, including its technology, team, use case, and community support. Risk Management: Understand that altcoins generally carry higher risk and volatility than Bitcoin. Adjust your position sizes and stop-loss orders accordingly. The crypto market is cyclical, and periods of altcoin outperformance will undoubtedly return. The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index simply tells us where we stand today. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us About Tomorrow? While the Altcoin Season Index dipping to 71 might seem like a setback for altcoin enthusiasts, it’s a natural part of the crypto market’s ebb and flow. It underscores Bitcoin’s foundational role and its tendency to lead market movements. For investors, this moment presents an opportunity to re-evaluate portfolios, conduct thorough research, and prepare for future market shifts. Whether we’re heading towards a stronger Bitcoin season or merely pausing before another altcoin rally, staying informed with tools like the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for making strategic decisions in this exciting financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric provided by CoinMarketCap that measures the performance of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the last 90 days. It helps indicate whether altcoins or Bitcoin are currently dominating the market. How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? It’s calculated by determining if 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins (by market cap, excluding stablecoins/wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin in the past 90 days. A higher index score indicates a stronger altcoin season, while a lower score suggests Bitcoin dominance. What does an Altcoin Season Index of 71 mean? An index of 71 means that while a significant number of altcoins are still outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days, the momentum has slightly decreased. It’s not a full altcoin season (which would be 75 or higher), nor is it a strong Bitcoin season (typically below 50), but rather a more balanced or transitioning period. Is it an Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season right now? With the Altcoin Season Index at 71, it’s closer to an altcoin season, but the recent dip indicates that Bitcoin has gained some relative strength. It suggests a mixed market where some altcoins are still performing well, but Bitcoin is also asserting its presence. How can I use the Altcoin Season Index in my trading? Use the Altcoin Season Index as an indicator of overall market sentiment. A rising index might encourage more altcoin exposure, while a falling index could prompt a more cautious approach or a focus on Bitcoin. Always combine this with fundamental analysis and robust risk management strategies. If you found this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

The shortfall is highlighted in a new report from the City of London Corporation, the local authority that presides over the country’s financial district. The report quotes a 15 billion-pound annual funding gap for the small- and medium-sized enterprises seeking to grow. It also shows a similar infrastructure investment gap from housing, energy, and transport projects to digital networks. Chris Hayward, policy chairman for the City, warned that the cost of inaction would be great: doing nothing would lead to lost opportunities, decreased productivity, and slower economic growth. The warning comes as the UK economy grapples to break out of stagnation. While markets worldwide struggle and tax increases are anticipated within the autumn budget, the government is pressured to create new money. City pushes for pension reform and more defined infrastructure plans The City calls for reform of pensions and a greater effort to direct savings into UK assets to plug the gap. It cites examples from Canada and Australia, where domestic pension funds are significant investors in infrastructure at home. The UK government has already taken steps to implement some of these recommendations. In the Mansion House Accord, 17 of the biggest pension funds in the country promised to allocate as much as 10% of their portfolios to private markets by 2030. At least half of that will likely be invested in UK assets, which could unlock a further £50 billion of fresh capital. But the City says that’s not good enough, as it would like the government to lay out a more transparent pipeline of projects, so investors know what’s coming. Transparency is necessary, it adds, to generate confidence and attract long-term private capital. Just last month, BlackRock announced it had poured $700m into UK data centres – so clearly there’s still plenty of appetite among international investors to back them if the terms are sweet enough. The new Labour government, little more than a year in office, is making strenuous efforts to increase investment. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government had wanted to steer capital into British infrastructure, green energy, and growth industries. A reshuffle has brought fresh faces to the forefront of this push. The minister for investment, who used to be Poppy Gustafsson, is businessman Jason Stockwood. Meanwhile, Lucy Rigby became city minister instead of Emma Reynolds, who was made environment secretary. The government is also establishing a new investment hub to match global funds with projects in the UK. Officials say the goal is to make Britain an easier and more appealing investment place. Pension capital sparks challenges and debates These are all advances, but there are still huge hurdles. UK pension funds have been on the decline for domestic stocks for decades. Today, pensions are invested in British stocks to only 4% in those portfolios, compared with about 50% during the 1990s. Many trustees prefer investing offshore, where they can make better returns for less risk. This trend has sparked debate. Reformers claim that switching pensions back into the UK would fuel growth and finance badly-needed infrastructure. Critics have said it could place savers at risk, or amount to trustees breaching their legal duty to act in members’ best interests. Some executives have even sounded the alarm. The chief executive of Aviva has also recently cautioned against “coercing” pension schemes to invest in Britain, arguing that it was not always the best way to maximize returns.

51793761,581294,1757984409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51793761.jpeg,Solana Price Prediction: September Outlook Brightens as Galaxy Digital Fuels Another Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-price-prediction-september-outlook-brightens-as-galaxy-digital-fuels-another-rally/,"Solana (SOL) continues to command market attention after Galaxy Digital purchased $300 million worth of SOL in 13 transactions across Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit. The digital assets investment firm has now acquired over 6.5 million SOL in the past five days, worth approximately $1.57 billion, according to on-chain data. These purchases come as part of a broader Solana-focused strategy. Galaxy, alongside Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital, recently led a $1.65 billion private placement for Forward Industries. The move places Forward Industries as a key institutional actor in the ecosystem, with Galaxy moving large batches of SOL into custody wallets on Fireblocks, signaling long-term holding intent. Novogratz: “Season of Solana” Begins Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has described the current market phase as the “season of Solana.” He emphasized that faster and cheaper blockchains like Solana are now primed for Wall Street adoption, especially as U.S. regulators hint at modernizing crypto rules. SEC Chair Paul Atkins recently noted that most crypto tokens may fall outside securities law, a stance Novogratz called a “radical departure” from past approaches. He believes this clarity will accelerate institutional adoption, especially for networks like Solana, which offer high throughput and sub-cent transaction costs without relying on Layer 2 scaling solutions. Analysts Eye $300 as Next Solana Target With SOL trading around $233.15, the token has climbed 12% in the past week and over 23% in the past month. Analysts suggest that a breakout above $253 could pave the way toward $272–$300, levels last seen in late 2023. Matt Hougan , CIO at Bitwise, noted that spot Solana ETFs awaiting SEC approval could unleash further inflows by October. He compared the momentum to Bitcoin’s treasury-driven rallies, saying Solana’s unique blend of speed, scalability, and institutional interest could amplify its price trajectory. For now, Solana sits just 16% below its all-time high, with bullish technical indicators supporting the case for another leg upward. If Galaxy’s buying spree continues and regulatory clarity arrives, September could introduce another Solana rally.

XRP Whales Have Sold 160 Million Tokens Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the latest move from the XRP whales. The analyst has cited Santiment’s Supply Distribution indicator, which measures the total amount of the asset’s supply that a given wallet group as a whole is holding right now. Whales are defined as addresses carrying between 1 million and 10 million tokens of the cryptocurrency. At the current exchange rate, the range converts to about $2.99 million at the lower end and $29.9 million at the upper end. Thus, only the market participants with a substantial amount of capital fall in this range. Related Reading: Analyst Sets Bold $1,314 Target For Solana After Cup-And-Handle Breakout These large investors can carry some degree of influence in the market, so their movements can be worth keeping an eye on. One way to do so is through the Supply Distribution. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of the 1 million to 10 million XRP group over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP whales took their supply to a high earlier in the month, but since then, these holders have participated in selling. Interestingly, most of this distribution came as the asset’s rally to the $3.1 level took place. This timing would imply that the whales were using the price surge as an opportunity to take profits and exit from the market. In total, these humongous entities have offloaded 160 million tokens of the cryptocurrency over the last couple of weeks, worth a whopping $486 million right now. The coin has declined since its high, and if selling from the whales continues, it’s possible that the drawdown may extend. From a technical perspective, however, XRP may actually be near a rebound, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges As Whales Scoop Up 181,000 LTC The reason is that the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has just given a reversal signal for the asset. The TD Sequential is an indicator that counts up candles of the same color in an asset’s price chart to identify points of trend exhaustion. Once nine candles are in, it signals that the earlier trend is over and a reversal may be about to occur. From the above chart, it’s visible that XRP has formed a TD Sequential signal with nine red candles on its 4-hour chart, suggesting a bullish turnaround could potentially take place next. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $3.02, down almost 1% over the last 24 hours.

The company has turned to its most powerful weapon to revive that dream: Jack Ma. After vanishing from public view towards the end of 2020 during an antitrust crackdown, China’s most famous entrepreneur is back in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s campus in Hangzhou more frequently than he did during the past five years, people familiar with the matter say. His influence is increasingly evident, including in the company’s renewed pursuit of artificial intelligence and its bloody price war against e-commerce competitor JD.com Inc. and Meituan. One insider said that Ma supported the company’s plan to spend as much as 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) on subsidies in response to JD.com Inc. heading into the market in a surprise challenge. Now run by longtime aides Joe Tsai and Eddie Wu, Alibaba has declined to confirm Ma’s official capacity — but several insiders say the 61-year-old founder is once again deeply involved. He insists on being kept informed about the company’s progress in AI— at one point, pestering a senior manager three times in one day to get an update. Alibaba bets big on AI and price wars Ma’s reappearance is widely seen as a symbol of Beijing’s cooling toward its once freewheeling tech titans . A handshake with President Xi Jinping earlier this year sealed his comeback, though Ma is now less assertive than in the days of Davos panels. Internally, his presence has jolted the staff’s morale, rekindling the entrepreneurial attitude of his company’s founding. Yet such a comeback carries risks. Beijing disapproves of the “vicious subsidies” behind Alibaba’s ongoing price war, and there is also a more pressing risk. Beijing frowns on the “malicious subsidies” fueling Alibaba’s latest price war, and Ma risks attracting fresh scrutiny. His 2020 speech blasting Chinese banks as “pawn shops” triggered regulators to halt Ant Group’s record IPO, unleashing a trillion-dollar crackdown that slashed Alibaba’s value by nearly $700 billion. Beijing watches as Ma rekindles influence For employees, seeing Ma is emotional after years of retreat in Tokyo and Hong Kong. Some longtime employees cried when he addressed them at Ant Group last December. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the affiliate company of the Chinese conglomerate Alibaba Group revealed in March that it has developed new techniques for training artificial intelligence models. Ant Group utilized Chinese-made semiconductors from Alibaba and Huawei. On a campus tour this April, he lauded Alibaba’s cloud, chips, and AI models, telling staff, “Technology isn’t just about conquering the stars and the oceans, it’s about preserving the spark in all of us.” Alibaba, which was once worth more than $800 billion, is still clawing its way back from those lost years. With Wu driving AI, Tsai anchoring the board, and up-and-coming star Jiang Fan reshaping e-commerce, Ma has surrounded himself with a loyal cadre of lieutenants. At the same time, the company has promised to spend more than 380 billion yuan on AI and cloud infrastructure, leading to a sharp recovery in cloud revenue and an 88 percent jump in its stock this year — though still well off its highs. Although Ma eschews formal titles, his moral authority is significant. “He’s not a day-to-day micromanager,” said Duncan Clark, author of Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built. “But his word — or displeasure — can turn the company around.” For employees, the sight of Ma once again donning an Alibaba badge is his silent but influential comeback. He once told state media, “Retirement does not mean I’ve left Alibaba. If Alibaba calls me, I’ll always be there.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|Alibaba,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-16 01:01:23

The U.S. Senate has confirmed Stephen Miran as a governor of the Federal Reserve, a development first reported by the crypto market insights platform Unfolded. This crucial appointment, approved by a narrow 48-47 vote, marks a pivotal moment for economic policy and could have ripple effects across various sectors, including the dynamic crypto market. Understanding the implications of the Stephen Miran Federal Reserve confirmation is essential for anyone tracking financial trends. Who is Stephen Miran and Why Does His Federal Reserve Appointment Matter? Stephen Miran’s confirmation to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is a significant event. As a known ally of former President Trump, his presence on the board could influence the direction of monetary policy for years to come. The confirmation process itself was closely watched, reflecting the political divisions within the Senate. The tight 48-47 vote underscores the importance and often contentious nature of such high-level financial appointments. Miran joins a board responsible for steering the U.S. economy. His background and political leanings are now part of the Fed’s diverse perspectives. This appointment fills a critical vacancy, bringing the board closer to full capacity. Decoding the Federal Reserve’s Influence and New Leadership Dynamics The Federal Reserve, often simply called ‘the Fed,’ serves as the central bank of the United States. Its primary roles include managing monetary policy, maintaining financial stability, and supervising banks. When a new governor like Stephen Miran Federal Reserve joins, it introduces a fresh voice and perspective to these critical discussions. The collective views of the Board of Governors shape decisions on interest rates, inflation targets, and other economic tools that affect everything from employment to investment. Moreover, the balance of the board can shift with each new member. This dynamic is particularly important during periods of economic uncertainty or rapid change, such as the current landscape influenced by global events and technological advancements. How Might Stephen Miran’s Stance Impact the Crypto Market? The crypto market, while often seen as distinct from traditional finance, is undeniably influenced by macroeconomic policies set by institutions like the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s decisions on interest rates, for instance, can impact investor sentiment towards riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. While Stephen Miran’s specific views on cryptocurrency may not be widely publicized, his general economic philosophy will contribute to the overall stance of the Federal Reserve. For example, if the Fed adopts a more hawkish (anti-inflation) or dovish (pro-growth) approach, these shifts can directly affect crypto valuations. Consider these potential impacts: Interest Rates: Higher rates can make traditional investments more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from crypto. Regulatory Environment: The Fed, alongside other agencies, contributes to the broader regulatory conversation around digital assets. Economic Stability: A stable economic outlook, partly managed by the Fed, generally fosters a more favorable environment for all investments, including crypto. Navigating Future Economic Shifts: What Should Investors Watch For? With the confirmation of Stephen Miran Federal Reserve , market participants should pay close attention to future statements and actions from the Fed. His contributions will be part of the larger policy narrative. Investors should monitor the following key indicators: Fed Meeting Minutes: These provide insights into discussions and potential future policy directions. Inflation Reports: The Fed’s primary focus often revolves around managing inflation. Employment Data: Another key mandate of the central bank. Miran’s Public Comments: Any statements he makes could offer clues about his specific policy leanings. Understanding these signals can help investors anticipate market movements and adjust their strategies accordingly, especially within the volatile crypto space. The confirmation of Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve is more than just a political appointment; it’s a strategic move that could reshape economic policy and indirectly influence the burgeoning crypto market. As the Fed continues to navigate complex economic challenges, the new perspectives brought by governors like Miran will be crucial. Keeping an eye on these developments will be key for investors and enthusiasts alike to understand the evolving financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Federal Reserve Board of Governors? The Federal Reserve Board of Governors is the governing body of the Federal Reserve System, responsible for overseeing the 12 Federal Reserve Banks and setting national monetary policy. It consists of seven members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. 2. How does a Federal Reserve appointment impact the economy? Each new governor brings their economic philosophy and expertise to the board, influencing decisions on interest rates, money supply, and financial regulation. These decisions directly affect inflation, employment, and the overall stability of the U.S. economy. 3. What does Stephen Miran’s background as a ‘Trump ally’ imply? While the Fed is designed to be independent, a ‘Trump ally’ designation suggests Miran might hold more conservative economic views, potentially favoring deregulation or specific approaches to monetary policy that align with past administrations. However, governors operate within the Fed’s mandate. 4. Why is the crypto market mentioned in relation to the Stephen Miran Federal Reserve appointment? The crypto market, despite its decentralized nature, is not immune to macroeconomic forces. Federal Reserve policies, such as interest rate hikes or quantitative tightening, influence overall market liquidity and investor appetite for risk, which in turn affects cryptocurrency valuations and investor behavior. 5. What should I do as a crypto investor following this news? Crypto investors should remain informed about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions and any public statements from its governors. These insights can help in understanding broader market trends and making more informed investment decisions, rather than reacting solely to crypto-specific news.

One look at names like Peanut the Squirrel or Turbo shows how wild and witty this space really is. These tokens mix humor, hype, and surprising performance, creating a playground where fortunes rise and fall faster than a bull charging a red cape. With Peanut the Squirrel holding steady despite market dips and Turbo stirring up noise, it’s clear meme culture isn’t slowing down. The buzz about MoonBull Whitelist being live right now is electric. Crypto students, degens, and even analysts know early entry is everything. Being whitelisted means front-row seats before the crowd stampede. This isn’t just another presale; it’s a ticket to Stage One with benefits that make FOMO feel real. Let’s break down MoonBull , Peanut the Squirrel, and Turbo to see why all three belong on the list of meme coins to watch in 2025. MoonBull Whitelist: Your Golden Ticket to Stage One MoonBull ($MOBU) is an Ethereum-based meme coin crafted for traders who thrive on adrenaline and upside. Designed for degens and meme coin fans chasing serious gains, it fuses meme energy with secure smart contracts. Unlike countless pump-and-dump plays, MoonBull delivers structure: staking rewards, secret token drops, and exclusive perks locked behind whitelist access. The whitelist is more than a sign-up form – it’s a VIP pass to join before the public even knows the door is open. Whitelist members get the lowest price, bonus token allocations, and private hints about the roadmap. Everything happens on a first-come, first-served basis, making this a chance that could vanish in seconds. For crypto communities in places like São Paulo, Mexico City, and Los Angeles, where meme culture blends with trading hustle, missing this chance could feel like letting a peanut slip through your fingers. The hype doesn’t stop at discounts. Whitelist members are the only ones who’ll hear whispers of upcoming updates before launch. Stage One isn’t closed to outsiders, but only whitelisted users know the exact launch date in advance. In markets where timing is everything, that edge is priceless. Picture a bull run starting, and only a handful of insiders knowing when the gate opens. That’s MoonBull’s promise. How to Secure a Spot in the MoonBull Whitelist Getting whitelisted is simple yet strategic. Submit your email through the secure whitelist form, and wait for a private notification with the launch details. Those who sign up early stand at the front of the herd. Spots are limited, so hesitation means missing out. Think of it as a rodeo – only those who grab the reins first get to ride the bull. MoonBull’s first stage is engineered for urgency. Investors who’ve watched past moonshots slip away now have a shot at redemption. Whitelist access ensures not just early entry but exclusive perks unavailable anywhere else. For anyone chasing the next 1000x, this isn’t just another listing – it’s a lifeline. Peanut the Squirrel: Nutty by Name, Serious by Numbers Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) may sound quirky, but its numbers prove it’s no joke. The live price sits at $0.2442 with a market cap of about $236 million. Ranked #308, it shows real staying power compared to other meme coins. Traders often underestimate coins like this until they realize the market has already priced in long-term potential. Daily trading volume is swinging hard. In the past 24 hours, PNUT saw $75 million in activity, marking a sharp 40% drop from the day before. While that signals cooling interest in the short term, it also suggests the coin is stabilizing after heavy moves. Like squirrels stashing nuts for winter, smart traders may see this dip as a buying opportunity. The fully diluted valuation also stands at $236 million, aligned with its market cap, suggesting supply dynamics are transparent. This kind of clarity reassures cautious investors. For crypto communities, where volatility is expected but transparency is prized, Peanut the Squirrel has carved out its niche. Turbo: Speeding Ahead or Running Out of Fuel? Turbo (TURBO) takes its name seriously, aiming for fast growth and meme-level attention. Its live price is $0.004169 with a market cap of around $277 million, placing it higher than Peanut the Squirrel in overall rankings. The all-time high was $0.01432, but current prices are nearly 72% lower, showing how volatile Turbo’s engine can be. Turbo’s fully diluted valuation mirrors its market cap, just over $277 million. With 69 billion tokens in circulation, investors must weigh the risks of dilution against the upside of meme-driven demand. This isn’t a coin for those faint of heart. As they say in Montevideo, this coin can buck like a bull or collapse like a hippo in a mud pit – fast, messy, and without warning. Despite recent underperformance, Turbo’s branding power and liquidity mean it’s far from out of the race. Meme investors love high-risk, high-reward plays, and Turbo keeps delivering the kind of rollercoaster action they crave. For anyone betting on meme coin culture in 2025, Turbo deserves a seat at the table. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, MoonBull stands out as the new meme coin to watch in 2025. With its whitelist live, it hands early supporters a rare chance to secure the lowest entry price, unlock bonus allocations, and gain access to secret staking rewards before the public rush begins. That first-come, first-served model fuels genuine FOMO, especially for traders who know timing is everything in this market. At the same time, Peanut the Squirrel shows grit by holding steady in a competitive market, while Turbo brings high liquidity and nonstop action for traders who thrive on volatility. Each coin caters to a different appetite – stability, speed, or explosive potential – but MoonBull ’s whitelist advantage tips the scales. For those who sat on the sidelines during past moonshots, this lineup feels like déjà vu with a second chance. Missing it could mean watching the herd ride off into the sunset while you’re left standing at the gate.

Presale participants see quoted APYs up to 722%, although rewards taper as adoption scales. The fixed supply of 10 billion tokens adds scarcity. This mix has placed Layer Brett high on lists of the best meme coins to buy. Furthermore, its roadmap includes NFT features, gamified staking, and bridges to other chains. While memes fuel culture, utility ensures staying power. That dual approach could give it an edge over tokens like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. Bitcoin News and Market Resilience Recent Bitcoin news shows the asset trading between $118,000 and $120,000. Analysts point to strong institutional demand, even after a whale unloaded billions in BTC. Despite selling pressure, Bitcoin’s realized cap crossed $1 trillion, a milestone that reflects long-term holder confidence. Market watchers say dips are being treated as buying opportunities. But they also caution that resistance near $125,000 could hold in the short term. This backdrop makes investors curious about alternatives, especially the best meme coins to buy. XRP Price Prediction and Ripple Momentum While Bitcoin news grabs headlines, another theme is the XRP price prediction circulating among analysts. XRP recently showed reduced selling pressure from whales, down by more than 90%. At the same time, institutions accumulated roughly $500 million worth of XRP. This accumulation has many suggesting XRP could stage a breakout. A popular XRP price prediction points to a potential 15% rally if resistance breaks. Combined with Ripple’s ongoing legal clarity and adoption by banks, the sentiment has shifted. Investors are weighing whether XRP could run alongside newer plays like Layer Brett. Why Layer Brett is the best meme coin to buy Dogecoin remains the original meme coin, while Shiba Inu built Shibarium to add utility. Yet both face challenges: slower speeds, higher fees, and diminishing staking rewards. Layer Brett enters differently. It has meme appeal but also positions itself as a Layer 2 solution with practical use cases. That’s why more commentators include it in discussions of the best meme coins to buy in 2025. Yet, the best approach to a healthy portfolio may be diversification: keep exposure to Bitcoin, consider XRP based on its price prediction, and allocate a portion to promising newcomers like Layer Brett. That way, investors ride both established giants and speculative growth. Conclusion The latest Bitcoin news highlights resilience, while an XRP price prediction suggests a rally could be near. Yet the spotlight is also on newer opportunities. Among the best meme coins to buy, Layer Brett stands out with its presale success, low price entry, and Layer 2 efficiency. Crypto thrives on cycles of trust, hype, and innovation. Bitcoin anchors the market. XRP builds bridges in finance. Layer Brett brings memes with purpose. For investors searching beyond headlines, this may be the moment to blend tradition with disruption.

51795000,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=178063,1757986223,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/51795000.jpeg,Cardano vs. Dogecoin: Which Will Outperform in 2026?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cardano-vs-dogecoin-which-will-outperform-in-2026/,"Cardano and Dogecoin couldn’t be more different, yet both remain central to discussions about which altcoins could dominate future cycles. Cardano, with its reputation for careful development and academic rigor, represents the world of utility-driven blockchains. Dogecoin, born as a meme, thrives on culture, community, and unexpected staying power. As the crypto market prepares for the next big rotation, investors are asking: which of these coins is better positioned for 2026? Some analysts point to Cardano’s ecosystem upgrades, while others highlight Dogecoin’s enduring appeal in meme-driven markets. Yet beneath this debate, a third option is emerging, one that combines meme culture with audits from biggest companies in the sector: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cardano: Utility and Patience Cardano (ADA) has always marched to its own rhythm. While Ethereum and Solana pushed forward aggressively with new features, Cardano’s approach has been methodical. Built on peer-reviewed research, its roadmap has unfolded carefully, sometimes frustrating investors seeking quick returns. Yet this patience has also been Cardano’s strength. In 2026, Cardano’s prospects revolve around Voltaire , its governance era that promises full decentralization of decision-making. Through treasury mechanisms, community voting, and on-chain governance, Cardano aims to become a truly self-sustaining ecosystem. Analysts argue that this level of decentralization could make Cardano more resilient long-term, even if it doesn’t produce the kind of explosive short-term gains meme coins generate. With institutional interest in blockchain governance growing, ADA may carve out a niche as the blockchain for long-term utility and credible adoption. But the challenge remains: will slow and steady be enough in a market addicted to hype? Dogecoin: The Meme That Won’t Die Dogecoin (DOGE) is living proof that memes can outlast expectations. Born as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin leveraged humor, simplicity, and an enthusiastic community to outlive many so-called “serious” projects. Even without smart contracts or DeFi, it continues to hold a top market cap position, a testament to culture’s power in crypto. Its staying power is reinforced by endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk, who frequently reignites Dogecoin’s visibility. Every cycle, DOGE seems to defy skeptics, producing spectacular rallies. For 2026, analysts suggest its success will depend largely on whether it can maintain cultural dominance against a new wave of meme tokens. Dogecoin’s strength lies in familiarity: it’s the meme coin everyone knows. But that same familiarity may also limit upside. With so many new meme projects promising higher multiples, DOGE may remain a cultural staple but struggle to deliver the kind of returns it once did. Security Meets High Reward Then there’s MAGACOIN FINANCE, the rising presale that is turning heads for combining meme appeal with structural legitimacy. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few presales to pass both CertiK and HashEx audits, earning recognition as a project that puts security first. Investors say this is the kind of foundation missing in most meme coins. At the same time, its market cycle analysis shows 13,500% ROI potential , putting MAGACOIN FINANCE in a class of its own for this bull run. Unlike typical presales that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN has built its story on scarcity and credibility. Every funding round has sold out faster than the last, with both whales and retail investors competing for allocations. It’s this rare combination, meme-driven branding plus structural trust, that makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out. While Cardano offers patient utility and Dogecoin offers cultural nostalgia, MAGACOIN FINANCE is pitching itself as the bridge: hype that lasts because it is built on secure foundations. How They Compare Looking ahead to 2026, Cardano анд Dogecoin each represent a different kind of opportunity: Dual audits complete: CertiK and HashEx validation give MAGACOIN FINANCE a credibility edge over most meme projects. Cardano: A long-term governance play with slow but steady growth potential. It could appeal to institutions and patient investors who value decentralization and utility. Dogecoin: The cultural stalwart of meme coins. While its upside may be capped compared to newer projects, it will likely continue to thrive on visibility and community loyalty. For investors, the choice comes down to strategy. Do you prioritize steady, utility-driven progress? Do you stick with a cultural icon? Or do you chase the presale that could multiply many times over? Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out 13,500% ROI potential: Market cycle forecasts put it among the highest-upside plays of 2025–2026. Scarcity model: Presale rounds sell out rapidly, proving demand far outpaces supply. Cultural traction: Meme branding ensures mass appeal, while credibility anchors investor confidence. This is why analysts call MAGACOIN FINANCE a “dual-threat token” , capable of attracting meme traders chasing multiples while reassuring cautious investors who want real safeguards in place. Conclusion The debate between Cardano and Dogecoin reflects the larger divide in crypto: utility versus culture. Cardano’s governance and utility upgrades could cement it as a serious blockchain contender in 2026. Dogecoin’s community and cultural cachet mean it will likely never disappear, even if it delivers smaller multiples than before. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the script. With dual audits, 13,500% ROI projections , and a presale defined by scarcity and momentum, it combines the best of both worlds. It has the hype and cultural resonance of meme coins, paired with the structural trust usually found in utility projects. For many, that makes MAGACOIN FINANCE the most intriguing option heading into 2026, an altcoin capable of delivering the kind of life-changing returns neither Cardano’s slow build nor Dogecoin’s nostalgia may achieve again.

The SEC accused the cryptocurrency platform of failing to register a cryptocurrency asset lending program before offering it to retail investors. According to reports, the settlement resolves the agency’s lawsuit over the Gemini Earn program. The settlement still needs to be approved by SEC In a letter filed on Monday in a Manhattan federal court, lawyers representing both parties indicated the settlement would “completely resolve” the lawsuit but still subject to SEC approval. The lawyers reportedly asked the US District Judge Edgardo Ramos to give them up to December 15 to submit their final paperwork, and to put all deadlines on hold. The exact terms of the settlement remain confidential pending a final approval from commissioners. However, experts familiar with similar cases are projecting the penalty will be in the region of $10 million to $20 million, which is far less severe than initially feared. These are also significantly lower penalties than those that were imposed during the previous administration. The settlement was revealed four days after Gemini raised $425 million in an initial public offering , valuing the New York based firm at about $3.3 billion in its market debut. According to a Reuters report, Gemini shares closed up 52 cents at $32.52 on Monday, which was 16% above the $28 IPO price. Gemini Earn, which launched in 2021 allowed customers to lend bitcoin and other crypto assets to the cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital in exchange for interest payments, with Gemini Trust taking fees as high as 4.29%. Gemini paused withdrawals in November 2022, the same month that Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX cryptocurrency exchange collapsed before filing for bankruptcy two months later. The exchange held $900 million assets from about 340,000 Gemini Earn customers at the time. In January 2023, the SEC sued Gemini and Genesis on allegations that they bypassed disclosure requirements for Gemini Earn that were meant to protect investors. Genesis accepted a $21 million fine to settle without admitting any wrongdoing. The SEC – Gemini settlement signals regulator’s softer approach to crypto The SEC has stopped oversight of the cryptocurrency industry since Donald Trump became president in January and appointed crypto-friendly officials to lead the agency including the new chair, Paul Atkins, who has called for clearer guidelines rather than enforcement actions. So far, the SEC has created a Crypto Task Force designed to develop appropriate frameworks for digital assets and has halted several investigations into major industry players. The resolution of the Gemini Trust case is not unique as it follows a similar pattern to other crypto settlements recently reached. These include cases against Ripple Labs, which was finalized with a leaner penalty as well as more favorable terms for the cryptocurrency firm. Industry experts view these developments as a sign that the US is becoming more receptive to cryptocurrency innovation while still maintaining consumer protections. According to Namecoin News , this also to be a shift from viewing most digital assets as securities that require strict registration to recognizing that different types of cryptocurrencies may need different regulatory treatments. And for an average crypto user, this settlement also means that established firms like Gemini can continue operating with greater regulatory certainty.

BTC Holds the Line at $115K,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/16/asia-morning-briefing-fragility-or-back-on-track-btc-holds-the-line-at-usd115k,"Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin (BTC) traded just above $115k in Asia Tuesday morning, slipping slightly after a strong start to the week. The modest pullback followed a run of inflows into U.S. spot ETFs and lingering optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut rates next week. The moves left traders divided: is this recovery built on fragile foundations, or is crypto firmly back on track after last week’s CPI-driven jitters? That debate is playing out across research desks. Glassnode’s weekly pulse emphasizes fragility . While ETF inflows surged nearly 200% last week and futures open interest jumped, the underlying spot market looks weak. Buying conviction remains shallow, Glassnode writes, funding rates have softened, and profit-taking is on the rise with more than 92% of supply in profit. Options traders have also scaled back downside hedges, pushing volatility spreads lower, which Glassnode warns leaves the market exposed if risk returns. The core message: ETFs and futures are supporting the rally, but without stronger spot flows, BTC remains vulnerable. QCP takes the other side. The Singapore-based desk says crypto is “back on track” after CPI confirmed tariff-led inflation without major surprises. They highlight five consecutive days of sizeable BTC ETF inflows, ETH’s biggest inflow in two weeks, and strength in XRP and SOL even after ETF delays. Traders, they argue, are interpreting regulatory postponements as inevitability rather than rejection. With the Altcoin Season Index at a 90-day high, QCP sees BTC consolidation above $115k as the launchpad for rotation into higher-beta assets. The divide underscores how Bitcoin’s current range near $115k–$116k is a battleground. Glassnode calls it fragile optimism; QCP calls it momentum. Which side is right may depend on whether ETF inflows keep offsetting profit-taking in the weeks ahead. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin is consolidating near the $115,000 level as traders square positions ahead of expected U.S. Fed policy moves; institutional demand via spot Bitcoin ETFs is supporting upside ETH: ETH is trading near $4500 in a key resistance band; gains are being helped by renewed institutional demand, tightening supply (exchange outflows), and positive technical setups. Gold: Gold continues to hold near record highs, underpinned by expectations of Fed interest rate cuts, inflation risk, and investor demand for safe havens; gains tempered somewhat by profit‑taking and a firmer U.S. dollar Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 topped 45,000 for the first time Monday, leading Asia-Pacific gains as upbeat U.S.-China trade talks and a TikTok divestment framework lifted sentiment. S&P 500: The S&P 500 rose 0.5% to close above 6,600 for the first time on Monday as upbeat U.S.-China trade talks and anticipation of a Fed meeting lifted stocks.

This exciting development marks a new era for investors seeking access to innovative Yunfeng Financial crypto services . What’s Driving Yunfeng Financial’s Crypto Ambition? Yunfeng Financial recently announced a substantial capital injection, raising an impressive HKD 1.17 billion, equivalent to $150 million, through a strategic new share issuance.

The S-1 form indicates the initial registration statement required by the regulatory body for new securities offerings. The filing marks Bitwise’s latest effort to expand its crypto ETF offerings beyond existing products. Coinbase will be the acting custodian of these products if the commission approves this proposal. Bitwise submits a proposal for its Avalanche ETF to the SEC In Bitwise’s S-1 filing dated September 15, the crypto-asset manager mentioned that the Trust allows investors to access the Avalanche market via a regular brokerage account. According to the firm, this enables them to avoid problems and risks associated with purchasing and holding Avalanche directly. Apart from that, the company argued that they believed the Trust’s design could assist certain investors in effectively implementing their strategic and tactical asset allocation strategies with Avalanche. Bitwise highlighted that this can be achieved by investing in Shares instead of purchasing, holding, and trading Avalanche. The SEC filing disclosed that the fund will determine its net asset value (NAV) depending on the CME CF Avalanche–Dollar Reference Rate, adding that it will retain AVAX tokens directly and will not apply any derivatives. In the meantime, it is worth noting that to obtain the NAV of an ETF, one needs to calculate the total value of its assets minus any liabilities, then divide it by the number of available shares, which will indicate the value per share of the fund. Bitwise’s proposal triggers other crypto asset managers to apply for a spot AVAX ETF Bitwise was initially founded in 2017. Since then, it has positioned itself as a leading international crypto-asset manager offering several crypto investment alternatives, such as crypto index funds and ETFs that track Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other asset management services. The crypto-asset manager has also achieved other significant milestones this year. To illustrate, it recently developed an Avalanche trust in Delaware, initiating a first step towards releasing the product. Concerning Bitwise’s proposal for its Avalanche ETF, it has triggered a trend among other crypto asset manager rivals to apply for a spot AVAX ETF. To support this claim, reports from sources have revealed that Grayscale, an asset manager and investment platform, has requested to change its Avalanche Trust into a spot AVAX ETF. Moreover, VanEck, an asset management company, is considering launching an AVAX fund. To further expand its operations, the Avalanche Foundation made public its intention to raise around $1 billion purposefully to develop two AVAX treasury firms in the US last week. The foundation stated that these companies will purchase tokens from them at a reduced price. It is worth noting that digital asset treasuries, similar to ETFs, provide investors with an alternative method of participating in the crypto markets via regular brokerage accounts. Meanwhile, Bitwise has submitted applications requesting to list several single-asset ETFs, including those that can track Chainlink and XRP’s performance. According to data from CoinMarketCap , AVAX is currently trading at $29.54, indicating a 0.25% decrease in the last 24 hours. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The Ethereum Price Prediction for September points to a battle between bulls and bears, as ETH trades in a tight range near $4,300. While investors remain hopeful for another breakout, many are starting to look beyond Ethereum for more substantial upside. One project catching that attention is Remittix (RTX) , the PayFi altcoin tipped to shake up global payments. Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Levels in Focus The Ethereum price is within the $4,250–$4,500 range. If the Ethereum price drops below $4,250, it might retest the $3,745 levels. However, if buyers go beyond $4,500, the next target is $4,957. ETH is forming bullish higher lows on the daily chart, but resistance is still strong. Traders are eyeing the $4,493 zone as the level that could set off the next rally. Despite cautious sentiment, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong. Nasdaq-listed Bitmine Immersion Technologies just purchased 446,255 ETH worth $201 million, becoming the largest corporate holder of Ethereum. That kind of buying shows institutions still see ETH as a long-term bet. Even so, many retail holders are beginning to hedge with newer tokens that promise higher returns. Remittix: The PayFi Altcoin Gaining Momentum Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming one of 2025’s standout projects. It’s addressing a genuine issue, slow and costly cross-border payments, instead of creating hype. Remittix can reduce the high fees associated with traditional money transfers and transaction times from days to hours by utilizing blockchain efficiency. Investors are drawn to the project for more than just utility. Here’s why Remittix is standing out: $250,000 Remittix Giveaway pulling in early adopters Support expanding beyond Ethereum to Solana, Avalanche, and Polygon The Remittix (RTX) Wallet enters beta testing on September 15, 2025, with instant crypto-to-fiat conversion First and second exchange listing already confirmed on BitMart and LBank Why Ethereum Holders Are Backing Remittix While ETH remains a cornerstone of crypto, its size limits explosive growth. That’s why many Ethereum holders are rotating part of their portfolios into Remittix, seeing it as a high-upside play in the PayFi sector. With staking rewards, audited transparency, and a deflationary model that reduces supply weekly, Remittix is gaining traction fast. The Ethereum Price Prediction for the months ahead points to steady gains, but analysts argue Remittix could deliver 20x or even 30x returns in the same window. For investors chasing the next big breakout, it’s quickly becoming the PayFi altcoin to watch.

The revised duty structure, enacted through an executive order signed by President Trump on September 4, directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection to collect the reduced 15% rate on passenger cars, light trucks, and auto parts from Japan. The change took effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on September 16, applying to goods entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouses afterward. According to officials, tariffs overpaid on qualifying imports since August 7 will also be refunded. The administration described the tariff cut as part of its broader strategy to rebalance trade relationships and encourage investment within the U.S. However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick cautioned that Japan could face renewed tariff hikes if it fails to meet its investment commitments in America. A few weeks ago, Ryosei Akazawa, the head of Japan’s trade negotiating team, indicated he was leading his cavalry back to Washington to push for swift action on the auto tariff cut. As reported by Cryptopolitan , Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi had also called for quicker issuance of Trump’s executive order to reduce auto tariffs. Tokyo accepts tariff cut with investment pledge After branding the measure as vital to its economic health, Japan had been urging the United States for months to deliver on a pledge to lower tariffs on shipments of automobiles . Japan’s economy is based on the car industry, contributing much of its gross domestic product, exports, and jobs. Passenger cars and parts are the single category that Japan ships to America, so tariff levels are crucial for corporate profits, wages for employees, and the broader industrial competitiveness of a nation. The announcement came after Tokyo promised to support efforts to help anchor the deal with a $550 billion fund focusing on migrating capital into American infrastructure, energy, and technology. American officials have touted the pledge to assist local industries and jobs. But there is still a residue of uncertainty. Washington presented the fund as a direct sponsorship of Trump’s economic agenda; Tokyo, in broader strokes, has called it an investment vehicle following corporate decisions. The absence of interpretation has led to speculation on whether the fund will be translated and politicized over those funds that eventually materialise in the months ahead. And beyond its headline numbers, it also contained the outlines of shared trade opportunities. Japan is committed to improving market access for United States agricultural products such as beef, pork, and dairy. It also vowed to clamp down on approvals of United States-made vehicles. It also telegraphed that both governments would work together in new tech areas like semiconductors, clean energy, and digital infrastructure, seen as strategic to future growth and global competition. Automakers respond to tariff cut Japanese automakers welcomed the news as an answer to their prayers, arguing that it would fuel less uncertainty around supply chains and pricing if duties were to come down. “It’s a good step forward for long-term planning and competitive operations,” one senior Toyota executive said. US auto policy groups were less enthusiastic. The authors noted that Japanese car companies would have a price advantage. Meanwhile, their American competitors were burdened with the higher prices they paid for steel, aluminum, and other supplies. Some lawmakers on Capitol Hill have also pushed back, warning that the agreement could jeopardize American workers as domestic manufacturers continue to lose market share. The deal, economists said, could help spur a rebound in car sales in the United States by lowering retail prices for some of America’s most popular Japanese models. The clause is also retroactive, so importers paying above the correct tariff rate for the last three months, since August, are entitled to refunds aimed at bringing fresh liquidity into the processor sector.

The firm filed a $500 million shelf registration to issue common stock while also stating that part of the capital will be channeled into the accumulation of Bitcoin. Common stock going for an aggregate initial offering price Next Technology disclosed in its SEC filing that it is establishing a shelf registration for up to $500 million in common stock, paving the way for one or more offerings in the months ahead. The announcement triggered an initial sell-off in NXTT shares, which fell almost 3% in post-market trading on Monday, according to Seeking Alpha. While the filing gives management discretion over the use of proceeds, Next Technology has indicated in past disclosures and commentary that Bitcoin acquisition remains a core corporate strategy. Next Technology’s Bitcoin strategy comes into focus Within a short span, Next Technology has managed to establish itself as one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin relative to its size. The firm reported holding roughly 5,833 BTC, including 5,000 acquired in recent months. The alignment with Bitcoin has boosted NXTT’s profile among crypto-focused investors but also raised its risk profile. Bitcoin-linked equities tend to trade with high volatility, mirroring the digital currency’s price swings. NXTT’s strategy is not so different from the moves made by Semler Scientific , which earlier this year filed a $500 million shelf registration to fund Bitcoin purchases and general corporate purposes. The trend is growing and for Next Technology, the potential to allocate part of the new proceeds toward additional BTC accumulation represents both a bet on long-term digital asset adoption and a branding exercise that aligns the company with the cryptocurrency narrative. Investor reaction and market context The longer-term impact lies in execution, and this includes how much stock is ultimately sold, at what prices, and how the capital is deployed. If a portion of proceeds is used for Bitcoin purchases, NXTT could further concentrate its balance sheet exposure to a single, volatile asset. Investors remain divided on the merits of such a strategy. Advocates argue that Bitcoin’s supply cap and growing institutional adoption justify corporate treasuries allocating capital to it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. NXTT has already tested investor tolerance for dilution. The company also recently announced a $9 million registered direct offering of stock and warrants. That sale was relatively modest compared to the new $500 million ceiling but illustrates management’s willingness to raise funds quickly. Despite the bullish narrative, risks abound. The SEC filing gives management a wide window in how to deploy proceeds, and there is no guarantee that significant sums will ultimately be directed toward BTC purchases. Shareholders face potential dilution from future issuances, while the company’s fortunes may become increasingly tethered to the volatility of digital asset markets.

That flow has pushed Solana into a fresh bout of attention from investors who watch big-wallet moves. Galaxy Digital Buying Spree According to reports, Galaxy Digital has been one of the most active buyers, taking on more than $1 billion in SOL in recent days. Transfers out of exchange addresses and into private wallets were flagged by researchers. Reports have disclosed that this type of accumulation often removes supply from the market, at least temporarily, and can leave prices more sensitive to new demand. Galaxy Digital bought $1.35 Billion in $SOL this week. That’s 5.82 million $SOL accumulated in just 7 days, the largest institutional Solana purchases this year. But they didn’t buy the cycle top.

That zone matters because it was a barrier that, once cleared, turned into a floor for buyers to defend. Short squeezes were also observed, where traders betting against SOL were pushed to close positions. Volume spiked on some of the upward moves, which made runs sharper, and that can speed up both gains and corrections. 🚀 Galaxy Digital just bought $240.58 million in $SOL in 5 hours.

Some analysts put nearer-term targets at $250 or $300 if buying continues and technicals hold. More optimistic scenarios, often framed as longer-term or best-case outcomes, extend the outlook to $350–$450. A claim that SOL could reach $460 has circulated in some corners, but clear public backing for that exact figure appears limited in mainstream outlets. $SOL Solana is showing three major levels of interest before a strong pullback is likely. The most probable targets to watch are ~$260, ~$380, and ~$460 before a major correction sets in. The RRR ratio for longs remains poor, unless additional risk is taken on through leverage. pic.twitter.com/vuQQO3tF4V — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) September 14, 2025 What $460 Would Require For SOL to climb toward $460, a chain of events probably needs to align. Large and sustained institutional inflows would help, and the creation or expansion of SOL treasuries could remove more tokens from circulation. Regulatory clarity or the launch of regulated products that let big pools buy SOL safely would widen the buyer base. Finally, stronger real-world use on the Solana chain — more transactions, apps, and revenue — would add a fundamental argument for much higher valuations. Time also matters; even strong bull cases often play out over many months.

If macro conditions tighten, or if network problems reappear, any rally can be cut short. Overbought readings on some indicators suggest a pullback is possible before further gains. Watch exchange flows, whether large wallets keep withdrawing SOL, and whether the $220–$230 band holds. Those signals should tell traders a lot about the likely next leg.

He expects demand to pick up in Q4 as portfolio managers set positions ahead of 2025. Some managers will make small moves; others could shift larger slices of their holdings into BTC, Visser said. Institutional Survey Signals Strong Bitcoin Interest According to a joint Coinbase and EY-Parthenon survey , a large share of institutional investors plan to add crypto exposure in 2025. The survey found 83% of respondents intend to increase allocations, and 59% expect to put more than 5% of assets under management into crypto or related products. Those figures suggest that many firms are preparing for wider crypto use in portfolios. Intentions Do Not Always Equal Action Plans by money managers can change. Regulation, market swings, and macro shocks can slow or halt buys. Still, when lots of institutions say they will act, it raises the odds that real flows will follow. That said, timing and size of the moves remain uncertain. ETF Flows Feeding Demand Spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled heavy inflows this year, giving institutions an easier on-ramp into the market. Recent daily net inflows reached about $642 million on one trading day, and cumulative ETF net inflows since launch are roughly $57 billion, lifting total ETF assets to about $153 billion. Those flows can provide a steady source of demand for BTC if they continue. How ETFs Change The Game ETFs give big funds a familiar product to buy. That reduces some barriers to entry. If allocations rise in Q4 as Visser suggests, ETF channels are where much of that buying could show up first. Corporate Holdings Add Another Layer Public and private firms are already holding Bitcoin on their books. Data trackers show public companies’ treasury BTC holdings are valued at roughly $112 billion across many firms. Big buyers like the Michael Saylor-led Strategy continue to add to their piles, and corporate buys make headlines when they happen. Such corporate demand can add to overall market appetite for BTC. The Period To Watch Based on reports and the surveys, late Q4 will be the period to watch. If institutions move as planned, Bitcoin could see meaningful support. But investors should expect bumps, as it’s the nature of crypto: policy shifts, rates, or a sudden liquidity squeeze could cut short flows. In short, the signs point toward more allocation from TradFi, yet execution will depend on several moving parts.

An individual recently received an 18-month prison sentence for cleverly concealing approximately 45 stolen Bitcoin (BTC) through sophisticated crypto mixing and currency exchange services, as reported by Digital Asset. This case is particularly noteworthy because the defendant had siphoned off these funds after illicitly obtaining a mnemonic code—a vital security key for a crypto wallet. The ruling itself carries immense weight, as it formally acknowledges the act of crypto mixing as a direct method of concealing criminal proceeds, setting a powerful precedent. What is Crypto Mixing and Why is it Used? Crypto mixing , often referred to as a ‘Bitcoin mixer’ or ‘tumbler,’ is a service designed to obscure the trail of cryptocurrency transactions. It works by pooling together various users’ coins and then redistributing them to their intended recipients from this mixed pool. This process makes it incredibly difficult to trace the original source of the funds. Privacy Concerns: For some, crypto mixing offers enhanced privacy, allowing individuals to transact without revealing their entire financial history on public ledgers. Illicit Activities: Unfortunately, a significant portion of mixers are utilized by criminals to launder stolen funds, evade sanctions, or finance illegal operations. The South Korean case clearly falls into the latter category, demonstrating how illicit actors leverage these tools to hide their tracks after committing theft. The South Korean Verdict: A Landmark in Crypto Crime The recent sentencing by the South Korean court marks a pivotal moment in the fight against digital asset-related crimes. The defendant’s use of crypto mixing services was not seen as a legitimate privacy measure but rather as a deliberate attempt to hide stolen assets. This distinction is vital for future legal battles. The court’s decision to hand down an 18-month prison term sends a clear message: attempting to obfuscate the origins of stolen cryptocurrency through mixers will not be tolerated. This formal recognition of crypto mixing as a concealment method provides a stronger legal framework for prosecuting similar cases worldwide. Moreover, the theft of the mnemonic code highlights a critical vulnerability. Mnemonic codes are essentially master keys to crypto wallets, and their compromise can lead to complete loss of funds. This case serves as a stark reminder of the importance of robust security practices. Navigating the Legal Landscape of Crypto Mixing The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding crypto mixing is rapidly evolving. Jurisdictions globally are grappling with how to effectively regulate these services to prevent their misuse without stifling legitimate privacy-enhancing technologies. This South Korean ruling provides a significant precedent. Global Scrutiny: Financial intelligence units and law enforcement agencies worldwide are increasing their focus on identifying and prosecuting individuals who use mixers for illicit purposes. Regulatory Challenges: Regulators face the challenge of distinguishing between legitimate privacy tools and those primarily designed for money laundering. Increased Enforcement: We can expect to see more coordinated international efforts to track funds moved through mixers and bring perpetrators to justice. This case underscores that legal systems are becoming more sophisticated in understanding and prosecuting complex cryptocurrency crimes, even those involving advanced concealment techniques. Protecting Your Digital Assets: Actionable Insights In light of such incidents, safeguarding your digital assets is more critical than ever. Here are some actionable steps to protect yourself and your investments: Secure Your Mnemonic Codes: Always store your mnemonic code offline in a secure, private location. Never share it with anyone or store it digitally where it could be compromised. Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, consider using a hardware wallet, which provides an extra layer of security against online threats. Practice Due Diligence: Be cautious of unsolicited links, phishing attempts, or services promising unrealistic returns. Always verify the legitimacy of any platform or individual you interact with. Understand the Risks: While crypto mixing can offer privacy, its association with illicit activities means that engaging with such services carries significant legal and reputational risks. Staying informed and vigilant is your best defense in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. The South Korean court’s decision marks a pivotal moment, signaling a growing legal understanding and intolerance for the use of crypto mixing in criminal enterprises. This ruling reinforces the importance of robust security practices for digital assets and highlights the increasing scrutiny on tools that can facilitate illicit activities. As the crypto landscape matures, legal precedents like this will continue to shape how digital assets are regulated and how crimes involving them are prosecuted. It’s a clear message: transparency and accountability are paramount, even in the decentralized world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is crypto mixing? Crypto mixing is a service that blends various cryptocurrency transactions together, making it difficult to trace the origin and destination of specific funds on a public blockchain. It’s used for both privacy and illicit activities. 2. Is crypto mixing illegal? While the act of crypto mixing itself isn’t universally illegal, using it to conceal stolen funds, launder money, or evade sanctions is highly illegal and subject to severe penalties, as demonstrated by the South Korean court case. 3. How did the South Korean court rule on this case? A South Korean court sentenced an individual to 18 months in prison for stealing 45 BTC and then using crypto mixing services to conceal these criminal proceeds. The ruling formally recognized mixing as a method of concealment. 4. What are the risks of using crypto mixers? The primary risks include legal repercussions if used for illicit purposes, the potential for your funds to be stolen by the mixer service itself, and being associated with criminal activity, which can lead to reputational damage or account closures. 5. How can I protect my crypto assets from theft? To protect your crypto assets, always secure your mnemonic codes offline, use hardware wallets for significant holdings, enable two-factor authentication, and be extremely cautious of phishing attempts or suspicious links.

On September 15, these investment vehicles collectively drew in an impressive $258.92 million, signaling robust and sustained investor interest in Bitcoin. This consistent positive flow underscores a growing confidence in digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, as a legitimate investment class. Why Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attracting Such Massive Inflows? This impressive streak of positive inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs isn’t just a fleeting moment; it reflects a deeper shift in how investors view and access Bitcoin. The ability to invest in Bitcoin through a regulated, traditional financial product like an ETF removes many barriers for institutional and retail investors alike. It offers a familiar structure, ease of trading, and often, enhanced security compared to direct cryptocurrency purchases. Accessibility: ETFs make Bitcoin accessible to a broader range of investors who might be hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges directly. Institutional Trust: The involvement of major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity lends significant credibility to the Bitcoin market. Market Maturation: Consistent inflows suggest a maturing market where Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a long-term asset rather than just a speculative play. Understanding the Dynamics: Who’s Leading the Spot Bitcoin ETFs Race? While the overall picture for Spot Bitcoin ETFs is overwhelmingly positive, a closer look reveals key players driving these significant inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT, for instance, continues to dominate the scene. On September 15, IBIT alone accounted for a staggering $260 million in inflows, highlighting its strong market position and investor preference. Fidelity’s FBTC also demonstrated solid performance, bringing in $7.54 million. Even Grayscale’s Mini BTC, a newer offering, saw positive movement with $6.13 million. These figures showcase a diverse interest across different fund providers, though some clearly hold a larger share of the market. However, it wasn’t entirely a one-way street. Bitwise’s BIBT experienced a net outflow of $18.81 million. This minor counter-trend reminds us that even within a booming sector, individual fund performances can vary, and investor preferences can shift based on various factors. What Does This Streak Mean for the Future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Crypto? The continuous positive flows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just daily statistics; they are a powerful indicator of evolving market sentiment. This sustained interest suggests a growing institutional embrace of Bitcoin, which could have profound implications for its price stability and broader adoption. As more traditional investors gain exposure to Bitcoin through these ETFs, it could lead to increased liquidity and reduced volatility in the long run. Moreover, this trend might encourage other financial institutions to launch their own Spot Bitcoin ETFs or similar crypto-backed products, further legitimizing the asset class. It also signals a potential shift from speculative trading to long-term investment strategies, treating Bitcoin as a valuable component of a diversified portfolio. Actionable Insight: Investors keen on gaining exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset should consider the various Spot Bitcoin ETFs available, evaluating their fees, liquidity, and underlying assets. Diversification remains key. In conclusion, the six consecutive days of net inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a significant moment for the cryptocurrency market. This sustained positive momentum, led by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, underscores increasing institutional confidence and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin. As these investment vehicles continue to attract capital, they are likely to play a pivotal role in shaping the future trajectory of digital asset adoption and market maturation. The future looks bright for Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Frequently Asked Questions About Spot Bitcoin ETFs What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. This means its value is derived directly from the current market price of Bitcoin, offering investors exposure to the asset without needing to buy and store Bitcoin themselves. Why are Spot Bitcoin ETFs important for the crypto market? They provide a regulated and accessible way for traditional investors, including institutions, to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This can increase market liquidity, legitimacy, and potentially reduce volatility, driving broader adoption of Bitcoin. Which funds are seeing the most inflows? Currently, BlackRock’s IBIT is consistently leading in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC. These funds have attracted significant capital due to their established presence and investor trust. Do all Spot Bitcoin ETFs experience positive inflows? While the overall trend has been positive, individual funds can experience outflows on certain days, as seen with Bitwise’s BIBT. Investor sentiment and fund-specific factors can influence these movements. How do Spot Bitcoin ETFs differ from Bitcoin futures ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs hold actual Bitcoin, directly reflecting its price. Bitcoin futures ETFs, on the other hand, hold futures contracts that bet on Bitcoin’s future price, which can lead to different performance characteristics and tracking errors.

Among the leaders in this niche is Remittix (RTX) , a worldwide payment project which has gradually gained increasing credibility before its launch of the beta wallet in September. Bitcoin & XRP Latest Market Figures Bitcoin remains in the news, trading at $115,451.01, falling 0.45% in the last day. Even with the marginal retreat, its market cap of $2.29 trillion confirms its position as the foundation of the crypto space. Daily volume is $31.87 billion, down 29.32% from yesterday’s high, a reminder that even when Bitcoin is targeting the $125,000 threshold, short-term corrections are still part of its trajectory. XRP, meanwhile, is at $3.02, down 4.12% in the last 24 hours. Its $179.71 billion market cap and 25.88% decline in trading to $4.93 billion still leave it holding a healthy position among top payment-biased tokens. Its more measured pace compared to the flashier new presale tokens shows, however, how slowly the market attention is shifting towards new money such as Remittix. Presale Growth, Token Sales, and CEX Listings Remittix (RTX) is priced at $0.1080 for every token and already crossed more than $25.6 million, selling more than 662 million tokens in its presale. Such milestones earned it its first officially sanctioned centralized exchange (CEX) listing announcement on BitMart when it hit the $20 million milestone, followed by the second listing on LBank when it crossed $22 million. Such listings are important for early-stage crypto investment projects because they provide access and liquidity. As opposed to speculative releases, Remittix is positioning itself with adoption pathways similar to how mainstreamed XRP in its early years, yet with more explicit focus on crypto-to-bank transfers. 24 Hours Left: Remittix Wallet Beta Testing The launch of Remittix Wallet Beta on September 15 is one of RTX’s important upcoming milestones. Supporting over 40 cryptocurrencies and over 30 fiat currencies, the wallet is useful for remitters, freelancers, and enterprises. With real-time FX conversion and no gas fees, you can send crypto directly into bank accounts of over 30 countries. How Remittix Is Building Market Steam: $25.6 million + presale capital raised to date 662 million + tokens allocated to early adopters First two CEX listings: BitMart & LBank Beta Wallet release date: September 15 $250,000 community giveaway Utility Beyond Presale Hype What sets Remittix apart from most new altcoin to keep an eye on news is that it is a functional design. It targets the $19 trillion payments space with business APIs, crypto-to-bank settlements, and minimal gas fees. This makes RTX both a cross-chain DeFi venture and a crypto solving real-world problems, which is why it’s being compared to early XRP but with a broader fiat integration roadmap.

However, fresh data from Binance crypto exchange indicates that the Bitcoin Scarcity Index recently witnessed its first spike since June 2025. Bitcoin Scarcity Index Spikes, Will BTC Rally? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, the Bitcoin Scarcity Index witnessed its first spike yesterday since June 2025. The analyst referred to the latest exchange data from Binance to confirm the spike in Bitcoin Scarcity Index. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Shift Strategy: Accumulation Over Selling Signals Stronger Bull Cycle For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Scarcity Index measures how limited the available supply of Bitcoin is on exchanges relative to immediate buying demand. A spike in the index usually indicates strong accumulation by large investors or institutions, signaling potential price pressure to the upside. In their analysis, Arab Chain remarked that the latest spike in the Bitcoin Scarcity Index means that either a large amount of BTC was withdrawn from Binance, or the volume of sell orders fell significantly on the exchange. As a result, the available supply of BTC on Binance suddenly became scarce. Notably, such movements are usually associated with the entry of large investors – such as whales or sharks – who hold substantial quantities of BTC. Arab Chain added: The index jumps when immediate buying power exceeds available supply, as if buyers are racing to acquire Bitcoin on the market This type of spike is often linked to positive news or sudden capital inflows. The same pattern occurred last June and persisted for several days, after which Bitcoin climbed to around $124,000. BTC may confirm the beginning of a strong accumulation phase and the continuation of the uptrend if the Bitcoin Scarcity Index remains positive for several consecutive days. However, if the index rises rapidly – followed by an equally quick descent – it may suggest speculative activity or order liquidations. Such a phase is often followed by a period of calm or a price correction. In recent months, the Bitcoin Scarcity Index has reached new all-time highs (ATH). The chart below shows the metric reaching as high as +6, before quickly falling toward neutral and even negative territory. Is BTC Losing Momentum? Arab Chain concluded by saying that the contrast between BTC’s high price, and the index’s quick move back to or below zero suggest that some strong buying momentum has started to decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds $112,000 Support As Binance Whale Activity Cools Off – What’s Ahead? That said, some positive signs persist. For example, the flagship cryptocurrency recently broke above the mid-term holder breakeven, hinting that a fresh rally to the upside may be on the horizon. From a technical perspective, BTC recently flashed the Golden Cross, a rare bullish signal that has crypto pundits forecasting a potential price appreciation of 100%. At press time, BTC trades at $114,601, down 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

What sets the Fellowship PAC apart from previous political efforts, according to their statement, is its commitment to transparency and trust. The organization emphasizes that its mission is to foster a political environment that supports the broader crypto ecosystem rather than serving narrow interests. The new political action committee aims to build on the crypto regulatory framework being established under the Trump administration, which is viewed as a pathway for the US to become the world’s digital asset capital . Progress has already been made in the form of the passage of the GENIUS Act for dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, also known as stablecoins, being one of the most notorious successes for the cryptocurrency industry this year. Super PACs Gear Up For 2026 Midterms The Fellowship PAC’s objectives are clear: it seeks to support candidates dedicated to creating transparent and predictable regulations for digital assets. Additionally, the PAC aims to protect America’s edge in technology and entrepreneurship, ensuring that the innovation economy reflects American values of openness and fairness. A crucial focus will also be on preventing the migration of talent and entrepreneurs overseas by maintaining the US as the premier destination for innovation, supported by clear regulatory guidelines . The PAC’s press release also noted: Our differentiator is transparency and trust. This initiative is designed to align the interests of crypto entrepreneurs, policymakers, and the public, fostering accountability as we work to advance the ecosystem. This is just the beginning; we have more initiatives planned. The launch of the Fellowship PAC follows a year of notable activity among crypto-focused political action committees, which are gearing up to increase their influence in upcoming special elections across the country. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, super PACs like Fairshake, along with its affiliates Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress, have already invested approximately $136 million in supporting over 58 pro-crypto candidates during the 2024 election cycle. With over $100 million in resources ready for the 2026 midterms, Fairshake is positioned to make a significant impact, bolstered by contributions from major players in the digital asset space, including Coinbase, Andreessen Horowitz, and Ripple.

LSEG Has Launched Its Blockchain Infrastructure As announced in a press release on Monday, the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) has launched its blockchain infrastructure and facilitated its first transaction. The platform, called “Digital Markets Infrastructure” (DMI), was developed in collaboration with Microsoft and runs on the tech giant’s Azure cloud service. Related Reading: Record Bitcoin Difficulty Not Enough To Stop Miners: Hashrate Explodes To New ATH While blockchain is the same technology that powers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, LSEG’s platform isn’t about these digital currencies themselves. Rather, DMI is about applying the technology to traditional finance. Unlike many other projects that digitize only part of the process, LSEG is offering the full range of the blockchain experience, including issuance, tokenization, and settlement. “There are many processes in private markets today that can be improved,” said Head of DMI, Dr. Darko Hajdukovic. “At LSEG we are committed to significantly improving access to private markets, by streamlining workflows, enhancing distribution, and enabling liquidity.” MembersCap, an investment manager, has become the first to use LSEG’s DMI, raising capital for its MCM Fund 1. The fundraising has been facilitated with Archax, a digital securities exchange regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), acting as a nominee. According to the press release, institutional alternative asset manager EJF Capital has also been onboarded as an early adopter, with some of its funds expected to become available on the platform soon. Hjdukovic noted, The onboarding of our first clients and this first transaction are significant milestones, demonstrating the appetite for an end-to-end, interoperable, regulated financial markets DLT infrastructure. LSEG’s position as a convener of markets can bring significant scale to digital assets and effect real change. For now, DMI is only open to private funds, with LSEG planning for expansion into additional asset classes. The stock exchange said it will continue to collaborate with Microsoft to scale the blockchain platform. “Together, we’re reshaping the future of global finance to empower our customers to unlock new opportunities and drive meaningful change,” said Bill Borden, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft’s Worldwide Financial Services. Bitcoin Saw A Retrace During The Past Day Bitcoin recovered above $116,700 on Sunday, but the cryptocurrency has opened the week with a sharp pullback as it’s now back at $114,700. The chart below shows how the recent volatility in the coin’s price has looked. The rest of the digital asset sector has also slid down alongside Bitcoin, with some altcoins like Dogecoin even being down as much as 8%. The consequence of the bearish price action has been that a significant $352 million in long liquidations have piled up on the cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, according to data from CoinGlass .",Bitcoin News|blockchain|London Stock Exchange|London Stock Exchange Group|LSEG Blockchain|microsoft|tokenization,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|SPONSORED|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-16 03:00:46

ETH is now trading below $4,650 and might extend losses if it stays below $4,620. Ethereum is now correcting gains below the $4,650 zone. The price is trading below $4,620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it settles above $4,620 and $4,650. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $4,765 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price corrected gains and dipped below the $4,650 support. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $4,268 swing low to the $4,765 high. The bears were able to push the price below $4,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,600 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,620 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,650 level. A clear move above the $4,650 resistance might send the price toward the $4,720 resistance. An upside break above the $4,720 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,765 resistance zone or even $4,800 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,620 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,500 level. The first major support sits near the $4,460 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $4,268 swing low to the $4,765 high.

At the forefront of this significant market event is Ethereum (ETH), which alone accounted for a substantial portion of these liquidations. This sudden downturn primarily impacted long positions, leaving many traders feeling the pinch. Understanding these market movements, especially crypto liquidations , is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset space. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations, and Why Do They Happen? For those new to the world of crypto trading, a liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. Essentially, if a trader borrows funds to amplify their potential gains (a “leveraged” position) and the market moves against their prediction, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses once their margin falls below a certain threshold. This mechanism is a fundamental aspect of derivatives trading in the crypto market. These events are often triggered by sharp price movements, unexpected news, or broader market sentiment shifts. When a large number of positions are liquidated simultaneously, it can create a cascading effect, exacerbating price drops and leading to even more liquidations. This is precisely what we observed with the recent wave of crypto liquidations . ETH Dominates the Liquidation Landscape Over the past day, Ethereum (ETH) perpetual futures contracts saw the largest share of liquidations, totaling an astonishing $110 million. What’s particularly noteworthy is that 81.57% of these were long positions. This indicates that a significant majority of traders were betting on ETH’s price to rise, only to be caught off guard by a downward movement. But ETH wasn’t alone in this market turbulence. Bitcoin (BTC) also experienced substantial liquidations: BTC: $42.61 million liquidated, with 71.88% being long positions. SOL: $27.62 million liquidated, with a striking 88.63% from long positions. The high percentage of long liquidations across these major cryptocurrencies suggests a broad market correction or a sudden shift in investor sentiment, leading to significant losses for those anticipating upward price action. Understanding the Impact of Long Liquidations on the Crypto Market When long positions are liquidated, it means that traders who bought believing prices would increase are forced to sell their assets. This forced selling adds downward pressure to the market, potentially causing prices to fall further. This phenomenon can create a “liquidation cascade,” where one liquidation triggers another, amplifying market volatility. The sheer volume of these recent crypto liquidations , especially involving ETH, BTC, and SOL, serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading. It highlights the importance of risk management and understanding market dynamics, particularly in a rapidly evolving space like cryptocurrency. How Can Traders Navigate Volatility and Avoid Crypto Liquidations? While the allure of amplified gains through leverage is strong, the risks are equally substantial. Here are some actionable insights for traders to consider: Implement Robust Risk Management: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on leveraged positions. Never risk more capital than you can afford to lose. Avoid Excessive Leverage: While high leverage can boost profits, it also dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. Start with lower leverage ratios, especially if you are new to derivatives. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, technical analysis, and broader economic indicators that could influence crypto prices. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading investments across different assets can help mitigate risk during market downturns. Understand Market Cycles: Recognize that crypto markets are cyclical. Periods of rapid growth are often followed by corrections. These strategies can help protect your capital and navigate the often-turbulent waters of crypto liquidations . A Powerful Reminder of Market Risks The recent $180 million in crypto liquidations , spearheaded by ETH, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and risks in the cryptocurrency market, particularly when engaging in leveraged trading. The dominance of long liquidations across ETH, BTC, and SOL underscores a significant market correction that caught many optimistic traders off guard. For both seasoned and novice traders, this event reinforces the critical need for sound risk management, prudent leverage use, and continuous market education. By understanding the mechanics of liquidations and adopting cautious trading practices, participants can better protect their investments and navigate the unpredictable currents of the digital asset world. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Liquidations Here are some common questions about crypto liquidations: What is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because the market has moved against their bet, causing their margin to fall below a required threshold. This prevents further losses. Why did ETH lead the recent liquidations? ETH led the recent liquidations because a significant number of traders had open “long” positions (betting on price increases) with leverage. When ETH’s price moved downwards, these leveraged long positions were closed out by exchanges. What does it mean if long positions are liquidated? If long positions are liquidated, it means traders who expected prices to rise were forced to sell their assets. This indicates a market downturn or correction, as the collective expectation of price appreciation was met with a decline. How can I protect my crypto investments from liquidations? To protect against liquidations, it’s crucial to use robust risk management strategies like setting stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, staying informed about market trends, and diversifying your portfolio. Are crypto liquidations bad for the market? While liquidations can cause immediate price drops and increase volatility, they are a normal part of leveraged trading markets. They can help flush out excessive speculation, potentially leading to a healthier market rebalancing in the long run. Did you find this analysis of crypto liquidations helpful?

Martinez recently shared on X a crucial signal concerning the future of Bitcoin. He highlighted that the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio has dipped below 0.1%, a level traditionally interpreted as a strong indication of a Bitcoin short-term bottom . This signal suggests an opportune accumulation zone and a period where selling pressure tends to be weak. Understanding the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio: What Does it Tell Us? What exactly does the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio tell us? This metric is a powerful tool used by analysts to gauge the potential for selling pressure in the Bitcoin market. It essentially measures the risk associated with sellers. When this ratio falls below 0.1%, as Martinez pointed out, it’s not just a number; it’s a significant market signal. It often implies that long-term holders are less inclined to sell, and the overall market is experiencing reduced selling intensity. Consequently, this low ratio often precedes or coincides with an accumulation phase. During such times, savvy investors might view current prices as attractive entry points, anticipating future upward movement. The insight from Ali Martinez, therefore, provides a valuable perspective for anyone closely watching Bitcoin’s price action. Why a Bitcoin Short-Term Bottom Sparks Investor Interest? The concept of a Bitcoin short-term bottom is particularly exciting for investors. It signifies a potential turning point after a period of price declines or consolidation. For many, this represents a strategic window to acquire more Bitcoin at what could be a discounted price. Accumulation Opportunity: A short-term bottom often marks a period where the “smart money” begins to accumulate assets, expecting a rebound. Reduced Downside Risk: When selling pressure is weak, the immediate risk of further significant price drops can diminish, offering a more stable environment for purchases. Foundation for Growth: Establishing a bottom can provide a strong base from which Bitcoin’s price can build momentum for its next upward trend. However, it’s crucial to remember that while indicators provide guidance, the crypto market remains dynamic and unpredictable. Navigating the Potential Accumulation Zone: What’s Your Strategy? If the market is indeed entering an accumulation zone, what steps should investors consider? This period demands careful thought and a well-defined strategy. Understanding the implications of a Bitcoin short-term bottom is just the first step. Here are some actionable insights: Research Diligently: Always conduct your own research beyond any single indicator or analyst’s view. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider implementing a DCA strategy, buying smaller amounts of Bitcoin over time to average out your entry price. This mitigates the risk of trying to perfectly time the absolute bottom. Risk Management: Allocate only capital you can afford to lose. The crypto market is volatile, and even strong signals are not guarantees. Long-Term Vision: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment. A short-term bottom might be a great entry point for those with a multi-year horizon. The goal is to approach these signals with a balanced perspective, leveraging insights without succumbing to impulsive decisions. Historical Precedent: Does the Sell-Side Risk Ratio Hold Up for a Bitcoin Short-Term Bottom? Looking back at historical data, technical indicators like the Sell-Side Risk Ratio have often provided valuable insights into market cycles. When the ratio has previously fallen to such low levels, it has frequently coincided with periods of significant accumulation before subsequent price rallies. This historical context lends credibility to Martinez’s current observation about a potential Bitcoin short-term bottom . Nevertheless, every market cycle presents unique variables. While past performance can offer guidance, it never guarantees future results. External factors, global economic conditions, and regulatory news can all influence Bitcoin’s trajectory, regardless of internal metrics. Conclusion: Seizing the Moment with Informed Decisions The recent analysis by Ali Martinez, highlighting the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio falling below 0.1%, offers a compelling signal for a potential Bitcoin short-term bottom . This indicator points towards an accumulation zone and a period of reduced selling pressure, suggesting a potentially favorable environment for investors looking to enter or add to their Bitcoin holdings. While such signals are valuable, a prudent approach involves combining this insight with thorough personal research and a robust risk management strategy. The crypto market rewards those who are patient, well-informed, and strategic. This potential bottom could indeed be a significant moment for Bitcoin, paving the way for its next chapter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio? A1: The BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio is a metric that indicates the potential for selling pressure in the Bitcoin market. A low ratio, especially below 0.1%, suggests that long-term holders are less likely to sell, implying weaker overall selling pressure. Q2: What does a “Bitcoin short-term bottom” mean for investors? A2: A Bitcoin short-term bottom suggests that Bitcoin’s price has reached a temporary low point, often signaling an accumulation zone. For investors, this can represent an opportunity to buy Bitcoin at potentially favorable prices before a possible rebound. Q3: Is the Sell-Side Risk Ratio a guaranteed indicator of future price movements? A3: No, while the Sell-Side Risk Ratio has historically been a reliable indicator of potential accumulation phases and short-term bottoms, no single indicator guarantees future price movements. The crypto market is complex and influenced by many factors. Q4: What strategies should I consider during an accumulation zone? A4: During an accumulation zone, strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and thorough personal research are recommended. It’s also crucial to practice sound risk management and only invest capital you are prepared to lose. Q5: Who is Ali Martinez, and why is his analysis significant? A5: Ali Martinez is a well-known cryptocurrency trader and analyst. His insights are significant because he often utilizes various on-chain and technical indicators to provide informed perspectives on market trends, which many in the crypto community follow closely.

Bitcoin has experienced a significant pullback this September, as whale sell-offs and macro uncertainties test investor conviction. Recent data shows Bitcoin spot ETFs are attracting capital while Ethereum spot ETFs are seeing record outflows, an intriguing divergence amid volatile sentiment. Capital rotation, diminished liquidity, and fading dominance are eroding BTC’s grip on the crypto market, prompting investors, especially speculators, to seek the next breakout opportunity. If momentum follows narrative power, MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its PATRIOT50X bonus code , might become investors’ rallying point for catching the next wave. Bitcoin Under Pressure ETF Flows and Liquidity Trends Between September 2–5, Ethereum spot ETFs experienced unprecedented net outflows totaling $788 million , while Bitcoin ETFs recorded $246 million in net inflows , sustaining two consecutive weeks of positive BTC flows. This divergence underscores shifting institutional sentiment. While Ethereum appears to be losing momentum with big players, Bitcoin remains a safer allocation in the short term, particularly as inflation concerns keep investors glued to assets with a longer track record. Yet, despite inflows into ETFs, Bitcoin’s price has struggled to hold support. Traders point out that ETF buying has been offset by aggressive spot selling from whales. That dynamic has left order books thin and prone to sharp intraday swings, adding to retail anxiety and increasing the appeal of smaller, high-upside assets. Whale Selling & Technical Stress A massive sell-off by a long-term Bitcoin holder, about $2.59 billion worth , sparked a $310 million flash crash , pushing BTC below critical support and triggering cascading liquidations. On-chain data highlights a worrying pattern: long-term holders are distributing more coins than they accumulate, a reversal from the earlier part of the year when accumulation was steady. Technical indicators reinforce caution. A potential “death cross” looms as the 50-day moving average threatens to slip under the 200-day, while Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings have fallen below 50. Historically, these setups often precede short-term corrections. For investors accustomed to Bitcoin’s role as a “safe haven” in crypto, such signals are undermining confidence. Seasonal Volatility & Macro Risks September has long been a difficult month for Bitcoin. Since 2016, the asset has finished in the red more often than not during this period, a seasonal trend many traders are now respecting. Analysts at Cryptodnes.bg warned that market participants could be underestimating the risks of September volatility, particularly when combined with sticky inflation, weaker U.S. jobs data, and uncertainty around Federal Reserve cuts. The broader macro backdrop is hardly comforting. The Fed remains stuck between cooling inflation and a fragile labor market, and bond yields continue to reflect skepticism about the speed of future rate cuts. That mix has spilled into risk assets, making Bitcoin vulnerable to sharper swings as traders reduce leverage and protect margins. A Flight Toward Different Narratives Even as Bitcoin’s dominance shows cracks, investors are not abandoning crypto altogether. Instead, capital is fragmenting. Part of it is rotating into Ethereum’s tokenization-driven ecosystem, while another portion is chasing smaller altcoins and presales that promise exponential multiples. This dynamic has defined every major cycle: when Bitcoin pauses or retraces, high-beta assets become the main attraction. The speculative side of the market is thriving under these conditions. Traders are gravitating toward presale projects with scarcity mechanics, cultural branding, and bonus incentives. In many ways, presales are seen as a hedge against Bitcoin’s sluggishness, offering investors exposure to asymmetric risk with smaller initial commitments. Amid Bitcoin’s latest sell-off, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the cycle’s most talked-about hidden gems. The PATRIOT50X bonus code is fueling presale acceleration, rewarding participants with 50% more tokens at a time when confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory is shaken. Forecasts of 15,000% potential upside have quickly become the centerpiece of discussions in crypto communities, with some analysts calling it the “second chance setup” for those who regret missing Bitcoin’s $10 breakout. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is how it thrives in turbulence. Instead of relying on mining economics or ETF flows, its strength comes from scarcity-driven rounds, cultural resonance, and an engaged early-mover community. This positions it not only as a speculative bet but as a potential cultural symbol of the next bull run. Broader Market Environment Liquidity Shifts & Altcoin Season Signals With Bitcoin dominance slipping toward 57%, analysts are once again monitoring “altseason” indicators. Historically, a dip below 55% has preceded massive capital rotation into altcoins. Coinbase Institutional recently noted that liquidity conditions are improving, with tighter spreads and stronger depth across altcoin order books. If Bitcoin continues to stagnate, capital may chase higher multiples in emerging tokens. Institutional Reassessment Coinbase’s report also highlighted that September could mark the beginning of a broader altcoin shift. Analysts like Michael van de Poppe argue that Bitcoin’s current weakness may serve as a catalyst, as it has historically been the prelude to powerful alt rallies. That shift would open the door for speculative presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE to dominate narratives. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be Bitcoin’s Second-Chance Play 15,000% ROI whispers : Market chatter frames MAGACOIN FINANCE as the boldest speculative bet of 2025. Scarcity + bonus edge : Rapid presale sellouts and the PATRIOT50X code create urgency and amplify rewards for early movers. Cultural + credible fusion : Combines meme-driven appeal with legitimacy through completed audits, something few presales achieve. Momentum from all sides : Retail buzz aligns with whale positioning, ensuring liquidity and visibility at launch. Bitcoin contrast : As BTC wavers, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a narrative of redemption for those who missed Bitcoin’s earliest breakout. Conclusion Bitcoin’s September sell-off, driven by whale distribution, ETF divergences, and macro uncertainty, has reinforced its reputation for volatility. For some, this is a reminder of Bitcoin’s cyclical nature; for others, it’s a signal to look elsewhere for growth. Ethereum remains the backbone of tokenization and institutional adoption, but the speculative edge of crypto is where fortunes are often made. In that corner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a defining story, a presale blending scarcity, cultural branding, and auditable legitimacy, supercharged by the PATRIOT50X bonus code. For risk-on investors, it could represent the long-awaited “ second chance ” after missing Bitcoin’s historic rise.

Its venture capital arm, SC Ventures, is planning to launch an impressive crypto fund worth $250 million. This initiative, set for 2026, is attracting support from key investors in the Middle East, according to reports from The Block.

This figure is its biggest weekly tally since July. Meanwhile, short-Bitcoin products lost ground, with outflows trimming their assets under management to $86 million. Ethereum also benefited from the change in sentiment. After eight days of consistent withdrawals, it posted four straight days of inflows last week, which added up to $646 million. Altcoins Join the Party According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, following weaker US macroeconomic figures, digital asset products shifted back to inflows and collected $3.3 billion last week. The rally in prices toward week’s end supported the climb in assets under management, which hit $239 billion. This level stands just below the all-time high of $244 billion recorded in early August. In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, funds related to Solana also saw its largest-ever single-day inflow on Friday at $145 million, which contributed to a weekly total of $198 million. XRP and Sui also noted similar traction as they attracted $32.5 million and $14 million in inflows, respectively. Next up were Chainlink, Cardano, and Cronos, which registered $1.5 million, $1 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. On the other hand, multi-asset products witnessed $1.1 million outflows similar to the previous week. Aave and Avalanche-based funds also saw minor outflows of $1.08 million and $0.66 million during the same period, respectively. US Leads Crypto Surge With Record Inflows Across regions, investor sentiment remained largely optimistic. The United States dominated the week by bringing in $3.2 billion in inflows. Germany followed with $160 million, including its second-largest daily intake on record on Friday. Canada added $14.1 million, while Brazil and Hong Kong contributed $5.4 million each, and Australia registered $2.4 million. However, not all regions shared the bullish momentum. Despite the broader positive sentiment, Switzerland, for one, noted heavy outflows of over $92 million, as it offset some gains, while Sweden also posted $5.6 million in outflows.

This latest initiative, led by the head of France’s financial watchdog, Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, is part of a broader push to shift regulatory oversight to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), based in Paris. France Pushes For Centralized Crypto Oversight According to an exclusive coverage made by Reuters on Monday, the urgency of this move stems from concerns that under the EU’s new regulatory framework, known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, crypto companies are gravitating towards jurisdictions with more lenient licensing processes. Barbat-Layani emphasized that there are significant inconsistencies in how national regulators are applying the new rules, raising alarms about the potential for inadequate supervision of cross-border firms. In a coordinated effort, France has joined Italy and Austria in advocating for ESMA to assume supervisory responsibilities over major crypto firms. This was outlined in a position paper shared with Reuters, highlighting a collective concern about the regulatory landscape. The head of France’s financial watchdog warned that France would not shy away from employing what she termed an “atomic weapon”—the possibility of challenging the validity of licenses granted by other EU member states. This could disrupt the established “passporting” mechanism that allows companies approved in one country to operate throughout the European Union. Barbat-Layani also pointed out that some crypto platforms are engaging in “regulatory shopping,” seeking out jurisdictions with less stringent requirements to gain favorable licenses. France And Allies Seek Major Changes For MiCA Rules The call for enhanced oversigh t comes after a review by ESMA, which found that certain national regulators, like Malta, faced scrutiny for their licensing processes. In some cases, the review indicated insufficient risk assessment when granting licenses to crypto firms. As part of this ongoing transition, crypto companies are in the process of applying for MiCA licenses, with jurisdictions like Luxembourg and Malta already granting approvals to prominent platforms such as Coinbase (COIN) and Gemini (GEMI). However, the French, Italian, and Austrian regulators are advocating for revisions to MiCA that would impose stricter rules on crypto activities outside the EU, enhance cybersecurity measures, and refine how authorities manage new digital asset offerings . France has consistently championed the idea of expanding ESMA’s regulatory powers, a sentiment echoed by ESMA’s head, Verena Ross. However, this proposal faces resistance from certain EU member states, highlighting the challenges ahead in establishing a cohesive regulatory approach for the digital asset market.

Analysts from The Bull Theory, a crypto research firm, have emphasized the significance of this upcoming period, suggesting it could determine the fate of what they term “mega altseason” in the fourth quarter (Q4) of the year. Could Global Economic Data Trigger A Surge In Crypto Prices? The urgency of this new prediction for the broader crypto sector, comes in light of recent economic data from China, which revealed signs of weakening demand. Retail sales grew by only 3.4% year-on-year, falling short of the expected 3.9%. Similarly, industrial production increased by just 5.2%, marking the slowest growth in twelve months, while urban unemployment rose to 5.3%. These indicators suggest that the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, leading to speculation that quantitative easing (QE) may be the only viable solution moving forward. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Eye $0.54 ‘Final Boss’ Breakout, Says Top Analyst China has already begun injecting substantial liquidity into its economy, and further measures could significantly boost the global money supply. The situation in the United States adds another layer of complexity, as markets are anticipating a 25 basis point cut in the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rates on September 17. If Fed Chair Jerome Powell not only confirms this cut but also signals the possibility of additional easing, The Bull Theory claims that this situation could lead to a surge in liquidity. Historically, such moves have prompted sharp upward movements in crypto and Bitcoin prices, often ranging from 5% to 10% within weeks. Moreover, Ethereum (ETH) could see increased inflows, particularly from exchange-traded funds (ETFs), while altcoins may benefit from an expanded risk appetite among investors. However, if the Federal Reserve hesitates to implement further cuts, risk assets across the board could face a sharp correction. Potential Rate Cuts From Key Central Banks The following days will also see critical decisions from other central banks, including the Bank of England (BOE) on September 18. Should the BOE signal a willingness to cut rates, it would reinforce the narrative of synchronized global easing. This could align with potential dovish moves from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on September 19, which would further weaken the yen and facilitate more dollar liquidity flowing into the market. Related Reading: The Big PEPE Price Breakout: Falling Wedge Pattern Points To 64% Rally According to the firm’s analysis, in the macroeconomic landscape the best-case scenario would involve a coordinated global easing strategy, featuring cuts from the Federal Reserve, a dovish BOJ, and a supportive BOE. They assert this could lead to massive liquidity inflows, potentially pushing Bitcoin past the $120,000 mark, accelerating exchange-traded fund inflows into Ethereum, and prompting stronger performance from altcoins. The Bull Theory concludes that if global central banks align their policies towards easing, the next ten days could very well mark the beginning of a robust altcoin season.

Despite the progress, PI is in red territory today, while the multi-million token unlocks scheduled for the next month and the major supply stored on exchanges signal heavy potential selling pressure. Moving Forward as Scheduled The controversial crypto project, officially launched in 2019, continues to make adjustments and implement developments to strengthen its ecosystem. Most recently, the X account Pi News revealed that Pi Network is gradually upgrading from protocol v19 to v23, covering Testnet, Testnet2, and Mainnet. Moreover, the Testnet has been successfully upgraded to v22. The goal is to improve performance and network stability, thereby enabling further ecosystem advancements. Earlier this month, the project’s team explained that Version 23 is based on Stellar v23, but it’s custom-made for Pi Network. It aims to provide users with more control and a few functionalities, including Know-Your-Customer (KYC) authorities into the protocol that will “maintain PI as a KYC-verified blockchain, while offering a more distributed community-driven KYC process at the protocol level.” Some users commenting on the latest progress news claimed verifications remain an issue. “Will this improve KYC approvals? They need to hurry the hell up and purge all UNVERIFIED Pi that doesn’t have KYC so we can go back to 1 dollar,” one person asked. PI Price Outlook Despite the latest upgrade status, the native token of the crypto project remains in red territory today (September 15). As of this writing, it trades at approximately $0.34 (per CoinGecko’s data), which is a staggering 88% decline compared to the all-time high of around $3 registered at the start of the year. And while some community members believe that PI could mark a significant revival in the short term, important metrics signal that the pullback may even intensify. Data indicates that over 137 million tokens will be unlocked within the next 30 days, providing an opportunity for people to offload coins they have been waiting for a long time, thereby increasing sell pressure. PI Token Unlocks, Source: piscan.io In addition, the amount of PI stored on crypto exchanges continues to rise and is currently above 440 million. Almost half of that stash is stored on Gate.io, while Bitget comes in second with 147 million.
