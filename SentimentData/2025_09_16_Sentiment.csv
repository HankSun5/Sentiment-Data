It’s likely that short-term traders have taken some profits following the market’s rally over the weekend, although most coins are still up in the past seven days. This includes XRP, Pump.fun and Hyperliquid, which are all showing strong momentum despite correcting a little today. But if the FOMC does cut rates later this week, they could all rebound strongly, bringing traders more profits. Crypto Price Prediction Today 15 September XRP ($XRP): Ripple Expansion Means Altcoin Could Be Biggest Winner of Bull Market It’s down by 3.5% today, but XRP remains one of the most bullish tokens in the top-100 by quite some margin. At $2.98, it remains up by 1.5% in a week and by 6% in a fortnight, although it is down by 5% in the past month. This monthly decline is arguably bullish, however, since it indicates that XRP is due to correct upwards in the near future. Its chart also invites this suspicion, given that its had yet to reach an overbought position prior to its decline today. Source: TradingView In other words, today likely represents a blip within a medium-term upswing, which could get into motion as and when the much-hoped-for rate cut arrives on Wednesday. More fundamentally, XRP is in a great position to ride any end-of-year bull rally, given Ripple’s encouraging growth in recent weeks. It has signed partnerships with major banks , made important acquisitions, and also expanded into Dubai and Africa, so the future looks very bright for the firm. In view of this, the XRP price could hit $3.50 by the end of the month, and close 2025 at over $5. Pump.fun ($PUMP): Growth of Launchpad Could Push New Token to Record Highs by End of Week PUMP is currently priced at $0.007989, which marks a 1.5% loss today, having set a new ATH of $0.008819 within the past 24 hours. The altcoin is also up by an astonishing 129% in a month, making it one of the best-performing tokens in the market across this timeframe. And fundamentally, PUMP is in a strong position, given that Pump.fun remains the biggest token launchpad on Solana, with 8 million unique active wallets in the past month , as well as a volume of $1 billion. Looking at its chart, its indicators suggest that it may be close to peaking, yet it’s also possible that the FOMC meeting later this week could give it a second wind. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) has bounced up again after dipping from 80 over the weekend, suggesting that it has momentum left to spare. Some whales are continuing to invest more deeply in PUMP , despite the possibility that it could peak soon, indicating confidence in its long-term prospects. It has already bounced within the past hour, so we could see it testing new highs later in the week, potentially passing $0.0950 by the weekend. Hyperliquid ($HYPE): Altcoin Hitting New Highs As Native DEX Platform Continues to Grow HYPE has declined by 1.5% today, but its current price of $53.51 marks a 5% gain in a week, with the coin hitting a new ATH over the weekend. Hyperliquid is another token that has the advantage of having a strong platform behind it, with the Hyperliquid DEX now boasting a total value locked in of $2.6 billion . This makes it the eighth-biggest platform in crypto in terms of TVL, and its on-chain value only continues to grow. For this reason, we can expect the Hyperliquid price to keep climbing in the medium- and long-term. Source: TradingView Its indicators suggest that it may also be close to peaking, but given that the wider market is entering a bullish phase, it could continue to rise into Q4. We could therefore see the HYPE price reach $75 by the end of the month, $100 by the end of October, and $150 by 2026. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): L2 Network Raises $16 Million As Launch Quickly Approaches The crypto price prediction for these 3 tokens is very positive right now, but the incoming bull market will also see many other coins outperforming averages. This is likely to include presale tokens, with one of the most exciting presale coins right now being Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new L2 project for Bitcoin . Bitcoin, but faster. Introducing Bitcoin Hyper: the Layer-2 that brings speed & scalability back to BTC. pic.twitter.com/tPe1eQmYWv — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 14, 2025 Bitcoin Hyper has raised $16 million in its ongoing presale, with investors excited by its plans to launch a true layer-two network for Bitcoin. In its role as an L2, it will offer low transaction fees and fast confirmation times, provide an ecosystem in which BTC holders can put their holdings to work. It’s aiming to become a DeFi and trading layer for Bitcoin, tapping into its network’s huge value, and providing Bitcoin holders with opportunities to make additional profits. Using Solana’s Virtual Machine and zero-knowledge rollups, it will provide an unparalleled level of scalability and security. Its native token, HYPER, will be necessary to pay transaction fees, so it could witness lots of demand once the network launches. Investors can join its sale by heading over to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as MetaMask or Best Wallet. HYPER now costs $0.012925, but this will rise repeatedly as the sale progresses.

The Solana price is still drawing eyes, Chainlink is making headlines, but experts argue that only Remittix is positioned as the best crypto to buy now in Q3. With its wallet beta launch imminent, a $250,000 giveaway live, and a 15 per cent referral program already paying out daily in USDT, the window to act is closing. Find out more in this article. Solana Price Performance and Outlook Solana price is floating at around $246.91, which is an indicator of an unexpected stability in the market where there is volatility. Its blazing-fast blockchain and minimal gas charges are appreciated by analysts, which spur developers and DeFi projects need. In the recent past, there has been the deployment of new platforms on the network of Solana increasing the liquidity and adoption. However, as the Solana price looks healthy, traders are undecided whether the next upward move will be robust or temporary. Predictions are optimistic so long as the ecosystem continues to grow, although the gain might be limited relative to smaller tokens that have higher growth potential. Chainlink’s Latest Developments and Market Impact The latest Chainlink news has kept its token in the spotlight. Integrations across DeFi continue to multiply, reinforcing its position as the industry’s leading decentralized oracle provider. Secure data feeds are now more critical than ever, and Chainlink is a name institutions trust to deliver. As positive as these developments are, some question whether Chainlink has already priced in much of its growth. Why Remittix Stands Out As Best Crypto To Buy Now This is where Remittix changes the game. Unlike Solana and Chainlink, Remittix is targeting a global market worth trillions of dollars. It is not about speculation, it is about solving payments for businesses, freelancers, and everyday users. Remittix has sold over 662 million tokens, raised more than 25.6 million dollars, and is priced at just $0.1080. A BitMart listing was locked in after the 20 million milestone, LBANK followed after 22 million, and a third CEX is on deck. Momentum is undeniable. With the wallet beta launching on September 15 and a massive $250,000 giveaway underway, the race to accumulate RTX has never been hotter. Analysts are already calling it the best crypto to buy now , and for good reason: • RTX is solving a real world 19 trillion dollar payments problem. • Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries. • The tokenomics are deflationary and designed for long term growth. • Project momentum is accelerating ahead of the beta launch. • The referral program pays 15 percent in USDT, claimable daily via the dashboard. Every signal points to scarcity. The market is tightening, listings are lining up, and demand is accelerating. Investors who wait risk watching the value slip away to early movers. Remittix is not another speculative play. It is a payments solution backed by tech, listings, and adoption. That is why experts rank it as the best crypto to buy now, and why buyers are rushing in before the wallet launch activates its utility.

In a thread posted on September 12 and expanded over the weekend, analyst Nik Patel (@cointradernik) said the current positioning backdrop “is less like March and Dec ’24 crossovers and more like Dec ’23,” warning that the market is set up for a “multi-week whipsaw going into early/mid Oct.” He added a specific liquidation map: “Give me $1.5bn in shorts liqs on the weekly and then $2.8bn of long liqs into Oct 7th pls.” pic.twitter.com/LVsY4bU99o — Nik (@cointradernik) September 12, 2025 What Is Different This Time For Bitcoin? What makes this setup different, in his view, is the balance between spot and derivatives flows and the breadth of basis trades. “Spot vol as % of total vol [is] lower here than prior crossovers for Others OI vs BTC OI (March ’24 and Dec ’24),” he wrote, arguing that if spot demand were truly in the driver’s seat “we should expect spot vol as a % of total vol to be higher not lower.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Above Mid-Term Holder Breakeven – Is A Fresh Rally Brewing? Instead, he sees “a combination of basis trade across a broader range of markets than just BTC & ETH but also more directional levered shorts than prior occasions,” with the immediate “upside risk… even greater for a short liq cascade first.” Funding, he noted, is “benign” relative to those earlier peaks. Real-time funding data broadly corroborate the “benign” characterization. Across major venues, BTC perpetual funding hovered close to flat in recent sessions—generally in the +0.005% to +0.01% per-8-hour range—well below the overheated prints typical of euphoric tops. That keeps the door open to a squeeze without the need to first unwind extreme long leverage. Sentiment, Nik argued, is still closer to “disbelief” than euphoria. He contrasted March 2024’s ETF frenzy and December 2024’s post-election optimism with today’s more skeptical tone, pointing to a still-elevated pool of sidelined capital. “Both prior crossovers had stablecoin dominance trough at 5% ish. We are currently at 6.1% — imo this is textbook disbelief/Sidelined September positioning,” he wrote. In his base case, that war chest ultimately fuels year-end risk-taking once the whipsaw plays out: “We will almost certainly get the positioning whipsaw and bear trap during that quarterly end & monthly open window of weakness, but there are a lot more stables ready to be deployed here into year-end.” In a self-aware aside, Nik even shared a machine-generated distillation of his view: “ChatGPT coming to a similar conclusion here after I fed all these charts in, idk if that inspires confidence or concern about my view though lol.” Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is A Strong Buy If It Overcomes $118K — Here’s Why ChatGPT wrote: “Past crossovers: signaled end-phase altseason blowoffs, fueled by euphoric longs with no dry powder left. This crossover: signals pre-phase potential — leverage is already there, but it’s balanced/shorter, with capital still on the sidelines (stables). This is why the funding differential is so important: • High funding + low stables = top-like conditions. Low funding + high stables = squeeze-ready conditions.” Renowned crypto analyst CRG (@MacroCRG) consented: “Agree with him that a big short liq event is likely before a big long liq event still lots of positioning to unwind imo from ppl expecting a bearish September. In saying that, would like the coins to bounce soon, many are at/near key pivots.” As ever with path-dependent derivatives tape, the trigger matters. Nik cautioned that a “massive short liquidation event” in the coming week could flip the script if it invites “late longs” and spikes funding into October. But absent that sudden shift, his base case remains a two-step: an upside liquidation cascade that resets shorts, followed by a rug-pull on over-eager longs into the October 7 window. Traders watching for confirmation will focus on whether funding stays contained as price lifts, whether spot participation actually broadens rather than fades, and whether stablecoin deployment reduces the cash cushion he cites. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $114,852.

Over the weekend, the address acquired 3,976 ETH worth approximately $18.9 million, according to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence. The purchase was executed using 18.9 million DAI, a stablecoin, and split across multiple transactions before being consolidated into the buy. The transaction came just as Ethereum broke above $4,700, marking its highest level in more than two weeks. Currently, ETH trades at $4,538, down 2.9% in the past 24 hours. A Pattern of Bold Acquisitions This is not the first time the wallet has made waves. In July, it bought 4,863 ETH for $12.6 million and later added 649 ETH at $3,562 per token. Just last month, the same wallet scooped up $8 million worth of Solana (SOL), though that position has since slipped below entry price. Analysts say the strategy shows deliberate fund consolidation, often seen in money laundering tactics. Breaking transactions into smaller amounts and using privacy tools allows the hacker to mask movements, making tracking more difficult. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT previously estimated that the Coinbase-related social engineering scam drained at least $330 million from victims, warning that the real figure may be significantly higher. Growing Concerns Over Rising Crypto Hacks The latest Ethereum purchase shows broader concerns in the crypto industry, where hack-related losses reached $163 million in August alone, according to security firm PeckShield. With exploits shifting from smart contract bugs to social engineering and cross-chain bridge vulnerabilities, wallets like this continue to pose a major threat to investor confidence. Despite Coinbase offering a $20 million reward for information on the perpetrators and tightening security, the hacker remains unidentified. The latest $19M ETH grab proves the resilience and boldness of cybercriminals operating in the space. As crypto rallies and institutional inflows grow, the question remains: is the hacker simply riding bullish momentum, or is this part of a deeper strategy to launder stolen funds? Regulators and blockchain investigators are watching closely, but for now, the crypto world is left with more questions than answers.

Popular with retail investors, the trading platform revealed it filed plans with regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for this new fund dubbed Robinhood Ventures Fund I. Robinhood makes a shift towards inclusive venture capital According to the firm, the fund is meant to democratize access to private startups and potentially shape how everyday retail investors participate in high growth opportunities that have for long been a preserve of the elite – venture capital firms, institutions and the ultra-wealthy. This move also comes on the backdrop of rising interest in private markets where valuations have surged due to AI and digital innovations. Data cited by Robinhood’s newsroom post on Robinhood Newsroom shows that the number of listed domestic firms in the US has decreased, pushing more capital into private entities that often yield outsized returns for institutional players. “For decades, wealthy people and institutions have invested in private companies while retail investors have been unfairly locked out,” said Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev in a statement. “With Robinhood Ventures, everyday people will be able to invest in opportunities once reserved for the elite.” Tenev. If SEC approves the Robinhood Ventures Fund I, it will subsequently list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker RVI. According to a statement, its shares will be accessible to the public via various brokerages among them Robinhood’s own platform. The fund is expected to focus on investing in “a concentrated portfolio of private companies at the frontiers of their respective industries,” according to Robinhood. The Monday announcement is the latest in a series of strategic expansions by Robinhood as it recently coveted a spot on the S&P 500 and introduced a new social media feature known as Robinhood Social within its app during the past two weeks alone. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , the social media app will roll out next year with a select group of customers having invitations before rolling out to all users. The new fund aligns with the firm’s ecosystem The fund announcement also comes following the firm’s and controversial entry into tokenized equities in Europe, which offered exposure to private giants like the ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SpaceX. This initiative attracted criticism from OpenAI and scrutiny from European regulators, highlighting the complexities of innovating in the private market space. The filing also underscores the firm’s aggressive pivot from its origins as a commission-free stock trading app towards a more “diversified, multilane financial platform,” a transformation which has been significantly powered by the firm’s booming cryptocurrency business. Earlier this year, the firm revealed that transaction based revenues had climbed 77% year-over0year, largely driven by crypto trading. Its second quarter earnings also highlighted this momentum as revenue from crypto products surged 98% year-over-year to $160 million. According to the firm, total crypto trading volumes reached $35 billion. This growth, Robinhood said, was substantially driven by the June acquisition of the veteran European crypto exchange Bitstamp, which brought with it over 50 regulatory licenses and accounted for $7 billion in trading volume in second quarter alone from its institutional client base. Now, the introduction of the Robinhood Ventures Fund I marks a direct challenge to the traditional structures of private equity and represents a significant step in the company’s stated mission “to democratize finance for all.” Market watchers have also noted that this fund could lower barriers for retail investors, who have historically been left out due to high minimum investments and accreditation requirements. A report by WealthManagement.com shows how the fund, pending approval by SEC will enable ordinary users to gain exposure to startups before they can go public, potentially through tokenized assets or direct equity stakes.

Ever since SHIB’s legendary rally in 2021, investors have been searching for signs of another breakout moment. With its community-driven growth, the expansion of its Shibarium Layer 2 network, and broader developments in the meme coin sector, the question lingers: is SHIB preparing for its next big surge? At the same time, new entrants such as Layer Brett (LBRETT) are shifting the narrative, offering utility-backed alternatives that may influence how traders view meme tokens going forward. The current state of Shiba Inu Right now, Shiba Inu price prediction discussions focus on volatility, supply, and adoption. SHIB trades near $0.000014 , with a market capitalization in the $7–8 billion range . While far below its October 2021 all-time high of $0.00008845 , analysts note that new network developments could support a rebound. Shibarium, SHIB’s own Layer 2 solution, has introduced lower fees and faster transactions, a crucial element for long-term sustainability. These upgrades form the backbone of a more optimistic Shiba Inu price prediction. Still, headwinds remain: token supply remains enormous, transaction activity fluctuates, and competition from emerging meme coins is growing. Layer Brett: A rising contender While SHIB continues to capture attention, Layer Brett has become part of the same conversation. Its presale recently crossed $3.6 million , with tokens priced at $0.0058 Unlike many meme coins, Layer Brett is built as a Layer 2 solution on Ethereum, designed for scalability, speed, and low-cost transactions. For those tracking the Shiba Inu price prediction, Layer Brett presents a useful point of comparison. Where SHIB relies heavily on community strength and branding, Layer Brett layers in technical innovation, claiming gas fees as low as $0.0001 and offering staking rewards through its dApp. By combining meme appeal with utility, it is carving a different trajectory in the meme coin market. Comparing Forecasts: SHIB vs. Layer Brett A realistic Shiba Inu price prediction requires examining community behavior, on-chain activity, and network growth. Optimistic analysts suggest SHIB could double in price if Shibarium gains wider adoption. Others caution that without a major catalyst, SHIB may stay range-bound. Either way, its future rests on more than hype—it needs functional traction. In contrast, Layer Brett’s forecasts lean on its presale dynamics and tokenomics. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens and high staking incentives for early adopters, it attracts a different kind of speculation. Many commentators now mention Layer Brett in the same breath as the Shiba Inu price prediction, highlighting how new entrants may influence market sentiment. Conclusion The Shiba Inu price prediction remains a key topic in the meme coin sector. For SHIB, the path to another historic rally depends on adoption of Shibarium, reductions in transaction costs, and ongoing community engagement. For investors, this means keeping a close watch on SHIB’s technical developments as well as external market sentiment. Layer Brett, meanwhile, offers a contrasting approach—utility-driven growth layered onto meme culture. Its presale strength, low gas fees, and staking rewards give it momentum of its own. For some traders, balancing exposure between SHIB and Layer Brett could provide a hedge between history and innovation.

Japanese financial giant Credit Saison has just announced the launch of an ambitious blockchain fund , signaling a powerful new wave of institutional interest in the digital asset space. This move isn’t just about investing; it’s about pioneering the future of finance, specifically targeting the burgeoning real-world asset (RWA) sector. What is Onigiri Capital and its Blockchain Fund Focus? Credit Saison’s new venture, aptly named Onigiri Capital, is set to deploy up to $50 million into innovative startups. This dedicated blockchain fund will primarily concentrate on companies building solutions within the Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization domain. Imagine transforming traditional assets like real estate, commodities, or even intellectual property into digital tokens on a blockchain. This is precisely where Onigiri Capital sees immense potential. Investment Size: Up to $50 million. Primary Focus: Startups in the Real-World Asset (RWA) sector. Goal: Drive innovation and adoption of tokenized assets. Why Are Real-World Assets Crucial for a Blockchain Fund? The RWA sector is gaining incredible traction, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). Tokenizing RWAs offers numerous advantages, fundamentally changing how we perceive and interact with assets: Increased Liquidity: Assets that were once illiquid can be traded more easily on global markets. Fractional Ownership: Allows smaller investors to own a piece of high-value assets, democratizing access. Transparency: Blockchain records provide an immutable and transparent ownership trail, enhancing trust. Accessibility: Global access to investment opportunities, breaking down geographical barriers. Credit Saison’s strategic decision to focus its blockchain fund here highlights a forward-thinking approach, recognizing the massive untapped value in digitizing tangible and intangible assets. This move positions them at the forefront of financial innovation. Japan’s Growing Embrace of Blockchain Innovation This launch by Credit Saison isn’t an isolated event; it reflects a broader trend in Japan. The nation has been increasingly open to exploring blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, albeit with a cautious regulatory stance. Financial institutions are now actively looking for ways to integrate this technology into their core businesses. A dedicated blockchain fund from a firm of Credit Saison’s stature could inspire other traditional players to follow suit, further accelerating institutional adoption in Asia. The establishment of Onigiri Capital demonstrates a clear commitment to fostering growth in the Web3 ecosystem, particularly within a regulated financial framework. This institutional backing provides much-needed credibility and capital for promising startups, helping them scale and innovate. Navigating the Challenges and Seizing the Benefits of a Blockchain Fund While the potential of a blockchain fund focused on RWAs is immense, challenges certainly exist. Regulatory clarity, technological scalability, and market acceptance are all factors that need careful navigation. However, the benefits for early movers like Credit Saison are substantial: Pioneering Position: Establishing leadership in a rapidly evolving and competitive market. Diversification: Adding a new, high-growth asset class to their portfolio, reducing overall risk. Innovation Driver: Fostering new technologies that can benefit their existing financial services and create new revenue streams. Credit Saison’s move is a powerful statement about the future of finance, indicating a definitive shift towards a more digitized, transparent, and accessible financial system globally. This strategic investment solidifies their role as an innovator.

But moving away from Siberia and the North Caucuses is presenting miners with a new set of problems, media outlets in the nation have reported. Per a report from the Russian newspaper Vedomosti Yug , the B2B electrical equipment platform TenderPro has compiled a top 10 of areas where demand for crypto mining rigs and other related equipment is highest. Topping the table were Moscow and the Moscow Oblast (the region surrounding the capital). This area is now responsible for 21.9% of mining hardware purchases. Russian Crypto Miners: Relocating to Bigger Cities? The figure for the capital dwarfed demand figures (6.7%) in the Siberian oblast of Irkutsk. The latter is the birthplace of the Russian Bitcoin mining industry. A Russian crypto mining-related facility. (Source: Artemy Lebedev/VK) However, mining in much of Irkutsk is now illegal. Those mining farms that do have the right to operate in the Siberian region already reportedly “near full capacity.” The drift toward urban centers appears to be real: St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region took third spot with 4.7%. Krasnodar Krai, in the southwestern part of the North Caucasus region, took fourth place. Krasnodar is Russia’s third most populous federal subject. Kuban, also in the North Caucasus, rounded out the top five. The Total Hash Rate for the Bitcoin network over the past 12 months. (Source: Blockchain.com) The platform calculated that overall demand for mining equipment from commercial enterprises in the Russian South fell by 19.3% over the first eight months of 2025. A ‘Market Correction’ Olga Gorchitsyna, TenderPro’s Director of Digital Products Development, said that this fall in demand may be attributable to a market correction. She suggested that the Kremlin’s decision last year to legalize the crypto mining sector may have caused an exceptional spike in demand. Gorchitsyna explained: “A year ago, after the legalization of industrial mining, we saw a sharp increase in demand for crypto mining equipment. However, since the beginning of this year, the excitement around the sector has gradually begun to subside.” Russian prosecutors are targeting Denis Shtengelov's KDV Group, one of the country’s largest snack producers, for expropriation https://t.co/Ahk6oLYrm8 — Bloomberg (@business) September 15, 2025 In previous years, crypto miners made a beeline for the Northern Caucasus and Southern Siberia , attracted mainly to these areas’ famously low energy prices. But these areas are traditionally sparsely populated, meaning their generally more moderst power generation capabilities can easily be overloaded. The introduction of seasonal bans and police crackdowns on illegal miners in these regions has scared off many industrial miners. The statistics, it appears, now indicate that miners are preferring to set up shop in areas where power shortages are rare, and other mining firms are few and far between. Noise Concerns However, moving into the more densely populated European part of Russia is posting a new challenge for some Russian miners, as well as their international backers. Russia revives barter trade to dodge Western sanctions https://t.co/QnvdRaS1NU https://t.co/QnvdRaS1NU — Reuters (@Reuters) September 15, 2025 Some 260km southeast of Moscow, in the village of Kiritsy, Ryazan Region, a mining firm named Integral has faced a backlash after launching a crypto mining facility. The village has a population of over 3,000 people, who have complained bitterly about high noise levels since the firm turned on its rigs in April this year. Per the Ryazan branch of Top 24 News , Rospotrebnadzor, the Russian federal well-being and consumer rights agency, ordered Integral to suspend its operations for 30 days. The agency acted after residents complained that noise levels from the facility were rising above 50 decibels. Kiritsy residents said they were suffering from “headaches, hearing loss, and a general deterioration in health.” Watchdog Steps In, Russian Crypto Miners Face New Problems? Rospotrebnadzor told Integral it must install special equipment that will help suppress the noise. The firm has brought in “specialists from China” who will help install equipment aimed at reducing the farm’s noise levels. In August, Argumenti y Facti reported that residents say the mining facility uses gas piston turbine generators. One resident explained: “Two of these turbines are currently operational. But there are plans to install 20 more. These two turbines have already created unbearable living conditions for people here. It’s frightening to even imagine what will happen when there are 22 of them here.” Kiritsy residents complained that the turbine generators are “no more than 500 meters away” from some of their houses. They added that the village is home to a children’s tuberculosis healthcare center, where young people from all over the country come for treatment.

51790256,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=178075,1757979024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/51790256.jpeg,The Best Daily Habits of Successful Crypto Traders,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-best-daily-habits-of-successful-crypto-traders/,"Success in crypto is rarely about luck alone. Behind every profitable trade lies a framework of discipline, consistency, and repeatable actions. In a market as volatile as digital assets, the traders who last are the ones who develop daily habits that keep them focused while others get distracted by noise. From Bitcoin whales to altcoin scalpers, veterans share a common truth: habits compound into results. In 2025, with ETFs driving institutional flows and altcoins preparing for their next cycle, the ability to sharpen habits may be the greatest edge a trader can have. Alongside proven methods, new opportunities are also entering conversations, one of them being MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could deliver 45× returns before major listings. Habit 1: Structured market research The first thing successful traders do daily is check the markets, but not just prices. They track macroeconomic events, ETF flows, on-chain data, and sentiment. By starting each day with structured research, they avoid reacting emotionally to sudden moves. Tools like CoinMarketCap, CryptoQuant, and Santiment provide context, whether it’s whale accumulation, exchange inflows, or funding rate shifts. This data-driven approach means they act from strategy, not impulse. Habit 2: Journaling trades A trading journal might sound old-fashioned, but it’s one of the most powerful tools for improvement. Successful traders log every position, entry, exit, rationale, and outcome. Over time, this builds a personal database that reveals patterns: strengths to lean on and weaknesses to avoid. Many beginners skip this step, but those who keep journals learn faster and cut losses earlier. As one professional once said, “Markets repeat themselves, your journal shows you how.” Habit 3: Mindset and discipline Psychology is half the battle. Top traders practice patience, emotional discipline, and resilience. They avoid revenge trading after losses and don’t let FOMO drive entries. Many have daily routines outside of charts, exercise, meditation, or reading, that sharpen focus. By grounding themselves, they bring stability into a market defined by chaos. This same principle of discipline applies to spotting new opportunities, where MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. With forecasts calling for a 45× move , the token is stirring global crypto communities. What makes MAGACOIN different is its balance of structure and energy. Traders describe it as the rare presale that blends smart tokenomics with cultural firepower, turning it into more than hype, it’s strategy in motion. Just as good habits compound in trading, presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE compound through momentum, and that synergy is why so many are watching closely. Habit 4: Continuous education Markets evolve, and traders evolve with them. The best spend at least 30–60 minutes a day studying new concepts: ETF mechanics, Layer-2 rollups, DeFi strategies, or simply reviewing macroeconomic reports. Crypto is one of the fastest-moving industries in finance; those who stop learning fall behind. Successful traders treat education as part of their routine, not an afterthought. Habit 5: Risk management rituals Every day, top traders reassess their risk. They set clear stop-loss levels, calculate position sizes, and ensure their exposure aligns with their capital plan. The traders who survive crashes are not the ones with the highest win rates, but the ones who never let a single loss wipe them out. Risk management isn’t glamorous, but it is the lifeline of every profitable career in crypto. Habit 6: Networking and community Crypto trading is no longer a solo sport. The best traders exchange ideas in private groups, Telegram channels, and Discord communities. They test strategies, share data, and learn from collective insights. Being part of a strong network keeps them updated and accountable. It also helps them spot early narratives, whether it’s ETF approvals, presale momentum, or altcoin rotations, that others miss until it’s too late. Habit 7: Reviewing and refining At the end of each day, successful traders review their performance. Did they stick to their plan? Did emotions interfere? Were entries timed correctly? This self-audit, repeated daily, builds discipline. It transforms trading from guesswork into a process. Over months and years, this refinement compounds into mastery. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is on Every Trader’s Radar Massive Upside Potential: Analysts are calling for up to 45× gains , giving it the kind of asymmetric return profile traders dream of. Deflationary Design: A scarcity-driven model ensures supply pressure favors early participants as the presale tightens. Balanced Strategy: Unlike hype-only plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE blends disciplined tokenomics with cultural firepower, making it both structured and energetic. Timing Advantage: Arriving before major exchange listings, it offers first-mover exposure that seasoned traders value for maximum upside. Conclusion: habits create longevity The crypto market rewards those who prepare, not those who gamble. The traders who thrive in 2025 are those who commit to daily habits: research, journaling, risk control, learning, and emotional discipline. These small steps add up to extraordinary results when applied consistently. At the same time, new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, forecasted for a potential 45× surge, are reminding traders that discipline isn’t just about risk; it’s also about recognizing projects with huge growth potential on time. For anyone aiming to trade successfully, combining solid habits with timely opportunities may be the most powerful strategy of all.

With XRP pushing toward $4 from just under $0.10, comparisons are everywhere. Will XRP’s newfound strength hold as Remittix sets the stage for its own breakout? XRP Price Prediction: Ripple’s Path to $4 Recent XRP price action shows strength. After clearing resistance near $3.01, XRP is setting up for further gains according to chart signals. Large wallet addresses have been steadily adding to their holdings, on-chain activity confirms growing participation from smaller investors, and technical analysts now view $3.66 as the next area that could attract strong buying interest. Even so, overhead barriers between $3.50 and $4 are expected to act as a real test. Catalysts such as approval of exchange-traded funds or more clarity from regulators could be what finally drives momentum past that zone. How Remittix Compares and Stands Out While XRP aims for $4, Remittix is already turning heads. Unlike XRP, whose strength depends on long-standing networks and regulatory wins, Remittix is being designed as an altcoin with working product features from the start. Its referral rewards, live utility, and near-term launch set it apart. On the funding side, Remittix has already sold more than 662 million tokens at $0.1080 each and raised over $25.6 million. Importantly, the project secured a BitMart listing right after surpassing $20 million raised, then announced an LBANK listing once the $22 million level was cleared, and is now preparing a third CEX. These milestones show how investor demand is translating into global exchange traction at a pace rarely seen in early-stage projects. Check what makes Remittix special right now: Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries Global payout rails are integrated already and expanding The project is audited by CertiK, which builds trust and transparency Early believers are already calling it “XRP 2.0” It is built for adoption, not speculation Comparing XRP’s Surge and Remittix’s Rise XRP is carving a path toward $4, pushing past key resistance and riding on institutional momentum and partnership news. Remittix, dubbed “XRP 2.0,” is not just whispering, it is building. Remittix is blending utility, community rewards, and real product rollout in a way that sets it apart. XRP may be closer to mainstream adoption and proven infrastructure, but Remittix is sprinting ahead in terms of early-stage opportunity. For those tracking XRP price prediction, keep one eye on Ripple’s charts. For those seeking high growth from low entry, Remittix offers something very different.

Analyst Projects $20+ In October 2025,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrps-biggest-rally-yet-analyst-projects-20-in-october-2025/,"XRP is trading close to $3 and has struggled to hold that level in recent sessions. According to a market analyst, a repeat of a past pattern tied to Bitcoin halvings could push XRP much higher, with a possible cycle top above $20 on Oct. 17, 2025. The timeline ties back to earlier halving cycles and a short lag that, she argues, has repeated before. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Odds, Jumps 21% Even As ETF Debut Gets Pushed Back Halving Dates And Follow-On Moves Based on reports, crypto expert Diana points to the 2016–2017 cycle as the clearest example. Bitcoin halved on July 9, 2016, and then reached a peak above $19,000 on Dec. 18, 2017 — 525 days later. XRP, she notes, followed with its high of $3.31 on Jan. 5, 2018, around 18 days after Bitcoin’s top. That sequence — Bitcoin first, XRP soon after — is central to her case. 🚨 XRP TO $15–$20? HISTORY SAYS OCT 2025 IS THE DATE ⏳🔥 History, math, and the end of SEC suppression all point to one window: mid-October 2025. This could be XRP’s most savage run yet — let’s break it down. 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/RJ6Z85b6pz — Diana (@InvestWithD) September 4, 2025 Losing Steam, Legal Pressure The pattern did not hold in the next cycle. Bitcoin halved on May 11, 2020, and then topped near $69,000 on Nov. 10, 2021, about 545 days later. XRP did not mirror that run. Reports show XRP hit $1.95 in April 2021, several months earlier than Bitcoin’s peak, after legal pressure and exchange delistings constrained its move. Diana describes that episode as a lost cycle for the token. Regulatory Clarity And Product Growth According to reports, the legal cloud around XRP eased after a July 2023 court outcome that cleared major parts of XRP’s past sales from being labeled as securities. Exchanges in the US resumed listings, and Ripple has been building out products like RLUSD and new payment corridors. Diana says those developments, together with multiple ETF filings, improve XRP’s chances this time. She puts forward three price scenarios: a modest run to $5–$7 if Bitcoin’s momentum is modest; a base case of $10–$15 assuming ETF inflows and stronger use cases; and a blow-off rally that could push XRP past $20 if big institutional liquidity arrives.

Modest Growth Outlook Meanwhile, Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered expects XRP’s rally to continue, saying the token could take on a larger role in international finance. He also points to future XRP ETFs as a catalyst that could draw more investors. Kendrick places his price target at $12.25 by 2029, which would mean a 300%+ jump from today’s $2.95 and translate into annualized returns of about 43%. That outlook, however, is far from universal. Morningstar analysts forecast the broader crypto market to grow close to 10% per year through 2034, a rate in line with historical stock market performance.

According to on-chain data, the exchange’s cold wallets now hold only a fraction of the XRP they once did, and the decline is now more than 90%. This comes at a time when the XRP community has been closely monitoring institutional activity, with growing rumors of BlackRock and other heavyweight firms quietly building exposure to XRP. Coinbase’s XRP Holdings Crash By 90% Recent moves by Coinbase with its XRP holdings have taken most crypto investors by surprise. Previous data showed that Coinbase, which was once the fifth-largest holder of XRP, has trimmed its XRP reserve balance from approximately 780.13 million XRP to 199.47 million. This was a cutback of about 69% in its holdings since the second quarter of 2025. However, on-chain data tracked by the @XRPwallets account on the social media platform X shows that Coinbase hasn’t stepped back from slashing its XRP holdings. As recently revealed by @XRPwallets, Coinbase now has just six cold wallets holding about 16.5 million XRP each. This leaves the US-based exchange with an estimated 99 million XRP in total. By comparison, the exchange had 52 cold wallets as recently as June 9, with 10 wallets holding 26.8 million XRP each and another 42 wallets holding 16.8 million XRP each. Combined, that amounted to nearly 970 million XRP under Coinbase’s control. In other words, the most recent numbers mean that Coinbase has shed about 90% of its XRP reserves within the past three months. Such a strong reduction in the movement of XRP away from Coinbase has been linked to accumulation into institutional wallets in anticipation of the launch of a Spot XRP ETF in the US. It also corresponds with previous reports about BlackRock’s indirect involvement with XRP through Coinbase’s custodial services. What Does This Mean For XRP? The scale of outflows from Coinbase’s XRP reserves has taken many crypto investors by surprise, as seen by comments on social media platforms. For instance, XRPwallets hinted at the possibility of these huge movements being linked to BlackRock. An account on the social media platform X, known as Stern Drew , suggested that Coinbase’s sell-offs go with a deliberate strategy to suppress XRP’s price. This was met with a firm rejection by pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who was quick to push back on the manipulation claims. Although there has been no official confirmation, the most plausible explanation of these large XRP exits is mostly linked to the eventual launch of an XRP ETF. The odds of the SEC accepting an XRP ETF in 2025 are now at a 94% chance on Polymarket . Bloomberg analysts also place the odds at a 90% chance or higher. Large institutions could be accumulating XRP in anticipation of such a product, and the reduced supply on exchanges could contribute to buying pressure even before it is launched. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3, down by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.",XRP|BlackRock|coinbase|Polymarket|Spot XRP ETF|Stern Drew|US SEC|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-16 00:00:46

AllInCrypto (@RealAllinCrypto), a well-respected analyst, recently highlighted this research in a video on X, connecting Ripple and BlackRock through one of the most senior figures in digital assets today. Mitchnick’s career includes a period at Ripple before joining BlackRock in February 2018. At the time of his move, he co-authored a research report analyzing digital assets and their potential valuations. The analyst stressed that this document is significant not only for Bitcoin but also for XRP. According to him, it provided numerical scenarios that many in the community have overlooked. BlackRock's Managing Director, Robert Mitchnick, researched future possible trajectories of $BTC and $XRP . A price target of $32.91 was given to XRP based on legitimate value propositions. pic.twitter.com/hgnbFLfv1N — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) September 14, 2025 High Price Targets for XRP AllInCrypto explained that Mitchnick’s report modeled potential success and failure cases for XRP, with the double-digit estimate for the asset’s future price. According to his explanation, the same report set a low estimate of $6.37, still well above XRP’s current trading level. The report then narrowed the forecast into what it called a fundamental value range. “The resulting fundamental value range of between $1.59 to $8.23” was reached after assigning a 25% probability to the success case, with the failure case assuming XRP would be worth nothing. He contrasted this with XRP’s trading range of $0.49 to $3.72 at the time of publication. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 BlackRock Connection Adds Weight AllInCrypto emphasized the importance of Mitchnick’s role today. He noted that the same individual who contributed to that report now holds one of the most senior digital asset positions in global finance. Mitchnick has been at BlackRock for a long time, and AllInCrypto stated that the continuity of his influence makes the earlier valuations more noteworthy. While BlackRock has not filed specifically for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , its presence in the digital asset space has grown considerably. The fact that the firm’s digital asset strategy is overseen by a former Ripple employee has created natural interest around XRP among investors and market commentators. The analyst placed Mitchnick’s XRP estimates alongside his earlier views on Bitcoin. At the time of publication, the report suggested that Bitcoin was undervalued, with its trading range compressed relative to projected long-term value. By linking these assessments, AllInCrypto argued that the high estimate of $32.91 should be taken seriously.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a crucial barometer for market sentiment, currently stands at 52. This score places it squarely in neutral territory, a slight dip from yesterday but a consistent signal of balanced investor emotions. But what does this mean for your crypto strategy, and why should you pay attention to this single number? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is designed to help investors gauge the overall sentiment dominating the cryptocurrency market. It’s a powerful tool that quantifies emotions, moving from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). When the market is in ""Extreme Fear,"" it often suggests potential buying opportunities, as investors are overly cautious. Conversely, ""Extreme Greed"" might signal an impending correction, as the market could be overheating. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated composite of several key market indicators. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final score, offering a comprehensive snapshot of investor psychology: Volatility (25%): Measures the current market’s price fluctuations and drawdown relative to average values. Higher volatility can indicate fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volume and market momentum, often showing increased activity during periods of greed or panic. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related keywords, gauging public interest and sentiment. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls, providing a direct insight into individual perspectives. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors might be shifting away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to cryptocurrencies, with higher search interest often correlating with speculative greed. What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Score of 52 Imply? A score of 52, as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently shows, signifies a balanced market. It’s neither overwhelmingly fearful nor excessively greedy. This neutral zone suggests that investors are not making rash decisions based on extreme emotions. Instead, there’s a mix of caution and optimism, leading to a more stable environment compared to periods of extreme sentiment. In a neutral market, prices might consolidate, moving sideways without significant upward or downward trends. This can be a time for reflection rather than reaction. It allows investors to assess fundamentals, look for long-term value, and avoid getting swept up in short-term emotional trading. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from the Index Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be incredibly beneficial for your trading and investment decisions. It acts as a counter-indicator for many seasoned traders. Here’s how you might interpret different zones: Extreme Fear (0-24): Often seen as a potential buying opportunity. When others are fearful, smart money might be accumulating. Fear (25-49): A cautious period. Investors might be hesitant, but strong projects could still offer good entry points. Neutral (50-59): This is where we are now. It suggests a time for careful analysis. Avoid impulsive moves. Consider dollar-cost averaging or rebalancing your portfolio. Greed (60-74): A period of increasing optimism. While prices may rise, it’s also a time to be cautious about overextension. Extreme Greed (75-100): Often a signal for potential market tops or corrections. Many investors consider taking profits or reducing exposure during these times. However, it’s crucial to remember that the index is just one tool. It should always be used in conjunction with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a clear understanding of your own risk tolerance. Why the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Matters for Your Strategy This index provides a unique perspective on market psychology, which is a powerful driver of crypto prices. By understanding whether the collective sentiment leans towards fear or greed, you can potentially make more informed decisions. It helps you avoid emotional pitfalls, such as selling during a panic or buying into an unsustainable pump. For long-term investors, a neutral score might mean continuing to build positions steadily. For short-term traders, it might indicate a period of lower volatility, requiring different strategies. The index empowers you to think critically about market conditions rather than simply reacting to price movements. Conclusion: A Balanced Perspective in a Volatile Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently at 52, signals a moment of equilibrium in the often-turbulent crypto market. This neutral stance offers a valuable opportunity for investors to step back, assess their strategies, and make rational choices free from extreme emotional pressure. While not a standalone predictor, this index is an indispensable guide for understanding the underlying sentiment that shapes cryptocurrency valuations. Use it wisely to navigate the digital asset landscape with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index?

Recently, a significant indicator for many investors, the Altcoin Season Index , registered a notable drop. This key metric, provided by CoinMarketCap, now stands at 71, a decrease of two points from yesterday. But what exactly does this number signify for your crypto holdings and the broader market outlook? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index : What Does 71 Really Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool designed to help investors gauge the prevailing sentiment in the crypto market. It’s not just a random number; it’s calculated based on a very specific methodology: It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Crucially, stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from this analysis to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The comparison is made against Bitcoin’s performance over the last 90 days. An official “altcoin season” is declared when a remarkable 75% of these top altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day window. Conversely, if Bitcoin is outperforming the majority, it’s considered a “Bitcoin season.” A reading closer to 100 indicates a strong altcoin season, while a lower number points towards Bitcoin’s dominance. Why Did the Altcoin Season Index Dip to 71? The recent two-point fall in the Altcoin Season Index to 71 suggests a subtle yet important shift in market momentum. While 71 is still above the threshold typically associated with a full Bitcoin season (often considered below 50), it indicates that fewer altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin compared to very recently. This slight decrease could be attributed to several factors: Bitcoin’s Resurgence: Often, when Bitcoin experiences a strong price rally, it tends to pull capital from altcoins, as investors prioritize the perceived safety and liquidity of the leading cryptocurrency. Profit-Taking: After periods of altcoin strength, some investors may be taking profits, rotating back into Bitcoin or stablecoins. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news or global events can also influence investor sentiment, leading to a flight to quality, which often means Bitcoin. This dip serves as a reminder that market conditions are fluid and require constant monitoring. It’s not necessarily a sign of impending doom for altcoins, but rather an indication of a rebalancing act. Navigating the Current Crypto Climate: Strategies with the Altcoin Season Index For savvy investors, the Altcoin Season Index offers crucial insights, but it’s important not to view it as a standalone predictor. Instead, consider it as one piece of a larger puzzle. Here are some actionable insights: Diversification is Key: Even during a Bitcoin-dominant phase, some altcoins can still perform well due to specific project developments or niche market demand. Maintaining a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks. Monitor Trends: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index regularly. A sustained drop might suggest a prolonged period of Bitcoin strength, while a reversal could signal new opportunities in altcoins. Fundamental Analysis: Don’t solely rely on market indices. Always research the fundamentals of any altcoin you consider investing in, including its technology, team, use case, and community support. Risk Management: Understand that altcoins generally carry higher risk and volatility than Bitcoin. Adjust your position sizes and stop-loss orders accordingly. The crypto market is cyclical, and periods of altcoin outperformance will undoubtedly return. The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index simply tells us where we stand today. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us About Tomorrow? While the Altcoin Season Index dipping to 71 might seem like a setback for altcoin enthusiasts, it’s a natural part of the crypto market’s ebb and flow. It underscores Bitcoin’s foundational role and its tendency to lead market movements. For investors, this moment presents an opportunity to re-evaluate portfolios, conduct thorough research, and prepare for future market shifts. Whether we’re heading towards a stronger Bitcoin season or merely pausing before another altcoin rally, staying informed with tools like the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for making strategic decisions in this exciting financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric provided by CoinMarketCap that measures the performance of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the last 90 days. It helps indicate whether altcoins or Bitcoin are currently dominating the market. How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? It’s calculated by determining if 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins (by market cap, excluding stablecoins/wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin in the past 90 days. A higher index score indicates a stronger altcoin season, while a lower score suggests Bitcoin dominance. What does an Altcoin Season Index of 71 mean? An index of 71 means that while a significant number of altcoins are still outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days, the momentum has slightly decreased. It’s not a full altcoin season (which would be 75 or higher), nor is it a strong Bitcoin season (typically below 50), but rather a more balanced or transitioning period. Is it an Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season right now? With the Altcoin Season Index at 71, it’s closer to an altcoin season, but the recent dip indicates that Bitcoin has gained some relative strength. It suggests a mixed market where some altcoins are still performing well, but Bitcoin is also asserting its presence. How can I use the Altcoin Season Index in my trading? Use the Altcoin Season Index as an indicator of overall market sentiment. A rising index might encourage more altcoin exposure, while a falling index could prompt a more cautious approach or a focus on Bitcoin. Always combine this with fundamental analysis and robust risk management strategies. If you found this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

The shortfall is highlighted in a new report from the City of London Corporation, the local authority that presides over the country’s financial district. The report quotes a 15 billion-pound annual funding gap for the small- and medium-sized enterprises seeking to grow. It also shows a similar infrastructure investment gap from housing, energy, and transport projects to digital networks. Chris Hayward, policy chairman for the City, warned that the cost of inaction would be great: doing nothing would lead to lost opportunities, decreased productivity, and slower economic growth. The warning comes as the UK economy grapples to break out of stagnation. While markets worldwide struggle and tax increases are anticipated within the autumn budget, the government is pressured to create new money. City pushes for pension reform and more defined infrastructure plans The City calls for reform of pensions and a greater effort to direct savings into UK assets to plug the gap. It cites examples from Canada and Australia, where domestic pension funds are significant investors in infrastructure at home. The UK government has already taken steps to implement some of these recommendations. In the Mansion House Accord, 17 of the biggest pension funds in the country promised to allocate as much as 10% of their portfolios to private markets by 2030. At least half of that will likely be invested in UK assets, which could unlock a further £50 billion of fresh capital. But the City says that’s not good enough, as it would like the government to lay out a more transparent pipeline of projects, so investors know what’s coming. Transparency is necessary, it adds, to generate confidence and attract long-term private capital. Just last month, BlackRock announced it had poured $700m into UK data centres – so clearly there’s still plenty of appetite among international investors to back them if the terms are sweet enough. The new Labour government, little more than a year in office, is making strenuous efforts to increase investment. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government had wanted to steer capital into British infrastructure, green energy, and growth industries. A reshuffle has brought fresh faces to the forefront of this push. The minister for investment, who used to be Poppy Gustafsson, is businessman Jason Stockwood. Meanwhile, Lucy Rigby became city minister instead of Emma Reynolds, who was made environment secretary. The government is also establishing a new investment hub to match global funds with projects in the UK. Officials say the goal is to make Britain an easier and more appealing investment place. Pension capital sparks challenges and debates These are all advances, but there are still huge hurdles. UK pension funds have been on the decline for domestic stocks for decades. Today, pensions are invested in British stocks to only 4% in those portfolios, compared with about 50% during the 1990s. Many trustees prefer investing offshore, where they can make better returns for less risk. This trend has sparked debate. Reformers claim that switching pensions back into the UK would fuel growth and finance badly-needed infrastructure. Critics have said it could place savers at risk, or amount to trustees breaching their legal duty to act in members’ best interests. Some executives have even sounded the alarm. The chief executive of Aviva has also recently cautioned against “coercing” pension schemes to invest in Britain, arguing that it was not always the best way to maximize returns.

51793761,581294,1757984409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51793761.jpeg,Solana Price Prediction: September Outlook Brightens as Galaxy Digital Fuels Another Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-price-prediction-september-outlook-brightens-as-galaxy-digital-fuels-another-rally/,"Solana (SOL) continues to command market attention after Galaxy Digital purchased $300 million worth of SOL in 13 transactions across Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit. The digital assets investment firm has now acquired over 6.5 million SOL in the past five days, worth approximately $1.57 billion, according to on-chain data. These purchases come as part of a broader Solana-focused strategy. Galaxy, alongside Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital, recently led a $1.65 billion private placement for Forward Industries. The move places Forward Industries as a key institutional actor in the ecosystem, with Galaxy moving large batches of SOL into custody wallets on Fireblocks, signaling long-term holding intent. Novogratz: “Season of Solana” Begins Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has described the current market phase as the “season of Solana.” He emphasized that faster and cheaper blockchains like Solana are now primed for Wall Street adoption, especially as U.S. regulators hint at modernizing crypto rules. SEC Chair Paul Atkins recently noted that most crypto tokens may fall outside securities law, a stance Novogratz called a “radical departure” from past approaches. He believes this clarity will accelerate institutional adoption, especially for networks like Solana, which offer high throughput and sub-cent transaction costs without relying on Layer 2 scaling solutions. Analysts Eye $300 as Next Solana Target With SOL trading around $233.15, the token has climbed 12% in the past week and over 23% in the past month. Analysts suggest that a breakout above $253 could pave the way toward $272–$300, levels last seen in late 2023. Matt Hougan , CIO at Bitwise, noted that spot Solana ETFs awaiting SEC approval could unleash further inflows by October. He compared the momentum to Bitcoin’s treasury-driven rallies, saying Solana’s unique blend of speed, scalability, and institutional interest could amplify its price trajectory. For now, Solana sits just 16% below its all-time high, with bullish technical indicators supporting the case for another leg upward. If Galaxy’s buying spree continues and regulatory clarity arrives, September could introduce another Solana rally.

XRP Whales Have Sold 160 Million Tokens Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the latest move from the XRP whales. The analyst has cited Santiment’s Supply Distribution indicator, which measures the total amount of the asset’s supply that a given wallet group as a whole is holding right now. Whales are defined as addresses carrying between 1 million and 10 million tokens of the cryptocurrency. At the current exchange rate, the range converts to about $2.99 million at the lower end and $29.9 million at the upper end. Thus, only the market participants with a substantial amount of capital fall in this range. Related Reading: Analyst Sets Bold $1,314 Target For Solana After Cup-And-Handle Breakout These large investors can carry some degree of influence in the market, so their movements can be worth keeping an eye on. One way to do so is through the Supply Distribution. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of the 1 million to 10 million XRP group over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP whales took their supply to a high earlier in the month, but since then, these holders have participated in selling. Interestingly, most of this distribution came as the asset’s rally to the $3.1 level took place. This timing would imply that the whales were using the price surge as an opportunity to take profits and exit from the market. In total, these humongous entities have offloaded 160 million tokens of the cryptocurrency over the last couple of weeks, worth a whopping $486 million right now. The coin has declined since its high, and if selling from the whales continues, it’s possible that the drawdown may extend. From a technical perspective, however, XRP may actually be near a rebound, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges As Whales Scoop Up 181,000 LTC The reason is that the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has just given a reversal signal for the asset. The TD Sequential is an indicator that counts up candles of the same color in an asset’s price chart to identify points of trend exhaustion. Once nine candles are in, it signals that the earlier trend is over and a reversal may be about to occur. From the above chart, it’s visible that XRP has formed a TD Sequential signal with nine red candles on its 4-hour chart, suggesting a bullish turnaround could potentially take place next. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $3.02, down almost 1% over the last 24 hours.
