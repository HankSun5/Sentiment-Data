It’s likely that short-term traders have taken some profits following the market’s rally over the weekend, although most coins are still up in the past seven days. This includes XRP, Pump.fun and Hyperliquid, which are all showing strong momentum despite correcting a little today. But if the FOMC does cut rates later this week, they could all rebound strongly, bringing traders more profits. Crypto Price Prediction Today 15 September XRP ($XRP): Ripple Expansion Means Altcoin Could Be Biggest Winner of Bull Market It’s down by 3.5% today, but XRP remains one of the most bullish tokens in the top-100 by quite some margin. At $2.98, it remains up by 1.5% in a week and by 6% in a fortnight, although it is down by 5% in the past month. This monthly decline is arguably bullish, however, since it indicates that XRP is due to correct upwards in the near future. Its chart also invites this suspicion, given that its had yet to reach an overbought position prior to its decline today. Source: TradingView In other words, today likely represents a blip within a medium-term upswing, which could get into motion as and when the much-hoped-for rate cut arrives on Wednesday. More fundamentally, XRP is in a great position to ride any end-of-year bull rally, given Ripple’s encouraging growth in recent weeks. It has signed partnerships with major banks , made important acquisitions, and also expanded into Dubai and Africa, so the future looks very bright for the firm. In view of this, the XRP price could hit $3.50 by the end of the month, and close 2025 at over $5. Pump.fun ($PUMP): Growth of Launchpad Could Push New Token to Record Highs by End of Week PUMP is currently priced at $0.007989, which marks a 1.5% loss today, having set a new ATH of $0.008819 within the past 24 hours. The altcoin is also up by an astonishing 129% in a month, making it one of the best-performing tokens in the market across this timeframe. And fundamentally, PUMP is in a strong position, given that Pump.fun remains the biggest token launchpad on Solana, with 8 million unique active wallets in the past month , as well as a volume of $1 billion. Looking at its chart, its indicators suggest that it may be close to peaking, yet it’s also possible that the FOMC meeting later this week could give it a second wind. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) has bounced up again after dipping from 80 over the weekend, suggesting that it has momentum left to spare. Some whales are continuing to invest more deeply in PUMP , despite the possibility that it could peak soon, indicating confidence in its long-term prospects. It has already bounced within the past hour, so we could see it testing new highs later in the week, potentially passing $0.0950 by the weekend. Hyperliquid ($HYPE): Altcoin Hitting New Highs As Native DEX Platform Continues to Grow HYPE has declined by 1.5% today, but its current price of $53.51 marks a 5% gain in a week, with the coin hitting a new ATH over the weekend. Hyperliquid is another token that has the advantage of having a strong platform behind it, with the Hyperliquid DEX now boasting a total value locked in of $2.6 billion . This makes it the eighth-biggest platform in crypto in terms of TVL, and its on-chain value only continues to grow. For this reason, we can expect the Hyperliquid price to keep climbing in the medium- and long-term. Source: TradingView Its indicators suggest that it may also be close to peaking, but given that the wider market is entering a bullish phase, it could continue to rise into Q4. We could therefore see the HYPE price reach $75 by the end of the month, $100 by the end of October, and $150 by 2026. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): L2 Network Raises $16 Million As Launch Quickly Approaches The crypto price prediction for these 3 tokens is very positive right now, but the incoming bull market will also see many other coins outperforming averages. This is likely to include presale tokens, with one of the most exciting presale coins right now being Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new L2 project for Bitcoin . Bitcoin, but faster. Introducing Bitcoin Hyper: the Layer-2 that brings speed & scalability back to BTC. pic.twitter.com/tPe1eQmYWv — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 14, 2025 Bitcoin Hyper has raised $16 million in its ongoing presale, with investors excited by its plans to launch a true layer-two network for Bitcoin. In its role as an L2, it will offer low transaction fees and fast confirmation times, provide an ecosystem in which BTC holders can put their holdings to work. It’s aiming to become a DeFi and trading layer for Bitcoin, tapping into its network’s huge value, and providing Bitcoin holders with opportunities to make additional profits. Using Solana’s Virtual Machine and zero-knowledge rollups, it will provide an unparalleled level of scalability and security. Its native token, HYPER, will be necessary to pay transaction fees, so it could witness lots of demand once the network launches. Investors can join its sale by heading over to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as MetaMask or Best Wallet. HYPER now costs $0.012925, but this will rise repeatedly as the sale progresses.

The Solana price is still drawing eyes, Chainlink is making headlines, but experts argue that only Remittix is positioned as the best crypto to buy now in Q3. With its wallet beta launch imminent, a $250,000 giveaway live, and a 15 per cent referral program already paying out daily in USDT, the window to act is closing. Find out more in this article. Solana Price Performance and Outlook Solana price is floating at around $246.91, which is an indicator of an unexpected stability in the market where there is volatility. Its blazing-fast blockchain and minimal gas charges are appreciated by analysts, which spur developers and DeFi projects need. In the recent past, there has been the deployment of new platforms on the network of Solana increasing the liquidity and adoption. However, as the Solana price looks healthy, traders are undecided whether the next upward move will be robust or temporary. Predictions are optimistic so long as the ecosystem continues to grow, although the gain might be limited relative to smaller tokens that have higher growth potential. Chainlink’s Latest Developments and Market Impact The latest Chainlink news has kept its token in the spotlight. Integrations across DeFi continue to multiply, reinforcing its position as the industry’s leading decentralized oracle provider. Secure data feeds are now more critical than ever, and Chainlink is a name institutions trust to deliver. As positive as these developments are, some question whether Chainlink has already priced in much of its growth. Why Remittix Stands Out As Best Crypto To Buy Now This is where Remittix changes the game. Unlike Solana and Chainlink, Remittix is targeting a global market worth trillions of dollars. It is not about speculation, it is about solving payments for businesses, freelancers, and everyday users. Remittix has sold over 662 million tokens, raised more than 25.6 million dollars, and is priced at just $0.1080. A BitMart listing was locked in after the 20 million milestone, LBANK followed after 22 million, and a third CEX is on deck. Momentum is undeniable. With the wallet beta launching on September 15 and a massive $250,000 giveaway underway, the race to accumulate RTX has never been hotter. Analysts are already calling it the best crypto to buy now , and for good reason: • RTX is solving a real world 19 trillion dollar payments problem. • Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries. • The tokenomics are deflationary and designed for long term growth. • Project momentum is accelerating ahead of the beta launch. • The referral program pays 15 percent in USDT, claimable daily via the dashboard. Every signal points to scarcity. The market is tightening, listings are lining up, and demand is accelerating. Investors who wait risk watching the value slip away to early movers. Remittix is not another speculative play. It is a payments solution backed by tech, listings, and adoption. That is why experts rank it as the best crypto to buy now, and why buyers are rushing in before the wallet launch activates its utility.

In a thread posted on September 12 and expanded over the weekend, analyst Nik Patel (@cointradernik) said the current positioning backdrop “is less like March and Dec ’24 crossovers and more like Dec ’23,” warning that the market is set up for a “multi-week whipsaw going into early/mid Oct.” He added a specific liquidation map: “Give me $1.5bn in shorts liqs on the weekly and then $2.8bn of long liqs into Oct 7th pls.” pic.twitter.com/LVsY4bU99o — Nik (@cointradernik) September 12, 2025 What Is Different This Time For Bitcoin? What makes this setup different, in his view, is the balance between spot and derivatives flows and the breadth of basis trades. “Spot vol as % of total vol [is] lower here than prior crossovers for Others OI vs BTC OI (March ’24 and Dec ’24),” he wrote, arguing that if spot demand were truly in the driver’s seat “we should expect spot vol as a % of total vol to be higher not lower.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Above Mid-Term Holder Breakeven – Is A Fresh Rally Brewing? Instead, he sees “a combination of basis trade across a broader range of markets than just BTC & ETH but also more directional levered shorts than prior occasions,” with the immediate “upside risk… even greater for a short liq cascade first.” Funding, he noted, is “benign” relative to those earlier peaks. Real-time funding data broadly corroborate the “benign” characterization. Across major venues, BTC perpetual funding hovered close to flat in recent sessions—generally in the +0.005% to +0.01% per-8-hour range—well below the overheated prints typical of euphoric tops. That keeps the door open to a squeeze without the need to first unwind extreme long leverage. Sentiment, Nik argued, is still closer to “disbelief” than euphoria. He contrasted March 2024’s ETF frenzy and December 2024’s post-election optimism with today’s more skeptical tone, pointing to a still-elevated pool of sidelined capital. “Both prior crossovers had stablecoin dominance trough at 5% ish. We are currently at 6.1% — imo this is textbook disbelief/Sidelined September positioning,” he wrote. In his base case, that war chest ultimately fuels year-end risk-taking once the whipsaw plays out: “We will almost certainly get the positioning whipsaw and bear trap during that quarterly end & monthly open window of weakness, but there are a lot more stables ready to be deployed here into year-end.” In a self-aware aside, Nik even shared a machine-generated distillation of his view: “ChatGPT coming to a similar conclusion here after I fed all these charts in, idk if that inspires confidence or concern about my view though lol.” Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is A Strong Buy If It Overcomes $118K — Here’s Why ChatGPT wrote: “Past crossovers: signaled end-phase altseason blowoffs, fueled by euphoric longs with no dry powder left. This crossover: signals pre-phase potential — leverage is already there, but it’s balanced/shorter, with capital still on the sidelines (stables). This is why the funding differential is so important: • High funding + low stables = top-like conditions. Low funding + high stables = squeeze-ready conditions.” Renowned crypto analyst CRG (@MacroCRG) consented: “Agree with him that a big short liq event is likely before a big long liq event still lots of positioning to unwind imo from ppl expecting a bearish September. In saying that, would like the coins to bounce soon, many are at/near key pivots.” As ever with path-dependent derivatives tape, the trigger matters. Nik cautioned that a “massive short liquidation event” in the coming week could flip the script if it invites “late longs” and spikes funding into October. But absent that sudden shift, his base case remains a two-step: an upside liquidation cascade that resets shorts, followed by a rug-pull on over-eager longs into the October 7 window. Traders watching for confirmation will focus on whether funding stays contained as price lifts, whether spot participation actually broadens rather than fades, and whether stablecoin deployment reduces the cash cushion he cites. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $114,852.

Over the weekend, the address acquired 3,976 ETH worth approximately $18.9 million, according to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence. The purchase was executed using 18.9 million DAI, a stablecoin, and split across multiple transactions before being consolidated into the buy. The transaction came just as Ethereum broke above $4,700, marking its highest level in more than two weeks. Currently, ETH trades at $4,538, down 2.9% in the past 24 hours. A Pattern of Bold Acquisitions This is not the first time the wallet has made waves. In July, it bought 4,863 ETH for $12.6 million and later added 649 ETH at $3,562 per token. Just last month, the same wallet scooped up $8 million worth of Solana (SOL), though that position has since slipped below entry price. Analysts say the strategy shows deliberate fund consolidation, often seen in money laundering tactics. Breaking transactions into smaller amounts and using privacy tools allows the hacker to mask movements, making tracking more difficult. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT previously estimated that the Coinbase-related social engineering scam drained at least $330 million from victims, warning that the real figure may be significantly higher. Growing Concerns Over Rising Crypto Hacks The latest Ethereum purchase shows broader concerns in the crypto industry, where hack-related losses reached $163 million in August alone, according to security firm PeckShield. With exploits shifting from smart contract bugs to social engineering and cross-chain bridge vulnerabilities, wallets like this continue to pose a major threat to investor confidence. Despite Coinbase offering a $20 million reward for information on the perpetrators and tightening security, the hacker remains unidentified. The latest $19M ETH grab proves the resilience and boldness of cybercriminals operating in the space. As crypto rallies and institutional inflows grow, the question remains: is the hacker simply riding bullish momentum, or is this part of a deeper strategy to launder stolen funds? Regulators and blockchain investigators are watching closely, but for now, the crypto world is left with more questions than answers.

Popular with retail investors, the trading platform revealed it filed plans with regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for this new fund dubbed Robinhood Ventures Fund I. Robinhood makes a shift towards inclusive venture capital According to the firm, the fund is meant to democratize access to private startups and potentially shape how everyday retail investors participate in high growth opportunities that have for long been a preserve of the elite – venture capital firms, institutions and the ultra-wealthy. This move also comes on the backdrop of rising interest in private markets where valuations have surged due to AI and digital innovations. Data cited by Robinhood’s newsroom post on Robinhood Newsroom shows that the number of listed domestic firms in the US has decreased, pushing more capital into private entities that often yield outsized returns for institutional players. “For decades, wealthy people and institutions have invested in private companies while retail investors have been unfairly locked out,” said Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev in a statement. “With Robinhood Ventures, everyday people will be able to invest in opportunities once reserved for the elite.” Tenev. If SEC approves the Robinhood Ventures Fund I, it will subsequently list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker RVI. According to a statement, its shares will be accessible to the public via various brokerages among them Robinhood’s own platform. The fund is expected to focus on investing in “a concentrated portfolio of private companies at the frontiers of their respective industries,” according to Robinhood. The Monday announcement is the latest in a series of strategic expansions by Robinhood as it recently coveted a spot on the S&P 500 and introduced a new social media feature known as Robinhood Social within its app during the past two weeks alone. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , the social media app will roll out next year with a select group of customers having invitations before rolling out to all users. The new fund aligns with the firm’s ecosystem The fund announcement also comes following the firm’s and controversial entry into tokenized equities in Europe, which offered exposure to private giants like the ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SpaceX. This initiative attracted criticism from OpenAI and scrutiny from European regulators, highlighting the complexities of innovating in the private market space. The filing also underscores the firm’s aggressive pivot from its origins as a commission-free stock trading app towards a more “diversified, multilane financial platform,” a transformation which has been significantly powered by the firm’s booming cryptocurrency business. Earlier this year, the firm revealed that transaction based revenues had climbed 77% year-over0year, largely driven by crypto trading. Its second quarter earnings also highlighted this momentum as revenue from crypto products surged 98% year-over-year to $160 million. According to the firm, total crypto trading volumes reached $35 billion. This growth, Robinhood said, was substantially driven by the June acquisition of the veteran European crypto exchange Bitstamp, which brought with it over 50 regulatory licenses and accounted for $7 billion in trading volume in second quarter alone from its institutional client base. Now, the introduction of the Robinhood Ventures Fund I marks a direct challenge to the traditional structures of private equity and represents a significant step in the company’s stated mission “to democratize finance for all.” Market watchers have also noted that this fund could lower barriers for retail investors, who have historically been left out due to high minimum investments and accreditation requirements. A report by WealthManagement.com shows how the fund, pending approval by SEC will enable ordinary users to gain exposure to startups before they can go public, potentially through tokenized assets or direct equity stakes.

Ever since SHIB’s legendary rally in 2021, investors have been searching for signs of another breakout moment. With its community-driven growth, the expansion of its Shibarium Layer 2 network, and broader developments in the meme coin sector, the question lingers: is SHIB preparing for its next big surge? At the same time, new entrants such as Layer Brett (LBRETT) are shifting the narrative, offering utility-backed alternatives that may influence how traders view meme tokens going forward. The current state of Shiba Inu Right now, Shiba Inu price prediction discussions focus on volatility, supply, and adoption. SHIB trades near $0.000014 , with a market capitalization in the $7–8 billion range . While far below its October 2021 all-time high of $0.00008845 , analysts note that new network developments could support a rebound. Shibarium, SHIB’s own Layer 2 solution, has introduced lower fees and faster transactions, a crucial element for long-term sustainability. These upgrades form the backbone of a more optimistic Shiba Inu price prediction. Still, headwinds remain: token supply remains enormous, transaction activity fluctuates, and competition from emerging meme coins is growing. Layer Brett: A rising contender While SHIB continues to capture attention, Layer Brett has become part of the same conversation. Its presale recently crossed $3.6 million , with tokens priced at $0.0058 Unlike many meme coins, Layer Brett is built as a Layer 2 solution on Ethereum, designed for scalability, speed, and low-cost transactions. For those tracking the Shiba Inu price prediction, Layer Brett presents a useful point of comparison. Where SHIB relies heavily on community strength and branding, Layer Brett layers in technical innovation, claiming gas fees as low as $0.0001 and offering staking rewards through its dApp. By combining meme appeal with utility, it is carving a different trajectory in the meme coin market. Comparing Forecasts: SHIB vs. Layer Brett A realistic Shiba Inu price prediction requires examining community behavior, on-chain activity, and network growth. Optimistic analysts suggest SHIB could double in price if Shibarium gains wider adoption. Others caution that without a major catalyst, SHIB may stay range-bound. Either way, its future rests on more than hype—it needs functional traction. In contrast, Layer Brett’s forecasts lean on its presale dynamics and tokenomics. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens and high staking incentives for early adopters, it attracts a different kind of speculation. Many commentators now mention Layer Brett in the same breath as the Shiba Inu price prediction, highlighting how new entrants may influence market sentiment. Conclusion The Shiba Inu price prediction remains a key topic in the meme coin sector. For SHIB, the path to another historic rally depends on adoption of Shibarium, reductions in transaction costs, and ongoing community engagement. For investors, this means keeping a close watch on SHIB’s technical developments as well as external market sentiment. Layer Brett, meanwhile, offers a contrasting approach—utility-driven growth layered onto meme culture. Its presale strength, low gas fees, and staking rewards give it momentum of its own. For some traders, balancing exposure between SHIB and Layer Brett could provide a hedge between history and innovation.

Japanese financial giant Credit Saison has just announced the launch of an ambitious blockchain fund , signaling a powerful new wave of institutional interest in the digital asset space. This move isn’t just about investing; it’s about pioneering the future of finance, specifically targeting the burgeoning real-world asset (RWA) sector. What is Onigiri Capital and its Blockchain Fund Focus? Credit Saison’s new venture, aptly named Onigiri Capital, is set to deploy up to $50 million into innovative startups. This dedicated blockchain fund will primarily concentrate on companies building solutions within the Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization domain. Imagine transforming traditional assets like real estate, commodities, or even intellectual property into digital tokens on a blockchain. This is precisely where Onigiri Capital sees immense potential. Investment Size: Up to $50 million. Primary Focus: Startups in the Real-World Asset (RWA) sector. Goal: Drive innovation and adoption of tokenized assets. Why Are Real-World Assets Crucial for a Blockchain Fund? The RWA sector is gaining incredible traction, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). Tokenizing RWAs offers numerous advantages, fundamentally changing how we perceive and interact with assets: Increased Liquidity: Assets that were once illiquid can be traded more easily on global markets. Fractional Ownership: Allows smaller investors to own a piece of high-value assets, democratizing access. Transparency: Blockchain records provide an immutable and transparent ownership trail, enhancing trust. Accessibility: Global access to investment opportunities, breaking down geographical barriers. Credit Saison’s strategic decision to focus its blockchain fund here highlights a forward-thinking approach, recognizing the massive untapped value in digitizing tangible and intangible assets. This move positions them at the forefront of financial innovation. Japan’s Growing Embrace of Blockchain Innovation This launch by Credit Saison isn’t an isolated event; it reflects a broader trend in Japan. The nation has been increasingly open to exploring blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, albeit with a cautious regulatory stance. Financial institutions are now actively looking for ways to integrate this technology into their core businesses. A dedicated blockchain fund from a firm of Credit Saison’s stature could inspire other traditional players to follow suit, further accelerating institutional adoption in Asia. The establishment of Onigiri Capital demonstrates a clear commitment to fostering growth in the Web3 ecosystem, particularly within a regulated financial framework. This institutional backing provides much-needed credibility and capital for promising startups, helping them scale and innovate. Navigating the Challenges and Seizing the Benefits of a Blockchain Fund While the potential of a blockchain fund focused on RWAs is immense, challenges certainly exist. Regulatory clarity, technological scalability, and market acceptance are all factors that need careful navigation. However, the benefits for early movers like Credit Saison are substantial: Pioneering Position: Establishing leadership in a rapidly evolving and competitive market. Diversification: Adding a new, high-growth asset class to their portfolio, reducing overall risk. Innovation Driver: Fostering new technologies that can benefit their existing financial services and create new revenue streams. Credit Saison’s move is a powerful statement about the future of finance, indicating a definitive shift towards a more digitized, transparent, and accessible financial system globally. This strategic investment solidifies their role as an innovator.

But moving away from Siberia and the North Caucuses is presenting miners with a new set of problems, media outlets in the nation have reported. Per a report from the Russian newspaper Vedomosti Yug , the B2B electrical equipment platform TenderPro has compiled a top 10 of areas where demand for crypto mining rigs and other related equipment is highest. Topping the table were Moscow and the Moscow Oblast (the region surrounding the capital). This area is now responsible for 21.9% of mining hardware purchases. Russian Crypto Miners: Relocating to Bigger Cities? The figure for the capital dwarfed demand figures (6.7%) in the Siberian oblast of Irkutsk. The latter is the birthplace of the Russian Bitcoin mining industry. A Russian crypto mining-related facility. (Source: Artemy Lebedev/VK) However, mining in much of Irkutsk is now illegal. Those mining farms that do have the right to operate in the Siberian region already reportedly “near full capacity.” The drift toward urban centers appears to be real: St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region took third spot with 4.7%. Krasnodar Krai, in the southwestern part of the North Caucasus region, took fourth place. Krasnodar is Russia’s third most populous federal subject. Kuban, also in the North Caucasus, rounded out the top five. The Total Hash Rate for the Bitcoin network over the past 12 months. (Source: Blockchain.com) The platform calculated that overall demand for mining equipment from commercial enterprises in the Russian South fell by 19.3% over the first eight months of 2025. A ‘Market Correction’ Olga Gorchitsyna, TenderPro’s Director of Digital Products Development, said that this fall in demand may be attributable to a market correction. She suggested that the Kremlin’s decision last year to legalize the crypto mining sector may have caused an exceptional spike in demand. Gorchitsyna explained: “A year ago, after the legalization of industrial mining, we saw a sharp increase in demand for crypto mining equipment. However, since the beginning of this year, the excitement around the sector has gradually begun to subside.” Russian prosecutors are targeting Denis Shtengelov's KDV Group, one of the country’s largest snack producers, for expropriation https://t.co/Ahk6oLYrm8 — Bloomberg (@business) September 15, 2025 In previous years, crypto miners made a beeline for the Northern Caucasus and Southern Siberia , attracted mainly to these areas’ famously low energy prices. But these areas are traditionally sparsely populated, meaning their generally more moderst power generation capabilities can easily be overloaded. The introduction of seasonal bans and police crackdowns on illegal miners in these regions has scared off many industrial miners. The statistics, it appears, now indicate that miners are preferring to set up shop in areas where power shortages are rare, and other mining firms are few and far between. Noise Concerns However, moving into the more densely populated European part of Russia is posting a new challenge for some Russian miners, as well as their international backers. Russia revives barter trade to dodge Western sanctions https://t.co/QnvdRaS1NU https://t.co/QnvdRaS1NU — Reuters (@Reuters) September 15, 2025 Some 260km southeast of Moscow, in the village of Kiritsy, Ryazan Region, a mining firm named Integral has faced a backlash after launching a crypto mining facility. The village has a population of over 3,000 people, who have complained bitterly about high noise levels since the firm turned on its rigs in April this year. Per the Ryazan branch of Top 24 News , Rospotrebnadzor, the Russian federal well-being and consumer rights agency, ordered Integral to suspend its operations for 30 days. The agency acted after residents complained that noise levels from the facility were rising above 50 decibels. Kiritsy residents said they were suffering from “headaches, hearing loss, and a general deterioration in health.” Watchdog Steps In, Russian Crypto Miners Face New Problems? Rospotrebnadzor told Integral it must install special equipment that will help suppress the noise. The firm has brought in “specialists from China” who will help install equipment aimed at reducing the farm’s noise levels. In August, Argumenti y Facti reported that residents say the mining facility uses gas piston turbine generators. One resident explained: “Two of these turbines are currently operational. But there are plans to install 20 more. These two turbines have already created unbearable living conditions for people here. It’s frightening to even imagine what will happen when there are 22 of them here.” Kiritsy residents complained that the turbine generators are “no more than 500 meters away” from some of their houses. They added that the village is home to a children’s tuberculosis healthcare center, where young people from all over the country come for treatment.

Behind every profitable trade lies a framework of discipline, consistency, and repeatable actions. In a market as volatile as digital assets, the traders who last are the ones who develop daily habits that keep them focused while others get distracted by noise. From Bitcoin whales to altcoin scalpers, veterans share a common truth: habits compound into results. In 2025, with ETFs driving institutional flows and altcoins preparing for their next cycle, the ability to sharpen habits may be the greatest edge a trader can have. Alongside proven methods, new opportunities are also entering conversations, one of them being MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could deliver 45× returns before major listings. Habit 1: Structured market research The first thing successful traders do daily is check the markets, but not just prices. They track macroeconomic events, ETF flows, on-chain data, and sentiment. By starting each day with structured research, they avoid reacting emotionally to sudden moves. Tools like CoinMarketCap, CryptoQuant, and Santiment provide context, whether it’s whale accumulation, exchange inflows, or funding rate shifts. This data-driven approach means they act from strategy, not impulse. Habit 2: Journaling trades A trading journal might sound old-fashioned, but it’s one of the most powerful tools for improvement. Successful traders log every position, entry, exit, rationale, and outcome. Over time, this builds a personal database that reveals patterns: strengths to lean on and weaknesses to avoid. Many beginners skip this step, but those who keep journals learn faster and cut losses earlier. As one professional once said, “Markets repeat themselves, your journal shows you how.” Habit 3: Mindset and discipline Psychology is half the battle. Top traders practice patience, emotional discipline, and resilience. They avoid revenge trading after losses and don’t let FOMO drive entries. Many have daily routines outside of charts, exercise, meditation, or reading, that sharpen focus. By grounding themselves, they bring stability into a market defined by chaos. This same principle of discipline applies to spotting new opportunities, where MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. With forecasts calling for a 45× move , the token is stirring global crypto communities. What makes MAGACOIN different is its balance of structure and energy. Traders describe it as the rare presale that blends smart tokenomics with cultural firepower, turning it into more than hype, it’s strategy in motion. Just as good habits compound in trading, presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE compound through momentum, and that synergy is why so many are watching closely. Habit 4: Continuous education Markets evolve, and traders evolve with them. The best spend at least 30–60 minutes a day studying new concepts: ETF mechanics, Layer-2 rollups, DeFi strategies, or simply reviewing macroeconomic reports. Crypto is one of the fastest-moving industries in finance; those who stop learning fall behind. Successful traders treat education as part of their routine, not an afterthought. Habit 5: Risk management rituals Every day, top traders reassess their risk. They set clear stop-loss levels, calculate position sizes, and ensure their exposure aligns with their capital plan. The traders who survive crashes are not the ones with the highest win rates, but the ones who never let a single loss wipe them out. Risk management isn’t glamorous, but it is the lifeline of every profitable career in crypto. Habit 6: Networking and community Crypto trading is no longer a solo sport. The best traders exchange ideas in private groups, Telegram channels, and Discord communities. They test strategies, share data, and learn from collective insights. Being part of a strong network keeps them updated and accountable. It also helps them spot early narratives, whether it’s ETF approvals, presale momentum, or altcoin rotations, that others miss until it’s too late. Habit 7: Reviewing and refining At the end of each day, successful traders review their performance. Did they stick to their plan? Did emotions interfere? Were entries timed correctly? This self-audit, repeated daily, builds discipline. It transforms trading from guesswork into a process. Over months and years, this refinement compounds into mastery. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is on Every Trader’s Radar Massive Upside Potential: Analysts are calling for up to 45× gains , giving it the kind of asymmetric return profile traders dream of. Deflationary Design: A scarcity-driven model ensures supply pressure favors early participants as the presale tightens. Balanced Strategy: Unlike hype-only plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE blends disciplined tokenomics with cultural firepower, making it both structured and energetic. Timing Advantage: Arriving before major exchange listings, it offers first-mover exposure that seasoned traders value for maximum upside. Conclusion: habits create longevity The crypto market rewards those who prepare, not those who gamble. The traders who thrive in 2025 are those who commit to daily habits: research, journaling, risk control, learning, and emotional discipline. These small steps add up to extraordinary results when applied consistently. At the same time, new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, forecasted for a potential 45× surge, are reminding traders that discipline isn’t just about risk; it’s also about recognizing projects with huge growth potential on time. For anyone aiming to trade successfully, combining solid habits with timely opportunities may be the most powerful strategy of all.

Remittix(RTX) , already being called “XRP 2.0,” is riding its own momentum with a 15% USDT referral program, a $250,000 giveaway, and the wallet beta launching in 24 hours, the first working product in the Remittix ecosystem. With XRP pushing toward $4 from just under $0.10, comparisons are everywhere. Will XRP’s newfound strength hold as Remittix sets the stage for its own breakout? XRP Price Prediction: Ripple’s Path to $4 Recent XRP price action shows strength. After clearing resistance near $3.01, XRP is setting up for further gains according to chart signals. Large wallet addresses have been steadily adding to their holdings, on-chain activity confirms growing participation from smaller investors, and technical analysts now view $3.66 as the next area that could attract strong buying interest. Even so, overhead barriers between $3.50 and $4 are expected to act as a real test. Catalysts such as approval of exchange-traded funds or more clarity from regulators could be what finally drives momentum past that zone. How Remittix Compares and Stands Out While XRP aims for $4, Remittix is already turning heads. Unlike XRP, whose strength depends on long-standing networks and regulatory wins, Remittix is being designed as an altcoin with working product features from the start. Its referral rewards, live utility, and near-term launch set it apart. On the funding side, Remittix has already sold more than 662 million tokens at $0.1080 each and raised over $25.6 million. Importantly, the project secured a BitMart listing right after surpassing $20 million raised, then announced an LBANK listing once the $22 million level was cleared, and is now preparing a third CEX. These milestones show how investor demand is translating into global exchange traction at a pace rarely seen in early-stage projects. Check what makes Remittix special right now: Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries Global payout rails are integrated already and expanding The project is audited by CertiK, which builds trust and transparency Early believers are already calling it “XRP 2.0” It is built for adoption, not speculation Comparing XRP’s Surge and Remittix’s Rise XRP is carving a path toward $4, pushing past key resistance and riding on institutional momentum and partnership news. Remittix, dubbed “XRP 2.0,” is not just whispering, it is building. Remittix is blending utility, community rewards, and real product rollout in a way that sets it apart. XRP may be closer to mainstream adoption and proven infrastructure, but Remittix is sprinting ahead in terms of early-stage opportunity. For those tracking XRP price prediction, keep one eye on Ripple’s charts. For those seeking high growth from low entry, Remittix offers something very different.

Analyst Projects $20+ In October 2025,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrps-biggest-rally-yet-analyst-projects-20-in-october-2025/,"XRP is trading close to $3 and has struggled to hold that level in recent sessions. According to a market analyst, a repeat of a past pattern tied to Bitcoin halvings could push XRP much higher, with a possible cycle top above $20 on Oct. 17, 2025. The timeline ties back to earlier halving cycles and a short lag that, she argues, has repeated before. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Odds, Jumps 21% Even As ETF Debut Gets Pushed Back Halving Dates And Follow-On Moves Based on reports, crypto expert Diana points to the 2016–2017 cycle as the clearest example. Bitcoin halved on July 9, 2016, and then reached a peak above $19,000 on Dec. 18, 2017 — 525 days later. XRP, she notes, followed with its high of $3.31 on Jan. 5, 2018, around 18 days after Bitcoin’s top. That sequence — Bitcoin first, XRP soon after — is central to her case. 🚨 XRP TO $15–$20? HISTORY SAYS OCT 2025 IS THE DATE ⏳🔥 History, math, and the end of SEC suppression all point to one window: mid-October 2025. This could be XRP’s most savage run yet — let’s break it down. 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/RJ6Z85b6pz — Diana (@InvestWithD) September 4, 2025 Losing Steam, Legal Pressure The pattern did not hold in the next cycle. Bitcoin halved on May 11, 2020, and then topped near $69,000 on Nov. 10, 2021, about 545 days later. XRP did not mirror that run. Reports show XRP hit $1.95 in April 2021, several months earlier than Bitcoin’s peak, after legal pressure and exchange delistings constrained its move. Diana describes that episode as a lost cycle for the token. Regulatory Clarity And Product Growth According to reports, the legal cloud around XRP eased after a July 2023 court outcome that cleared major parts of XRP’s past sales from being labeled as securities. Exchanges in the US resumed listings, and Ripple has been building out products like RLUSD and new payment corridors. Diana says those developments, together with multiple ETF filings, improve XRP’s chances this time. She puts forward three price scenarios: a modest run to $5–$7 if Bitcoin’s momentum is modest; a base case of $10–$15 assuming ETF inflows and stronger use cases; and a blow-off rally that could push XRP past $20 if big institutional liquidity arrives. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out With A 32% Surge: Time To Buy Or Too Late To Chase? XRP Forecasts Split: $12.25 Target Vs. Modest Growth Outlook Meanwhile, Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered expects XRP’s rally to continue, saying the token could take on a larger role in international finance. He also points to future XRP ETFs as a catalyst that could draw more investors. Kendrick places his price target at $12.25 by 2029, which would mean a 300%+ jump from today’s $2.95 and translate into annualized returns of about 43%. That outlook, however, is far from universal. Morningstar analysts forecast the broader crypto market to grow close to 10% per year through 2034, a rate in line with historical stock market performance.

According to on-chain data, the exchange’s cold wallets now hold only a fraction of the XRP they once did, and the decline is now more than 90%. This comes at a time when the XRP community has been closely monitoring institutional activity, with growing rumors of BlackRock and other heavyweight firms quietly building exposure to XRP. Coinbase’s XRP Holdings Crash By 90% Recent moves by Coinbase with its XRP holdings have taken most crypto investors by surprise. Previous data showed that Coinbase, which was once the fifth-largest holder of XRP, has trimmed its XRP reserve balance from approximately 780.13 million XRP to 199.47 million. This was a cutback of about 69% in its holdings since the second quarter of 2025. However, on-chain data tracked by the @XRPwallets account on the social media platform X shows that Coinbase hasn’t stepped back from slashing its XRP holdings. As recently revealed by @XRPwallets, Coinbase now has just six cold wallets holding about 16.5 million XRP each. This leaves the US-based exchange with an estimated 99 million XRP in total. By comparison, the exchange had 52 cold wallets as recently as June 9, with 10 wallets holding 26.8 million XRP each and another 42 wallets holding 16.8 million XRP each. Combined, that amounted to nearly 970 million XRP under Coinbase’s control. In other words, the most recent numbers mean that Coinbase has shed about 90% of its XRP reserves within the past three months. Such a strong reduction in the movement of XRP away from Coinbase has been linked to accumulation into institutional wallets in anticipation of the launch of a Spot XRP ETF in the US. It also corresponds with previous reports about BlackRock’s indirect involvement with XRP through Coinbase’s custodial services. What Does This Mean For XRP? The scale of outflows from Coinbase’s XRP reserves has taken many crypto investors by surprise, as seen by comments on social media platforms. For instance, XRPwallets hinted at the possibility of these huge movements being linked to BlackRock. An account on the social media platform X, known as Stern Drew , suggested that Coinbase’s sell-offs go with a deliberate strategy to suppress XRP’s price. This was met with a firm rejection by pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who was quick to push back on the manipulation claims. Although there has been no official confirmation, the most plausible explanation of these large XRP exits is mostly linked to the eventual launch of an XRP ETF. The odds of the SEC accepting an XRP ETF in 2025 are now at a 94% chance on Polymarket . Bloomberg analysts also place the odds at a 90% chance or higher. Large institutions could be accumulating XRP in anticipation of such a product, and the reduced supply on exchanges could contribute to buying pressure even before it is launched. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3, down by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.",XRP|BlackRock|coinbase|Polymarket|Spot XRP ETF|Stern Drew|US SEC|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-16 00:00:46

AllInCrypto (@RealAllinCrypto), a well-respected analyst, recently highlighted this research in a video on X, connecting Ripple and BlackRock through one of the most senior figures in digital assets today. Mitchnick’s career includes a period at Ripple before joining BlackRock in February 2018. At the time of his move, he co-authored a research report analyzing digital assets and their potential valuations. The analyst stressed that this document is significant not only for Bitcoin but also for XRP. According to him, it provided numerical scenarios that many in the community have overlooked. BlackRock's Managing Director, Robert Mitchnick, researched future possible trajectories of $BTC and $XRP . A price target of $32.91 was given to XRP based on legitimate value propositions. pic.twitter.com/hgnbFLfv1N — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) September 14, 2025 High Price Targets for XRP AllInCrypto explained that Mitchnick’s report modeled potential success and failure cases for XRP, with the double-digit estimate for the asset’s future price. According to his explanation, the same report set a low estimate of $6.37, still well above XRP’s current trading level. The report then narrowed the forecast into what it called a fundamental value range. “The resulting fundamental value range of between $1.59 to $8.23” was reached after assigning a 25% probability to the success case, with the failure case assuming XRP would be worth nothing. He contrasted this with XRP’s trading range of $0.49 to $3.72 at the time of publication. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 BlackRock Connection Adds Weight AllInCrypto emphasized the importance of Mitchnick’s role today. He noted that the same individual who contributed to that report now holds one of the most senior digital asset positions in global finance. Mitchnick has been at BlackRock for a long time, and AllInCrypto stated that the continuity of his influence makes the earlier valuations more noteworthy. While BlackRock has not filed specifically for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , its presence in the digital asset space has grown considerably. The fact that the firm’s digital asset strategy is overseen by a former Ripple employee has created natural interest around XRP among investors and market commentators. The analyst placed Mitchnick’s XRP estimates alongside his earlier views on Bitcoin. At the time of publication, the report suggested that Bitcoin was undervalued, with its trading range compressed relative to projected long-term value. By linking these assessments, AllInCrypto argued that the high estimate of $32.91 should be taken seriously.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a crucial barometer for market sentiment, currently stands at 52. This score places it squarely in neutral territory, a slight dip from yesterday but a consistent signal of balanced investor emotions. But what does this mean for your crypto strategy, and why should you pay attention to this single number? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is designed to help investors gauge the overall sentiment dominating the cryptocurrency market. It’s a powerful tool that quantifies emotions, moving from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). When the market is in ""Extreme Fear,"" it often suggests potential buying opportunities, as investors are overly cautious. Conversely, ""Extreme Greed"" might signal an impending correction, as the market could be overheating. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated composite of several key market indicators. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final score, offering a comprehensive snapshot of investor psychology: Volatility (25%): Measures the current market’s price fluctuations and drawdown relative to average values. Higher volatility can indicate fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volume and market momentum, often showing increased activity during periods of greed or panic. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related keywords, gauging public interest and sentiment. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls, providing a direct insight into individual perspectives. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors might be shifting away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to cryptocurrencies, with higher search interest often correlating with speculative greed. What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Score of 52 Imply? A score of 52, as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently shows, signifies a balanced market. It’s neither overwhelmingly fearful nor excessively greedy. This neutral zone suggests that investors are not making rash decisions based on extreme emotions. Instead, there’s a mix of caution and optimism, leading to a more stable environment compared to periods of extreme sentiment. In a neutral market, prices might consolidate, moving sideways without significant upward or downward trends. This can be a time for reflection rather than reaction. It allows investors to assess fundamentals, look for long-term value, and avoid getting swept up in short-term emotional trading. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from the Index Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be incredibly beneficial for your trading and investment decisions. It acts as a counter-indicator for many seasoned traders. Here’s how you might interpret different zones: Extreme Fear (0-24): Often seen as a potential buying opportunity. When others are fearful, smart money might be accumulating. Fear (25-49): A cautious period. Investors might be hesitant, but strong projects could still offer good entry points. Neutral (50-59): This is where we are now. It suggests a time for careful analysis. Avoid impulsive moves. Consider dollar-cost averaging or rebalancing your portfolio. Greed (60-74): A period of increasing optimism. While prices may rise, it’s also a time to be cautious about overextension. Extreme Greed (75-100): Often a signal for potential market tops or corrections. Many investors consider taking profits or reducing exposure during these times. However, it’s crucial to remember that the index is just one tool. It should always be used in conjunction with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a clear understanding of your own risk tolerance. Why the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Matters for Your Strategy This index provides a unique perspective on market psychology, which is a powerful driver of crypto prices. By understanding whether the collective sentiment leans towards fear or greed, you can potentially make more informed decisions. It helps you avoid emotional pitfalls, such as selling during a panic or buying into an unsustainable pump. For long-term investors, a neutral score might mean continuing to build positions steadily. For short-term traders, it might indicate a period of lower volatility, requiring different strategies. The index empowers you to think critically about market conditions rather than simply reacting to price movements. Conclusion: A Balanced Perspective in a Volatile Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently at 52, signals a moment of equilibrium in the often-turbulent crypto market. This neutral stance offers a valuable opportunity for investors to step back, assess their strategies, and make rational choices free from extreme emotional pressure. While not a standalone predictor, this index is an indispensable guide for understanding the underlying sentiment that shapes cryptocurrency valuations. Use it wisely to navigate the digital asset landscape with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index?

Recently, a significant indicator for many investors, the Altcoin Season Index , registered a notable drop. This key metric, provided by CoinMarketCap, now stands at 71, a decrease of two points from yesterday. But what exactly does this number signify for your crypto holdings and the broader market outlook? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index : What Does 71 Really Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool designed to help investors gauge the prevailing sentiment in the crypto market. It’s not just a random number; it’s calculated based on a very specific methodology: It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Crucially, stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from this analysis to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The comparison is made against Bitcoin’s performance over the last 90 days. An official “altcoin season” is declared when a remarkable 75% of these top altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day window. Conversely, if Bitcoin is outperforming the majority, it’s considered a “Bitcoin season.” A reading closer to 100 indicates a strong altcoin season, while a lower number points towards Bitcoin’s dominance. Why Did the Altcoin Season Index Dip to 71? The recent two-point fall in the Altcoin Season Index to 71 suggests a subtle yet important shift in market momentum. While 71 is still above the threshold typically associated with a full Bitcoin season (often considered below 50), it indicates that fewer altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin compared to very recently. This slight decrease could be attributed to several factors: Bitcoin’s Resurgence: Often, when Bitcoin experiences a strong price rally, it tends to pull capital from altcoins, as investors prioritize the perceived safety and liquidity of the leading cryptocurrency. Profit-Taking: After periods of altcoin strength, some investors may be taking profits, rotating back into Bitcoin or stablecoins. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news or global events can also influence investor sentiment, leading to a flight to quality, which often means Bitcoin. This dip serves as a reminder that market conditions are fluid and require constant monitoring. It’s not necessarily a sign of impending doom for altcoins, but rather an indication of a rebalancing act. Navigating the Current Crypto Climate: Strategies with the Altcoin Season Index For savvy investors, the Altcoin Season Index offers crucial insights, but it’s important not to view it as a standalone predictor. Instead, consider it as one piece of a larger puzzle. Here are some actionable insights: Diversification is Key: Even during a Bitcoin-dominant phase, some altcoins can still perform well due to specific project developments or niche market demand. Maintaining a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks. Monitor Trends: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index regularly. A sustained drop might suggest a prolonged period of Bitcoin strength, while a reversal could signal new opportunities in altcoins. Fundamental Analysis: Don’t solely rely on market indices. Always research the fundamentals of any altcoin you consider investing in, including its technology, team, use case, and community support. Risk Management: Understand that altcoins generally carry higher risk and volatility than Bitcoin. Adjust your position sizes and stop-loss orders accordingly. The crypto market is cyclical, and periods of altcoin outperformance will undoubtedly return. The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index simply tells us where we stand today. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us About Tomorrow? While the Altcoin Season Index dipping to 71 might seem like a setback for altcoin enthusiasts, it’s a natural part of the crypto market’s ebb and flow. It underscores Bitcoin’s foundational role and its tendency to lead market movements. For investors, this moment presents an opportunity to re-evaluate portfolios, conduct thorough research, and prepare for future market shifts. Whether we’re heading towards a stronger Bitcoin season or merely pausing before another altcoin rally, staying informed with tools like the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for making strategic decisions in this exciting financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric provided by CoinMarketCap that measures the performance of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the last 90 days. It helps indicate whether altcoins or Bitcoin are currently dominating the market. How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? It’s calculated by determining if 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins (by market cap, excluding stablecoins/wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin in the past 90 days. A higher index score indicates a stronger altcoin season, while a lower score suggests Bitcoin dominance. What does an Altcoin Season Index of 71 mean? An index of 71 means that while a significant number of altcoins are still outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days, the momentum has slightly decreased. It’s not a full altcoin season (which would be 75 or higher), nor is it a strong Bitcoin season (typically below 50), but rather a more balanced or transitioning period. Is it an Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season right now? With the Altcoin Season Index at 71, it’s closer to an altcoin season, but the recent dip indicates that Bitcoin has gained some relative strength. It suggests a mixed market where some altcoins are still performing well, but Bitcoin is also asserting its presence. How can I use the Altcoin Season Index in my trading? Use the Altcoin Season Index as an indicator of overall market sentiment. A rising index might encourage more altcoin exposure, while a falling index could prompt a more cautious approach or a focus on Bitcoin. Always combine this with fundamental analysis and robust risk management strategies. If you found this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

The shortfall is highlighted in a new report from the City of London Corporation, the local authority that presides over the country’s financial district. The report quotes a 15 billion-pound annual funding gap for the small- and medium-sized enterprises seeking to grow. It also shows a similar infrastructure investment gap from housing, energy, and transport projects to digital networks. Chris Hayward, policy chairman for the City, warned that the cost of inaction would be great: doing nothing would lead to lost opportunities, decreased productivity, and slower economic growth. The warning comes as the UK economy grapples to break out of stagnation. While markets worldwide struggle and tax increases are anticipated within the autumn budget, the government is pressured to create new money. City pushes for pension reform and more defined infrastructure plans The City calls for reform of pensions and a greater effort to direct savings into UK assets to plug the gap. It cites examples from Canada and Australia, where domestic pension funds are significant investors in infrastructure at home. The UK government has already taken steps to implement some of these recommendations. In the Mansion House Accord, 17 of the biggest pension funds in the country promised to allocate as much as 10% of their portfolios to private markets by 2030. At least half of that will likely be invested in UK assets, which could unlock a further £50 billion of fresh capital. But the City says that’s not good enough, as it would like the government to lay out a more transparent pipeline of projects, so investors know what’s coming. Transparency is necessary, it adds, to generate confidence and attract long-term private capital. Just last month, BlackRock announced it had poured $700m into UK data centres – so clearly there’s still plenty of appetite among international investors to back them if the terms are sweet enough. The new Labour government, little more than a year in office, is making strenuous efforts to increase investment. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government had wanted to steer capital into British infrastructure, green energy, and growth industries. A reshuffle has brought fresh faces to the forefront of this push. The minister for investment, who used to be Poppy Gustafsson, is businessman Jason Stockwood. Meanwhile, Lucy Rigby became city minister instead of Emma Reynolds, who was made environment secretary. The government is also establishing a new investment hub to match global funds with projects in the UK. Officials say the goal is to make Britain an easier and more appealing investment place. Pension capital sparks challenges and debates These are all advances, but there are still huge hurdles. UK pension funds have been on the decline for domestic stocks for decades. Today, pensions are invested in British stocks to only 4% in those portfolios, compared with about 50% during the 1990s. Many trustees prefer investing offshore, where they can make better returns for less risk. This trend has sparked debate. Reformers claim that switching pensions back into the UK would fuel growth and finance badly-needed infrastructure. Critics have said it could place savers at risk, or amount to trustees breaching their legal duty to act in members’ best interests. Some executives have even sounded the alarm. The chief executive of Aviva has also recently cautioned against “coercing” pension schemes to invest in Britain, arguing that it was not always the best way to maximize returns.

51793761,581294,1757984409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51793761.jpeg,Solana Price Prediction: September Outlook Brightens as Galaxy Digital Fuels Another Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-price-prediction-september-outlook-brightens-as-galaxy-digital-fuels-another-rally/,"Solana (SOL) continues to command market attention after Galaxy Digital purchased $300 million worth of SOL in 13 transactions across Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit. The digital assets investment firm has now acquired over 6.5 million SOL in the past five days, worth approximately $1.57 billion, according to on-chain data. These purchases come as part of a broader Solana-focused strategy. Galaxy, alongside Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital, recently led a $1.65 billion private placement for Forward Industries. The move places Forward Industries as a key institutional actor in the ecosystem, with Galaxy moving large batches of SOL into custody wallets on Fireblocks, signaling long-term holding intent. Novogratz: “Season of Solana” Begins Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has described the current market phase as the “season of Solana.” He emphasized that faster and cheaper blockchains like Solana are now primed for Wall Street adoption, especially as U.S. regulators hint at modernizing crypto rules. SEC Chair Paul Atkins recently noted that most crypto tokens may fall outside securities law, a stance Novogratz called a “radical departure” from past approaches. He believes this clarity will accelerate institutional adoption, especially for networks like Solana, which offer high throughput and sub-cent transaction costs without relying on Layer 2 scaling solutions. Analysts Eye $300 as Next Solana Target With SOL trading around $233.15, the token has climbed 12% in the past week and over 23% in the past month. Analysts suggest that a breakout above $253 could pave the way toward $272–$300, levels last seen in late 2023. Matt Hougan , CIO at Bitwise, noted that spot Solana ETFs awaiting SEC approval could unleash further inflows by October. He compared the momentum to Bitcoin’s treasury-driven rallies, saying Solana’s unique blend of speed, scalability, and institutional interest could amplify its price trajectory. For now, Solana sits just 16% below its all-time high, with bullish technical indicators supporting the case for another leg upward. If Galaxy’s buying spree continues and regulatory clarity arrives, September could introduce another Solana rally.

XRP Whales Have Sold 160 Million Tokens Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the latest move from the XRP whales. The analyst has cited Santiment’s Supply Distribution indicator, which measures the total amount of the asset’s supply that a given wallet group as a whole is holding right now. Whales are defined as addresses carrying between 1 million and 10 million tokens of the cryptocurrency. At the current exchange rate, the range converts to about $2.99 million at the lower end and $29.9 million at the upper end. Thus, only the market participants with a substantial amount of capital fall in this range. Related Reading: Analyst Sets Bold $1,314 Target For Solana After Cup-And-Handle Breakout These large investors can carry some degree of influence in the market, so their movements can be worth keeping an eye on. One way to do so is through the Supply Distribution. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of the 1 million to 10 million XRP group over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP whales took their supply to a high earlier in the month, but since then, these holders have participated in selling. Interestingly, most of this distribution came as the asset’s rally to the $3.1 level took place. This timing would imply that the whales were using the price surge as an opportunity to take profits and exit from the market. In total, these humongous entities have offloaded 160 million tokens of the cryptocurrency over the last couple of weeks, worth a whopping $486 million right now. The coin has declined since its high, and if selling from the whales continues, it’s possible that the drawdown may extend. From a technical perspective, however, XRP may actually be near a rebound, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges As Whales Scoop Up 181,000 LTC The reason is that the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has just given a reversal signal for the asset. The TD Sequential is an indicator that counts up candles of the same color in an asset’s price chart to identify points of trend exhaustion. Once nine candles are in, it signals that the earlier trend is over and a reversal may be about to occur. From the above chart, it’s visible that XRP has formed a TD Sequential signal with nine red candles on its 4-hour chart, suggesting a bullish turnaround could potentially take place next. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $3.02, down almost 1% over the last 24 hours.

The company has turned to its most powerful weapon to revive that dream: Jack Ma. After vanishing from public view towards the end of 2020 during an antitrust crackdown, China’s most famous entrepreneur is back in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s campus in Hangzhou more frequently than he did during the past five years, people familiar with the matter say. His influence is increasingly evident, including in the company’s renewed pursuit of artificial intelligence and its bloody price war against e-commerce competitor JD.com Inc. and Meituan. One insider said that Ma supported the company’s plan to spend as much as 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) on subsidies in response to JD.com Inc. heading into the market in a surprise challenge. Now run by longtime aides Joe Tsai and Eddie Wu, Alibaba has declined to confirm Ma’s official capacity — but several insiders say the 61-year-old founder is once again deeply involved. He insists on being kept informed about the company’s progress in AI— at one point, pestering a senior manager three times in one day to get an update. Alibaba bets big on AI and price wars Ma’s reappearance is widely seen as a symbol of Beijing’s cooling toward its once freewheeling tech titans . A handshake with President Xi Jinping earlier this year sealed his comeback, though Ma is now less assertive than in the days of Davos panels. Internally, his presence has jolted the staff’s morale, rekindling the entrepreneurial attitude of his company’s founding. Yet such a comeback carries risks. Beijing disapproves of the “vicious subsidies” behind Alibaba’s ongoing price war, and there is also a more pressing risk. Beijing frowns on the “malicious subsidies” fueling Alibaba’s latest price war, and Ma risks attracting fresh scrutiny. His 2020 speech blasting Chinese banks as “pawn shops” triggered regulators to halt Ant Group’s record IPO, unleashing a trillion-dollar crackdown that slashed Alibaba’s value by nearly $700 billion. Beijing watches as Ma rekindles influence For employees, seeing Ma is emotional after years of retreat in Tokyo and Hong Kong. Some longtime employees cried when he addressed them at Ant Group last December. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the affiliate company of the Chinese conglomerate Alibaba Group revealed in March that it has developed new techniques for training artificial intelligence models. Ant Group utilized Chinese-made semiconductors from Alibaba and Huawei. On a campus tour this April, he lauded Alibaba’s cloud, chips, and AI models, telling staff, “Technology isn’t just about conquering the stars and the oceans, it’s about preserving the spark in all of us.” Alibaba, which was once worth more than $800 billion, is still clawing its way back from those lost years. With Wu driving AI, Tsai anchoring the board, and up-and-coming star Jiang Fan reshaping e-commerce, Ma has surrounded himself with a loyal cadre of lieutenants. At the same time, the company has promised to spend more than 380 billion yuan on AI and cloud infrastructure, leading to a sharp recovery in cloud revenue and an 88 percent jump in its stock this year — though still well off its highs. Although Ma eschews formal titles, his moral authority is significant. “He’s not a day-to-day micromanager,” said Duncan Clark, author of Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built. “But his word — or displeasure — can turn the company around.” For employees, the sight of Ma once again donning an Alibaba badge is his silent but influential comeback. He once told state media, “Retirement does not mean I’ve left Alibaba. If Alibaba calls me, I’ll always be there.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|Alibaba,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-16 01:01:23

The U.S. Senate has confirmed Stephen Miran as a governor of the Federal Reserve, a development first reported by the crypto market insights platform Unfolded. This crucial appointment, approved by a narrow 48-47 vote, marks a pivotal moment for economic policy and could have ripple effects across various sectors, including the dynamic crypto market. Understanding the implications of the Stephen Miran Federal Reserve confirmation is essential for anyone tracking financial trends. Who is Stephen Miran and Why Does His Federal Reserve Appointment Matter? Stephen Miran’s confirmation to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is a significant event. As a known ally of former President Trump, his presence on the board could influence the direction of monetary policy for years to come. The confirmation process itself was closely watched, reflecting the political divisions within the Senate. The tight 48-47 vote underscores the importance and often contentious nature of such high-level financial appointments. Miran joins a board responsible for steering the U.S. economy. His background and political leanings are now part of the Fed’s diverse perspectives. This appointment fills a critical vacancy, bringing the board closer to full capacity. Decoding the Federal Reserve’s Influence and New Leadership Dynamics The Federal Reserve, often simply called ‘the Fed,’ serves as the central bank of the United States. Its primary roles include managing monetary policy, maintaining financial stability, and supervising banks. When a new governor like Stephen Miran Federal Reserve joins, it introduces a fresh voice and perspective to these critical discussions. The collective views of the Board of Governors shape decisions on interest rates, inflation targets, and other economic tools that affect everything from employment to investment. Moreover, the balance of the board can shift with each new member. This dynamic is particularly important during periods of economic uncertainty or rapid change, such as the current landscape influenced by global events and technological advancements. How Might Stephen Miran’s Stance Impact the Crypto Market? The crypto market, while often seen as distinct from traditional finance, is undeniably influenced by macroeconomic policies set by institutions like the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s decisions on interest rates, for instance, can impact investor sentiment towards riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. While Stephen Miran’s specific views on cryptocurrency may not be widely publicized, his general economic philosophy will contribute to the overall stance of the Federal Reserve. For example, if the Fed adopts a more hawkish (anti-inflation) or dovish (pro-growth) approach, these shifts can directly affect crypto valuations. Consider these potential impacts: Interest Rates: Higher rates can make traditional investments more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from crypto. Regulatory Environment: The Fed, alongside other agencies, contributes to the broader regulatory conversation around digital assets. Economic Stability: A stable economic outlook, partly managed by the Fed, generally fosters a more favorable environment for all investments, including crypto. Navigating Future Economic Shifts: What Should Investors Watch For? With the confirmation of Stephen Miran Federal Reserve , market participants should pay close attention to future statements and actions from the Fed. His contributions will be part of the larger policy narrative. Investors should monitor the following key indicators: Fed Meeting Minutes: These provide insights into discussions and potential future policy directions. Inflation Reports: The Fed’s primary focus often revolves around managing inflation. Employment Data: Another key mandate of the central bank. Miran’s Public Comments: Any statements he makes could offer clues about his specific policy leanings. Understanding these signals can help investors anticipate market movements and adjust their strategies accordingly, especially within the volatile crypto space. The confirmation of Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve is more than just a political appointment; it’s a strategic move that could reshape economic policy and indirectly influence the burgeoning crypto market. As the Fed continues to navigate complex economic challenges, the new perspectives brought by governors like Miran will be crucial. Keeping an eye on these developments will be key for investors and enthusiasts alike to understand the evolving financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Federal Reserve Board of Governors? The Federal Reserve Board of Governors is the governing body of the Federal Reserve System, responsible for overseeing the 12 Federal Reserve Banks and setting national monetary policy. It consists of seven members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. 2. How does a Federal Reserve appointment impact the economy? Each new governor brings their economic philosophy and expertise to the board, influencing decisions on interest rates, money supply, and financial regulation. These decisions directly affect inflation, employment, and the overall stability of the U.S. economy. 3. What does Stephen Miran’s background as a ‘Trump ally’ imply? While the Fed is designed to be independent, a ‘Trump ally’ designation suggests Miran might hold more conservative economic views, potentially favoring deregulation or specific approaches to monetary policy that align with past administrations. However, governors operate within the Fed’s mandate. 4. Why is the crypto market mentioned in relation to the Stephen Miran Federal Reserve appointment? The crypto market, despite its decentralized nature, is not immune to macroeconomic forces. Federal Reserve policies, such as interest rate hikes or quantitative tightening, influence overall market liquidity and investor appetite for risk, which in turn affects cryptocurrency valuations and investor behavior. 5. What should I do as a crypto investor following this news? Crypto investors should remain informed about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions and any public statements from its governors. These insights can help in understanding broader market trends and making more informed investment decisions, rather than reacting solely to crypto-specific news.

One look at names like Peanut the Squirrel or Turbo shows how wild and witty this space really is. These tokens mix humor, hype, and surprising performance, creating a playground where fortunes rise and fall faster than a bull charging a red cape. With Peanut the Squirrel holding steady despite market dips and Turbo stirring up noise, it’s clear meme culture isn’t slowing down. The buzz about MoonBull Whitelist being live right now is electric. Crypto students, degens, and even analysts know early entry is everything. Being whitelisted means front-row seats before the crowd stampede. This isn’t just another presale; it’s a ticket to Stage One with benefits that make FOMO feel real. Let’s break down MoonBull , Peanut the Squirrel, and Turbo to see why all three belong on the list of meme coins to watch in 2025. MoonBull Whitelist: Your Golden Ticket to Stage One MoonBull ($MOBU) is an Ethereum-based meme coin crafted for traders who thrive on adrenaline and upside. Designed for degens and meme coin fans chasing serious gains, it fuses meme energy with secure smart contracts. Unlike countless pump-and-dump plays, MoonBull delivers structure: staking rewards, secret token drops, and exclusive perks locked behind whitelist access. The whitelist is more than a sign-up form – it’s a VIP pass to join before the public even knows the door is open. Whitelist members get the lowest price, bonus token allocations, and private hints about the roadmap. Everything happens on a first-come, first-served basis, making this a chance that could vanish in seconds. For crypto communities in places like São Paulo, Mexico City, and Los Angeles, where meme culture blends with trading hustle, missing this chance could feel like letting a peanut slip through your fingers. The hype doesn’t stop at discounts. Whitelist members are the only ones who’ll hear whispers of upcoming updates before launch. Stage One isn’t closed to outsiders, but only whitelisted users know the exact launch date in advance. In markets where timing is everything, that edge is priceless. Picture a bull run starting, and only a handful of insiders knowing when the gate opens. That’s MoonBull’s promise. How to Secure a Spot in the MoonBull Whitelist Getting whitelisted is simple yet strategic. Submit your email through the secure whitelist form, and wait for a private notification with the launch details. Those who sign up early stand at the front of the herd. Spots are limited, so hesitation means missing out. Think of it as a rodeo – only those who grab the reins first get to ride the bull. MoonBull’s first stage is engineered for urgency. Investors who’ve watched past moonshots slip away now have a shot at redemption. Whitelist access ensures not just early entry but exclusive perks unavailable anywhere else. For anyone chasing the next 1000x, this isn’t just another listing – it’s a lifeline. Peanut the Squirrel: Nutty by Name, Serious by Numbers Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) may sound quirky, but its numbers prove it’s no joke. The live price sits at $0.2442 with a market cap of about $236 million. Ranked #308, it shows real staying power compared to other meme coins. Traders often underestimate coins like this until they realize the market has already priced in long-term potential. Daily trading volume is swinging hard. In the past 24 hours, PNUT saw $75 million in activity, marking a sharp 40% drop from the day before. While that signals cooling interest in the short term, it also suggests the coin is stabilizing after heavy moves. Like squirrels stashing nuts for winter, smart traders may see this dip as a buying opportunity. The fully diluted valuation also stands at $236 million, aligned with its market cap, suggesting supply dynamics are transparent. This kind of clarity reassures cautious investors. For crypto communities, where volatility is expected but transparency is prized, Peanut the Squirrel has carved out its niche. Turbo: Speeding Ahead or Running Out of Fuel? Turbo (TURBO) takes its name seriously, aiming for fast growth and meme-level attention. Its live price is $0.004169 with a market cap of around $277 million, placing it higher than Peanut the Squirrel in overall rankings. The all-time high was $0.01432, but current prices are nearly 72% lower, showing how volatile Turbo’s engine can be. Turbo’s fully diluted valuation mirrors its market cap, just over $277 million. With 69 billion tokens in circulation, investors must weigh the risks of dilution against the upside of meme-driven demand. This isn’t a coin for those faint of heart. As they say in Montevideo, this coin can buck like a bull or collapse like a hippo in a mud pit – fast, messy, and without warning. Despite recent underperformance, Turbo’s branding power and liquidity mean it’s far from out of the race. Meme investors love high-risk, high-reward plays, and Turbo keeps delivering the kind of rollercoaster action they crave. For anyone betting on meme coin culture in 2025, Turbo deserves a seat at the table. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, MoonBull stands out as the new meme coin to watch in 2025. With its whitelist live, it hands early supporters a rare chance to secure the lowest entry price, unlock bonus allocations, and gain access to secret staking rewards before the public rush begins. That first-come, first-served model fuels genuine FOMO, especially for traders who know timing is everything in this market. At the same time, Peanut the Squirrel shows grit by holding steady in a competitive market, while Turbo brings high liquidity and nonstop action for traders who thrive on volatility. Each coin caters to a different appetite – stability, speed, or explosive potential – but MoonBull ’s whitelist advantage tips the scales. For those who sat on the sidelines during past moonshots, this lineup feels like déjà vu with a second chance. Missing it could mean watching the herd ride off into the sunset while you’re left standing at the gate.

Presale participants see quoted APYs up to 722%, although rewards taper as adoption scales. The fixed supply of 10 billion tokens adds scarcity. This mix has placed Layer Brett high on lists of the best meme coins to buy. Furthermore, its roadmap includes NFT features, gamified staking, and bridges to other chains. While memes fuel culture, utility ensures staying power. That dual approach could give it an edge over tokens like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. Bitcoin News and Market Resilience Recent Bitcoin news shows the asset trading between $118,000 and $120,000. Analysts point to strong institutional demand, even after a whale unloaded billions in BTC. Despite selling pressure, Bitcoin’s realized cap crossed $1 trillion, a milestone that reflects long-term holder confidence. Market watchers say dips are being treated as buying opportunities. But they also caution that resistance near $125,000 could hold in the short term. This backdrop makes investors curious about alternatives, especially the best meme coins to buy. XRP Price Prediction and Ripple Momentum While Bitcoin news grabs headlines, another theme is the XRP price prediction circulating among analysts. XRP recently showed reduced selling pressure from whales, down by more than 90%. At the same time, institutions accumulated roughly $500 million worth of XRP. This accumulation has many suggesting XRP could stage a breakout. A popular XRP price prediction points to a potential 15% rally if resistance breaks. Combined with Ripple’s ongoing legal clarity and adoption by banks, the sentiment has shifted. Investors are weighing whether XRP could run alongside newer plays like Layer Brett. Why Layer Brett is the best meme coin to buy Dogecoin remains the original meme coin, while Shiba Inu built Shibarium to add utility. Yet both face challenges: slower speeds, higher fees, and diminishing staking rewards. Layer Brett enters differently. It has meme appeal but also positions itself as a Layer 2 solution with practical use cases. That’s why more commentators include it in discussions of the best meme coins to buy in 2025. Yet, the best approach to a healthy portfolio may be diversification: keep exposure to Bitcoin, consider XRP based on its price prediction, and allocate a portion to promising newcomers like Layer Brett. That way, investors ride both established giants and speculative growth. Conclusion The latest Bitcoin news highlights resilience, while an XRP price prediction suggests a rally could be near. Yet the spotlight is also on newer opportunities. Among the best meme coins to buy, Layer Brett stands out with its presale success, low price entry, and Layer 2 efficiency. Crypto thrives on cycles of trust, hype, and innovation. Bitcoin anchors the market. XRP builds bridges in finance. Layer Brett brings memes with purpose. For investors searching beyond headlines, this may be the moment to blend tradition with disruption.

51795000,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=178063,1757986223,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/51795000.jpeg,Cardano vs. Dogecoin: Which Will Outperform in 2026?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cardano-vs-dogecoin-which-will-outperform-in-2026/,"Cardano and Dogecoin couldn’t be more different, yet both remain central to discussions about which altcoins could dominate future cycles. Cardano, with its reputation for careful development and academic rigor, represents the world of utility-driven blockchains. Dogecoin, born as a meme, thrives on culture, community, and unexpected staying power. As the crypto market prepares for the next big rotation, investors are asking: which of these coins is better positioned for 2026? Some analysts point to Cardano’s ecosystem upgrades, while others highlight Dogecoin’s enduring appeal in meme-driven markets. Yet beneath this debate, a third option is emerging, one that combines meme culture with audits from biggest companies in the sector: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cardano: Utility and Patience Cardano (ADA) has always marched to its own rhythm. While Ethereum and Solana pushed forward aggressively with new features, Cardano’s approach has been methodical. Built on peer-reviewed research, its roadmap has unfolded carefully, sometimes frustrating investors seeking quick returns. Yet this patience has also been Cardano’s strength. In 2026, Cardano’s prospects revolve around Voltaire , its governance era that promises full decentralization of decision-making. Through treasury mechanisms, community voting, and on-chain governance, Cardano aims to become a truly self-sustaining ecosystem. Analysts argue that this level of decentralization could make Cardano more resilient long-term, even if it doesn’t produce the kind of explosive short-term gains meme coins generate. With institutional interest in blockchain governance growing, ADA may carve out a niche as the blockchain for long-term utility and credible adoption. But the challenge remains: will slow and steady be enough in a market addicted to hype? Dogecoin: The Meme That Won’t Die Dogecoin (DOGE) is living proof that memes can outlast expectations. Born as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin leveraged humor, simplicity, and an enthusiastic community to outlive many so-called “serious” projects. Even without smart contracts or DeFi, it continues to hold a top market cap position, a testament to culture’s power in crypto. Its staying power is reinforced by endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk, who frequently reignites Dogecoin’s visibility. Every cycle, DOGE seems to defy skeptics, producing spectacular rallies. For 2026, analysts suggest its success will depend largely on whether it can maintain cultural dominance against a new wave of meme tokens. Dogecoin’s strength lies in familiarity: it’s the meme coin everyone knows. But that same familiarity may also limit upside. With so many new meme projects promising higher multiples, DOGE may remain a cultural staple but struggle to deliver the kind of returns it once did. Security Meets High Reward Then there’s MAGACOIN FINANCE, the rising presale that is turning heads for combining meme appeal with structural legitimacy. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few presales to pass both CertiK and HashEx audits, earning recognition as a project that puts security first. Investors say this is the kind of foundation missing in most meme coins. At the same time, its market cycle analysis shows 13,500% ROI potential , putting MAGACOIN FINANCE in a class of its own for this bull run. Unlike typical presales that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN has built its story on scarcity and credibility. Every funding round has sold out faster than the last, with both whales and retail investors competing for allocations. It’s this rare combination, meme-driven branding plus structural trust, that makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out. While Cardano offers patient utility and Dogecoin offers cultural nostalgia, MAGACOIN FINANCE is pitching itself as the bridge: hype that lasts because it is built on secure foundations. How They Compare Looking ahead to 2026, Cardano анд Dogecoin each represent a different kind of opportunity: Dual audits complete: CertiK and HashEx validation give MAGACOIN FINANCE a credibility edge over most meme projects. Cardano: A long-term governance play with slow but steady growth potential. It could appeal to institutions and patient investors who value decentralization and utility. Dogecoin: The cultural stalwart of meme coins. While its upside may be capped compared to newer projects, it will likely continue to thrive on visibility and community loyalty. For investors, the choice comes down to strategy. Do you prioritize steady, utility-driven progress? Do you stick with a cultural icon? Or do you chase the presale that could multiply many times over? Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out 13,500% ROI potential: Market cycle forecasts put it among the highest-upside plays of 2025–2026. Scarcity model: Presale rounds sell out rapidly, proving demand far outpaces supply. Cultural traction: Meme branding ensures mass appeal, while credibility anchors investor confidence. This is why analysts call MAGACOIN FINANCE a “dual-threat token” , capable of attracting meme traders chasing multiples while reassuring cautious investors who want real safeguards in place. Conclusion The debate between Cardano and Dogecoin reflects the larger divide in crypto: utility versus culture. Cardano’s governance and utility upgrades could cement it as a serious blockchain contender in 2026. Dogecoin’s community and cultural cachet mean it will likely never disappear, even if it delivers smaller multiples than before. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the script. With dual audits, 13,500% ROI projections , and a presale defined by scarcity and momentum, it combines the best of both worlds. It has the hype and cultural resonance of meme coins, paired with the structural trust usually found in utility projects. For many, that makes MAGACOIN FINANCE the most intriguing option heading into 2026, an altcoin capable of delivering the kind of life-changing returns neither Cardano’s slow build nor Dogecoin’s nostalgia may achieve again.

The SEC accused the cryptocurrency platform of failing to register a cryptocurrency asset lending program before offering it to retail investors. According to reports, the settlement resolves the agency’s lawsuit over the Gemini Earn program. The settlement still needs to be approved by SEC In a letter filed on Monday in a Manhattan federal court, lawyers representing both parties indicated the settlement would “completely resolve” the lawsuit but still subject to SEC approval. The lawyers reportedly asked the US District Judge Edgardo Ramos to give them up to December 15 to submit their final paperwork, and to put all deadlines on hold. The exact terms of the settlement remain confidential pending a final approval from commissioners. However, experts familiar with similar cases are projecting the penalty will be in the region of $10 million to $20 million, which is far less severe than initially feared. These are also significantly lower penalties than those that were imposed during the previous administration. The settlement was revealed four days after Gemini raised $425 million in an initial public offering , valuing the New York based firm at about $3.3 billion in its market debut. According to a Reuters report, Gemini shares closed up 52 cents at $32.52 on Monday, which was 16% above the $28 IPO price. Gemini Earn, which launched in 2021 allowed customers to lend bitcoin and other crypto assets to the cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital in exchange for interest payments, with Gemini Trust taking fees as high as 4.29%. Gemini paused withdrawals in November 2022, the same month that Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX cryptocurrency exchange collapsed before filing for bankruptcy two months later. The exchange held $900 million assets from about 340,000 Gemini Earn customers at the time. In January 2023, the SEC sued Gemini and Genesis on allegations that they bypassed disclosure requirements for Gemini Earn that were meant to protect investors. Genesis accepted a $21 million fine to settle without admitting any wrongdoing. The SEC – Gemini settlement signals regulator’s softer approach to crypto The SEC has stopped oversight of the cryptocurrency industry since Donald Trump became president in January and appointed crypto-friendly officials to lead the agency including the new chair, Paul Atkins, who has called for clearer guidelines rather than enforcement actions. So far, the SEC has created a Crypto Task Force designed to develop appropriate frameworks for digital assets and has halted several investigations into major industry players. The resolution of the Gemini Trust case is not unique as it follows a similar pattern to other crypto settlements recently reached. These include cases against Ripple Labs, which was finalized with a leaner penalty as well as more favorable terms for the cryptocurrency firm. Industry experts view these developments as a sign that the US is becoming more receptive to cryptocurrency innovation while still maintaining consumer protections. According to Namecoin News , this also to be a shift from viewing most digital assets as securities that require strict registration to recognizing that different types of cryptocurrencies may need different regulatory treatments. And for an average crypto user, this settlement also means that established firms like Gemini can continue operating with greater regulatory certainty.

BTC Holds the Line at $115K,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/16/asia-morning-briefing-fragility-or-back-on-track-btc-holds-the-line-at-usd115k,"Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin (BTC) traded just above $115k in Asia Tuesday morning, slipping slightly after a strong start to the week. The modest pullback followed a run of inflows into U.S. spot ETFs and lingering optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut rates next week. The moves left traders divided: is this recovery built on fragile foundations, or is crypto firmly back on track after last week’s CPI-driven jitters? That debate is playing out across research desks. Glassnode’s weekly pulse emphasizes fragility . While ETF inflows surged nearly 200% last week and futures open interest jumped, the underlying spot market looks weak. Buying conviction remains shallow, Glassnode writes, funding rates have softened, and profit-taking is on the rise with more than 92% of supply in profit. Options traders have also scaled back downside hedges, pushing volatility spreads lower, which Glassnode warns leaves the market exposed if risk returns. The core message: ETFs and futures are supporting the rally, but without stronger spot flows, BTC remains vulnerable. QCP takes the other side. The Singapore-based desk says crypto is “back on track” after CPI confirmed tariff-led inflation without major surprises. They highlight five consecutive days of sizeable BTC ETF inflows, ETH’s biggest inflow in two weeks, and strength in XRP and SOL even after ETF delays. Traders, they argue, are interpreting regulatory postponements as inevitability rather than rejection. With the Altcoin Season Index at a 90-day high, QCP sees BTC consolidation above $115k as the launchpad for rotation into higher-beta assets. The divide underscores how Bitcoin’s current range near $115k–$116k is a battleground. Glassnode calls it fragile optimism; QCP calls it momentum. Which side is right may depend on whether ETF inflows keep offsetting profit-taking in the weeks ahead. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin is consolidating near the $115,000 level as traders square positions ahead of expected U.S. Fed policy moves; institutional demand via spot Bitcoin ETFs is supporting upside ETH: ETH is trading near $4500 in a key resistance band; gains are being helped by renewed institutional demand, tightening supply (exchange outflows), and positive technical setups. Gold: Gold continues to hold near record highs, underpinned by expectations of Fed interest rate cuts, inflation risk, and investor demand for safe havens; gains tempered somewhat by profit‑taking and a firmer U.S. dollar Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 topped 45,000 for the first time Monday, leading Asia-Pacific gains as upbeat U.S.-China trade talks and a TikTok divestment framework lifted sentiment. S&P 500: The S&P 500 rose 0.5% to close above 6,600 for the first time on Monday as upbeat U.S.-China trade talks and anticipation of a Fed meeting lifted stocks.

This exciting development marks a new era for investors seeking access to innovative Yunfeng Financial crypto services . What’s Driving Yunfeng Financial’s Crypto Ambition? Yunfeng Financial recently announced a substantial capital injection, raising an impressive HKD 1.17 billion, equivalent to $150 million, through a strategic new share issuance.

The S-1 form indicates the initial registration statement required by the regulatory body for new securities offerings. The filing marks Bitwise’s latest effort to expand its crypto ETF offerings beyond existing products. Coinbase will be the acting custodian of these products if the commission approves this proposal. Bitwise submits a proposal for its Avalanche ETF to the SEC In Bitwise’s S-1 filing dated September 15, the crypto-asset manager mentioned that the Trust allows investors to access the Avalanche market via a regular brokerage account. According to the firm, this enables them to avoid problems and risks associated with purchasing and holding Avalanche directly. Apart from that, the company argued that they believed the Trust’s design could assist certain investors in effectively implementing their strategic and tactical asset allocation strategies with Avalanche. Bitwise highlighted that this can be achieved by investing in Shares instead of purchasing, holding, and trading Avalanche. The SEC filing disclosed that the fund will determine its net asset value (NAV) depending on the CME CF Avalanche–Dollar Reference Rate, adding that it will retain AVAX tokens directly and will not apply any derivatives. In the meantime, it is worth noting that to obtain the NAV of an ETF, one needs to calculate the total value of its assets minus any liabilities, then divide it by the number of available shares, which will indicate the value per share of the fund. Bitwise’s proposal triggers other crypto asset managers to apply for a spot AVAX ETF Bitwise was initially founded in 2017. Since then, it has positioned itself as a leading international crypto-asset manager offering several crypto investment alternatives, such as crypto index funds and ETFs that track Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other asset management services. The crypto-asset manager has also achieved other significant milestones this year. To illustrate, it recently developed an Avalanche trust in Delaware, initiating a first step towards releasing the product. Concerning Bitwise’s proposal for its Avalanche ETF, it has triggered a trend among other crypto asset manager rivals to apply for a spot AVAX ETF. To support this claim, reports from sources have revealed that Grayscale, an asset manager and investment platform, has requested to change its Avalanche Trust into a spot AVAX ETF. Moreover, VanEck, an asset management company, is considering launching an AVAX fund. To further expand its operations, the Avalanche Foundation made public its intention to raise around $1 billion purposefully to develop two AVAX treasury firms in the US last week. The foundation stated that these companies will purchase tokens from them at a reduced price. It is worth noting that digital asset treasuries, similar to ETFs, provide investors with an alternative method of participating in the crypto markets via regular brokerage accounts. Meanwhile, Bitwise has submitted applications requesting to list several single-asset ETFs, including those that can track Chainlink and XRP’s performance. According to data from CoinMarketCap , AVAX is currently trading at $29.54, indicating a 0.25% decrease in the last 24 hours. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The Ethereum Price Prediction for September points to a battle between bulls and bears, as ETH trades in a tight range near $4,300. While investors remain hopeful for another breakout, many are starting to look beyond Ethereum for more substantial upside. One project catching that attention is Remittix (RTX) , the PayFi altcoin tipped to shake up global payments. Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Levels in Focus The Ethereum price is within the $4,250–$4,500 range. If the Ethereum price drops below $4,250, it might retest the $3,745 levels. However, if buyers go beyond $4,500, the next target is $4,957. ETH is forming bullish higher lows on the daily chart, but resistance is still strong. Traders are eyeing the $4,493 zone as the level that could set off the next rally. Despite cautious sentiment, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong. Nasdaq-listed Bitmine Immersion Technologies just purchased 446,255 ETH worth $201 million, becoming the largest corporate holder of Ethereum. That kind of buying shows institutions still see ETH as a long-term bet. Even so, many retail holders are beginning to hedge with newer tokens that promise higher returns. Remittix: The PayFi Altcoin Gaining Momentum Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming one of 2025’s standout projects. It’s addressing a genuine issue, slow and costly cross-border payments, instead of creating hype. Remittix can reduce the high fees associated with traditional money transfers and transaction times from days to hours by utilizing blockchain efficiency. Investors are drawn to the project for more than just utility. Here’s why Remittix is standing out: $250,000 Remittix Giveaway pulling in early adopters Support expanding beyond Ethereum to Solana, Avalanche, and Polygon The Remittix (RTX) Wallet enters beta testing on September 15, 2025, with instant crypto-to-fiat conversion First and second exchange listing already confirmed on BitMart and LBank Why Ethereum Holders Are Backing Remittix While ETH remains a cornerstone of crypto, its size limits explosive growth. That’s why many Ethereum holders are rotating part of their portfolios into Remittix, seeing it as a high-upside play in the PayFi sector. With staking rewards, audited transparency, and a deflationary model that reduces supply weekly, Remittix is gaining traction fast. The Ethereum Price Prediction for the months ahead points to steady gains, but analysts argue Remittix could deliver 20x or even 30x returns in the same window. For investors chasing the next big breakout, it’s quickly becoming the PayFi altcoin to watch.

The revised duty structure, enacted through an executive order signed by President Trump on September 4, directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection to collect the reduced 15% rate on passenger cars, light trucks, and auto parts from Japan. The change took effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on September 16, applying to goods entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouses afterward. According to officials, tariffs overpaid on qualifying imports since August 7 will also be refunded. The administration described the tariff cut as part of its broader strategy to rebalance trade relationships and encourage investment within the U.S. However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick cautioned that Japan could face renewed tariff hikes if it fails to meet its investment commitments in America. A few weeks ago, Ryosei Akazawa, the head of Japan’s trade negotiating team, indicated he was leading his cavalry back to Washington to push for swift action on the auto tariff cut. As reported by Cryptopolitan , Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi had also called for quicker issuance of Trump’s executive order to reduce auto tariffs. Tokyo accepts tariff cut with investment pledge After branding the measure as vital to its economic health, Japan had been urging the United States for months to deliver on a pledge to lower tariffs on shipments of automobiles . Japan’s economy is based on the car industry, contributing much of its gross domestic product, exports, and jobs. Passenger cars and parts are the single category that Japan ships to America, so tariff levels are crucial for corporate profits, wages for employees, and the broader industrial competitiveness of a nation. The announcement came after Tokyo promised to support efforts to help anchor the deal with a $550 billion fund focusing on migrating capital into American infrastructure, energy, and technology. American officials have touted the pledge to assist local industries and jobs. But there is still a residue of uncertainty. Washington presented the fund as a direct sponsorship of Trump’s economic agenda; Tokyo, in broader strokes, has called it an investment vehicle following corporate decisions. The absence of interpretation has led to speculation on whether the fund will be translated and politicized over those funds that eventually materialise in the months ahead. And beyond its headline numbers, it also contained the outlines of shared trade opportunities. Japan is committed to improving market access for United States agricultural products such as beef, pork, and dairy. It also vowed to clamp down on approvals of United States-made vehicles. It also telegraphed that both governments would work together in new tech areas like semiconductors, clean energy, and digital infrastructure, seen as strategic to future growth and global competition. Automakers respond to tariff cut Japanese automakers welcomed the news as an answer to their prayers, arguing that it would fuel less uncertainty around supply chains and pricing if duties were to come down. “It’s a good step forward for long-term planning and competitive operations,” one senior Toyota executive said. US auto policy groups were less enthusiastic. The authors noted that Japanese car companies would have a price advantage. Meanwhile, their American competitors were burdened with the higher prices they paid for steel, aluminum, and other supplies. Some lawmakers on Capitol Hill have also pushed back, warning that the agreement could jeopardize American workers as domestic manufacturers continue to lose market share. The deal, economists said, could help spur a rebound in car sales in the United States by lowering retail prices for some of America’s most popular Japanese models. The clause is also retroactive, so importers paying above the correct tariff rate for the last three months, since August, are entitled to refunds aimed at bringing fresh liquidity into the processor sector.

The firm filed a $500 million shelf registration to issue common stock while also stating that part of the capital will be channeled into the accumulation of Bitcoin. Common stock going for an aggregate initial offering price Next Technology disclosed in its SEC filing that it is establishing a shelf registration for up to $500 million in common stock, paving the way for one or more offerings in the months ahead. The announcement triggered an initial sell-off in NXTT shares, which fell almost 3% in post-market trading on Monday, according to Seeking Alpha. While the filing gives management discretion over the use of proceeds, Next Technology has indicated in past disclosures and commentary that Bitcoin acquisition remains a core corporate strategy. Next Technology’s Bitcoin strategy comes into focus Within a short span, Next Technology has managed to establish itself as one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin relative to its size. The firm reported holding roughly 5,833 BTC, including 5,000 acquired in recent months. The alignment with Bitcoin has boosted NXTT’s profile among crypto-focused investors but also raised its risk profile. Bitcoin-linked equities tend to trade with high volatility, mirroring the digital currency’s price swings. NXTT’s strategy is not so different from the moves made by Semler Scientific , which earlier this year filed a $500 million shelf registration to fund Bitcoin purchases and general corporate purposes. The trend is growing and for Next Technology, the potential to allocate part of the new proceeds toward additional BTC accumulation represents both a bet on long-term digital asset adoption and a branding exercise that aligns the company with the cryptocurrency narrative. Investor reaction and market context The longer-term impact lies in execution, and this includes how much stock is ultimately sold, at what prices, and how the capital is deployed. If a portion of proceeds is used for Bitcoin purchases, NXTT could further concentrate its balance sheet exposure to a single, volatile asset. Investors remain divided on the merits of such a strategy. Advocates argue that Bitcoin’s supply cap and growing institutional adoption justify corporate treasuries allocating capital to it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. NXTT has already tested investor tolerance for dilution. The company also recently announced a $9 million registered direct offering of stock and warrants. That sale was relatively modest compared to the new $500 million ceiling but illustrates management’s willingness to raise funds quickly. Despite the bullish narrative, risks abound. The SEC filing gives management a wide window in how to deploy proceeds, and there is no guarantee that significant sums will ultimately be directed toward BTC purchases. Shareholders face potential dilution from future issuances, while the company’s fortunes may become increasingly tethered to the volatility of digital asset markets.

That flow has pushed Solana into a fresh bout of attention from investors who watch big-wallet moves. Galaxy Digital Buying Spree According to reports, Galaxy Digital has been one of the most active buyers, taking on more than $1 billion in SOL in recent days. Transfers out of exchange addresses and into private wallets were flagged by researchers. Reports have disclosed that this type of accumulation often removes supply from the market, at least temporarily, and can leave prices more sensitive to new demand. Galaxy Digital bought $1.35 Billion in $SOL this week. That’s 5.82 million $SOL accumulated in just 7 days, the largest institutional Solana purchases this year. But they didn’t buy the cycle top.

That zone matters because it was a barrier that, once cleared, turned into a floor for buyers to defend. Short squeezes were also observed, where traders betting against SOL were pushed to close positions. Volume spiked on some of the upward moves, which made runs sharper, and that can speed up both gains and corrections. 🚀 Galaxy Digital just bought $240.58 million in $SOL in 5 hours.

Some analysts put nearer-term targets at $250 or $300 if buying continues and technicals hold. More optimistic scenarios, often framed as longer-term or best-case outcomes, extend the outlook to $350–$450. A claim that SOL could reach $460 has circulated in some corners, but clear public backing for that exact figure appears limited in mainstream outlets. $SOL Solana is showing three major levels of interest before a strong pullback is likely. The most probable targets to watch are ~$260, ~$380, and ~$460 before a major correction sets in. The RRR ratio for longs remains poor, unless additional risk is taken on through leverage. pic.twitter.com/vuQQO3tF4V — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) September 14, 2025 What $460 Would Require For SOL to climb toward $460, a chain of events probably needs to align. Large and sustained institutional inflows would help, and the creation or expansion of SOL treasuries could remove more tokens from circulation. Regulatory clarity or the launch of regulated products that let big pools buy SOL safely would widen the buyer base. Finally, stronger real-world use on the Solana chain — more transactions, apps, and revenue — would add a fundamental argument for much higher valuations. Time also matters; even strong bull cases often play out over many months.

If macro conditions tighten, or if network problems reappear, any rally can be cut short. Overbought readings on some indicators suggest a pullback is possible before further gains. Watch exchange flows, whether large wallets keep withdrawing SOL, and whether the $220–$230 band holds. Those signals should tell traders a lot about the likely next leg.

He expects demand to pick up in Q4 as portfolio managers set positions ahead of 2025. Some managers will make small moves; others could shift larger slices of their holdings into BTC, Visser said. Institutional Survey Signals Strong Bitcoin Interest According to a joint Coinbase and EY-Parthenon survey , a large share of institutional investors plan to add crypto exposure in 2025. The survey found 83% of respondents intend to increase allocations, and 59% expect to put more than 5% of assets under management into crypto or related products. Those figures suggest that many firms are preparing for wider crypto use in portfolios. Intentions Do Not Always Equal Action Plans by money managers can change. Regulation, market swings, and macro shocks can slow or halt buys. Still, when lots of institutions say they will act, it raises the odds that real flows will follow. That said, timing and size of the moves remain uncertain. ETF Flows Feeding Demand Spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled heavy inflows this year, giving institutions an easier on-ramp into the market. Recent daily net inflows reached about $642 million on one trading day, and cumulative ETF net inflows since launch are roughly $57 billion, lifting total ETF assets to about $153 billion. Those flows can provide a steady source of demand for BTC if they continue. How ETFs Change The Game ETFs give big funds a familiar product to buy. That reduces some barriers to entry. If allocations rise in Q4 as Visser suggests, ETF channels are where much of that buying could show up first. Corporate Holdings Add Another Layer Public and private firms are already holding Bitcoin on their books. Data trackers show public companies’ treasury BTC holdings are valued at roughly $112 billion across many firms. Big buyers like the Michael Saylor-led Strategy continue to add to their piles, and corporate buys make headlines when they happen. Such corporate demand can add to overall market appetite for BTC. The Period To Watch Based on reports and the surveys, late Q4 will be the period to watch. If institutions move as planned, Bitcoin could see meaningful support. But investors should expect bumps, as it’s the nature of crypto: policy shifts, rates, or a sudden liquidity squeeze could cut short flows. In short, the signs point toward more allocation from TradFi, yet execution will depend on several moving parts.

An individual recently received an 18-month prison sentence for cleverly concealing approximately 45 stolen Bitcoin (BTC) through sophisticated crypto mixing and currency exchange services, as reported by Digital Asset. This case is particularly noteworthy because the defendant had siphoned off these funds after illicitly obtaining a mnemonic code—a vital security key for a crypto wallet. The ruling itself carries immense weight, as it formally acknowledges the act of crypto mixing as a direct method of concealing criminal proceeds, setting a powerful precedent. What is Crypto Mixing and Why is it Used? Crypto mixing , often referred to as a ‘Bitcoin mixer’ or ‘tumbler,’ is a service designed to obscure the trail of cryptocurrency transactions. It works by pooling together various users’ coins and then redistributing them to their intended recipients from this mixed pool. This process makes it incredibly difficult to trace the original source of the funds. Privacy Concerns: For some, crypto mixing offers enhanced privacy, allowing individuals to transact without revealing their entire financial history on public ledgers. Illicit Activities: Unfortunately, a significant portion of mixers are utilized by criminals to launder stolen funds, evade sanctions, or finance illegal operations. The South Korean case clearly falls into the latter category, demonstrating how illicit actors leverage these tools to hide their tracks after committing theft. The South Korean Verdict: A Landmark in Crypto Crime The recent sentencing by the South Korean court marks a pivotal moment in the fight against digital asset-related crimes. The defendant’s use of crypto mixing services was not seen as a legitimate privacy measure but rather as a deliberate attempt to hide stolen assets. This distinction is vital for future legal battles. The court’s decision to hand down an 18-month prison term sends a clear message: attempting to obfuscate the origins of stolen cryptocurrency through mixers will not be tolerated. This formal recognition of crypto mixing as a concealment method provides a stronger legal framework for prosecuting similar cases worldwide. Moreover, the theft of the mnemonic code highlights a critical vulnerability. Mnemonic codes are essentially master keys to crypto wallets, and their compromise can lead to complete loss of funds. This case serves as a stark reminder of the importance of robust security practices. Navigating the Legal Landscape of Crypto Mixing The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding crypto mixing is rapidly evolving. Jurisdictions globally are grappling with how to effectively regulate these services to prevent their misuse without stifling legitimate privacy-enhancing technologies. This South Korean ruling provides a significant precedent. Global Scrutiny: Financial intelligence units and law enforcement agencies worldwide are increasing their focus on identifying and prosecuting individuals who use mixers for illicit purposes. Regulatory Challenges: Regulators face the challenge of distinguishing between legitimate privacy tools and those primarily designed for money laundering. Increased Enforcement: We can expect to see more coordinated international efforts to track funds moved through mixers and bring perpetrators to justice. This case underscores that legal systems are becoming more sophisticated in understanding and prosecuting complex cryptocurrency crimes, even those involving advanced concealment techniques. Protecting Your Digital Assets: Actionable Insights In light of such incidents, safeguarding your digital assets is more critical than ever. Here are some actionable steps to protect yourself and your investments: Secure Your Mnemonic Codes: Always store your mnemonic code offline in a secure, private location. Never share it with anyone or store it digitally where it could be compromised. Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, consider using a hardware wallet, which provides an extra layer of security against online threats. Practice Due Diligence: Be cautious of unsolicited links, phishing attempts, or services promising unrealistic returns. Always verify the legitimacy of any platform or individual you interact with. Understand the Risks: While crypto mixing can offer privacy, its association with illicit activities means that engaging with such services carries significant legal and reputational risks. Staying informed and vigilant is your best defense in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. The South Korean court’s decision marks a pivotal moment, signaling a growing legal understanding and intolerance for the use of crypto mixing in criminal enterprises. This ruling reinforces the importance of robust security practices for digital assets and highlights the increasing scrutiny on tools that can facilitate illicit activities. As the crypto landscape matures, legal precedents like this will continue to shape how digital assets are regulated and how crimes involving them are prosecuted. It’s a clear message: transparency and accountability are paramount, even in the decentralized world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is crypto mixing? Crypto mixing is a service that blends various cryptocurrency transactions together, making it difficult to trace the origin and destination of specific funds on a public blockchain. It’s used for both privacy and illicit activities. 2. Is crypto mixing illegal? While the act of crypto mixing itself isn’t universally illegal, using it to conceal stolen funds, launder money, or evade sanctions is highly illegal and subject to severe penalties, as demonstrated by the South Korean court case. 3. How did the South Korean court rule on this case? A South Korean court sentenced an individual to 18 months in prison for stealing 45 BTC and then using crypto mixing services to conceal these criminal proceeds. The ruling formally recognized mixing as a method of concealment. 4. What are the risks of using crypto mixers? The primary risks include legal repercussions if used for illicit purposes, the potential for your funds to be stolen by the mixer service itself, and being associated with criminal activity, which can lead to reputational damage or account closures. 5. How can I protect my crypto assets from theft? To protect your crypto assets, always secure your mnemonic codes offline, use hardware wallets for significant holdings, enable two-factor authentication, and be extremely cautious of phishing attempts or suspicious links.

On September 15, these investment vehicles collectively drew in an impressive $258.92 million, signaling robust and sustained investor interest in Bitcoin. This consistent positive flow underscores a growing confidence in digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, as a legitimate investment class. Why Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attracting Such Massive Inflows? This impressive streak of positive inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs isn’t just a fleeting moment; it reflects a deeper shift in how investors view and access Bitcoin. The ability to invest in Bitcoin through a regulated, traditional financial product like an ETF removes many barriers for institutional and retail investors alike. It offers a familiar structure, ease of trading, and often, enhanced security compared to direct cryptocurrency purchases. Accessibility: ETFs make Bitcoin accessible to a broader range of investors who might be hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges directly. Institutional Trust: The involvement of major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity lends significant credibility to the Bitcoin market. Market Maturation: Consistent inflows suggest a maturing market where Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a long-term asset rather than just a speculative play. Understanding the Dynamics: Who’s Leading the Spot Bitcoin ETFs Race? While the overall picture for Spot Bitcoin ETFs is overwhelmingly positive, a closer look reveals key players driving these significant inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT, for instance, continues to dominate the scene. On September 15, IBIT alone accounted for a staggering $260 million in inflows, highlighting its strong market position and investor preference. Fidelity’s FBTC also demonstrated solid performance, bringing in $7.54 million. Even Grayscale’s Mini BTC, a newer offering, saw positive movement with $6.13 million. These figures showcase a diverse interest across different fund providers, though some clearly hold a larger share of the market. However, it wasn’t entirely a one-way street. Bitwise’s BIBT experienced a net outflow of $18.81 million. This minor counter-trend reminds us that even within a booming sector, individual fund performances can vary, and investor preferences can shift based on various factors. What Does This Streak Mean for the Future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Crypto? The continuous positive flows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just daily statistics; they are a powerful indicator of evolving market sentiment. This sustained interest suggests a growing institutional embrace of Bitcoin, which could have profound implications for its price stability and broader adoption. As more traditional investors gain exposure to Bitcoin through these ETFs, it could lead to increased liquidity and reduced volatility in the long run. Moreover, this trend might encourage other financial institutions to launch their own Spot Bitcoin ETFs or similar crypto-backed products, further legitimizing the asset class. It also signals a potential shift from speculative trading to long-term investment strategies, treating Bitcoin as a valuable component of a diversified portfolio. Actionable Insight: Investors keen on gaining exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset should consider the various Spot Bitcoin ETFs available, evaluating their fees, liquidity, and underlying assets. Diversification remains key. In conclusion, the six consecutive days of net inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a significant moment for the cryptocurrency market. This sustained positive momentum, led by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, underscores increasing institutional confidence and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin. As these investment vehicles continue to attract capital, they are likely to play a pivotal role in shaping the future trajectory of digital asset adoption and market maturation. The future looks bright for Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Frequently Asked Questions About Spot Bitcoin ETFs What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. This means its value is derived directly from the current market price of Bitcoin, offering investors exposure to the asset without needing to buy and store Bitcoin themselves. Why are Spot Bitcoin ETFs important for the crypto market? They provide a regulated and accessible way for traditional investors, including institutions, to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This can increase market liquidity, legitimacy, and potentially reduce volatility, driving broader adoption of Bitcoin. Which funds are seeing the most inflows? Currently, BlackRock’s IBIT is consistently leading in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC. These funds have attracted significant capital due to their established presence and investor trust. Do all Spot Bitcoin ETFs experience positive inflows? While the overall trend has been positive, individual funds can experience outflows on certain days, as seen with Bitwise’s BIBT. Investor sentiment and fund-specific factors can influence these movements. How do Spot Bitcoin ETFs differ from Bitcoin futures ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs hold actual Bitcoin, directly reflecting its price. Bitcoin futures ETFs, on the other hand, hold futures contracts that bet on Bitcoin’s future price, which can lead to different performance characteristics and tracking errors.

Among the leaders in this niche is Remittix (RTX) , a worldwide payment project which has gradually gained increasing credibility before its launch of the beta wallet in September. Bitcoin & XRP Latest Market Figures Bitcoin remains in the news, trading at $115,451.01, falling 0.45% in the last day. Even with the marginal retreat, its market cap of $2.29 trillion confirms its position as the foundation of the crypto space. Daily volume is $31.87 billion, down 29.32% from yesterday’s high, a reminder that even when Bitcoin is targeting the $125,000 threshold, short-term corrections are still part of its trajectory. XRP, meanwhile, is at $3.02, down 4.12% in the last 24 hours. Its $179.71 billion market cap and 25.88% decline in trading to $4.93 billion still leave it holding a healthy position among top payment-biased tokens. Its more measured pace compared to the flashier new presale tokens shows, however, how slowly the market attention is shifting towards new money such as Remittix. Presale Growth, Token Sales, and CEX Listings Remittix (RTX) is priced at $0.1080 for every token and already crossed more than $25.6 million, selling more than 662 million tokens in its presale. Such milestones earned it its first officially sanctioned centralized exchange (CEX) listing announcement on BitMart when it hit the $20 million milestone, followed by the second listing on LBank when it crossed $22 million. Such listings are important for early-stage crypto investment projects because they provide access and liquidity. As opposed to speculative releases, Remittix is positioning itself with adoption pathways similar to how mainstreamed XRP in its early years, yet with more explicit focus on crypto-to-bank transfers. 24 Hours Left: Remittix Wallet Beta Testing The launch of Remittix Wallet Beta on September 15 is one of RTX’s important upcoming milestones. Supporting over 40 cryptocurrencies and over 30 fiat currencies, the wallet is useful for remitters, freelancers, and enterprises. With real-time FX conversion and no gas fees, you can send crypto directly into bank accounts of over 30 countries. How Remittix Is Building Market Steam: $25.6 million + presale capital raised to date 662 million + tokens allocated to early adopters First two CEX listings: BitMart & LBank Beta Wallet release date: September 15 $250,000 community giveaway Utility Beyond Presale Hype What sets Remittix apart from most new altcoin to keep an eye on news is that it is a functional design. It targets the $19 trillion payments space with business APIs, crypto-to-bank settlements, and minimal gas fees. This makes RTX both a cross-chain DeFi venture and a crypto solving real-world problems, which is why it’s being compared to early XRP but with a broader fiat integration roadmap.

However, fresh data from Binance crypto exchange indicates that the Bitcoin Scarcity Index recently witnessed its first spike since June 2025. Bitcoin Scarcity Index Spikes, Will BTC Rally? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, the Bitcoin Scarcity Index witnessed its first spike yesterday since June 2025. The analyst referred to the latest exchange data from Binance to confirm the spike in Bitcoin Scarcity Index. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Shift Strategy: Accumulation Over Selling Signals Stronger Bull Cycle For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Scarcity Index measures how limited the available supply of Bitcoin is on exchanges relative to immediate buying demand. A spike in the index usually indicates strong accumulation by large investors or institutions, signaling potential price pressure to the upside. In their analysis, Arab Chain remarked that the latest spike in the Bitcoin Scarcity Index means that either a large amount of BTC was withdrawn from Binance, or the volume of sell orders fell significantly on the exchange. As a result, the available supply of BTC on Binance suddenly became scarce. Notably, such movements are usually associated with the entry of large investors – such as whales or sharks – who hold substantial quantities of BTC. Arab Chain added: The index jumps when immediate buying power exceeds available supply, as if buyers are racing to acquire Bitcoin on the market This type of spike is often linked to positive news or sudden capital inflows. The same pattern occurred last June and persisted for several days, after which Bitcoin climbed to around $124,000. BTC may confirm the beginning of a strong accumulation phase and the continuation of the uptrend if the Bitcoin Scarcity Index remains positive for several consecutive days. However, if the index rises rapidly – followed by an equally quick descent – it may suggest speculative activity or order liquidations. Such a phase is often followed by a period of calm or a price correction. In recent months, the Bitcoin Scarcity Index has reached new all-time highs (ATH). The chart below shows the metric reaching as high as +6, before quickly falling toward neutral and even negative territory. Is BTC Losing Momentum? Arab Chain concluded by saying that the contrast between BTC’s high price, and the index’s quick move back to or below zero suggest that some strong buying momentum has started to decline.

For example, the flagship cryptocurrency recently broke above the mid-term holder breakeven, hinting that a fresh rally to the upside may be on the horizon. From a technical perspective, BTC recently flashed the Golden Cross, a rare bullish signal that has crypto pundits forecasting a potential price appreciation of 100%. At press time, BTC trades at $114,601, down 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

What sets the Fellowship PAC apart from previous political efforts, according to their statement, is its commitment to transparency and trust. The organization emphasizes that its mission is to foster a political environment that supports the broader crypto ecosystem rather than serving narrow interests. The new political action committee aims to build on the crypto regulatory framework being established under the Trump administration, which is viewed as a pathway for the US to become the world’s digital asset capital . Progress has already been made in the form of the passage of the GENIUS Act for dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, also known as stablecoins, being one of the most notorious successes for the cryptocurrency industry this year. Super PACs Gear Up For 2026 Midterms The Fellowship PAC’s objectives are clear: it seeks to support candidates dedicated to creating transparent and predictable regulations for digital assets. Additionally, the PAC aims to protect America’s edge in technology and entrepreneurship, ensuring that the innovation economy reflects American values of openness and fairness. A crucial focus will also be on preventing the migration of talent and entrepreneurs overseas by maintaining the US as the premier destination for innovation, supported by clear regulatory guidelines . The PAC’s press release also noted: Our differentiator is transparency and trust. This initiative is designed to align the interests of crypto entrepreneurs, policymakers, and the public, fostering accountability as we work to advance the ecosystem. This is just the beginning; we have more initiatives planned. The launch of the Fellowship PAC follows a year of notable activity among crypto-focused political action committees, which are gearing up to increase their influence in upcoming special elections across the country. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, super PACs like Fairshake, along with its affiliates Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress, have already invested approximately $136 million in supporting over 58 pro-crypto candidates during the 2024 election cycle. With over $100 million in resources ready for the 2026 midterms, Fairshake is positioned to make a significant impact, bolstered by contributions from major players in the digital asset space, including Coinbase, Andreessen Horowitz, and Ripple.

LSEG Has Launched Its Blockchain Infrastructure As announced in a press release on Monday, the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) has launched its blockchain infrastructure and facilitated its first transaction. The platform, called “Digital Markets Infrastructure” (DMI), was developed in collaboration with Microsoft and runs on the tech giant’s Azure cloud service. Related Reading: Record Bitcoin Difficulty Not Enough To Stop Miners: Hashrate Explodes To New ATH While blockchain is the same technology that powers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, LSEG’s platform isn’t about these digital currencies themselves. Rather, DMI is about applying the technology to traditional finance. Unlike many other projects that digitize only part of the process, LSEG is offering the full range of the blockchain experience, including issuance, tokenization, and settlement. “There are many processes in private markets today that can be improved,” said Head of DMI, Dr. Darko Hajdukovic. “At LSEG we are committed to significantly improving access to private markets, by streamlining workflows, enhancing distribution, and enabling liquidity.” MembersCap, an investment manager, has become the first to use LSEG’s DMI, raising capital for its MCM Fund 1. The fundraising has been facilitated with Archax, a digital securities exchange regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), acting as a nominee. According to the press release, institutional alternative asset manager EJF Capital has also been onboarded as an early adopter, with some of its funds expected to become available on the platform soon. Hjdukovic noted, The onboarding of our first clients and this first transaction are significant milestones, demonstrating the appetite for an end-to-end, interoperable, regulated financial markets DLT infrastructure. LSEG’s position as a convener of markets can bring significant scale to digital assets and effect real change. For now, DMI is only open to private funds, with LSEG planning for expansion into additional asset classes. The stock exchange said it will continue to collaborate with Microsoft to scale the blockchain platform. “Together, we’re reshaping the future of global finance to empower our customers to unlock new opportunities and drive meaningful change,” said Bill Borden, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft’s Worldwide Financial Services. Bitcoin Saw A Retrace During The Past Day Bitcoin recovered above $116,700 on Sunday, but the cryptocurrency has opened the week with a sharp pullback as it’s now back at $114,700. The chart below shows how the recent volatility in the coin’s price has looked. The rest of the digital asset sector has also slid down alongside Bitcoin, with some altcoins like Dogecoin even being down as much as 8%.

Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,620 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,500 level.

At the forefront of this significant market event is Ethereum (ETH), which alone accounted for a substantial portion of these liquidations. This sudden downturn primarily impacted long positions, leaving many traders feeling the pinch. Understanding these market movements, especially crypto liquidations , is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset space. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations, and Why Do They Happen? For those new to the world of crypto trading, a liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. Essentially, if a trader borrows funds to amplify their potential gains (a “leveraged” position) and the market moves against their prediction, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses once their margin falls below a certain threshold. This mechanism is a fundamental aspect of derivatives trading in the crypto market. These events are often triggered by sharp price movements, unexpected news, or broader market sentiment shifts. When a large number of positions are liquidated simultaneously, it can create a cascading effect, exacerbating price drops and leading to even more liquidations. This is precisely what we observed with the recent wave of crypto liquidations . ETH Dominates the Liquidation Landscape Over the past day, Ethereum (ETH) perpetual futures contracts saw the largest share of liquidations, totaling an astonishing $110 million. What’s particularly noteworthy is that 81.57% of these were long positions. This indicates that a significant majority of traders were betting on ETH’s price to rise, only to be caught off guard by a downward movement. But ETH wasn’t alone in this market turbulence. Bitcoin (BTC) also experienced substantial liquidations: BTC: $42.61 million liquidated, with 71.88% being long positions. SOL: $27.62 million liquidated, with a striking 88.63% from long positions. The high percentage of long liquidations across these major cryptocurrencies suggests a broad market correction or a sudden shift in investor sentiment, leading to significant losses for those anticipating upward price action. Understanding the Impact of Long Liquidations on the Crypto Market When long positions are liquidated, it means that traders who bought believing prices would increase are forced to sell their assets. This forced selling adds downward pressure to the market, potentially causing prices to fall further. This phenomenon can create a “liquidation cascade,” where one liquidation triggers another, amplifying market volatility. The sheer volume of these recent crypto liquidations , especially involving ETH, BTC, and SOL, serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading. It highlights the importance of risk management and understanding market dynamics, particularly in a rapidly evolving space like cryptocurrency. How Can Traders Navigate Volatility and Avoid Crypto Liquidations? While the allure of amplified gains through leverage is strong, the risks are equally substantial. Here are some actionable insights for traders to consider: Implement Robust Risk Management: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on leveraged positions. Never risk more capital than you can afford to lose. Avoid Excessive Leverage: While high leverage can boost profits, it also dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. Start with lower leverage ratios, especially if you are new to derivatives. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, technical analysis, and broader economic indicators that could influence crypto prices. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading investments across different assets can help mitigate risk during market downturns. Understand Market Cycles: Recognize that crypto markets are cyclical. Periods of rapid growth are often followed by corrections. These strategies can help protect your capital and navigate the often-turbulent waters of crypto liquidations . A Powerful Reminder of Market Risks The recent $180 million in crypto liquidations , spearheaded by ETH, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and risks in the cryptocurrency market, particularly when engaging in leveraged trading. The dominance of long liquidations across ETH, BTC, and SOL underscores a significant market correction that caught many optimistic traders off guard. For both seasoned and novice traders, this event reinforces the critical need for sound risk management, prudent leverage use, and continuous market education. By understanding the mechanics of liquidations and adopting cautious trading practices, participants can better protect their investments and navigate the unpredictable currents of the digital asset world. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Liquidations Here are some common questions about crypto liquidations: What is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because the market has moved against their bet, causing their margin to fall below a required threshold. This prevents further losses. Why did ETH lead the recent liquidations? ETH led the recent liquidations because a significant number of traders had open “long” positions (betting on price increases) with leverage. When ETH’s price moved downwards, these leveraged long positions were closed out by exchanges. What does it mean if long positions are liquidated? If long positions are liquidated, it means traders who expected prices to rise were forced to sell their assets. This indicates a market downturn or correction, as the collective expectation of price appreciation was met with a decline. How can I protect my crypto investments from liquidations? To protect against liquidations, it’s crucial to use robust risk management strategies like setting stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, staying informed about market trends, and diversifying your portfolio. Are crypto liquidations bad for the market? While liquidations can cause immediate price drops and increase volatility, they are a normal part of leveraged trading markets. They can help flush out excessive speculation, potentially leading to a healthier market rebalancing in the long run. Did you find this analysis of crypto liquidations helpful?

Martinez recently shared on X a crucial signal concerning the future of Bitcoin. He highlighted that the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio has dipped below 0.1%, a level traditionally interpreted as a strong indication of a Bitcoin short-term bottom . This signal suggests an opportune accumulation zone and a period where selling pressure tends to be weak. Understanding the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio: What Does it Tell Us? What exactly does the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio tell us? This metric is a powerful tool used by analysts to gauge the potential for selling pressure in the Bitcoin market. It essentially measures the risk associated with sellers. When this ratio falls below 0.1%, as Martinez pointed out, it’s not just a number; it’s a significant market signal. It often implies that long-term holders are less inclined to sell, and the overall market is experiencing reduced selling intensity. Consequently, this low ratio often precedes or coincides with an accumulation phase. During such times, savvy investors might view current prices as attractive entry points, anticipating future upward movement. The insight from Ali Martinez, therefore, provides a valuable perspective for anyone closely watching Bitcoin’s price action. Why a Bitcoin Short-Term Bottom Sparks Investor Interest? The concept of a Bitcoin short-term bottom is particularly exciting for investors. It signifies a potential turning point after a period of price declines or consolidation. For many, this represents a strategic window to acquire more Bitcoin at what could be a discounted price. Accumulation Opportunity: A short-term bottom often marks a period where the “smart money” begins to accumulate assets, expecting a rebound. Reduced Downside Risk: When selling pressure is weak, the immediate risk of further significant price drops can diminish, offering a more stable environment for purchases. Foundation for Growth: Establishing a bottom can provide a strong base from which Bitcoin’s price can build momentum for its next upward trend. However, it’s crucial to remember that while indicators provide guidance, the crypto market remains dynamic and unpredictable. Navigating the Potential Accumulation Zone: What’s Your Strategy? If the market is indeed entering an accumulation zone, what steps should investors consider? This period demands careful thought and a well-defined strategy. Understanding the implications of a Bitcoin short-term bottom is just the first step. Here are some actionable insights: Research Diligently: Always conduct your own research beyond any single indicator or analyst’s view. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider implementing a DCA strategy, buying smaller amounts of Bitcoin over time to average out your entry price. This mitigates the risk of trying to perfectly time the absolute bottom. Risk Management: Allocate only capital you can afford to lose. The crypto market is volatile, and even strong signals are not guarantees. Long-Term Vision: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment. A short-term bottom might be a great entry point for those with a multi-year horizon. The goal is to approach these signals with a balanced perspective, leveraging insights without succumbing to impulsive decisions. Historical Precedent: Does the Sell-Side Risk Ratio Hold Up for a Bitcoin Short-Term Bottom? Looking back at historical data, technical indicators like the Sell-Side Risk Ratio have often provided valuable insights into market cycles. When the ratio has previously fallen to such low levels, it has frequently coincided with periods of significant accumulation before subsequent price rallies. This historical context lends credibility to Martinez’s current observation about a potential Bitcoin short-term bottom . Nevertheless, every market cycle presents unique variables. While past performance can offer guidance, it never guarantees future results. External factors, global economic conditions, and regulatory news can all influence Bitcoin’s trajectory, regardless of internal metrics. Conclusion: Seizing the Moment with Informed Decisions The recent analysis by Ali Martinez, highlighting the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio falling below 0.1%, offers a compelling signal for a potential Bitcoin short-term bottom . This indicator points towards an accumulation zone and a period of reduced selling pressure, suggesting a potentially favorable environment for investors looking to enter or add to their Bitcoin holdings. While such signals are valuable, a prudent approach involves combining this insight with thorough personal research and a robust risk management strategy. The crypto market rewards those who are patient, well-informed, and strategic. This potential bottom could indeed be a significant moment for Bitcoin, paving the way for its next chapter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio? A1: The BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio is a metric that indicates the potential for selling pressure in the Bitcoin market. A low ratio, especially below 0.1%, suggests that long-term holders are less likely to sell, implying weaker overall selling pressure. Q2: What does a “Bitcoin short-term bottom” mean for investors? A2: A Bitcoin short-term bottom suggests that Bitcoin’s price has reached a temporary low point, often signaling an accumulation zone. For investors, this can represent an opportunity to buy Bitcoin at potentially favorable prices before a possible rebound. Q3: Is the Sell-Side Risk Ratio a guaranteed indicator of future price movements? A3: No, while the Sell-Side Risk Ratio has historically been a reliable indicator of potential accumulation phases and short-term bottoms, no single indicator guarantees future price movements. The crypto market is complex and influenced by many factors. Q4: What strategies should I consider during an accumulation zone? A4: During an accumulation zone, strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and thorough personal research are recommended. It’s also crucial to practice sound risk management and only invest capital you are prepared to lose. Q5: Who is Ali Martinez, and why is his analysis significant? A5: Ali Martinez is a well-known cryptocurrency trader and analyst. His insights are significant because he often utilizes various on-chain and technical indicators to provide informed perspectives on market trends, which many in the crypto community follow closely.

Bitcoin has experienced a significant pullback this September, as whale sell-offs and macro uncertainties test investor conviction. Recent data shows Bitcoin spot ETFs are attracting capital while Ethereum spot ETFs are seeing record outflows, an intriguing divergence amid volatile sentiment. Capital rotation, diminished liquidity, and fading dominance are eroding BTC’s grip on the crypto market, prompting investors, especially speculators, to seek the next breakout opportunity. If momentum follows narrative power, MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its PATRIOT50X bonus code , might become investors’ rallying point for catching the next wave. Bitcoin Under Pressure ETF Flows and Liquidity Trends Between September 2–5, Ethereum spot ETFs experienced unprecedented net outflows totaling $788 million , while Bitcoin ETFs recorded $246 million in net inflows , sustaining two consecutive weeks of positive BTC flows. This divergence underscores shifting institutional sentiment. While Ethereum appears to be losing momentum with big players, Bitcoin remains a safer allocation in the short term, particularly as inflation concerns keep investors glued to assets with a longer track record. Yet, despite inflows into ETFs, Bitcoin’s price has struggled to hold support. Traders point out that ETF buying has been offset by aggressive spot selling from whales. That dynamic has left order books thin and prone to sharp intraday swings, adding to retail anxiety and increasing the appeal of smaller, high-upside assets. Whale Selling & Technical Stress A massive sell-off by a long-term Bitcoin holder, about $2.59 billion worth , sparked a $310 million flash crash , pushing BTC below critical support and triggering cascading liquidations. On-chain data highlights a worrying pattern: long-term holders are distributing more coins than they accumulate, a reversal from the earlier part of the year when accumulation was steady. Technical indicators reinforce caution. A potential “death cross” looms as the 50-day moving average threatens to slip under the 200-day, while Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings have fallen below 50. Historically, these setups often precede short-term corrections. For investors accustomed to Bitcoin’s role as a “safe haven” in crypto, such signals are undermining confidence. Seasonal Volatility & Macro Risks September has long been a difficult month for Bitcoin. Since 2016, the asset has finished in the red more often than not during this period, a seasonal trend many traders are now respecting. Analysts at Cryptodnes.bg warned that market participants could be underestimating the risks of September volatility, particularly when combined with sticky inflation, weaker U.S. jobs data, and uncertainty around Federal Reserve cuts. The broader macro backdrop is hardly comforting. The Fed remains stuck between cooling inflation and a fragile labor market, and bond yields continue to reflect skepticism about the speed of future rate cuts. That mix has spilled into risk assets, making Bitcoin vulnerable to sharper swings as traders reduce leverage and protect margins. A Flight Toward Different Narratives Even as Bitcoin’s dominance shows cracks, investors are not abandoning crypto altogether. Instead, capital is fragmenting. Part of it is rotating into Ethereum’s tokenization-driven ecosystem, while another portion is chasing smaller altcoins and presales that promise exponential multiples. This dynamic has defined every major cycle: when Bitcoin pauses or retraces, high-beta assets become the main attraction. The speculative side of the market is thriving under these conditions. Traders are gravitating toward presale projects with scarcity mechanics, cultural branding, and bonus incentives. In many ways, presales are seen as a hedge against Bitcoin’s sluggishness, offering investors exposure to asymmetric risk with smaller initial commitments. Amid Bitcoin’s latest sell-off, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the cycle’s most talked-about hidden gems. The PATRIOT50X bonus code is fueling presale acceleration, rewarding participants with 50% more tokens at a time when confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory is shaken. Forecasts of 15,000% potential upside have quickly become the centerpiece of discussions in crypto communities, with some analysts calling it the “second chance setup” for those who regret missing Bitcoin’s $10 breakout. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is how it thrives in turbulence. Instead of relying on mining economics or ETF flows, its strength comes from scarcity-driven rounds, cultural resonance, and an engaged early-mover community. This positions it not only as a speculative bet but as a potential cultural symbol of the next bull run. Broader Market Environment Liquidity Shifts & Altcoin Season Signals With Bitcoin dominance slipping toward 57%, analysts are once again monitoring “altseason” indicators. Historically, a dip below 55% has preceded massive capital rotation into altcoins. Coinbase Institutional recently noted that liquidity conditions are improving, with tighter spreads and stronger depth across altcoin order books. If Bitcoin continues to stagnate, capital may chase higher multiples in emerging tokens. Institutional Reassessment Coinbase’s report also highlighted that September could mark the beginning of a broader altcoin shift. Analysts like Michael van de Poppe argue that Bitcoin’s current weakness may serve as a catalyst, as it has historically been the prelude to powerful alt rallies. That shift would open the door for speculative presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE to dominate narratives. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be Bitcoin’s Second-Chance Play 15,000% ROI whispers : Market chatter frames MAGACOIN FINANCE as the boldest speculative bet of 2025. Scarcity + bonus edge : Rapid presale sellouts and the PATRIOT50X code create urgency and amplify rewards for early movers. Cultural + credible fusion : Combines meme-driven appeal with legitimacy through completed audits, something few presales achieve. Momentum from all sides : Retail buzz aligns with whale positioning, ensuring liquidity and visibility at launch. Bitcoin contrast : As BTC wavers, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a narrative of redemption for those who missed Bitcoin’s earliest breakout. Conclusion Bitcoin’s September sell-off, driven by whale distribution, ETF divergences, and macro uncertainty, has reinforced its reputation for volatility. For some, this is a reminder of Bitcoin’s cyclical nature; for others, it’s a signal to look elsewhere for growth. Ethereum remains the backbone of tokenization and institutional adoption, but the speculative edge of crypto is where fortunes are often made. In that corner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a defining story, a presale blending scarcity, cultural branding, and auditable legitimacy, supercharged by the PATRIOT50X bonus code. For risk-on investors, it could represent the long-awaited “ second chance ” after missing Bitcoin’s historic rise.

This latest initiative, led by the head of France’s financial watchdog, Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, is part of a broader push to shift regulatory oversight to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), based in Paris. France Pushes For Centralized Crypto Oversight According to an exclusive coverage made by Reuters on Monday, the urgency of this move stems from concerns that under the EU’s new regulatory framework, known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, crypto companies are gravitating towards jurisdictions with more lenient licensing processes. Barbat-Layani emphasized that there are significant inconsistencies in how national regulators are applying the new rules, raising alarms about the potential for inadequate supervision of cross-border firms. In a coordinated effort, France has joined Italy and Austria in advocating for ESMA to assume supervisory responsibilities over major crypto firms. This was outlined in a position paper shared with Reuters, highlighting a collective concern about the regulatory landscape. The head of France’s financial watchdog warned that France would not shy away from employing what she termed an “atomic weapon”—the possibility of challenging the validity of licenses granted by other EU member states. This could disrupt the established “passporting” mechanism that allows companies approved in one country to operate throughout the European Union. Barbat-Layani also pointed out that some crypto platforms are engaging in “regulatory shopping,” seeking out jurisdictions with less stringent requirements to gain favorable licenses. France And Allies Seek Major Changes For MiCA Rules The call for enhanced oversigh t comes after a review by ESMA, which found that certain national regulators, like Malta, faced scrutiny for their licensing processes. In some cases, the review indicated insufficient risk assessment when granting licenses to crypto firms. As part of this ongoing transition, crypto companies are in the process of applying for MiCA licenses, with jurisdictions like Luxembourg and Malta already granting approvals to prominent platforms such as Coinbase (COIN) and Gemini (GEMI). However, the French, Italian, and Austrian regulators are advocating for revisions to MiCA that would impose stricter rules on crypto activities outside the EU, enhance cybersecurity measures, and refine how authorities manage new digital asset offerings . France has consistently championed the idea of expanding ESMA’s regulatory powers, a sentiment echoed by ESMA’s head, Verena Ross. However, this proposal faces resistance from certain EU member states, highlighting the challenges ahead in establishing a cohesive regulatory approach for the digital asset market.

Analysts from The Bull Theory, a crypto research firm, have emphasized the significance of this upcoming period, suggesting it could determine the fate of what they term “mega altseason” in the fourth quarter (Q4) of the year. Could Global Economic Data Trigger A Surge In Crypto Prices? The urgency of this new prediction for the broader crypto sector, comes in light of recent economic data from China, which revealed signs of weakening demand. Retail sales grew by only 3.4% year-on-year, falling short of the expected 3.9%. Similarly, industrial production increased by just 5.2%, marking the slowest growth in twelve months, while urban unemployment rose to 5.3%. These indicators suggest that the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, leading to speculation that quantitative easing (QE) may be the only viable solution moving forward. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Eye $0.54 ‘Final Boss’ Breakout, Says Top Analyst China has already begun injecting substantial liquidity into its economy, and further measures could significantly boost the global money supply. The situation in the United States adds another layer of complexity, as markets are anticipating a 25 basis point cut in the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rates on September 17. If Fed Chair Jerome Powell not only confirms this cut but also signals the possibility of additional easing, The Bull Theory claims that this situation could lead to a surge in liquidity. Historically, such moves have prompted sharp upward movements in crypto and Bitcoin prices, often ranging from 5% to 10% within weeks. Moreover, Ethereum (ETH) could see increased inflows, particularly from exchange-traded funds (ETFs), while altcoins may benefit from an expanded risk appetite among investors. However, if the Federal Reserve hesitates to implement further cuts, risk assets across the board could face a sharp correction. Potential Rate Cuts From Key Central Banks The following days will also see critical decisions from other central banks, including the Bank of England (BOE) on September 18. Should the BOE signal a willingness to cut rates, it would reinforce the narrative of synchronized global easing. This could align with potential dovish moves from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on September 19, which would further weaken the yen and facilitate more dollar liquidity flowing into the market. Related Reading: The Big PEPE Price Breakout: Falling Wedge Pattern Points To 64% Rally According to the firm’s analysis, in the macroeconomic landscape the best-case scenario would involve a coordinated global easing strategy, featuring cuts from the Federal Reserve, a dovish BOJ, and a supportive BOE. They assert this could lead to massive liquidity inflows, potentially pushing Bitcoin past the $120,000 mark, accelerating exchange-traded fund inflows into Ethereum, and prompting stronger performance from altcoins. The Bull Theory concludes that if global central banks align their policies towards easing, the next ten days could very well mark the beginning of a robust altcoin season.

Despite the progress, PI is in red territory today, while the multi-million token unlocks scheduled for the next month and the major supply stored on exchanges signal heavy potential selling pressure. Moving Forward as Scheduled The controversial crypto project, officially launched in 2019, continues to make adjustments and implement developments to strengthen its ecosystem. Most recently, the X account Pi News revealed that Pi Network is gradually upgrading from protocol v19 to v23, covering Testnet, Testnet2, and Mainnet. Moreover, the Testnet has been successfully upgraded to v22. The goal is to improve performance and network stability, thereby enabling further ecosystem advancements. Earlier this month, the project’s team explained that Version 23 is based on Stellar v23, but it’s custom-made for Pi Network. It aims to provide users with more control and a few functionalities, including Know-Your-Customer (KYC) authorities into the protocol that will “maintain PI as a KYC-verified blockchain, while offering a more distributed community-driven KYC process at the protocol level.” Some users commenting on the latest progress news claimed verifications remain an issue. “Will this improve KYC approvals? They need to hurry the hell up and purge all UNVERIFIED Pi that doesn’t have KYC so we can go back to 1 dollar,” one person asked. PI Price Outlook Despite the latest upgrade status, the native token of the crypto project remains in red territory today (September 15). As of this writing, it trades at approximately $0.34 (per CoinGecko’s data), which is a staggering 88% decline compared to the all-time high of around $3 registered at the start of the year. And while some community members believe that PI could mark a significant revival in the short term, important metrics signal that the pullback may even intensify. Data indicates that over 137 million tokens will be unlocked within the next 30 days, providing an opportunity for people to offload coins they have been waiting for a long time, thereby increasing sell pressure. PI Token Unlocks, Source: piscan.io In addition, the amount of PI stored on crypto exchanges continues to rise and is currently above 440 million. Almost half of that stash is stored on Gate.io, while Bitget comes in second with 147 million. This suggests that many investors have transitioned from self-custody methods to centralized platforms, which is often interpreted as a pre-sale step.

Senators voted 48–47, which split mostly along partisan lines in the GOP-controlled chamber. Nonetheless, Miran’s confirmation breaks nearly a century of precedent, becoming the first active White House aide to serve on the Fed’s board since its reorganization in the 1930s. He will join the Fed team in Washington on Tuesday, as they begin a crucial two-day meeting to shape the nation’s economic course. Policymakers are set to discuss interest rates, which, depending on their call, could affect how much Americans pay on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. Most economists are betting on a rate cut this time, at least a quarter-percentage point rate cut, to boost the labour market. Lawmakers are worried that Miran may not act independently as a member of the Fed Board On September 4, during his confirmation hearing, Miran told Congress he would take an unpaid leave of absence from his White House job while serving at the Fed. His decision, however, raised some concern about whether he could act independently, as some had expected him to resign from the position altogether. Miran, however, emphasized during the hearing that the Fed’s independence is “critical.” In the past few months, Trump has not hidden his ambition to steer the Federal Reserve, openly outlining plans to create “a majority” on the Fed’s board, a move that critics say could threaten its long-standing independence. Some have seen his clashes with Chair Jerome Powell over interest rates and criticism of several senior Fed officials as interference in the central bank’s work. Now, with his backing of Miran, some have hinted that he intended to assert influence on the board. Senator Elizabeth Warren even voiced fears that Miran might be perceived as a puppet rather than an impartial board member. Miran has backed some of Trump’s economic policies, including his global tariff strategy . He believes that the import duties won’t stoke inflation and that tighter immigration policies would ease housing demand and bring down prices. Trump attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook Miran’s appointment comes as Fed Governor Lisa Cook fights to keep her seat on the central bank’s board. Trump has moved to oust Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud and asserting his constitutional authority to remove her. Earlier, Bill Pulte, appointed by Trump to help regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, had connected Cook to three mortgage properties in two referrals to the Justice Department. The mortgages date back to 2021, before former President Biden tapped Cook to serve on the Federal Reserve board. Nonetheless, Trump acted on these accusations to fire her. Cook has denied the claims and even filed a lawsuit to challenge her dismissal. Over the last several meetings, she has voted to maintain current interest rate levels, contrary to the President’s demand. On a turn of events, Trump has been denied the right to dismiss Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors for now. As reported by Cryptopolitan , a federal appeals court decided in an emergency ruling Monday, just hours before the central bank begins its two-day monetary policy meeting.

The ebb and flow of traditional finance, particularly central bank policies and currency valuations, often dictate broader market sentiment, influencing everything from investor appetite for risk assets to the stability of stablecoins. Right now, a significant shift is underway: the anticipation of a Fed rate cut . This pivotal moment is not just about interest rates; it is about a potential rebalancing of global economic power, with profound implications for the US Dollar, Asian currencies, and indirectly, the crypto sphere. Let us delve into how these crucial shifts are shaping the future of finance. Understanding the Impending Fed Rate Cut : What is Driving the Shift? The prospect of a Fed rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve has become a central theme in global financial discussions. For months, markets have speculated on when and how aggressively the Fed would pivot from its hawkish stance, adopted to combat persistent inflation. Several factors are now aligning to make these rate cuts a more tangible reality: Inflation Moderation: While still above the Fed’s 2% target, inflation data has shown a consistent downward trend. This suggests that the aggressive rate hikes implemented over the past two years are having their intended effect. Economic Slowdown Concerns: Recent economic indicators, including some employment data and manufacturing surveys, point to a potential cooling of the U.S. economy. The Fed aims for a ‘soft landing,’ where inflation is tamed without triggering a severe recession. Rate cuts could provide necessary stimulus to avoid a sharp downturn. Global Economic Headwinds: Slower growth in other major economies and ongoing geopolitical tensions also factor into the Fed’s calculations. A global slowdown could dampen U.S. export demand and overall economic activity, necessitating a more accommodative monetary policy. A reduction in the federal funds rate would lower borrowing costs across the U.S. economy, impacting everything from mortgages to corporate loans. Globally, it would reduce the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets, potentially leading to capital outflows from the U.S. and into other markets, particularly those offering higher returns or perceived growth potential. Why is Asia FX Outlook Brightening? The Dollar’s Retreat Explained The anticipation of a Fed rate cut directly influences the Asia FX outlook . As the U.S. Dollar begins to retreat, Asian currencies find a stronger footing. This phenomenon is driven by several interconnected dynamics: Yield Differentials: Historically, higher U.S. interest rates made dollar assets more attractive, drawing capital away from emerging markets, including Asia. As the Fed cuts rates, this yield differential narrows, making Asian bonds and other local currency assets more appealing to international investors. Reduced Pressure on Central Banks: A weaker dollar eases the pressure on Asian central banks to defend their own currencies. During periods of dollar strength, many Asian central banks intervene in currency markets, often by selling dollar reserves, to prevent excessive depreciation of their local currencies, which can fuel imported inflation. With the dollar retreating, this pressure lessens, allowing for more independent monetary policy decisions. Improved Trade Balances: For many Asian export-oriented economies, a weaker dollar makes their goods more competitive in international markets, potentially boosting exports. Conversely, it makes dollar-denominated imports (like oil) more expensive in local currency terms, but the overall trade balance often benefits from stronger export performance. We are already observing some currencies like the Japanese Yen (JPY), South Korean Won (KRW), and Indian Rupee (INR) showing signs of firming against the dollar, albeit with regional nuances. This positive shift in the Asia FX outlook signifies a broader re-evaluation of investment destinations. The Mechanics of US Dollar Weakness : A Global Ripple Effect The current narrative of US Dollar weakness is a multifaceted one, extending beyond just Fed policy. While interest rate differentials are a primary driver, other factors contribute to the dollar’s retreat and its ripple effect across global markets: Risk-On Sentiment: When the global economic outlook improves or fears of a severe recession subside, investors tend to move away from ‘safe-haven’ assets like the U.S. Dollar and into riskier assets, including equities and emerging market currencies. This ‘risk-on’ environment naturally contributes to dollar depreciation. Current Account Deficit: The U.S. typically runs a significant current account deficit, meaning it imports more goods and services than it exports. While often offset by capital inflows, a reduction in these inflows (due to lower interest rates) can expose the underlying demand for dollars, pushing its value down. Comparison with Other Major Currencies: The dollar’s value is always relative. If other major central banks (like the European Central Bank or Bank of England) maintain higher interest rates or signal less aggressive cuts, their respective currencies could strengthen against the dollar, further contributing to perceived US Dollar weakness . This dollar retreat has significant implications for commodity markets, as many key commodities (like oil and gold) are priced in dollars. A weaker dollar makes these commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies, potentially increasing demand and supporting their prices. Navigating the Shifting Currency Markets : Opportunities and Risks For investors, businesses, and even individuals, understanding the dynamics within the currency markets is crucial. The current environment of a retreating dollar and strengthening Asian currencies presents both opportunities and challenges: Opportunities: Attractive Asian Assets: A stronger local currency can make Asian equities and bonds more appealing to foreign investors, potentially leading to capital appreciation and higher returns in dollar terms. Reduced Debt Burden: For Asian companies or governments with dollar-denominated debt, a stronger local currency reduces the cost of servicing and repaying that debt. Cheaper Imports (for some): While a weaker dollar can make dollar-denominated imports more expensive for the U.S., it makes them cheaper for countries whose currencies are strengthening against the dollar. Risks: Volatility: Currency markets are inherently volatile. While the general trend might be dollar weakness, unexpected economic data, geopolitical events, or shifts in central bank rhetoric can trigger sharp reversals. Geopolitical Tensions: Regional conflicts or trade disputes can quickly overshadow economic fundamentals, leading to capital flight from affected areas and impacting specific Asian currencies. Domestic Economic Challenges: Not all Asian economies are uniform. Some may face domestic challenges like high inflation, political instability, or structural issues that could limit the upside potential of their currencies, even amid broader dollar weakness. Navigating these complex currency markets requires careful analysis and a diversified approach. Businesses engaged in international trade need robust hedging strategies to mitigate currency risk, while investors should consider the fundamental strength of individual economies rather than relying solely on broad regional trends. What Does This Mean for Emerging Markets Forex and Beyond? The implications of a potential Fed rate cut and subsequent dollar weakness extend significantly to emerging markets forex . These economies are often more sensitive to global capital flows and the strength of the U.S. Dollar: Capital Inflows: A weaker dollar and lower U.S. yields tend to encourage capital to flow into emerging markets, seeking higher returns. This can boost local asset prices, support economic growth, and strengthen local currencies. Reduced External Debt Burden: Many emerging market countries and corporations have borrowed heavily in U.S. Dollars. A weaker dollar makes it cheaper to service and repay these debts in local currency terms, freeing up resources for domestic investment. Potential for Policy Space: With less pressure from a strong dollar, emerging market central banks may gain more flexibility to manage their own monetary policies, potentially allowing for rate cuts to support domestic growth without triggering currency depreciation. However, this is not a universal boon. Some emerging markets may face inflationary pressures from increased capital inflows or commodity price hikes. The impact on emerging markets forex is diverse, depending on each country’s economic structure, debt levels, and policy responses. Indirectly, this ‘risk-on’ environment in traditional finance can spill over into cryptocurrency markets, as investors might seek higher returns in alternative assets when traditional yields become less attractive. Compelling Summary: A New Chapter for Global Finance The financial world stands at a pivotal juncture, driven by the anticipated Fed rate cut and its cascading effects across global markets. We are witnessing a significant rebalancing, where the long-standing dominance of the U.S. Dollar is experiencing a measured retreat, offering a more positive Asia FX outlook . This shift, born from moderating inflation and evolving economic conditions, creates a dynamic environment in currency markets . While US Dollar weakness presents clear opportunities for capital flows into emerging markets forex and reduced debt burdens, it also brings inherent risks from volatility and geopolitical uncertainties. For investors and market watchers alike, understanding these interconnected forces is paramount to navigating the evolving landscape of global finance and anticipating its broader implications, even for nascent sectors like cryptocurrency.

The tweet included a chart displaying the performance of major cryptocurrencies alongside community comments reflecting on both the past and the potential future of the sector. Crypto in 2030 pic.twitter.com/VkaFR9lJiQ — borovik (@3orovik) September 14, 2025 Bitcoin’s Position in 2030 The chart posted alongside Borovik’s tweet presented Bitcoin with a reported market capitalization of $40.07 trillion at $2.01 million per BTC. This figure illustrates the magnitude of change envisioned for the market, with Bitcoin maintaining a leading position among all digital assets. The projection indicates an increase not just in value, but also in its share of the global financial system, consistent with an X user’s remark about Bitcoin potentially surpassing gold. XRP, Ethereum, and Other Assets The graphic also displayed Ethereum with a valuation of $80,929 and a market capitalization of $9.77 trillion, while XRP was shown trading at $53.76 with a market capitalization of $3.20 trillion. These figures suggest significant growth across multiple major cryptocurrencies, indicating expectations of broader adoption and institutional involvement by the end of the decade. Other leading assets in the projection included Solana at $4,230 with a $2.29 trillion market capitalization, Binance Coin at $16,170 with $2.25 trillion, Dogecoin at $4.92 with $743.82 billion, and TRON at $6.07 with $574.98 billion. The chart showed consistent upward performance, reflecting optimistic sentiment surrounding future price levels across the wider market. Reflections on the Early Days of Crypto Commenting on the post, X user Penn Nguyen recalled opening an old laptop and finding a browser tab still active on AllChains.info, a website that once listed the top cryptocurrency chains. At that time, only Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Namecoin were featured. Nguyen noted that Bitcoin was priced at approximately $13 during that period, remarking on the scale of change since those early days. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The recollection highlighted how the cryptocurrency market has developed from a small collection of assets into a multi-trillion-dollar sector. The reference to earlier projects, such as Namecoin and Litecoin, emphasizes how much the industry has shifted, with many early competitors no longer holding leading positions. Borovik’s post combined forward-looking projections with reflections on the early stages of digital assets. Zeff’s prediction that Bitcoin could surpass gold in market capitalization by 2030 presented a vision of global financial transformation, while Penn Nguyen’s memory underscored the growth that has already occurred within the space. The accompanying chart, illustrating trillion-dollar valuations for multiple leading cryptocurrencies, conveyed the scale of expectations among certain community members regarding the next chapter of digital asset adoption.

Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank's global head of digital asset research, said that Ethereum would benefit more from acquisitions by DAT companies than Bitcoin and Solana. According to Kendrick's data, DATs currently hold 4% of all Bitcoin, 3.1% of Ethereum, and 0.8% of Solana. This size means the success or failure of treasuries could have a significant impact on coin prices. Kendrick noted that the primary reason for the recent valuation squeeze for DATs is market saturation. He said the success of DATs going forward will depend on three key factors: financing cost, size, and yield. Kendrick stated that Ethereum and Solana treasuries can reach higher valuations compared to Bitcoin-focused DATs thanks to staking returns, and noted that Ethereum has an advantage over Solana in this area because ETH treasuries are more established. The report also noted that if some DATs trade below their asset value for an extended period, consolidation could arise. It argued that such mergers are more likely, particularly in Bitcoin treasuries, but that this would likely lead to a redistribution of existing assets rather than generating new demand. DAT companies have faced significant declines in their share prices in recent weeks, raising questions about their sustainable purchasing power in the markets. These companies need to trade above their market capitalization to raise new funds and continue accumulating crypto assets. Related News: Big Whales Are Quite Active: Here Are Their Altcoin Trading Activities in Recent Hours Kendrick, noting the relative resilience of Ethereum-focused DATs, explained that BitMine Immersion (BMNR), the largest ETH treasury traded on the NYSE American, has continued its purchases after receiving approval for its strategy and currently holds over 2 million ETH. This amount corresponds to approximately 5% of the total supply. Kendrick concluded his assessment with the following statements: “From a relative perspective, we expect DATs to be a stronger price-supporting factor in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin and Solana.” *This is not investment advice.

At the same time, Robinhood is seeking SEC approval for a new venture fund that would list on the NYSE and give retail investors access to early-stage companies, a space traditionally limited to institutions. Gemini and SEC Reach a Deal The long-running legal battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Gemini Trust Company seems to be approaching a close after the two parties filed a joint status update in federal court. The filing was submitted to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the SEC and Gemini informed the court that they reached a “resolution in principle” in the securities case that was first brought against Gemini and Genesis Global Capital in January of 2023. Both sides requested that litigation in the matter be indefinitely stayed, pending commission review and approval. There is also an agreement to provide another status report if no resolution is finalized by Dec. 15. (Source: SDNY) The SEC’s 2023 complaint accused Genesis and Gemini of engaging in an unregistered offer and sale of securities through the Gemini Earn Program between February 2021 and November 2022. The program allegedly raised billions of dollars in crypto assets from US retail investors, who were promised interest payments without the companies registering the product under securities law. The regulator argued that investors were deprived of critical disclosures required by law and were instead given only partial and inadequate information. The SEC further claimed that participants did not have the material facts needed to make informed investment decisions. The case already saw some major developments. In 2024, the SEC announced a $21 million settlement with Genesis, while in February of that same year, under acting chair Mark Uyeda, the agency notified Gemini that it will not recommend pursuing an enforcement action tied to a separate investigation. This latest filing suggests that Gemini is now on the verge of closing the chapter on its own securities dispute with the commission. At the same time, Gemini continued to deepen its political and financial profile despite its legal issues. The firm’s co-founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, were major backers of Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and have maintained close ties with his administration. The twins even attended the signing of the GENIUS stablecoin bill and lobbied the White House to reconsider the nomination of Brian Quintenz as chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Recently released text exchanges from July showed discussions between Quintenz and the Winklevosses over enforcement assurances tied to his stalled nomination. Meanwhile, Gemini moved ahead with its initial public offering last week, and raised roughly $425 million from the sale of 15.2 million shares. Robinhood Seeks SEC Nod for VC Fund Meanwhile, Robinhood is looking to open up the world of venture capital to everyday investors with a new fund that could give retail traders access to opportunities that are usually reserved for institutions and the wealthy. On Monday, the brokerage revealed it filed a Form N-2 with the SEC to register shares of the Robinhood Ventures Fund I (RVI), which would be managed by its newly formed subsidiary, Robinhood Ventures DE. If approved, the shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and available for trading through participating brokerage platforms. The company said the fund will target firms “at the frontiers of their respective industries,” but did not identify specific sectors. Venture capital typically focuses on high-growth fields like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and Web3, areas where Robinhood has already been expanding. In the past few years, the brokerage added cryptocurrency trading, acquired exchange Bitstamp, and purchased Canadian crypto firm WonderFi for $179 million. It also experimented with tokenization, offering tokenized stocks and developing private stock tokens, which has attracted some scrutiny from people who are concerned about potential regulatory challenges. This latest plan comes as venture capital funding is rebounding strongly. According to S&P Global , global VC investment reached $189.3 billion in the first half of 2025, up from $152.4 billion in the same period last year. Artificial intelligence startups led the surge, but crypto has also seen a sharp comeback, with $10 billion raised in the second quarter alone, the strongest performance since 2022. Tokenization, stablecoin infrastructure, and decentralized finance have been central themes in the sector’s growth. Monthly VC investments (Source: S&P Global ) For retail investors, however, access to these high-risk, high-reward early-stage deals has long been restricted by US securities laws, which generally limit participation to accredited investors. Robinhood’s proposed venture fund will offer a rare chance for retail traders to gain indirect exposure to a class of investments that has historically been closed off to them.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-16 05:30:00

Whale distributions, seasonal volatility, and persistent macro uncertainty have combined to force capital elsewhere in the market. Inflows into XRP and Solana are accelerating, signaling a fresh stage in the rotation cycle as investors search for higher growth opportunities outside of BTC. Analysts argue that such shifts are healthy, setting the stage for broader altcoin season strength and igniting speculative interest in new entrants. Among the projects positioned to benefit is MAGACOIN FINANCE , where projections of a 58× run-up have drawn thousands of wallets into its presale. Bitcoin’s Selling Pressure Mounts Whale Exits and Seasonal Risks On-chain trackers show that long-term holders have been distributing Bitcoin aggressively in early September, unloading billions in profit after a summer of strength. A single whale sale of roughly $2.6 billion last week triggered a cascading $310 million liquidation wave , reinforcing how vulnerable the market remains when liquidity thins. September has historically been one of Bitcoin’s weakest months, with negative returns recorded in six of the last eight years. ETF Flows Highlight Sentiment Divide ETF data highlights a sharp divergence. Ethereum-linked funds saw $788 million in outflows in the past week, while Bitcoin ETFs recorded $246 million in net inflows . While institutions are still allocating to BTC, the lack of corresponding price strength suggests retail selling and whale profit-taking are outweighing inflows. For traders, this combination has created uncertainty and volatility, sparking renewed appetite for altcoins. XRP: Positioning for Regulatory and ETF Catalysts XRP has emerged as a prime beneficiary of Bitcoin’s recent weakness. With the SEC expected to deliver decisions on pending ETF applications in the coming months, traders are positioning for a possible approval that could dramatically expand XRP’s investor base. Daily trading volumes have spiked, and large whale wallets continue to accumulate. Analysts argue XRP’s unique legal clarity, having won a partial court victory in 2023, gives it an advantage compared to many other altcoins. If ETF approval materializes, XRP could secure inflows at a pace similar to Ethereum’s post-ETF era, making it a strong rotational play. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Trust and Scarcity Drive Narrative The rotation into alternative assets has created fertile ground for MAGACOIN FINANCE , a presale project riding momentum from political branding and early community traction. Thousands of wallets have already applied the PATRIOT50X bonus code , boosting allocations by 50% extra tokens . But what truly sets it apart is trust: the project is audit-approved by both HashEx and CertiK , a dual stamp of legitimacy rarely achieved by early-stage tokens. Combined with scarcity-driven presale rounds, these factors have positioned MAGACOIN FINANCE as a cultural and financial narrative in its own right. Analysts projecting a 58× upside argue that it could mirror Ethereum’s early breakout years, when narrative and legitimacy combined to fuel generational gains. For many traders, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another presale, it’s being framed as a once-in-a-cycle opportunity . Solana: Retail Activity Fuels Momentum Solana is also seeing renewed inflows, supported by strong activity across DeFi and NFT sectors. Transaction volume on Solana-based decentralized exchanges rose sharply in early September, while new wallet creation remains near all-time highs. Retail enthusiasm for Solana meme coins, combined with consistent ecosystem upgrades, has reinforced confidence in its scalability. Analysts note that Solana’s blend of speed, cost efficiency, and cultural adoption gives it a unique position in the market. With Bitcoin losing dominance, Solana is increasingly seen as the “risk-on” platform of choice for both retail and institutional players. Macro Environment: Why Rotation Matters The shift away from Bitcoin reflects broader macro dynamics. Sticky inflation, weaker U.S. jobs numbers, and uncertainty around Federal Reserve rate cuts are pressuring risk assets. While Bitcoin remains the benchmark, its volatility and seasonal weakness have prompted investors to explore alternatives. In this environment, altcoins with clear narratives, regulatory catalysts, or cultural resonance become attractive. Rotation is also technical. Bitcoin dominance has slipped toward 57%, and analysts expect further downside. Historically, once dominance dips below 55%, altcoins often rally in unison. That dynamic is already visible as liquidity migrates to XRP, Solana, and presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Capture the Rotation Dual Audit Approval : Certification from both HashEx and CertiK enhances credibility, setting it apart from speculative peers. Scarcity and Bonus Mechanics : With PATRIOT50X codes boosting allocations by 50%, urgency is baked into participation. Cultural Branding : Politically charged identity helps MAGACOIN FINANCE attract both grassroots and whale support. Rotation Tailwind : As Bitcoin’s dominance wanes, speculative capital seeks fresh stories, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as the breakout presale. Conclusion Bitcoin’s latest sell-off has accelerated the long-anticipated rotation toward altcoins. With whales distributing and seasonal weakness weighing on BTC, investors are redirecting flows into projects with stronger catalysts. XRP offers regulatory clarity and ETF potential, Solana benefits from retail adoption and ecosystem growth, while MAGACOIN FINANCE combines scarcity, cultural branding, and dual audit approval to create a rare early-stage opportunity . As projections of a 58× run-up circulate, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a focal point for traders seeking not only profits but participation in one of 2025’s defining narratives. In a market where legitimacy and story matter as much as technology, it is uniquely positioned to thrive in the next phase of the cycle.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-20-per-xrp-is-closer-than-you-think-heres-why/,"Market Strategist Levi has predicted that XRP, the third-largest crypto by market cap, could realistically reach $20. In a recent tweet accompanied by a video, Levi stated, “$20 Per XRP Is CLOSER Than You Think!” He supported this prediction by referencing both historical price movements and present-day market factors. Levi began by highlighting the supply shock XRP experienced in 2017. At that time, the asset rose from around $0.20 to more than $3.38. According to him, that rally was driven by retail participation, fear of missing out, and early institutional interest, particularly from banks experimenting with Ripple’s cross-border payment technology . He suggested that conditions in today’s market show similarities that could potentially set the stage for another such cycle. $20 Per XRP Is CLOSER Than You Think! pic.twitter.com/t7iUOgAd8A — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 14, 2025 Indicators of Supply Contraction In the video, Levi focused on exchange reserve data, noting a 5.66% drop in XRP reserves held on trading platforms. He explained that as coins move off exchanges, the available liquidity in the market contracts, which may create upward pressure on price if demand holds steady or increases. Levi also pointed out that this trend could accelerate if more institutional vehicles, such as exchange-traded funds, begin accumulating positions. He further noted that ETFs have a strong probability of participation in the market, which he estimated at 95 percent. Alongside this, Levi mentioned the role of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, which he said had already processed around $1.3 trillion in volume. This level of adoption, in his view, adds structural demand that was not present to the same extent during earlier cycles. Short-Term and Midterm Projections Levi acknowledged that some market observers see XRP moving toward $6 in the short term. However, he emphasizes the midterm outlook. He argued that the combination of shrinking exchange reserves, potential ETF activity, and macroeconomic shifts such as interest rate cuts could support a scenario where XRP rallies significantly beyond those near-term targets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He expressed confidence in a higher trajectory, stating that a $20 XRP bull run is a likely possibility if multiple rate cuts materialize. Levi tied this directly to how looser monetary policy could benefit risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by improving liquidity conditions and increasing investor appetite for higher-yield opportunities. Levi’s analysis ties together historical precedent, current supply dynamics, institutional demand factors, and macroeconomic trends. He sees the present conditions as supportive of an outcome where XRP moves above its current price levels, potentially reaching $20. His perspective builds on the past example of the 2017 rally but integrates new elements such as exchange-traded fund participation and large-scale ODL usage. By combining these factors, Levi positions his outlook as a data-driven case for significant upside potential in XRP.

XRP’s $3.10 Battle Could Decide It,https://coinpaper.com/11036/fakeout-or-foreshadowing-xrp-s-3-10-battle-could-decide-it,"XRP Battles Key Resistance at $3.10: Fakeout or Fuel for a Bigger Breakout? XRP’s price action has once again placed the cryptocurrency in the spotlight, as it briefly pierced above the critical $3.10 resistance before slipping back below it. The move has sparked fears among traders of a classic fakeout, a failed breakout that traps buyers and opens the door to short-term downside. Yet, according to market analyst Shaminem, beneath the drama lies a setup that still favors the bulls, provided certain conditions are met. The $3.10 Resistance: Why It Matters The $3.10 level has become a key battleground for XRP. Breaking above this price would not only signal strength but also pave the way for a potential push toward the next upside target around $3.40 or higher. However, for the breakout to be considered legitimate, XRP needs to reclaim $3.10 with conviction. That means strong trading volume and, importantly, a daily close above the level. Without these, momentum may falter, leaving the door open for sellers to reassert control. Shaminem pointed out , “XRP is at a decision point. A strong close above $3.10 could fire up momentum for another leg higher. If bulls deliver volume and on-chain engagement now, the path toward $3.40+ is open.” Recent analysis also shows that the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency is also eyeing a $3.60 breakout if buying interest persists. Signs of Cooling Momentum Adding to concerns is the recent decline in on-chain activity. Data shows XRP transactions have dropped sharply from a recent peak of 11.7 million, a sign that user activity and network demand may be cooling off. On-chain health often acts as a leading indicator for price momentum, and the dip in activity raises questions about whether XRP has the fuel to sustain a move higher. For the bullish case to remain intact, Shaminem stresses that transaction growth will need to reverse and show renewed strength. The Safety Net: Support Levels to Watch Despite the pullback, XRP’s technical foundation still looks relatively stable. Key support zones are positioned at approximately $2.81, aligned with the exponential moving average (EMA), and near $2.50, where the 200-day moving average (MA) provides a longer-term safety net. As long as XRP holds these levels, downside risk is considered manageable. A clean defense of these supports would suggest that the broader uptrend remains intact, even if short-term volatility persists. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at the psychological price of $3, according to CoinGecko data . The Bullish Path Forward For bulls, the roadmap is clear: reclaim $3.10 with volume, secure a decisive daily close above it, and reignite on-chain activity. If these factors align, XRP could quickly gather momentum for a rally toward $3.40 or beyond. Such a move would not only invalidate the fakeout fears but also strengthen confidence that XRP is entering a new phase of market expansion. Conclusion XRP’s pullback below $3.10 has sparked uncertainty, but strong support suggests the battle isn’t over. All eyes are on $3.10, if bulls reclaim it with conviction, renewed momentum could drive the next leg higher.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-16 05:41:23

At the same time, it’s been sinking against every other major currency, setting off alarms from India to Mexico. But oh this isn’t some weird fluke, it’s exactly how Beijing wants it right now, and it’s already pissing off China’s biggest trading partners. While the offshore yuan has gained 3% against the dollar this year, it’s dropped more than 10% against the euro, 5% against the pound, and 3% against the yen. That divergence has made Chinese exports dirt cheap outside the U.S., just as shipments to America keep shrinking. China’s own customs data show the U.S. took less than 10% of Chinese exports in August, down from 15% last year. At the same time, exports to Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia are climbing fast. Beijing holds the line on rate cuts while Fed gets ready to slash The People’s Bank of China has refused to follow the Federal Reserve’s expected rate cut this week, which traders are pricing at a 94.2% chance, based on CME Group’s FedWatch tool. The Fed is widely expected to lower its key rate by 25 basis points. That would narrow the yield gap between U.S. and Chinese debt, boosting demand for Chinese assets just as global investors rotate into emerging markets. But Beijing is stuck. The CSI 300 Index has already surged 43% since September 2024, driven by state-led buying and retail investors ditching low-yield deposits. Any more easing could blow that bubble wide open. Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said the central bank is trapped between “fanning the flames” of a stock bubble and “worsening the growth slowdown.” Ting thinks they may go for a tiny 10-basis-point cut in the coming weeks, but only if the market cools down. Instead of pumping in fresh stimulus, the PBOC is steering the yuan higher by setting the daily fix stronger. On Monday, they pinned the midpoint at 7.1056, the strongest since last November. Tommy Xie, head of Asia macro research at OCBC Bank, said the yuan is “transitioning from prolonged stability to a carefully steered grind higher.” He expects the offshore yuan to land at 7.08 per dollar by year-end. That completely flips what most economists expected earlier this year, when they thought China would devalue the yuan to fight off U.S. tariffs. Even Goldman Sachs admitted the stronger fix could be a “goodwill gesture” to the Trump White House as trade talks grind on. The bank sees the onshore yuan hitting 7.0 by year-end. Currency drop triggers trade backlash from India and Mexico While the yuan-dollar rate looks clean, the freefall against other currencies is now drawing fire from trading partners. Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence, said: “The divergence of yuan’s appreciation against the dollar and depreciation against others is largely due to a weak dollar that’s unseen for many years.” Tianchen said the drop will help Chinese exporters as they move away from the U.S. and sell more to non-dollar markets. But not everyone’s happy. Larry Hu, chief economist at Macquarie, said the yuan’s real effective exchange rate, a measure that adjusts for inflation, is now the weakest since December 2011. That means Chinese goods are cheaper everywhere outside the U.S., and that’s blowing up China’s trade surplus with other countries. India is already pissed. The country logged a $77.7 billion trade deficit with China in just the first eight months of this year, 16% higher than last year. Now New Delhi wants the BRICS bloc to do something about it. Over in Mexico, the government is pushing to raise import tariffs on Asian vehicles to 50%, up from 20%, in a move clearly aimed at China. Stephen Jen, who runs Eurizon SLJ Capital, called it “opportunistic devaluation.” He said Beijing used the dollar’s collapse to quietly engineer a yuan devaluation against everyone else. “A more reasonably priced renminbi and a less predatory exchange rate policy would earn China some goodwill from the rest of the world,” Stephen said. That’s a polite way of saying the global backlash is already building, and Beijing knows it. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

If so, understanding the dynamics of BTC perpetual futures is absolutely essential. The long/short ratio for these futures provides a fascinating glimpse into collective trader sentiment, hinting at whether the market anticipates an upward or downward price movement for Bitcoin. What Does the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Reveal? The long/short ratio is a powerful indicator, showing the proportion of long positions (bets on price increase) versus short positions (bets on price decrease) among traders. When we look at the BTC perpetual futures data from the past 24 hours on the world’s top three cryptocurrency futures exchanges, ranked by open interest, a clear picture emerges. Overall, the sentiment leans slightly bearish: Overall: Long 48.92% / Short 51.08% Binance: Long 48.33% / Short 51.67% Bybit: Long 48.55% / Short 51.45% Gate.io: Long 50.55% / Short 49.45% This snapshot indicates that, across these major platforms, more traders are currently positioned for a price decline in Bitcoin than for a rise. Gate.io stands out as the only one with a slight bullish bias among the top three. Why is the BTC Perpetual Futures Market Leaning Short? You might be wondering why the sentiment for BTC perpetual futures is currently skewed towards short positions. Several factors can influence this. Recent price consolidation, macroeconomic uncertainties, or even specific technical resistance levels could lead traders to anticipate a pullback. It’s important to remember that these ratios reflect current market expectations. They are not predictions but rather a real-time aggregation of how a large segment of traders is positioning themselves. A prevailing short bias suggests a cautious or even bearish outlook among many participants in the BTC perpetual futures market. How Can Traders Utilize BTC Perpetual Futures Data? For savvy traders, the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio offers valuable insights. However, it’s crucial to use it as part of a broader analytical toolkit. Here are a few ways this data can be applied: Contrarian Indicator: Sometimes, an extreme imbalance in the ratio (either overwhelmingly long or short) can act as a contrarian signal. If too many traders are on one side, a reversal might be more likely as positions get squeezed. Confirmation Tool: If your own analysis points to a bearish outlook, a market-wide short bias in BTC perpetual futures could help confirm your conviction. Risk Management: Understanding the general sentiment can help you gauge the potential volatility and risk associated with your own positions. A heavily skewed market can be more prone to sharp moves. Always combine this data with other technical and fundamental analysis to make informed decisions for your BTC perpetual futures trading strategy. The Significance of Top Exchanges in BTC Perpetual Futures The data presented comes from Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io. These exchanges are not arbitrary choices; they represent the pinnacle of the cryptocurrency futures market due to their massive open interest and trading volumes. Their aggregated data provides a robust indicator of overall market sentiment for BTC perpetual futures . While the overall trend shows a slight short bias, the subtle differences between exchanges like Gate.io’s slight long lean highlight the nuances within the market. These variations can sometimes point to localized sentiment shifts or differing trader demographics on specific platforms. In conclusion, the current BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio suggests a cautious or slightly bearish sentiment among traders on leading exchanges. This metric is a powerful tool for understanding market psychology, but it should always be interpreted alongside other indicators. By paying attention to these shifts, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin’s potential price movements and refine your trading approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a BTC perpetual future? A BTC perpetual future is a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual futures don’t expire, making them popular for continuous trading. How is the long/short ratio calculated? The long/short ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total number or volume of open long positions by the total number or volume of open short positions on an exchange or across multiple exchanges. Does a high short ratio always mean Bitcoin’s price will fall? Not necessarily. While a high short ratio indicates more traders expect a price drop, it’s a sentiment indicator, not a guarantee. Extreme ratios can sometimes precede a ‘short squeeze,’ where price moves up sharply, forcing short sellers to cover their positions. Why are Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io important for this data? These exchanges are among the largest by open interest and trading volume for cryptocurrency futures. Their aggregated data offers a broad and significant representation of overall market sentiment for BTC perpetual futures . How often does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio change? The long/short ratio is constantly changing in real-time as traders open and close positions. The data presented here is a snapshot over a 24-hour period, but live data can fluctuate minute by minute. Did you find this analysis helpful?

European-listed firm Capital B has made a decisive move, securing substantial funding specifically for a Capital B Bitcoin investment . This bold step underscores a growing trend where established companies are increasingly recognizing the strategic value of digital assets. What’s Behind Capital B’s Massive Bitcoin Investment? Capital B recently announced a successful share offering, raising an impressive €58.1 million, equivalent to approximately $68.43 million. The primary purpose of these newly acquired funds is straightforward: to purchase Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t just a minor allocation; it’s a significant commitment from a publicly traded entity, signaling strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. The decision to raise capital explicitly for a Capital B Bitcoin investment reflects a strategic shift. Companies are now openly integrating digital assets into their treasury strategies or investment portfolios. This move by Capital B is a clear indicator that Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class, attracting serious institutional players. Why Are Companies Like Capital B Investing in BTC Now? Several factors are driving this institutional interest in Bitcoin. Firstly, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation, especially given the current global economic climate. Its decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive store of value. Inflation Hedge: Many see Bitcoin as “digital gold,” offering protection against currency debasement. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can diversify assets away from traditional fiat currencies and bonds. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth, appealing to companies seeking high-return opportunities. Technological Innovation: Investing in BTC also aligns companies with the cutting edge of financial technology and innovation. The transparency and efficiency of the Bitcoin network also play a role. For Capital B, this Capital B Bitcoin investment could be a strategic play to position itself at the forefront of the evolving digital economy. The Impact of Institutional Capital B Bitcoin Investment on the Market When a listed company like Capital B makes such a substantial move, it sends ripples through the entire cryptocurrency market. It lends credibility and legitimacy to Bitcoin, potentially encouraging other corporations to follow suit. This influx of institutional capital can have several positive effects: Increased Liquidity: More large-scale buyers contribute to a deeper and more stable market. Price Stability: While not eliminating volatility, institutional adoption can help stabilize prices over the long term by adding a steady demand source. Mainstream Acceptance: Each new corporate investment pushes Bitcoin further into the mainstream, reducing skepticism and increasing general acceptance. This development is not just about Capital B; it’s about the broader narrative of Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance. The Capital B Bitcoin investment serves as a powerful example for other European and global companies considering similar strategies. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? The trend of corporate Bitcoin holdings is accelerating. Companies like MicroStrategy pioneered this path, and now others, including Capital B, are joining in. This suggests a future where holding digital assets might become a standard practice for treasury management, rather than an outlier strategy. However, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. The price of Bitcoin can be volatile, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving. Companies undertaking a Capital B Bitcoin investment must have a robust strategy to manage these risks. This includes understanding market dynamics and having a clear long-term vision. For investors and enthusiasts, Capital B’s announcement is a testament to Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its increasing role in global finance. It reinforces the idea that digital assets are here to stay and are attracting serious capital from serious players. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from Capital B’s Move? Capital B’s decision offers valuable lessons for both individuals and businesses: Research is Key: Before any investment, thorough research into the asset and its potential risks is crucial. Long-Term Vision: Institutional investors often have a long-term perspective, which is vital in volatile markets. Diversification Matters: Even within a crypto portfolio, diversification across different assets can mitigate risk. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency space evolves rapidly. Keeping up with news and trends is essential. The Capital B Bitcoin investment isn’t just a headline; it’s a case study in how traditional finance is adapting to the digital age. A Glimpse into Bitcoin’s Institutional Future Capital B’s successful fundraising and explicit plan to acquire Bitcoin marks another significant milestone in the journey of cryptocurrency. This move not only validates Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset but also highlights the increasing confidence of European listed companies in its future. As more corporations follow this path, we can anticipate a more robust, stable, and widely accepted digital asset ecosystem.

Coinbase’s Base Network Takes Steps Toward Token Launch Armstrong articulated that the potential introduction of a network token could serve as a “powerful tool” to accelerate decentralization and foster growth among creators and developers within the ecosystem. Following the firm’s BaseCamp 2025 event in Vermont, the executive emphasized the importance of building in the open, stating that the exploration of this token aligns with their commitment to transparency and community engagement. Accompanying Armstrong’s announcement, the Base network published a blog post confirming its intention to explore a network token. The post highlighted that this exploration is in its early stages and does not come with definitive plans at this moment In addition to the token exploration, the blog post also unveiled an open-source bridge designed to enhance interoperability between Base and the Solana (SOL) blockchain as part of a broader initiative to facilitate seamless interactions across different chains. No Definitive Plans Yet When Base originally launched, its focus was clear: to establish a developer-friendly ecosystem capable of executing secure transactions at low costs. The introduction of a network token was not deemed necessary to meet these goals. However, with the successful achievement of sub-second and sub-cent transactions, as well as nearly one million active users according to Token Terminal data , the team aims to establish a more open and accessible on-chain economy. The network’s blog post noted that exploring this possibility is one avenue toward realizing their vision of a global on-chain economy, which could enhance decentralization and create more opportunities for builders and creators. While the exploration is in its nascent stages, the firm made it clear that there are no specific timelines, designs, or governance structures in place yet. In addition, the blog post reiterated three key commitments to the community: a continued dedication to the Ethereum blockchain , adherence to regulatory guidelines as a US-based company, and a focus on building transparently: If and when we move forward with a token, it will be grounded in principles, values, and in alignment with our long-term mission: to build a global economy that increases innovation, creativity, and freedom. In conclusion, Armstrong specified that this is not a definitive plan but rather an update to their philosophy as they consider the future of the network. When writing, Coinbase’s stock, which trades on the Nasdaq, has reached a valuation of $324. It is still in consolidation mode after dropping from its record high of $444 in July of this year.

Market analyst Ash Crypto recently highlighted several key factors, including demand and supply dynamics, a surge in US equities, and increasing inflows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs), suggesting that the current market conditions could favor Bitcoin’s resurgence. Market Makers Accused Of Manipulating Bitcoin Prices In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Ash pointed out that while US stocks are reaching new all-time highs, Bitcoin has struggled to break above the $117,000 mark, currently consolidating between $110,000 and $115,000. He argues that this situation is not indicative of weak demand, but rather the result of an alleged situation that is gaining strength among analysts: manipulation by market makers and exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Plunge Sparks Outrage: Binance Targeted For Alleged Market Manipulation The analyst further highlights that historical data show Bitcoin’s price movements were primarily driven by spot market activities. Buyers would purchase coins, absorbing supply and driving prices higher. However, today’s landscape is markedly different. Ash Crypto suggests that the introduction of futures and derivatives has transformed how Bitcoin is traded. He alleges that exchanges discovered that creating synthetic Bitcoin contracts is often more profitable than dealing in actual spot Bitcoin. The analyst notes that this shift allows undisclosed cryptocurrency exchanges to manipulate market movements using leverage and bypass the need for tangible Bitcoin. What Historical Patterns Suggest Ash pointed out that a situation indicative of this alleged manipulation was when Bitcoin recently touched $124,000, market makers and larger investors quickly shorted the asset through futures and exchange-traded funds. This triggered a wave of liquidations for bullish investors that predicted a new leg up, causing the price of Bitcoin to plummet to the $107,000 mark only two weeks ago. The analyst noted that although US equities are experiencing significant growth and liquidity is flooding into risk assets, Bitcoin is still caught in a cycle of manipulation that obscures its true value. Related Reading: The Big PEPE Price Breakout: Falling Wedge Pattern Points To 64% Rally In short, spot demand for Bitcoin continues to build, ETFs are steadily absorbing more coins, cryptocurrency exchange reserves are dwindling, and long-term holders are refraining from selling. However, Ash Crypto notes that the presence of futures and derivatives for the cryptocurrency creates an “illusion of weakness,” reportedly designed to shake out retail investors from current market levels. Despite the current challenges, he notes that the current bullish cycle remains intact. Historical patterns from 2017 and 2021 show that Bitcoin often experiences periods of suppression and sideways movement before exploding higher, suggesting a potential new price discovery phase ahead for BTC. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at around $114,969. It is still recording gains of nearly 3% and 6% in the seven- and fourteen-day time frames, respectively.

South Korean crypto exchange Upbit has issued an important notice regarding a temporary Upbit OM suspension for Mantra (OM) deposits and withdrawals. This crucial step is set to begin on September 17th at 3:00 a.m. UTC. The reason behind this action? A necessary network upgrade for the OM token. For many in the crypto community, understanding such announcements is key to managing their digital assets effectively and avoiding any unexpected disruptions. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader Mantra ecosystem. What Does the Upbit OM Suspension Entail for Users? Upbit’s official announcement clearly states that the suspension will affect both deposits and withdrawals of Mantra (OM). This means that from the specified time, users will not be able to: Deposit OM: Send OM tokens from an external wallet or another exchange to your Upbit account. Withdraw OM: Transfer OM tokens from your Upbit account to an external wallet or another exchange. It is important to remember that this is a temporary measure. Upbit is taking this step to ensure the smooth and secure transition of the Mantra network to its upgraded version. Planning any OM transactions before the deadline is a smart move to avoid inconvenience. Why Are Network Upgrades Crucial for Cryptocurrency Assets? You might be wondering why an exchange needs to suspend services for a network upgrade. Think of a network upgrade as a vital software update for your smartphone or computer. These updates are essential for improving performance, fixing bugs, and introducing new features. Similarly, blockchain network upgrades are fundamental to the long-term health and security of a cryptocurrency. They can bring about: Enhanced Security: Strengthening the network against potential threats. Improved Scalability: Allowing the network to handle more transactions efficiently. New Functionality: Introducing innovative features or smart contract capabilities. Better Performance: Making transactions faster and more reliable. Exchanges like Upbit play a critical role by supporting these upgrades, ensuring their platform is compatible with the new network, and protecting user assets during the transition. This commitment helps maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of the crypto space. Navigating the Upbit OM Suspension: Actionable Steps for OM Holders While the Upbit OM suspension might seem inconvenient, it is a necessary step for the Mantra network’s advancement. Here’s what OM holders should consider: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw OM, ensure you complete these transactions well before 3:00 a.m. UTC on September 17th. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Upbit’s official announcements for updates regarding the upgrade’s progress and when services will resume. Official channels are always the most reliable source of information. Avoid Attempts: Do not attempt to deposit or withdraw OM during the suspension period, as these transactions will likely fail and could potentially lead to loss of funds if not handled correctly. It’s worth noting that while deposits and withdrawals are suspended, trading of OM on Upbit may continue as usual, depending on the exchange’s specific policies during such events. Always verify the latest information directly from Upbit. The Broader Impact of This Upbit OM Suspension on the Mantra Ecosystem Every time a major exchange like Upbit supports a network upgrade with a temporary suspension, it sends a clear signal about the maturity and commitment of the token project.

Just a week after launch, the token has exploded across major exchanges. With listings on Binance, Upbit, and Bithumb, $AVNT surged to a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $1.5 , while trading volume ripped past $633M, according to CoinMarketCap. The Base-native token is already trading like a heavyweight. The speed of growth has stunned both traders and analysts. What is Avantis ($AVNT)? Avantis is being pitched as the on-chain perpetuals exchange built on Base. Think of Hyperliquid, but redesigned to be far more accessible. On Avantis, users can trade crypto, gold, FX, oil, equities, and even sports markets, all from one platform. No brokers. No middlemen. No settlement delays. It’s full decentralization applied to global trading. The vision: a single, borderless exchange where almost everything can be traded seamlessly. The Airdrop That Started It All $AVNT made headlines with its 12.5% airdrop last week. Thousands of users cashed in, with some walking away with six-figure sums. But the event wasn’t without controversy. Data from Bubblemaps revealed a suspicious pattern. One entity allegedly claimed $4M worth of $AVNT through a coordinated sybil attack. BREAKING: One entity claimed $4M from the $AVNT airdrop This sybil attack was coordinated, and spread across 300+ addresses pic.twitter.com/aWKuz52J4p — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) September 15, 2025 The attack was spread across 300+ wallets, all funded and managed in eerily similar ways. How the Attack Played Out Investigators flagged a repeating cycle: Wallets funded directly from Coinbase USDC moved in from a small group of connected addresses Tokens swapped on Avantis Airdrop claimed simultaneously Tokens consolidated into a few addresses Funds pushed onto Bybit and Gate at the same time The flow was too precise to be random. In fact, these wallets had been completely dormant until $AVNT went live. The activity mirrored patterns seen in previous sybil exploits, such as with $MYX. $AVNT hits a new ATH after triple listings on Binance, Upbit, and Bithumb. Launched just last week, AVNT is now live on nearly every major exchange, with volume surging past $633M. Full report by @KayyGilani https://t.co/QSJHRPmR7y pic.twitter.com/mu13VI9OSz — BeInCrypto (@beincrypto) September 15, 2025 The sybil attack doesn’t appear to have slowed momentum. If anything, the attention may have amplified Avantis’ debut. Traders seem more focused on the triple exchange listings and massive liquidity surge than on the controversy. Still, the incident highlights a recurring issue: airdrops remain a prime target for coordinated exploits. Despite advanced tracking tools and anti-sybil filters, whales continue to find ways around them. AVNT Market Snapshot Price (ATH): $1.19 ($1.5) 24h Volume: $633M Exchanges: Binance, Upbit, Bithumb (plus Bybit, Gate) Launch: Last week on Base Category: On-chain perpetuals (cross-asset trading) Why Avantis Surge Matters Avantis isn’t just another Base-native protocol. It’s trying to build a universal marketplace, something that goes beyond crypto. With decentralized access to commodities, stocks, and even sports markets, it blurs the line between DeFi and TradFi. The triple listing gave $AVNT the kind of visibility most projects never achieve in their first year. And with volume already over half a billion dollars, traders are treating Avantis as more than just a speculative play. But the airdrop drama shows how fragile early token launches can be. If Avantis wants to sustain momentum, it will need to prove it can secure its platform against sybil-style exploits while scaling access to its ambitious trading suite. Avantis has arrived fast, maybe too fast. In just a week, it went from a stealth Base project to trading at scale across global exchanges. The token now backed by explosive trading volume and aggressive listings. Yet, the airdrop controversy lingers. The $4M sybil grab casts a shadow over what should have been a flawless debut. For traders, the signal is clear: $AVNT is now on the map, and its rise is reshaping expectations of what Base-native protocols can achieve. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The report identified two cohorts that defined the threshold of illiquid supply. These were entities with Bitcoin that last moved seven or more years ago, and public companies holding at least 1,000 BTC. “We estimate that this combined group will hold over six million Bitcoin by the end of 2025 — or over 28% of the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist.” Illiquid Supply Growing Public companies currently hold more than 830,000 BTC, or 4% of the circulating supply, with 97% concentrated among companies holding more than 1,000 units. That number could be even higher, as BitcoinTreasuries reports that over 1.3 million BTC is held by public and private companies. When combining the supply of long-term holders with public company holdings, one can see an accelerating trend of holding Bitcoin versus trading or transacting, the researcher noted. He added that the rise in BTC adoption among public company treasuries has driven an uptick in illiquid supply since Q3 2024. New research piece from analyst Zack Wainwright where he digs deeper on bitcoin’s increasingly illiquid supply. One interesting aspect is the analysis of what public company accumulation could do to supply in the future. Check it out here for free: https://t.co/8eFwAYo0Yg — Chris Kuiper, CFA (@ChrisJKuiper) September 15, 2025 The report predicted that nearly 42% of the current circulating supply, or over 8.3 million BTC, will be considered illiquid by 2032. The researcher concluded that over time, the scarcity of Bitcoin may become the focal point as more entities buy and hold the asset long term. “If nation-state adoption increases and the regulatory environment surrounding Bitcoin continues to evolve, the growth of the illiquid supply could be even more dramatic.” Although the report did not mention it, the same is likely to be happening with Ethereum , as digital asset treasuries have scooped up more than 4% of the entire supply in just a few months. Since Ether ETFs launched last year, they have hoovered up more than 5.5% of the total supply. BTC Price Outlook Bitcoin has been in the red over the past day, falling back from a Monday high of $116,700 to just over $115,000 during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. The asset has been consolidating for almost a week and remains 7.2% down from its all-time high, so there has yet to be a major correction that was largely expected this month.

The stance made sense. Coinbase is a publicly traded company on NASDAQ under ticker $COIN , accountable to regulators and shareholders. But things are changing fast. At BaseCamp, Jesse Pollak, head of the Base ecosystem, revealed the team is exploring a network token. That admission, made publicly for the first time, could signal a historic shift. The timing isn’t random. Since Donald Trump took office, his administration has hinted at loosening restrictions around crypto. For Base, that could be the opening needed to step into territory previously seen as off-limits. Building the Bridge: Base Meets Solana Pollak laid out the vision clearly. “The goal of this bridge is to make it so you can build seamlessly across both Base and Solana with SOL, ERC-20s and SPL tokens.” The bridge unlocks three core features: Deposit and use SOL in any Base app Import any Solana token into Base apps Export Base tokens directly to Solana That’s a two-way highway connecting two of the fastest-growing ecosystems. It means developers aren’t siloed anymore. They can tap liquidity, users, and apps across both chains. Not Just Another Layer-2 Plenty of L2s compete for attention: Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync. But Base isn’t built the same. Coinbase owns it. That makes it the first major L2 with direct ties to Wall Street investors. That’s where the tension lies. How does a U.S.-listed company justify launching a token? What does that mean for compliance? For the Securities and Exchange Commission? And for the countless projects building on Base right now? This could become the biggest legitimization of tokens in U.S. history. Or it could turn into the wildest regulatory test case ever. The Numbers Behind Base Despite the uncertainty, Base has exploded in growth. The network now holds $4.8 billion in assets and manages over 200 million addresses, according to internal metrics. Pollak used BaseCamp to outline expansion plans, framing the potential token as a milestone in the network’s roadmap. A Base token, if approved, would cement its status not just as another scaling solution, but as a core pillar of Coinbase’s long-term strategy. Coinbase’s Stake in the Game Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has often stressed that the company wants to “bring a billion people on-chain.” Base is the vehicle for that vision. By owning the infrastructure, Coinbase isn’t just a centralized exchange anymore. It’s becoming the backbone for apps, wallets, and on-chain economies. A token launch would supercharge that mission. But it also raises the stakes. Shareholders may question the risks. Regulators could scrutinize every step. The industry will be watching. Binance Wallet Goes Live with Base Adding fuel to the momentum, Binance Wallet announced today that Base is live on its web wallet. That means millions of Binance users can now explore and trade Base tokens directly. Base is now live on #Binance Wallet (Web)! Explore and trade the latest Base tokens now Visit https://t.co/LFeLcYEnXK and select Base to get started. — Binance Wallet (@BinanceWallet) September 15, 2025 The integration gives Base instant global liquidity and visibility. For developers building tokens on Base, that’s massive. A listing pipeline from Base apps → Binance Wallet could bring new projects to market at speed. Voices Around the Ecosystem Pollak’s statement immediately set off a wave of reactions across X. Jesse Pollak himself posted about Base’s direction: welcome to BaseCamp https://t.co/62R2Wr2H54 — jesse.base.eth (@jessepollak) September 15, 2025 Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong echoed the message: We’re exploring a Base network token. It could be a great tool for accelerating decentralization and expanding creator and developer growth in the ecosystem. To be clear, there are no definitive plans. We’re just updating our philosophy. As of now, we’re exploring it. https://t.co/BK3asbMpar — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 15, 2025 Community members weighed in, with excitement and caution. One popular thread summed it up: BREAKING: Jesse Pollak announces that Base is launching a new bridge between Base and Solana “The goal of this bridge is to make it so you can build seamlessly across both Base and Solana with SOL, ERC-20s and SPL tokens” It lets you do 3 things – Deposit and use SOL in any… pic.twitter.com/oAIOj3ko7q — Jack (@Jack55750) September 15, 2025 The conversation reflects the moment. Is this the legitimization everyone has been waiting for, or a step into uncharted regulatory waters? If Base does launch a token, it won’t just be another asset on CoinMarketCap. It could mark a turning point in how U.S. companies approach on-chain networks. Coinbase’s involvement guarantees mainstream attention—and regulatory heat. For developers, the Solana bridge makes Base a more attractive hub. For users, Binance Wallet integration makes Base tokens easier to access. And for policymakers, this could become the case study they use to redefine token rules in America. One thing is clear: Base isn’t backing down. The question now is whether regulators, shareholders, and users are ready for what comes next. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

A recent forecast from Fidelity Digital Assets has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, highlighting a significant shift in the landscape of Bitcoin supply . This groundbreaking report projects that a substantial portion of Bitcoin will become effectively illiquid by the end of 2025, signaling profound implications for its future. Understanding the Illiquid Bitcoin Supply Phenomenon Fidelity Digital Assets, a reputable name in institutional crypto investment, recently published a comprehensive report shedding light on Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Their analysis indicates that approximately 28% of the total Bitcoin supply will be out of active circulation by the close of 2025. This isn’t just a fleeting statistic; it represents a growing trend with long-term consequences for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What exactly contributes to this increasing illiquidity? The report identifies two primary drivers: Long-Term Dormant Addresses: These are Bitcoin addresses that have shown no activity for over seven years. They represent early adopters or long-term holders who have not moved their coins, indicating a strong conviction or potentially lost access. Publicly Traded Companies: A rising number of public companies are adding significant amounts of Bitcoin to their balance sheets, holding at least 1,000 BTC. These corporate holdings are typically strategic, long-term investments, further removing coins from immediate trading. By combining the holdings from these two categories, Fidelity estimates that over 6 million BTC will be held in these illiquid states by year-end. This figure is particularly impactful when considering Bitcoin’s finite total supply of 21 million coins. What Does a Shrinking Bitcoin Supply Mean for Investors? The concept of a shrinking liquid Bitcoin supply is a critical factor for both current and prospective investors. In economics, scarcity often drives value. When fewer units of an asset are available for purchase, and demand remains constant or increases, the price typically responds positively. This principle is at the heart of Bitcoin’s design, with its fixed supply cap and halving events. For investors, this trend suggests several potential benefits: Increased Scarcity: As more Bitcoin is held off-market, the available supply for trading diminishes, potentially creating upward pressure on its price. Long-Term Confidence: The accumulation by long-term holders and public companies signals growing institutional confidence and a belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): While Bitcoin is known for its volatility, a larger base of long-term holders could, in theory, lead to more stable price action over time as fewer coins are subject to short-term trading whims. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges. A significantly illiquid market could lead to wider bid-ask spreads and potentially less efficient price discovery in the short term. Yet, the overwhelming sentiment leans towards the positive implications of increased scarcity. Projecting Future Bitcoin Supply Dynamics Beyond 2025 Fidelity’s analysis doesn’t stop at 2025. Their projections extend further into the future, offering a glimpse of what the Bitcoin supply landscape might look like in the coming years. The report forecasts that these combined illiquid holdings could surge to an astounding 8.3 million BTC by 2032. This long-term outlook underscores a fundamental shift in how Bitcoin is being perceived and utilized globally. This steady increase in illiquid Bitcoin suggests a maturation of the asset class. It moves beyond speculative trading and into a realm where it is viewed as a strategic reserve asset, similar to gold. The growing conviction among both individual “HODLers” and major corporations points to a future where a significant portion of Bitcoin will be held for decades, not days. Actionable Insight: For those considering an investment, this trend in Bitcoin supply reinforces the narrative of long-term holding. Understanding that a substantial portion of the asset is being locked away can inform investment strategies, emphasizing patience and a belief in its enduring value proposition. The Enduring Power of Bitcoin’s Scarcity The latest report from Fidelity Digital Assets provides a compelling narrative about the future of Bitcoin supply . The projected increase in illiquid holdings by year-end 2025 and beyond is not merely a statistic; it’s a testament to Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial system. As more Bitcoin is taken out of circulation by long-term holders and institutions, its inherent scarcity becomes even more pronounced. This trend could be a powerful catalyst for its continued growth and stability, solidifying its position as a digital store of value. Investors and enthusiasts alike should pay close attention to these dynamics, as they paint a vivid picture of Bitcoin’s promising future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “illiquid Bitcoin supply” mean? A1: Illiquid Bitcoin supply refers to the portion of Bitcoin that is not actively traded or available for immediate sale on exchanges. It’s held by long-term investors or entities with no immediate intention to sell. Q2: Who are the main contributors to this illiquid supply? A2: According to Fidelity’s report, the primary contributors are Bitcoin addresses dormant for over seven years (representing long-term holders) and publicly traded companies holding significant amounts of BTC (at least 1,000 BTC). Q3: How might this increasing illiquid Bitcoin supply impact its price? A3: A shrinking liquid supply, coupled with consistent or growing demand, typically leads to increased scarcity. This economic principle suggests potential upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price over the long term. Q4: Is the increase in illiquid Bitcoin supply a positive or negative trend? A4: Generally, it is viewed as a positive trend. It indicates growing conviction among holders, institutional adoption, and a maturation of Bitcoin as a strategic asset, reinforcing its value proposition as a store of value. Q5: What is Fidelity’s long-term projection for illiquid Bitcoin holdings? A5: Fidelity Digital Assets projects that combined illiquid holdings could increase to 8.3 million BTC by 2032, further solidifying Bitcoin’s status as a long-term asset. Share Your Insights!

As of September 14, 2025 , at 6:00 p.m. ET , BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) , a leading Bitcoin and Ethereum network company, announced its total crypto and cash holdings had reached approximately $10.771 billion . This significant figure solidifies BitMine’s position in the digital asset market, with a strategic focus on accumulating Ethereum (ETH) for long-term investment. The company’s holdings are a clear signal of its aggressive treasury strategy, positioning it as a major player in the institutional crypto space. The firm’s chairman, Thomas “Tom” Lee of Fundstrat , has publicly stated the company’s objective to acquire 5% of the total ETH supply , a goal referred to as the “alchemy of 5%.” This ambitious target underscores their conviction that Ethereum will be a foundational element for the next generation of financial systems and a major beneficiary of the ongoing convergence between Wall Street and AI on the blockchain. Breakdown of BitMine Immersion’s Crypto and Cash Holdings The total reported value of $10.771 billion is composed of several key assets, reflecting a diversified yet targeted approach to digital asset management. This detailed breakdown provides a clear picture for investors and market analysts. Ethereum (ETH) Holdings : The core of the company’s treasury is its 2,151,676 ETH tokens , valued at $4,632 per ETH as of the reporting date. This makes BitMine the #1 Ethereum treasury in the world . Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings : In addition to its primary ETH focus, BitMine holds 192 Bitcoin . Strategic Equity Investments (“Moonshots”) : The company’s portfolio includes a $214 million stake in Eightco (NASDAQ:ORBS) , a strategic investment aligned with their long-term growth and treasury strategy. Unencumbered Cash : The treasury is supported by $569 million in unencumbered cash, providing liquidity and financial flexibility for future operations and acquisitions. This asset composition places BitMine as the #2 global crypto treasury overall, trailing only Strategy Inc. (MSTR) , which holds over 638,460 BTC valued at $74 billion . BitMine’s (BMNR) Market Performance and Institutional Backing Beyond its asset treasury, BitMine Immersion (BMNR) has established itself as a highly liquid and widely traded stock, attracting a premier group of institutional investors who believe in its long-term strategy. Trading Volume : According to Fundstrat data, BMNR has an average daily trading dollar volume of $2.0 billion (5-day average as of September 12, 2025 ). US Stock Ranking : This trading volume ranks BMNR as the 28th most traded stock in the U.S. among 5,704 listed stocks, placing it ahead of major companies like Arista Networks and just behind Eli Lilly . Institutional Investors : BitMine’s strategy is supported by a notable list of institutional and personal investors, including ARK’s Cathie Wood , MOZAYYX , Founders Fund , Bill Miller III , Pantera , Kraken , DCG , Galaxy Digital , and personal investor Thomas “Tom” Lee . These strategic partnerships and high trading liquidity underscore the market’s growing confidence in BitMine’s Ethereum-centric business model. Frequently Asked Questions Why is BitMine Immersion (BMNR) focusing on Ethereum over Bitcoin for its corporate treasury? BitMine Immersion has made a strategic decision to focus on Ethereum (ETH) because its chairman, Thomas “Tom” Lee , and the company’s leadership believe that the convergence of Wall Street and AI on the blockchain is creating a “supercycle” for Ethereum . They see ETH as the primary beneficiary of this trend, given its role as the leading platform for smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and tokenized assets, which they project will drive the financial system’s transformation over the next 10-15 years . What is the “alchemy of 5%” and why is it a key goal for BitMine? The “alchemy of 5%” is the term BitMine uses to describe its long-term goal of acquiring 5% of the total circulating supply of Ethereum . This objective is central to their treasury strategy, as they believe that becoming a large holder of ETH will create a “power law benefit” and provide reflexive value. By accumulating a significant share of the supply, BitMine aims to reinforce Ethereum’s economic security, which could attract more institutional capital and further solidify its position as a dominant digital asset. How does BitMine’s business model differ from other crypto companies like MicroStrategy (MSTR)? While MicroStrategy (MSTR) has a core strategy of accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) as its primary treasury asset, BitMine Immersion’s (BMNR) model is specifically focused on accumulating Ethereum (ETH) . This strategic distinction reflects a fundamental difference in their market thesis. BitMine views Ethereum not just as a store of value but as the core platform for a future token economy driven by AI and institutional adoption, making its business model centered on the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem itself. Conclusion The latest announcement from BitMine Immersion Technologies signals a new milestone in the institutional adoption of digital assets. With total holdings approaching $11 billion and a definitive position as the world’s largest Ethereum treasury, the company is executing a bold, forward-thinking strategy. The convergence of traditional finance and AI on the blockchain is creating a unique market environment, and BitMine’s focused accumulation of ETH demonstrates a clear bet on Ethereum as a transformative macro trade for the coming decade. Investors and market participants should closely follow BMNR’s progress, as its ability to acquire and hold a significant portion of the ETH supply could be a bellwether for the future of institutional crypto investment.

The company made the initiative through an oversubscribed private investment in public equity (PIPE) offering of common stock at $6.88 per share. It also included stapled warrants exercisable at $10.134 for three years. Helius Medical Technologies agreed to raise $500 million in equity and up to $750 million in warrants, assuming full exercise. The firm revealed that the funds will be used to establish a crypto treasury strategy with the Solana token as its main reserve asset. Helius seeks to leverage yield-generating properties of Solana The initiative is led by venture capital firms Pantera Capital and Summer Capital, and participation is also from other companies like Avenir, Big Brian Holdings, FalconX, Arrington Capital, Animoca Brands, and HashKey Capital, among others. The neurotech company revealed that the offering will close on or around Thursday. Helius said it chose Solana for its historically fast growth, which leads the industry in transaction revenue and processes more than 3,500 transactions per second. The digital asset has also been widely adopted, with around 3.7 million daily active wallets and over 23 billion transactions year to date. The neurotech firm added that Solana offers a ~7% native staking yield compared to non-yield-bearing assets like BTC. Helius revealed that it wants to leverage Solana’s native yield-generating properties to capture opportunities in DeFi. “We believe that Solana is a category-defining blockchain and the foundation on which a new financial system will be built.” – Dan Morehead , Founder and Managing Partner of Pantera Capital. Morehead hopes that the initiative will help Helius substantially increase institutional and retail access to the Solana ecosystem and help fuel its adoption worldwide. The company also appointed Joseph Chee as director and executive chairman, Cosmo Jiang as board observer, and Dan Morehead as strategic advisor. Cosmo Jiang, general partner at Pantera Capital, believes that there’s an opportunity to create shareholder value, which Michael Saylor pioneered with Strategy by accelerating Solana adoption. He revealed that he has experience in participating in the strategy at Twenty One Capital with Tether, Softbank, Cantor, Bitmine (BNMR) with Tom Lee, and EightCo with Dan Ives and Sam Altman. Joseph Chee, founder and chairman of Summer Capital, believes that all capital market transactions, from tokenization to payments, are moving onto the blockchain. He said Helius aims to bridge public markets with the Solana network, where the company expects most activity to occur. Helius plans to scale its SOL treasury position Helius plans to build an initial SOL position and expand its holdings over the next 12-24 months. The scaling initiative will include a capital markets program incorporating ATM sales and other proven strategies. The company is also evaluating staking, lending, and other opportunities in the ecosystem to generate revenue from the SOL Treasury. Helius will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker HSDT following the closing of the offering. Its updated treasury strategy will also take effect at that time. The company hopes to maintain transparency in its holdings and strong engagement with the SOL ecosystem and community. Helius will also reveal updates on the offering, SOL acquisitions, treasury growth, relevant stockholder approvals, and governance measures in the coming weeks. Helius’ stock price has surged by more than 141.67% at the time of publication to $18.27. Solana has plummeted by 3.52% in the last 24 hours and is exchanging hands at around $235.

As of September 16, 2025 , the investment outlook for XRP (XRP) is a subject of significant debate among financial analysts and crypto investors, especially with a highly anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon. The price of XRP is currently trading around ₹263.02 , but its future trajectory hinges on a mix of macroeconomic factors, market sentiment, and its unique utility in the global financial system. XRP CHART – COINSTATS How Does a Fed Rate Cut Impact Cryptocurrencies like XRP? A Federal Reserve interest rate cut is a major macroeconomic event that influences asset classes across the board, including cryptocurrencies. Historically, lower interest rates tend to weaken the U.S. dollar and increase market liquidity, which often drives capital into more speculative, high-growth assets. Increased Liquidity: A rate cut makes borrowing cheaper, leading to more money flowing into the economy. A portion of this liquidity frequently finds its way into assets with higher risk-reward profiles, such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including XRP . Weakening Dollar: As the Fed lowers rates, the U.S. dollar can lose value relative to other global currencies. This can make cryptocurrencies, which are often viewed as alternative stores of value, more attractive to both institutional and retail investors seeking to hedge against currency depreciation. Market Consensus: There is a near-unanimous expectation among analysts for a Federal Reserve rate cut at the September 16-17, 2025 , meeting, with a 99% probability of at least a 25-basis-point reduction. This anticipation is a key driver for current market sentiment and could lead to a short-term boost for crypto assets. Is Now a Good Time to Buy XRP? Analyst and Market Sentiment Insights The question of whether to invest in XRP now divides experts. While some see the current price as a compelling entry point, others advise caution due to potential short-term volatility. Bullish Arguments: Proponents of buying XRP believe the token is poised for appreciation due to its growing utility and renewed institutional interest following the resolution of its legal battles. They view the current price as a strong opportunity, especially if the broader crypto market rallies on the news of a Fed rate cut. Bearish/Neutral Arguments: Skeptics highlight that much of the rate cut’s impact may already be “priced in” by the market. If the Fed only delivers the expected cut without signaling further easing, markets could see a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” reaction, leading to profit-taking and a price dip. Market Sentiment: According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , market sentiment is currently Neutral with a score of 53 . This indicates a balanced market that is neither overly greedy nor fearful. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP also remains in the 30-70 neutral zone, suggesting that the price is not overbought or oversold and is trending sideways. How is the XRP Ledger and Ripple’s Technology Driving Real-World Use Cases? XRP is not merely a speculative asset; its core investment thesis is built on its utility within the Ripple ecosystem. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is designed for fast, low-cost international transactions, and its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service is being adopted by a growing number of financial institutions. Real-Time Payments: Ripple’s ODL service leverages XRP as a bridge currency, allowing financial firms to conduct cross-border payments in seconds, as opposed to the days it can take with traditional systems like SWIFT . Institutional Adoption: Post-legal clarity, Ripple has expanded its partnerships, leading to increased institutional use of XRP . Large-scale buying by institutional players is a key driver for the token’s long-term value. Future Catalysts: A major catalyst for XRP’s price in late 2025 is the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF in the U.S. . This would open the floodgates for new institutional and retail capital, providing a significant boost to its market capitalization. What is the long-term potential for an investment in XRP? The long-term potential for XRP is heavily tied to its continued adoption for cross-border payments and the broader maturation of the crypto market. While short-term volatility is expected, the token’s utility, coupled with the potential for ETF approval and a favorable macroeconomic environment, positions it as a key asset to watch. As Ripple continues to onboard new partners, the demand for XRP as a reliable bridge currency could strengthen its price floor and unlock significant long-term value. Frequently Asked Questions What factors could cause the price of XRP to drop? The price of XRP could experience a drop if the Federal Reserve disappoints the market by not cutting interest rates, or if its forward guidance is less dovish than expected. Additionally, a slowdown in institutional adoption of Ripple’s ODL service or a broader downturn in the crypto market could lead to a price correction. The Neutral sentiment from the Fear & Greed Index suggests the market is currently in a state of equilibrium, which could be disrupted by negative news. How does the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP affect its price prediction? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP is a technical indicator used by traders to gauge momentum and identify overbought or oversold conditions. When the RSI is in the neutral zone, typically between 30 and 70 , it suggests that the price is neither poised for a sharp reversal nor is it in a strong trend. This neutral reading for XRP indicates that the market is in a phase of consolidation, awaiting a new catalyst—like a Fed rate cut—to determine its next major price move. Why is XRP considered different from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum? XRP is fundamentally different from Bitcoin and Ethereum because it was created by Ripple to serve a specific, institutional use case: facilitating real-time cross-border payments. Unlike Bitcoin , which is a decentralized store of value, or Ethereum , which serves as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), XRP is a bridge currency designed for high-speed, low-cost settlements between financial institutions. Its efficiency and lower transaction fees make it a compelling solution for global finance.

It Reveals Bearish and Bullish Scenarios!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/banking-giant-citigroup-issues-price-prediction-that-will-disappoint-ethereum-eth-investors-it-reveals-bearish-and-bullish-scenarios/,"Ethereum (ETH) reached a new ATH of over $4,900 in recent weeks after a prolonged period of weakness. However, this record high was short-lived, and ETH fell to $4,200 due to a general market correction. Ethereum subsequently recovered and rose to $4,500. As the fluctuations in the ETH price continue, there is a huge expectation in the market that ETH will experience a major rise by the end of 2025. However, Citigroup said it expects ETH to fall to as low as $4,300 (compared to the current $4,515) by the end of the year. According to Coindesk, Citibank said in a recent report that network activity remains the primary driver of Ethereum's value, but most of the recent growth has occurred in Ethereum's layer-2s. At this point, Citi analysts said that only 30% have migrated to Ethereum’s base layer, and the ETH price remains above their estimates. The recent growth of layer-2 networks has increased activity in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, it is unclear how much of a positive impact this will have on Ethereum layer-1. The current price of Ethereum reflects capital inflows and expectations for tokenization and stablecoins. In this context, Ethereum seems a bit overvalued.” Citibank predicted that Etheruem’s price could reach $4,300 by the end of 2025, which is the base case scenario, and that if the bull market continues, it could rise to $6,400, while in the worst-case scenario, it could fall to $2,200. *This is not investment advice.

While Pepe Coin (PEPE) had its viral stint as a memecoin phenomenon, most experts think its explosive upside is already in the rearview mirror. That clears the way for newer coins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi coin focused on real-world borrowing and lending use case. The project has raised over $15.80 million from over 16,320 backers on presale. As opposed to hype-based memecoins, Mutuum Finance matches new market entry with practical use cases in the real world, rendering it a token with far more long-term pump prospects than PEPE. Pepe Coin Holds Steady as Meme Market Matures Pepe (PEPE) currently trades at $0.000012, which is in keeping with its position as a meme-driven asset that has already seen robust viral pumps in the earlier stages of its life cycle. While trading volumes suggest the token remains the object of active speculation, a consensus among most market pundits is that its most extreme gains may be behind it, with future price action ever-more tied to retail-driven cycles rather than underlying growth. As attention starts to turn across the broader market, comparisons are being made more and more between PEPE’s longer-term trajectory and momentum gathering behind newer project Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Gain Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to be on fire in presale phase six, building huge momentum with volumes of investors still skyrocketing. The project is already past 16,320 registered owners and has eclipsed $15.80 million in locked-up capital, with recent developments suggesting that the momentum will continue to build. This type of monumental jump is a clear indication of growing investors’ confidence as the platform continues to move ever closer towards going live. Strategic Value for Early Birds Not only are investors buying at the presale price positioning themselves for tokens at significantly lower cost, but they’re also setting themselves up for astronomical short-term returns of up to 300 percent on launch day one, and even greater long-term potential as the ecosystem continues to expand. Early adopters are rallying behind a project founded on a strongly future-facing dual lending model, longevity-long-term-conceived stablecoin, fully audited and open-source codebase, and tokenomics to generate scarcity and appreciation. Put all of them together, and Mutuum Finance is a strongly capable contender to revolutionize the next level of DeFi innovation. Bug Bounty Program Securing Security In a further move towards ensuring security in its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch an official bug bounty program with a $50,000 USDT bounty pool. Reward is offered at four severities, namely critical, major, minor, and low, to ensure vulnerability of all types can be identified and eliminated. By opening itself up to external developer and researcher review of its platform, Mutuum opens itself up to the newest security controls, incorporating security and confidence in its investor base. Risk Controls Embedded and Market Provisions Mutuum Tiered Loan-to-Value ratios and liquidation levels are determined by the volatility of the underlying collateral. Less volatile assets allow for more borrowing, while riskier tokens have less available borrowing. The second stability comes from reserve multipliers, which range from around 10 percent for low-volatility instruments to as much as 35 percent for riskier instruments. The system is impressively well-balanced between access and safety, and further market participation is enabled while containing systemic risk. Pepe Coin (PEPE) made its impression on the meme coin boom, but like Shiba Inu (SHIB), its biggest pump in its history may be in its rearview mirror.

51809147,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=178141,1758007830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/51809147.jpeg,Bitcoin vs Gold: The Chart Signal No Investor Can Ignore,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-vs-gold-the-chart-signal-no-investor-can-ignore/,"Gold has been a store of value for centuries, offering stability in times of war, inflation, or currency debasement. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is less than two decades old but has already captured the imagination of investors who see it as “digital gold.” As 2025 enters a critical stretch, the charts of these two rival safe-haven assets are flashing signals no investor can afford to ignore. Gold’s rally to record highs suggests fear and uncertainty dominate the macro environment. Yet Bitcoin, bolstered by institutional ETF inflows, is quietly consolidating near historic levels, hinting that its next breakout could once again leave gold in the dust. In the middle of this battle between the old guard and the digital challenger, a third option is emerging. Insiders whisper that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 15,000% returns , calling it the second chance investors prayed for after missing DOGE and PEPE. Its momentum is undeniable, and analysts warn it won’t stay under the radar much longer. Gold: Rallying to Record Highs Gold has surged above $3,600 per ounce , propelled by weak U.S. jobs data and a wave of bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates sooner than expected. Rate cuts lower the opportunity cost of holding gold, while also stoking concerns about inflationary flare-ups. Analysts now see gold advancing toward $3,700–$3,730 in the near term, and some forecasts suggest $5,000 per ounce is possible if the Fed’s independence weakens and policy credibility erodes. The appeal is clear: central banks continue to hoard gold as a hedge against financial instability. Emerging economies, wary of dollar dependence, are leading the charge. For ordinary investors, ETFs backed by gold bullion remain a convenient hedge against volatility in equities and bonds. But the chart reveals limits. Gold’s RSI is in overbought territory, and multiple analysts highlight consolidation near the $3,600–$3,650 band. Without another wave of geopolitical shocks or economic stress, gold may struggle to sustain its pace. It is a fortress asset, yes, but it may not deliver the exponential returns that risk-seeking capital craves. Unlike gold or Bitcoin, which have years of trading history, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in its presale phase, but the hype already rivals household names. Thousands of wallets have joined, many leveraging the PATRIOT50X bonus code to receive 50% more tokens on early allocations. Insiders whisper about 15,000% return potential , numbers that evoke memories of DOGE’s viral rise or PEPE’s improbable surge. The difference? MAGACOIN FINANCE is audit-approved by both HashEx and CertiK , an extremely rare double endorsement in presales. This signals to investors that the project is more than just another meme coin; it’s a calculated attempt to blend narrative firepower with real credibility. Whale participation has added to the momentum. Large wallets are securing allocations early, ensuring liquidity and reinforcing the idea that this isn’t a retail-only phenomenon. For investors who missed Bitcoin under $1,000, DOGE at fractions of a cent, or PEPE before it exploded, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being branded as the elusive second chance. Bitcoin: Volatile, Yet Backed by Flows Bitcoin has once again reminded investors that volatility cuts both ways. After dropping sharply in early September on whale profit-taking, BTC found support above $110,000 and is holding firm in a consolidation band between $110K and $115K. Technical analysts note that Bitcoin is still comfortably above its 200-day moving average, which historically acts as a springboard for major rallies. The institutional flows are especially telling. In just two trading sessions, Bitcoin ETFs captured $633 million in inflows , led by BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. At the same time, Ethereum-linked ETFs have continued to bleed assets, underscoring Bitcoin’s growing appeal as the safer institutional bet. This divergence shows a maturing market: retail traders panic-sold on volatility, while institutions quietly accumulated at scale. Charts show a wedge pattern forming, with support at $110K and resistance at $115K. If Bitcoin breaks through resistance, analysts believe it could retest $125K within weeks. The question is whether investors trust Bitcoin’s volatility enough to embrace the upside, or prefer gold’s slower, steadier climb. Bitcoin vs Gold: A Tale of Two Stores of Value Comparing the charts of gold and Bitcoin underscores their differences. Gold offers consistency but is capped by macro headwinds like a strong dollar and higher real yields. Bitcoin, while riskier, shows the technical hallmarks of cyclical rebounds that historically precede massive rallies. The performance gap is undeniable: over the last five years, Bitcoin has outpaced gold by more than 800%, even after brutal corrections. This is why risk-on capital continues to view Bitcoin as the better asymmetric play, while risk-off capital favors gold’s reliability. Investors must decide not just where value lies today—but where exponential growth could materialize tomorrow. And it’s here that the spotlight shifts to new narratives. Every cycle brings a fresh wave of projects that capture the cultural and speculative imagination. This time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the candidate that bridges legitimacy, scarcity, and meme-driven momentum. Macro Context: Why Presales Are Thriving Markets thrive on rotation. When Bitcoin consolidates and gold trades sideways, speculative capital doesn’t disappear, it seeks out new opportunities. Presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide exactly that: low-cost entry, scarcity mechanics, and narratives strong enough to attract global attention. This cycle is uniquely primed for presales. Institutional adoption of tokenization and ETFs has legitimized crypto as an asset class, encouraging retail investors to take bigger risks on new launches. Every bull market has crowned a new cultural phenomenon, SHIB in 2021, PEPE in 2023. Analysts argue 2025–2026 will be no different, and MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the project that defines this era. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Defining Outlier Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Rewrite the Narrative Audit Trust : Certification by HashEx and CertiK adds rare legitimacy. Scarcity and Bonus Mechanics : PATRIOT50X code and limited rounds drive urgency. Whale Participation : Early backing by large wallets ensures credibility and liquidity. Cultural Branding : Politically charged identity aligns it with larger narratives beyond crypto hype. Conclusion The Bitcoin versus gold debate will not end soon. Gold continues to prove its worth as a hedge, rallying to record highs on macro fears and central bank demand. Bitcoin, though volatile, is attracting institutional inflows that could fuel its next explosive breakout. Both assets deserve attention, but neither offers the sheer asymmetry of early-stage presales. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with whispers of 15,000% returns , dual audits, and surging momentum, is rapidly becoming the name on every trader’s lips. In a market where charts matter but narratives rule, it may emerge as the defining breakout of the next cycle. For investors, the choice is clear: ignore the signal, or seize the second chance.

As of September 16, 2025 , the Pi Coin (PI) is trading at approximately $0.36 USD , reflecting a modest +1.58% increase over the last 24 hours. The 24-hour trading volume is $48.34M USD , with a circulating supply of 8.09B PI . This data is crucial for anyone assessing the current market dynamics of the Pi Network. Pi Network Price The journey of Pi Network has been highly anticipated. The project officially launched its open mainnet on February 20, 2025 , which enabled Pi Coins to be traded on several exchanges, including OKX , Bitget , and CoinDCX . This transition from a mobile-mining-only phase to an open market has been a pivotal moment, shifting the project’s focus to building a robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and completing user Know Your Customer ( KYC ) verification. What Factors Are Currently Influencing the Pi Coin (PI) Price in 2025? The price of Pi Coin is shaped by a unique combination of internal project developments and external market forces. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these factors is key to navigating its potential volatility. Mainnet Launch & Ecosystem Development : The successful transition to a fully open mainnet and the development of real-world use cases are the most critical drivers of long-term value. The more dApps and businesses that accept PI , the stronger its utility becomes. Exchange Listings : Gaining listings on major, top-tier cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance or Coinbase is a significant factor for increasing liquidity, market visibility, and price discovery. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Sentiment : Like other altcoins, the price of Pi Coin is heavily influenced by the performance of the overall crypto market, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) . Bullish trends in BTC often create a supportive environment for altcoins like PI . Token Unlocks : Scheduled token unlocks can increase the circulating supply, potentially creating downward pressure on the price if not met with sufficient demand. Community Adoption and Utility : The millions of users, or “Pioneers,” who have mined Pi on their mobile devices are the foundation of the network. The project’s success hinges on converting this massive user base into an active community that uses PI for real transactions. Should I Invest in Pi Coin (PI)? Key Investment Considerations and Risks While Pi Coin presents a unique and compelling opportunity, its investment potential remains highly uncertain. It is essential for potential investors to consider both the potential upsides and significant risks. Potential for Growth : Some analysts and community members believe that if Pi Network achieves widespread adoption and secures major exchange listings, its price could experience significant growth. The sheer size of its user base offers a powerful network effect that is rare in the crypto space. Uncertainty and Volatility : The transition to a fully open market is ongoing. The price remains subject to extreme volatility due to thin liquidity and a lack of established, real-world utility compared to mature cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Uncertainty : The future of cryptocurrencies is intertwined with global regulatory frameworks. Shifts in regulation could impact Pi Network ‘s operations and its ability to achieve widespread adoption. It is critical to conduct thorough research, assess your individual risk tolerance, and consider all technical and fundamental factors before making a decision to buy or sell PI . As of September 16, 2025 , Pi Network is still in the process of proving its long-term viability. What is the most significant risk for Pi Coin investors in late 2025? The most significant risk for Pi Coin investors in late 2025 is the potential for a sell-off from early mobile miners once the network achieves greater liquidity. As more users complete their KYC verification and migrate their mined Pi to the mainnet, a large influx of tokens could hit the market, overwhelming demand and driving the price down. This risk is amplified by the project’s massive circulating supply of 8.09B PI . How does the Pi Network’s unique mobile mining approach affect its long-term value? Pi Network’s mobile mining approach has created an enormous user base of over 60 million registered accounts, a powerful foundation for a decentralized economy. This method, which requires no energy-intensive hardware, democratizes access to cryptocurrency. However, the true long-term value depends on converting this passive user base into an active community that utilizes Pi for real-world transactions and applications, moving beyond a simple speculative asset. Why do experts believe major exchange listings are crucial for Pi Coin’s price? Experts believe major exchange listings are crucial for Pi Coin’s price because they provide much-needed liquidity and market exposure. A listing on a platform like Binance or Coinbase would allow millions of new users to easily buy and sell PI , leading to more stable price discovery and a more robust market. This increased accessibility is essential for the token to evolve from a niche community asset into a widely tradable cryptocurrency. Conclusion: A Strategic Outlook for Pi Network in a Shifting Financial Landscape The journey of Pi Network to a fully open mainnet is a significant and strategic move in the cryptocurrency space. The project is attempting to leverage its massive, globally distributed user base to create a unique, mobile-first ecosystem. The success of this endeavor in late 2025 and beyond will hinge on two primary factors: the rapid development of a utility-driven ecosystem and the achievement of true, widespread adoption for daily use. While the current price and market data provide a snapshot of its progress, the long-term value of Pi will ultimately be determined by its ability to transition from a speculative asset to a functional, essential part of a new digital economy. For investors, this moment represents a critical period to monitor, as timely action and a deep understanding of these core principles will be paramount.

But if ETH’s slow rise makes investors feel better, analysts are pointing to new initiatives that promise faster growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting a lot of attention because of its $3 aim, which gives investors a new reason to spread their money around. In a world where crypto predictions change every day, MUTM stands out because it has useful features, a good presale, and technology that can grow. ETH’s growth vs new ROI frontiers Ethereum (ETH) is still one of the most well-known names in the world of digital assets. ETH is a key part of crypto charts and long-term potential for investors because it is the most popular smart contract and decentralized application. The consistent rise in crypto prices today demonstrates that ETH is strong, but it’s also evident that its maturity means it won’t grow as quickly as new initiatives. For a lot of investors, ETH is still a safe place to put their money, but the days of getting huge profits in the early stages are over. People who are serious about investing in crypto are now looking for projects that have good fundamentals and a lot of room for growth. This is why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting more attention. It is a project with characteristics that appeal to both institutional investors and ordinary investors. MUTM rising toward the $3 target Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Presale Phase 6, where it has raised $15.8 million and reached 40% of its goal for $0.035. MUTM is not like other projects that rely on hype cycles. Instead, it is making a clear plan based on DeFi lending, Layer-2 scalability, and significant token usefulness. This combination is what analysts say makes it the greatest cryptocurrency to invest in for future growth. People who invested early are already in a strong position to make a significant amount of money. One person from Phase 1 who bought 30,000 MUTM for $0.01 currently owns $1,050, and when the token reaches $3, they will have $90,000. Another investor from Phase 4 who bought 5,000 MUTM for $0.025 is now holding $175, which will grow to $15,000 at the same target. These data show why expectations about MUTM in the crypto world are getting more and more positive. The Beta launch will show off the platform’s main capabilities by letting users lend and borrow money in both peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract formats. The system will be built on Layer-2 integration, which will cut costs and speed up transactions. This will give MUTM a structural edge over networks that are slower and more expensive. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is known for its buy-and-distribute system. The protocol will use the money it makes to buy back tokens on the open market, which will then be given to mtToken stakers. This keeps demand high, which means that token growth is directly linked to activities in the ecosystem rather than speculation. The platform is also adding a number of demand drivers that make it stronger in DeFi. Liquidation fines will go into the treasury, which will encourage people to stay involved for a long time. A reserve factor will act as a safety net, helping to keep funds and increase demand for tokens. At the same time, stable-rate borrowing will offer predictable interest rates, which will appeal to a wider range of borrowers who want to know what to expect. Each of these mechanisms is meant to make sure that growth is long-lasting. This makes people even more sure that crypto charts will show a definite upward trend when the presale ends. With future listings on Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, MEXC, and Kraken, MUTM is projected to get a lot more attention. These exchanges will make it easier for people all over the world to trade, which will help the price go up faster and reach the $3 aim. Conclusion ETH is still going up steadily, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going up much faster. Phase 6 is now 40% sold out, and the next presale stage will boost the price by 15%. This makes it more important to act quickly. The project has a strong growth story that blends usefulness, new ideas, and presale momentum. This makes its $3 goal a viable possibility. The message is clear: ETH will stay a behemoth in DeFi, but for those looking for better profits, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best crypto asset to acquire right now.

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $8.56 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times.

JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.774, resulting in a correction to $1.599. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained minor selling pressure around local highs, resulting in a downward correction. This created a drop below $1.85. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

AD , head of the HTX Pay business unit, views crypto payments not merely as a career but as a mission of paramount importance, grounded in trust and responsibility. He sees each transaction as a reflection of a user’s faith and expectations, and every technical update as the result of the team’s tireless effort and commitment. Transitioning from the internet industry, AD entered the crypto space with a dual mindset: maintaining a “student-like” eagerness to learn while confidently applying a “seasoned” approach to business management and operations. When HTX relaunched its crypto payments business in late 2022, he chose to work directly on the front lines. He engaged closely with users, merchants, and industry veterans to apply his previous experience to this new landscape. He was clear from the start: they wouldn’t simply copy what others were doing. Instead, they set clear quarterly goals and iterated based on to their specific phase. “We must forge a distinctive path based on our own context and phase,” he stated. Guided by this principle, HTX Pay completely overhauled its organizational structure, product roadmap, and risk control systems, and has since demonstrated steady, reliable growth. Hearing the “Gunfire” on the Front Lines AD’s leadership is defined by a highly pragmatic approach. He believes strategy is born not in boardrooms but on the front lines, amid the “gunfire” of real-world challenges . For him, a strategic plan is not a theoretical vision on PPT slides but a judgment built on extensive market insights, direct user feedback, and granular operational details. As the saying goes, firsthand experience leads to genuine wisdom. “If anyone on our team, myself included, can’t hear the ‘gunfire’ from the front lines or can’t make sense of it, we are not doing our jobs right,” he said. This statement isn’t a warning; it’s a standard for their daily work. Under his leadership, the HTX Pay team has fostered a hands-on culture where they remain deeply engaged. This involves frequent cross-department meetings, conducting regular in-depth user interviews, and the inclusion of engineers and risk control staff in operational reviews. Everyone is expected to step up and work directly on the front lines. This close market connection also informs AD’s “non-copycat” business strategy. He rejects the idea of simply following established industry models, confident in the necessity of “forging our own unique path based on our specific phase.” From the very beginning of HTX Pay’s relaunch, it has chosen to set its own product development cadence, aligning its resources and long-term vision rather than blindly following industry norms. As he puts it, “We aren’t in a race; we are building a truly sustainable and effective service system.” This simple declaration reflects a profound understanding of the long-term fundamentals of the crypto payment industry. Building Trust from the Inside Out AD’s philosophy is simple: the truest measure of a product’s maturity isn’t its market data but the willingness of its own employees to use it. He candidly shares that HTX Pay initially saw minimal adoption from staff upon its launch. “The product was still in its early stages, and the workflow had some rough edges,” he explains. Rather than pushing it on colleagues, he led the team to adopt a user-centric mindset, carefully refining every detail—from basic workflows and transaction speeds to the overall user experience. Today, HTX Pay is used daily by most HTX staff, including those who have since left the company. To AD, this shift is a far more powerful indicator of success than any external metric. “It’s like running a restaurant—you have to be willing to eat the food you serve.” He uses this powerful analogy to emphasize the importance of internal trust. It reflects his belief that a strong product must first earn the confidence of its “closest users.” This serves both as a test of the user experience and as a reflection of the company’s culture. This focus on internal users laid the foundation for external success. The product’s value is now being demonstrated in the wider market, with strong consumer retention and steadily improving support efficiency for business clients. AD’s philosophy is clear: you can’t succeed in the broader market until you’ve first satisfied “your own people.” Prioritizing Risk Control, Putting Security Above All AD sees crypto payments as a financial service, not a game of numbers. This makes risk control non-negotiable. His position is firm: “ Risk management is always the first priority .” The HTX Pay business unit that AD manages oversees the most sensitive and high-stakes parts of the trading system, including deposits and withdrawals, trading, conversions, and fiat transactions. It handles the highest volume of fund flows and faces the strictest risk control requirements. AD is well aware that a fragile system cannot support long-term growth, no matter how fast it expands initially. “The real game in finance isn’t a race; it’s about who can last the longest and go the furthest.” Led by AD, HTX Pay has developed an advanced risk management system. This includes an automated risk control engine, a quick intervention system, and flexible human checks to ensure the platform stays secure, even in the most challenging scenarios. This is more than a crisis-response mechanism; it’s a fundamental part of the company’s culture. The belief that “risk control comes first” is shared across the entire HTX Pay team—from product, operations, technology, and customer service. AD insists that every new initiative must be carefully vetted for risk. “We won’t go live with anything that doesn’t guarantee our users’ assets are completely safe.” Building a Solid Base, Winning the Long Game Even as the crypto industry has evolved at a breakneck pace over the past few years, HTX Pay has maintained a steady and clear rhythm. AD admits his team once faced questions about moving too slowly, but he remained committed to a disciplined pace for system development and business expansion. He describes HTX Pay’s growth over the last three years as a “standard 40-degree curve” —a steady, upward climb without large spikes or reliance on external events. This approach is rooted in AD’s strong emphasis on “ infrastructure .” He believes that crypto payments cannot be rushed. Success in this field requires significant early investment of time and resources to build a solid foundation across systems, risk control, compliance, and user experience. Only with this groundwork can a business handle the major market demands when the real opportunity arrives. HTX Pay hit a critical growth point in 2024. “We were right on schedule,” AD says. The company’s overall reputation improved, the external environment stabilized, and the payment business completed key system upgrades. “This is the inevitable result of a deliberate, long-term strategy, not a lucky coincidence,” AD stated. For him, the ability to last is more important than being first in the short term. Building Trustworthy Payment Infrastructure for a Global Audience AD consistently defines HTX Pay as a human-centered payment infrastructure. It is not a flashy, high-traffic gateway, but a system designed for maximum stability and absolute trust. According to AD, the key difference between HTX Pay and other platforms lies in three core values: sincerity, simplicity, and practicality . These principles reflect his deep understanding of user needs and guide his product design. “Users don’t need a showy product,” he explains. “They just want a payment tool they can use, feel confident in using, and trust completely.” AD is fully committed to HTX’s vision: “to build a financial free port for the metaverse and achieve financial freedom for 8 billion people on Earth.” He believes the payment business is not just about facilitating today’s transactions, but about creating a foundation for the future. He acknowledges that this is a long-term goal—one that will take more than a single team or generation to achieve—but he is confident that building infrastructure is a marathon, not a sprint. In a fast-changing industry, AD and his team have chosen a challenging but wise path: a commitment to stability, security, user-centricity, and a systems-first mindset. He concludes, “As long as everything we do honors the trust our users place in us, HTX Pay will endure.” To learn more about HTX, please visit https://www.htx.com/ or HTX Square , and follow HTX on X , Telegram , and Discord .

Three chains are becoming hosts for new liquidity pools of real-world assets—Solana, Base, and Arbitrum. RWA tokenization is expanding and testing the best chains for utility. Based on recent data, 2025 was a strong year for three chains that drove RWA adoption—Solana, Base, and Arbitrum. Those chains expanded their assets by over 800% in the year to date, based on Token Terminal data. Solana, Base and Arbitrum emerged as leaders both in terms of absolute asset value under management, and for the past few months of rapid growth . Solana reported a total of 81 projects, while Arbitrum expanded to 101 tokenized asset types, based on RWA XYZ data . BlackRock, Securitize, and Wormhole are the leading issuers as of September 2025. 🚨🆙 The AUM of tokenized investment funds is at an all-time high of $7.7 billion. Asset managers are increasingly interested in tokenizing their fund products and bringing them onchain. The biggest tokenized fund by AUM: @BlackRock BUIDL, powered by @Securitize & @wormhole . pic.twitter.com/jkJQt6N1nc — Token Terminal 📊 (@tokenterminal) September 15, 2025 Solana is also carrying more diverse RWAs, including Pokemon cards with a physical and digital component, as well as a market for Steam items. Solana’s tokenization has benefitted from the experience of NFTs to evolve into new markets, as Cryptopolitan reported . The tokenized assets are a mix of stablecoins and funds, and for now stablecoins are the lead driver of growth. However, there are also successful experiments for tokenized shares and other assets, especially on Solana. At the moment, there is no standard for on-chain tokenization, but the growth of new RWA projects show the space is promising. Is Ethereum the only chain for tokenization? Alternative chains for RWA trading also include the BNB Chain, TON, Aptos, and others. Those chains offer good integration with Web3 projects, and can offer smaller experimental mints for more diverse assets. Currently, many chains are claiming to be the central venue for RWAs. Ethereum is still seen as indispensable, potentially becoming the chain for Wall Street tokenization. While other chains offer cheaper access and good integration with wallets, Ethereum still claims leadership. A recent report warned Ethereum was still ideal for institutional tokenization, as the chain has not faced outages in block production, unlike Solana and some L2s. The setback for Ethereum is the risk of hacker attacks and flawed smart contracts, though this may affect other chains. For now, RWAs are still not fully used in DeFi projects, especially the tokens issued by leading Wall Street firms. RWAs expand across asset classes Based on recent data, on-chain tokenized assets broke above $30B in value. A total of 211 issuers have offered various types of tokens, with some sectors showing significant success. Private credit makes the bulk of tokenization at barely $17B. US Treasury bills make up over $7.8B in assets, and are one of the main sources of security and income for stablecoin issuers . Stocks are still lagging, with a little over $500M. Commodities are among the success stories of tokenization, with over $2B in assets under management. The RWAs narrative remains independent, mostly based on infrastructure tokens. Ondo still competes to become the main institutional network for tokenization, while retaining its token growth. Overall, RWA infrastructure tokens are valued at over $66B, led by ONDO and Chainlink (LINK). Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

With top coins on the move, attention shifts to fresh targets set for the end of the year. Rising tokens like Solana and the newcomer XYZVerse are capturing new interest, adding to the buzz. The latest rally raises fresh questions about what happens next. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Bitcoin’s Bold Journey: From Idea to Today’s Digital Gold Rush Bitcoin appeared in 2009 after a person called Satoshi Nakamoto shared a plan for money without banks. It runs on a public list called a blockchain that sits on many computers at once. People send coins to each other directly, and helpers named miners check each move by solving tricky puzzles. New coins drop into their accounts as a prize, but only until 21 million exist. Every four years the prize shrinks, a moment fans call the halving. This shrinking supply has often sparked fresh price waves, as fewer new coins meet growing demand. While newer tokens chase quick fame with flashy apps, Bitcoin stays the main yardstick of the whole market. Big firms now hold it as a store of value, styling it as digital gold. If rising rates cool risky bets, Bitcoin can still draw eyes thanks to its long record and tight limit. As the next halving nears, some traders see a fresh climb, though swings stay wild compared with regular cash. Ethereum: The Beating Heart of Web3 Gears Up for a New Price Run Ethereum, born from Vitalik Buterin’s idea in 2013, went live in 2015. It moved from mining to a lighter Proof-of-Stake system after the 2022 Merge. This cut energy use and lets users earn ETH by staking. The chain hosts smart contracts, the code behind many apps for lending, games, art, and more. It also set the ERC-20 rule, so any team can launch a token that still pays fees in ETH. Layer-2 tools like Arbitrum and Polygon help send those tokens faster and cheaper. Sharding, the next step, should push costs even lower. Past cycles hint at big moves when Bitcoin halves its supply. Analysts expect ETH to swing between $2,700 and $6,580 in 2025, with a slow climb toward the decade’s end. That range puts it ahead of many altcoins that still rely on hype. Demand comes from gas fees, staking rewards, and its use as loan collateral. New spot ETFs and rising interest in DeFi add fuel. While rivals like Solana boast speed, they trade off age and size. Ethereum keeps the lead in users, tools, and trust, making it a strong pick for the current upswing. Solana’s Fast Lane: Can SOL Overtake the Crypto Pack? Solana was built for speed. While chains like Ethereum and Cardano juggle heavy traffic with add-ons, Solana keeps one straight road and pushes more cars through. Its design lets apps run in many coding languages, so builders can launch games, markets, and art hubs without learning a new toolkit. The network clocks thousands of transactions in a blink, and each move is paid for with SOL, the coin that keeps the engine warm. In this market cycle, users crave quick and cheap moves after feeling the sting of high fees elsewhere. DeFi and NFT creators are flocking to Solana, betting that a smooth ride will lure the next wave of fans. SOL gains value every time someone trades, stakes, or launches a fresh project, so growing activity could pump new life into the coin. Prices still sit well below past peaks, offering room if momentum returns. If the rush to fast, high-capacity chains continues, SOL may steer closer to the front of the crypto race. Conclusion Bull run 2025 boosts BTC, ETH, SOL. XYZ, the first all-sport memecoin, fuses football to esports passion with meme hype, targeting 20,000% upside via community-led roadmap.

The passively managed fund aims to mirror Avalanche’s value minus operational expenses, with Coinbase Custody serving as the digital asset custodian. The filing details a Delaware statutory trust structure offering cost-effective exposure to Avalanche through traditional securities markets. The trust will hold only AVAX tokens and use the CME CF Avalanche-Dollar Reference Rate as its pricing benchmark, calculated daily at 4:00 PM ET from multiple constituent platforms. Avalanche Foundation is simultaneously raising $1 billion through two crypto treasury vehicles led by Hivemind Capital and Dragonfly Capital. Just in: Bitwise files Form S-1 for $AVAX ETF pic.twitter.com/DtvveAJqRH — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) September 15, 2025 ETF Arms Race Intensifies as Multiple Firms Target AVAX Approval The Bitwise registration follows VanEck’s March filing and Grayscale’s Form 19b-4 submission through Nasdaq for Avalanche ETF conversion. Bloomberg Intelligence assigns high approval odds for altcoin ETFs this year, with institutional demand driving applications beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Bitwise previously experienced regulatory turbulence when the SEC granted accelerated approval for its 10 Crypto Index ETF in July before reversing the decision hours later through a stay order. The multi-asset fund would have included Avalanche alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, with 85% allocation to previously approved components. VanEck launched the Purpose-built Fund specifically for Avalanche-based businesses, utilizing native real-world asset products and tokenized money market funds. The fund targets capital appreciation through investments in digital assets with a market capitalization of over $100 million across the finance, payments, gaming, and AI sectors. Grayscale’s pending conversion of its Digital Large Cap Fund to ETF status includes Avalanche alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP. The fund maintains a 79.9% Bitcoin allocation and an 11.3% Ethereum allocation, with the remaining assets distributed among approved altcoins. The competitive landscape intensified as major institutions began to engage with Avalanche’s blockchain for portfolio management and digital asset projects. BlackRock expanded access to its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund to include Avalanche in November 2024, following initial Ethereum availability. Regulatory Approval Timeline Faces Uncertainty Amid Treasury Vehicle Launch The SEC’s cautious approach to altcoin ETFs creates uncertainty despite technical compliance with existing regulations. Chairman Paul Atkins established a crypto task force to develop clear rules, following years of “regulation by enforcement” under the previous leadership. March decisions on multiple altcoin ETFs were delayed until October, with the Commission citing the need for “longer periods” to consider proposed rule changes. The SEC has delayed decisions on multiple altcoin spot ETFs, including XRP, Solana, and Litecoin, citing the need for more review. Analysts say it’s standard procedure and remain optimistic about approval. #CryptoETFs #SEC https://t.co/Q8aODggS0f — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 12, 2025 The approval process involves 21-day public comment periods, allowing industry stakeholders to provide input before final decisions are made. Avalanche’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and subnet architecture differentiate it from Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining. The network’s three-blockchain structure supports token creation, validator management, and smart contracts, while enabling custom permissioned blockchains that rely on the main network’s security and integrity. The simultaneous treasury vehicle launches aim to garner serious institutional conviction through SPAC structures and private placements. Hivemind Capital’s $500 million vehicle aims for September completion, while Dragonfly Capital’s equivalent SPAC targets October finalization. At the time of writing, AVAX is trading at $29.91, representing technical momentum testing $30 resistance. Technical Analysis Points to Breakout Momentum Following ETF Filing AVAX exhibits classic descending wedge characteristics on hourly charts, trading at $29.90 near the pattern’s apex with upper trendline resistance and dynamic support convergence. Source: X/@Jeremyybtc The coiling effect from multiple tests of wedge boundaries creates optimal conditions for explosive directional moves, particularly with ETF-filing catalysts supporting bullish sentiment. Long-term weekly charts reveal AVAX breaking above significant descending trendlines containing price action since the 2021 peaks near $147. $AVAX path back to ATHs looks pretty clear from here. Anywhere under $50 is free. pic.twitter.com/ppxaajNBde — K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) September 15, 2025 The macro perspective shows AVAX’s 240% recovery from cycle lows around $8.50, positioning the token in the critical $30-35 resistance zone. Sustained trading above current breakout levels could open pathways toward $50 with minimal intermediate resistance. ETF approval precedents from Bitcoin and Ethereum suggest initial announcements generate 50-100% advances within weeks of confirmation. The technical setup positions AVAX optimally to capture such moves through descending wedge momentum combined with institutional validation. AVAX’s immediate trajectory targets the $35-40 region following successful wedge breakouts, with long-term potential extending toward $50 levels based on minimal resistance structures.

Despite laying off 10% of its workforce earlier this year due to rising costs, MoonPay reported profitability in 2024 and says 2025 is shaping up to be its strongest year yet in terms of earnings and cash flow. The company is also said to be in discussions for a new funding round that could raise its valuation beyond the $3.4 billion mark set during its 2021 Series A. Payments Companies Push into Crypto In May, crypto payments platform Mesh unveiled its Apple Pay integration , which allows merchants partnered with Mesh to accept crypto payments via Apple Pay. Mesh’s partnership with Apple Pay came as payments companies continue to expand into digital assets. In April, global payments giant Stripe said it is developing a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin aimed at companies operating outside the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe. The announcement came after Stripe’s regulatory approval to acquire Bridge, a stablecoin payments network designed to rival traditional banking systems and SWIFT-based transfers. Earlier this year, Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO and outspoken Bitcoin advocate, publicly urged Signal Messenger to integrate Bitcoin for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. Dorsey’s call was echoed by David Marcus, former president of PayPal and current CEO of Lightspark, who stated that “all non-transactional apps should connect to Bitcoin.” The comments reflect a growing sentiment among Bitcoin advocates to reposition BTC not just as a store of value, but as a practical payment tool. More recently, Singapore-based payments company Triple-A announced plans to integrate PayPal’s stablecoin into its list of supported tokens for customer payments. Even companies like PayPal have entered the space , launching their own stablecoins and offering yield incentives to holders.

Founder Dan Morehead recently unveiled that the firm’s Pantera Capital SOL holding now stands at an astonishing $1.1 billion. This news marks a pivotal shift for a firm that once held an entirely Bitcoin-centric portfolio, signaling a strong belief in Solana’s future and its potential to reshape the digital asset landscape. Why is Pantera Capital’s SOL Holding So Significant? In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Dan Morehead openly shared that Solana (SOL) has officially become Pantera Capital’s largest holding. This is a dramatic change from their early days, when Bitcoin (BTC) dominated their entire portfolio. Morehead specifically emphasized that SOL has consistently outperformed BTC over the past four years, showcasing its robust growth potential and innovative capabilities. This strategic pivot by such a prominent investment firm is not merely an internal decision; it sends a powerful message to the broader market. It indicates a maturing perspective on digital assets, moving beyond solely “digital gold” narratives to embrace high-performance blockchain ecosystems. A Strategic Pivot: Pantera Capital’s decision to make SOL its top asset highlights a strategic diversification away from a singular focus on Bitcoin. Institutional Confidence: This significant move demonstrates deep institutional confidence in Solana’s underlying technology, its vibrant developer community, and its expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications. Solana’s Remarkable Ascent: Outperforming Bitcoin Solana’s journey has been nothing short of impressive, distinguishing itself with several key advantages. Its rapid transaction speeds, significantly lower fees compared to older blockchains, and a thriving decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem have attracted substantial developer interest and user adoption. These technical strengths have directly contributed to its strong market performance and ability to challenge established cryptocurrencies. Morehead’s comments underscore a growing trend among savvy institutional investors who are actively looking beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. They are diligently identifying promising altcoins with strong fundamentals, scalable solutions, and real-world utility. The substantial Pantera Capital SOL holding reflects this evolving investment landscape, where innovation, efficiency, and scalability are increasingly recognized as critical factors for long-term success. However, it is also important to acknowledge that Solana has faced its share of challenges, including network outages. Despite these hurdles, its resilience and continuous development have maintained investor interest, demonstrating a strong commitment to improving its infrastructure. Dan Morehead’s Bold Long-Term Crypto Vision Looking ahead, Morehead holds a clear and somewhat concentrated vision for the future of cryptocurrencies. He believes that only a select few projects will truly succeed and dominate in the long run. He specifically named Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) as the likely long-term winners. This perspective suggests an impending consolidation in the crypto market, where only projects with strong utility, robust security, and an active community will endure the test of time. Furthermore, Morehead made a striking prediction for Bitcoin, stating that he anticipates BTC could reach an astounding $750,000 within the next five years. This bold forecast provides a compelling glimpse into the potential upside he sees across the top-tier digital assets. Such predictions from seasoned investors reinforce the long-term bullish outlook for the entire sector, especially for significant institutional investments like the Pantera Capital SOL holding . What Does This Pantera Capital SOL Holding Mean for Investors? The substantial Pantera Capital SOL holding offers valuable insights for both institutional and individual retail investors alike. It strongly suggests that diversifying a crypto portfolio beyond just the top two assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, can be a prudent and potentially rewarding strategy. However, it also unequivocally emphasizes the critical importance of thorough research and a deep understanding of the underlying technology and use cases of any chosen digital asset. For those considering an investment in Solana, this prominent institutional endorsement could certainly be interpreted as a strong positive signal. Nevertheless, it is crucial to remember that all cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks due to their well-known market volatility. Therefore, it is always wise to approach such opportunities with caution and a well-defined strategy. Consider these actionable insights: Conduct Your Own Research: Do not solely rely on institutional endorsements. Thoroughly understand Solana’s technology, its specific use cases, and its development roadmap. Evaluate its competitive landscape. Assess Risk Tolerance: Only invest capital that you can comfortably afford to lose. Cryptocurrency markets can experience rapid and significant price fluctuations. Stay Informed: Continuously keep up with the latest market news, technological advancements, and project developments within the Solana ecosystem and the broader crypto space. Consider Portfolio Diversification: While a significant Pantera Capital SOL holding indicates confidence, a balanced portfolio usually includes a mix of assets to mitigate risk. A Glimpse into the Future of Crypto Investment Pantera Capital’s significant investment in Solana marks a new, exciting chapter in institutional crypto adoption. It unequivocally highlights a growing confidence in altcoins that possess strong fundamentals, innovative technology, and a clear path to scalability. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature and evolve, we can realistically expect more traditional investment firms to explore and strategically integrate a broader range of digital assets into their sophisticated portfolios. The remarkable shift in Pantera Capital’s strategy, moving from an exclusive BTC-only approach to a substantial Pantera Capital SOL holding , vividly underscores a dynamic and ever-evolving investment landscape, paving the way for new opportunities and fresh challenges in the digital economy.

Enthusiasm is growing as SOL tests new highs and market watchers weigh its next move. Could Solana surprise everyone and reach a higher target soon? The current momentum and shifting trends keep traders guessing what comes next. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Solana (SOL) Source: TradingView Over the last 7 days SOL jumped 16.77% and now trades between 213.97 and 257.98. The 1-month gain reaches 29.73%, while the 6-month move sits at a huge 92.28%. Short term buyers are active, yet price still sits below this week’s peak, hinting at a pause after the rally. The 10-day average is 241.90 and the 100-day average is 238.56, so the fast line is only 3.34 higher than the slow one. Momentum gauges read 43.97 and 27.10, both under neutral, and the signal line is slightly negative. This mix suggests the market is cooling but not broken. Bulls will point to the wide six-month rise, bears will note the soft momentum. If SOL can close above 257.98 the path toward the nearest ceiling at 275.85 opens, adding about 18% from the mid-band. A push past 275.85 could target 319.86, a further 36% leap. Failure to hold 213.97 would drag price toward the floor at 187.83, a slide near 20%. A deeper dip to 143.82 would mean roughly 39% off current levels. Traders now watch whether momentum flips higher or breaks the first support. Conclusion Breaking $250 would confirm SOL strength. Yet the standout play remains XYZVerse (XYZ), the first sports memecoin fusing meme hype and fandom, targeting 20,000% gains through community-led, GameFi-backed growth.

On Monday, Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500, set a record high for the fourth consecutive trading day, reaching 6,519 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index also hit lifetime highs, and the Dow Jones traded near the peak recorded on Thursday. Equities rose, disregarding the bearish September manufacturing survey, as bond yields fell in anticipation of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut on Wednesday. According to the Fed funds futures, traders expect rates to drop to 3% from the present 4.25% within the next 12 months. Still, bitcoin (BTC) lacked clear direction, as it traded back and forth between $114,000 and $117,000, forming an indecisive Doji candle. As of writing, it changed hands at $115,860, continuing a lacklustre trading pattern below record highs of above $124,000 hit in August. The dour price action is likely due to long-term holders continuing to take profits and countering the bullish pressure from spot ETF inflows. Other major tokens such as ether (ETH), XRP (XRP) and dogecoin (DOGE) have lost upward momentum too. Ethereum's ether token has pulled back from nearly $4,800 to $4,500 in three days, having put in lifetime highs above $5,000 last month. The weakness is perplexing, as ether, popularly known as the internet bond due to its staking yield mechanism, stands to become an attractive investment with the impending Fed rate cuts. The payments-focused XRP has pulled back to $3.00, marking a weak follow-through to the bullish breakout from the descending triangle confirmed last week. Meanwhile, dogecoin, the leading meme token by market value, has dropped sharply to 26.7 cents from 30.7 cents amid reports of whale selling . Analysts said that a 25-basis-point rate cut could resume the slow grind higher in BTC. Meanwhile, a surprise 50 bps move could see stocks, crypto and gold go berserk. Keep an eye on VIX and BTC vol indices Monday's rise in U.S. stocks was characterized by an uptick in the VIX index, which represents the options-based implied or expected volatility in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days. The VIX rose over 6% to 15.68 points. While it still largely hovers at multi-month lows, the Tuesday spike warrants attention for two reasons: First, historically, the two have moved in opposite directions, as evident from the correlation of nearly -90 over a 90-day period. Secondly, a breakdown in the negative correlation often precedes corrections, as noted by the quant-driven market intelligence platform Menthor Q on X . ""SPX rose with the VIX today. This often signals stretched upside positioning, traders grabbing calls or hedging downside [with puts], leaving markets vulnerable,"" Menthor Q said. The VIX is influenced by demand for options, and Tuesday's rise in the index could have been led by traders seeking S&P 500 puts or downside protection. Perhaps, market participants anticipate a correction following the expected 25-basis-point Fed rate cut on Wednesday. BTC implied volatility rises Volmex's bitcoin implied volatility index, which represents the expected price turbulence over 30 days, also rose by 3% Monday, maintaining its positive correlation with VIX. Note that BTC's historic positive correlation with implied volatility indices has flipped negative since the spot ETFs went live in January last year and more so since President Trump's electoral win in November last year.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|market analysis|VIX|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|DOGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-16 07:56:55

Galaxy, Multicoin, & Jump Back Forward’s Solana Treasury According to a press release , Forward Industries has completed its initial liquid Solana purchases totaling 6,822,000 SOL for its treasury strategy. The tokens cost the company $232 each or a total of $1.58 billion. CoinGecko’s tracker shows the largest SOL treasury before today held $474 million, making Forward’s bet the largest yet. Forward Industries is a publicly-traded company that has historically focused on design and manufacturing. The dip into the digital asset sector with the Solana treasury program represents a new shift. Kyle Samani, Chairman of the Board of Directors at Forward Industries, said: Today’s purchase marks a significant milestone as Forward Industries begins executing its differentiated Solana treasury strategy, built to benefit from one of the fastest growing and most profitable blockchain networks. On September 11th, the firm closed a private investment in public equity (PIPE) raising $1.65 billion. The main players behind the financing were Galaxy Digital , Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto, each of which are firms that have had a notable presence in the digital assets sector. The latest purchase is the initial deployment of this raised capital. Forward doesn’t plan to just passively hold SOL. Instead, the company has said it will take a more dynamic approach, deploying assets within the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem to generate more value. So far, it has put all its holdings into staking. Samani noted: We are building the world’s largest Solana treasury company, a strategy that will both advance the Solana ecosystem and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. We are pleased to make some of our SOL purchases on-chain, which is the first of many activities we expect the Company to do natively on-chain. Forward’s treasury isn’t the only SOL news for today. Neurotech company Helius Medical Technologies has also revealed a plan for a Solana treasury strategy, as per a press release . The company intends to raise $500 million through PIPE financing and a further $750 million via stapled warrants. Backers include Pantera Capital and Summer Capital, among other names. Speaking of digital asset treasury companies, the OG firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has also added to its Bitcoin holdings today, as announced by co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor in an X post . The acquisition has involved a total of 525 BTC, with a cost basis of $114,562 per token. In total, the buy has cost the company about $60.2 million, which is relatively modest when compared to some of the earlier purchases.

An early Ethereum holder , who has diligently held their digital assets since 2017, recently made a substantial move. Just moments ago, this individual deposited a staggering 2,200 ETH, equivalent to $9.92 million, onto the Bybit exchange. This crucial transfer, first highlighted by on-chain analyst ai9684xtpa, has immediately captured the attention of market observers and fellow Ethereum holders alike, sparking discussions about its potential implications for the broader market. Unveiling the Mysterious Ethereum Holder’s Actions This isn’t the first time this particular Ethereum holder has made headlines this year. On-chain data reveals a pattern of considerable activity. So far in 2024, this same address has deposited a cumulative total of 8,310 ETH, valued at an impressive $41.4 million, across various cryptocurrency exchanges. Such large-scale transfers from long-term holding wallets to active trading platforms are often interpreted as a strong signal, hinting at potential selling pressure. Understanding these movements is vital for anyone tracking the Ethereum market. When a long-term holder, especially one who acquired ETH at much lower prices, moves such a substantial sum, it naturally raises questions. Are they looking to secure profits? Are they rebalancing their portfolio? Or is there another strategy at play? Why Do Ethereum Holders Move Such Large Sums to Exchanges? For many in the crypto space, a large deposit to an exchange by a long-term Ethereum holder typically precedes a sale. This is because exchanges are the primary venues for converting cryptocurrencies into fiat money or other digital assets. Therefore, such actions are closely monitored as potential indicators of upcoming supply increases in the market, which could, in turn, influence price dynamics. Profit-Taking: After holding since 2017, this individual has seen immense gains. Moving ETH to an exchange could simply be a strategic decision to realize some of those profits. Portfolio Rebalancing: The holder might be diversifying their assets, selling ETH to invest in other cryptocurrencies or traditional assets. Market Anticipation: Some holders might believe the market is nearing a local top and choose to sell to buy back at a lower price, a strategy known as “timing the market.” However, it is also important to remember that a deposit does not always guarantee an immediate sale. Funds could be moved for various reasons, including staking on the exchange, using them as collateral for loans, or even for participating in specific trading pairs not available elsewhere. Crucial Market Implications for Ethereum Holders The immediate reaction to such a significant deposit often leans towards a bearish sentiment. The prospect of an additional $9.9 million worth of ETH entering the market for sale can create downward pressure on its price. Historically, large movements from dormant wallets have occasionally coincided with periods of increased volatility or price corrections. However, the Ethereum market is complex and influenced by numerous factors beyond a single large transaction. While this specific Ethereum holder’s move is noteworthy, it’s just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Institutional adoption, network upgrades, overall market sentiment, and macroeconomic factors all play critical roles in determining ETH’s trajectory. What should current Ethereum holders consider? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain analytics and market news. Understand Context: Differentiate between speculation and confirmed selling. Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance. Navigating the Volatility: Insights for Every Ethereum Holder The actions of early investors, often dubbed “whales,” can undeniably send ripples through the crypto market. For every Ethereum holder , understanding these dynamics is key to informed decision-making. While the recent Bybit deposit by a long-term holder might signal caution, it also underscores the vibrant and often unpredictable nature of the digital asset space. As the market continues to evolve, the ability to interpret on-chain data and gauge sentiment becomes an invaluable skill. This event serves as a powerful reminder that vigilance and a well-thought-out strategy are essential for navigating the exciting, yet challenging, world of cryptocurrency investments. Conclusion: A Watchful Eye on Ethereum Holders The recent deposit of $9.9 million in ETH to Bybit by an early Ethereum holder is a significant event that demands attention. While such transfers often precede selling, the ultimate impact on the market remains to be seen. It highlights the importance of on-chain analysis in understanding potential market shifts. For investors, this serves as a timely reminder to remain informed, exercise caution, and always conduct thorough research. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does it mean when an early Ethereum holder deposits ETH to an exchange? When a long-term Ethereum holder moves a large amount of ETH to an exchange, it is often interpreted as a precursor to selling. Exchanges are the primary platforms for converting crypto into fiat or other assets, so such a move can signal an intent to take profits or rebalance a portfolio. 2. Is this the first time this specific holder has moved funds this year? No, on-chain data indicates that this same Ethereum holder has deposited a cumulative total of 8,310 ETH, valued at $41.4 million, to various exchanges so far this year, making this recent Bybit deposit part of a larger pattern. 3. Will this ETH deposit necessarily lead to a price drop? While large deposits can create downward pressure due to increased potential supply, a deposit does not guarantee an immediate sale. The funds could be moved for other reasons, such as staking or using them as collateral. The overall market sentiment and other factors also play a significant role. 4. How can I track similar large crypto transactions? You can track large crypto transactions through on-chain analytics platforms and services that monitor whale movements and significant wallet activities. Analysts like ai9684xtpa specialize in providing such insights. 5. What are the risks associated with such large deposits? One primary risk is increased market volatility. If the holder decides to sell a substantial portion of their deposited ETH, it could lead to a temporary price drop. Investors should monitor such movements as part of their overall risk assessment.

51813686,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=809850,1758014776,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51813686.jpeg,Tim Cook says Apple investors back his $600 billion American push,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tim-cook-apple-investors-600-billion-america/,"Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Jim Cramer that the company will pump $600 billion into the United States economy over the next four years through a massive manufacturing expansion, and said no shareholders are objecting. Tim said the money will go into new and existing factories, workforce development, and local partnerships that will affect nearly 80 sites across the U.S. “We can’t be everywhere,” Tim said. “I wish we could, but we are putting $600 billion to work in the next four years. And so it is an extraordinary commitment. And there’s 79 factories across the U.S. that will benefit from this.” Tim said some communities that aren’t yet aware of Apple’s plans will be surprised to find out they’ll be receiving new facilities. He also said he hopes this scale of investment triggers a domino effect, pushing other companies to follow Apple’s lead and open more U.S.-based factories in the same areas. Tim confirms Corning gets $2.5 billion for iPhone glass During the interview , Tim also highlighted Apple’s recent $2.5 billion commitment to Corning, the Kentucky-based firm that supplies the glass used in iPhones and Apple Watches. The money will go toward expanding Corning’s glass production facility. “It’s a great start, and a very important one, because the glass is something you interface with all the time,” Tim said. This makes the Kentucky plant a key piece of Apple’s domestic hardware pipeline. He added that Apple plans to grow its partnerships with several semiconductor manufacturers based in the U.S., including Taiwan Semiconductor, Texas Instruments, and Applied Materials. The company had previously said it would work with all three to help scale chip production locally, and this latest announcement puts those partnerships into sharper focus. Aside from money and machines, Tim said Apple is also involved in training the workers that will eventually run these new and upgraded facilities. He confirmed that Apple has launched a “Manufacturing Academy” in Detroit as part of its workforce development strategy. According to Tim, the company wants to help small and mid-sized businesses while also sharing its training programs with community colleges to create a wider talent pool. Investors silent on $600 billion, as Tim says “not one complaint” When Jim Cramer asked if any Apple investors had voiced concern over the size of the domestic spend, Tim said flat-out that they hadn’t. “I think most of our shareholders believe that we’re in the best position to make these type of decisions,” Tim said. “I haven’t gotten a single complaint about the $600 billion.” He added that he believes shareholders are happy the company is investing in America rather than sending money elsewhere. The timing of this announcement overlaps with a major foreign policy event that will massively impact the tech industry: Donald Trump’s second state visit to the UK as sitting President. The visit, scheduled for this Wednesday, will include ceremonial events like a carriage tour, a state banquet, a military flypast, and a gun salute, all coordinated by the British government. As part of this trip, the U.S. and UK are expected to finalize technology and civil nuclear energy agreements, with trade still hanging over the visit. The British side is still hoping to resolve outstanding issues around U.S. steel tariffs as part of a broader economic deal. Before Trump’s arrival, UK officials announced $1.69 billion in U.S. investment from several American firms including PayPal and Bank of America. Two of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, Nvidia and OpenAI, are also expected to confirm new investments in the UK during the visit. U.S. private equity firm Blackstone plans to commit 100 billion pounds into UK assets over the next 10 years, as part of a $500 billion Europe-wide package. Another U.S. company, CoreWeave, which provides cloud computing infrastructure, also confirmed it would announce new UK-based investments this week. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office said a delegation of UK officials will be in Washington on Monday to finalize the visit details and trade commitments tied to Trump’s state trip.

While Cardano (ADA) may still deliver good returns, potentially in the 5–10x range, the real star of the cycle is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is building actual value with its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, positioning itself as a token that has the fundamentals in place to deliver explosive growth. As analysts seek out high-growth altcoins that can pump as much as 50x during the next cycle, MUTM stands out as a project that delivers utility, scalability, and first-mover advantage in a vertical poised for massive adoption. Cardano Nears $1 as Resistance Builds Cardano (ADA) is presently trading at approximately $0.92, with recent price action characterized by resistance forming in the $0.96–$1.00 zone and support at $0.83–$0.90. Trading volumes have been decent, and ADA has gained modestly in the past week, bouncing from lows of almost $0.82. While some technicals suggest a break over $1.00 will open up additional upside, ADA’s maturity and size most likely mean its returns will be less dramatic, perhaps in the 5-10× range during the period of a complete bull cycle. On the other hand, newer DeFi project Mutuum Finance is being viewed by some as having more upside in this cycle, with lower price and rapidly growing ecosystems. Mutuum Finance: Risk Mechanisms and Protocol Security Mutuum Finance has strong protection protocols for any collateralized asset to ensure the security of the protocol and the users. They include target collateral rates, deposit ceilings, and lending ceilings. In order to maintain systemic stability, liquidators are encouraged to off Close undercollateralized positions, invoke penalties and enforce liquidation guarantee remediation in a timely fashion. Collateral efficiency is optimized in correlated assets, i.e., lending capacity increases proportionately with Loan-to-Value (LTV) levels in well-secured lending. Reserve factors are provided as insurance against extraordinary market conditions, and supplementary reserves can be levied on volatile assets to cover against volatility. Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has already garnered more than 16,320 investors and $15.80 million amidst overwhelming demand. As part of its drive for better security and transparency, the project is launching a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. By the program, developers and researchers are invited to report vulnerabilities, the reward being placed on four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low. Dynamic Interest Rate Adjustments Mutuum Finance rides on a floating interest rate mechanism that changes with liquidity level. Borrowing is cheap when liquidity is high and allows for greater utilization. Borrowing is expensive when there is low liquidity, allowing for repayment of the loan together with greater deposits. This helps in balance in the system along with avoiding over-borrowing. Bringing Market Volatility Under Control and Liquidity Conservation Mutuum Finance is very sensitive to having the correct on-chain liquidity to prevent liquidating low-slippage, low-quality positions. The liquidation levels and LTV ratios are very sensitive to the volatility of the underlying token. Less volatile and more stable tokens can potentially have larger borrowing amounts and lower liquidation levels, with more risky and more volatile tokens having more conservative parameters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is this bull run’s real 50x contender. The project is still in the early presale phase at $0.035, with 16,320+ investors and $15.80M raised with tremendous upside potential. Its dual lending models, dynamic interest rate adjustment, and strict risk control mechanisms backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty give it real utility over hype. With strong adoption signals and low market cap foundation, MUTM can deliver 50x returns in the next cycle. Secure your presale tokens now before Stage 7 takes the price higher.

Banks' claims that they do are are myths crafted to defend their revenues, he wrote in a Tueday blog post . ""The central claim — that stablecoins will cause a mass outflow of bank deposits — simply doesn’t hold up,"" Shirzad wrote. ""Recent analysis shows no meaningful link between stablecoin adoption and deposit flight for community banks and there’s no reason to believe big banks would fare any worse."" Larger lenders still hold trillions of dollars at the Federal Reserve and if deposits were really at risk, he argued, they would be competing harder for customer funds by offering higher interest rates rather than parking cash at the central bank According to Shirzad, the real reason for banks' opposition is the payments business. Stablecoins , digital tokens whose value is pegged to a real-life asset such as the dollar, offer faster and cheaper ways to move money, threatening an estimated $187 billion in annual swipe-fee revenue for traditional card networks and banks. He compared the current pushback to earlier battles against ATMs and online banking, when incumbents warned of systemic dangers but, he said, were ultimately trying to protect entrenched profits. Shirzad also dismissed reports predicting trillions in potential outflows from deposits into stablecoins, whose total market cap is around $290 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. He stressed that stablecoins are primarily used as payment tools — for trading digital assets or sending funds abroad — not as long-term savings products. Someone purchasing stablecoins to settle with an overseas supplier, he argued, is opting for a more efficient transaction method the going through their bank, not pulling money from a savings account. He urged banks to embrace the technology instead of resisting it, saying stablecoin rails could cut settlement times, lower correspondent banking costs and provide round-the-clock payments. Those institutions willing to adapt, he wrote, stand to benefit from the shift. The U.K., too, faces concerns about the effect of stablecoins on the financial industry. The Financial Times reported Monday that the Bank of England is considering setting limits on how many ""systemic"" stablecoins people and companies can hold — setting thresholds as low as 10,000 pounds ($13,600) for individuals and about 10 million pounds for businesses. Officials define systemic stablecoins as those already widely used for U.K. payments or expected to become so, and say the caps are needed to prevent sudden deposit outflows that could weaken lending and financial stability.",Policy|Coinbase|crypto regulatioin|Stablecoins|banks|US|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|EXCHANGE|MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-16 09:30:22

Bitcoin’s seasonal weakness and ongoing whale profit-taking are prompting investors to look elsewhere for stronger returns. As sentiment shifts, XRP, Solana, and Cardano are emerging as frontrunners in what analysts say could be the next big altcoin frenzy. Rising inflows, technical setups, and ecosystem activity all suggest these projects are preparing for breakout moves. But beyond established large caps, speculative capital is also hunting for early-stage opportunities. Analysts warn allocations are moving fast as MAGACOIN FINANCE is tipped for huge gains. XRP: Legal Clarity and ETF Buzz XRP has long been a lightning rod for both retail excitement and regulatory scrutiny. With its partial legal victory over the SEC in 2023, XRP enjoys a level of clarity unmatched by many peers. This sets the stage for pending ETF applications that, if approved, could unleash significant institutional inflows. On-chain data shows whale wallets holding more than 10 million XRP have been steadily accumulating in September, reinforcing confidence ahead of potential catalysts. Trading volumes remain elevated, and analysts argue XRP’s use case in global payments could finally align with investor enthusiasm if ETFs materialize. In a crowded market, this clarity gives XRP an edge. Solana: Speed Meets Cultural Adoption Solana continues to capture both institutional and retail attention. Its scalability—capable of processing thousands of transactions per second at low fees—makes it a favorite for DeFi, gaming, and NFT developers. Recent data shows Solana-based DEX volumes hitting new monthly highs, even as overall crypto volumes softened. What drives Solana’s momentum is cultural resonance. Meme coins built on Solana have fueled retail excitement, while institutional adoption of Solana’s infrastructure has expanded. The dual momentum makes Solana a unique player in the Layer-1 race. Analysts see Solana as a core beneficiary of altcoin season, with both fundamentals and hype on its side. As capital rotates away from overcrowded large-cap names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the imagination of both retail traders and whales. Analysts now project up to 11,500% ROI , a figure that has fueled rapid presale sellouts and surging participation. The PATRIOT50X bonus code , which grants 50% more tokens to early buyers, has added urgency to allocations. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from other meme-driven projects is its foundation. With dual audits from HashEx and CertiK , the project has achieved a legitimacy rarely seen in presales. Combined with scarcity-driven rounds and whale interest, it is building the kind of early conviction usually reserved for institutional favorites. Momentum is undeniable. Telegram and X communities are expanding daily, social buzz is accelerating, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is now consistently appearing on analyst shortlists of altcoins to watch in 2025. Traders argue its dual appeal, meme culture hype fused with credible fundamentals, could rewrite the narrative of which meme-driven tokens dominate the next bull cycle. Cardano: Governance and Long-Term Vision Cardano often trades quietly compared to flashier peers, but its long-term approach to scalability and governance is starting to pay off. The launch of its Voltaire era, finalizing on-chain governance, marks a significant milestone. With this framework, Cardano is positioning itself as one of the few Layer-1 networks offering a decentralized and transparent decision-making model. Institutional attention has grown as Cardano’s ecosystem expands into DeFi and tokenized assets. Technical charts suggest ADA is building a base near $0.50, setting the stage for a possible breakout if market sentiment continues to improve. While not the fastest mover, Cardano appeals to investors seeking sustainable growth with governance-driven credibility. Macro Environment: Why Frenzy is Returning The global macro backdrop is amplifying crypto’s appeal. With recession fears rising and central banks expected to pivot toward easing, liquidity injections could ignite risk-on assets once more. Historically, such conditions have fueled outsized rallies in altcoins. Bitcoin’s dominance slipping toward 57% signals capital rotation is already underway. Analysts note that altcoins with strong narratives or clear catalysts, like XRP’s ETF prospects, Solana’s scalability, Cardano’s governance, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity-backed presale, are primed to lead the frenzy. This combination of fundamentals and speculative momentum has not been seen since the 2021 cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Lead the Frenzy 11,500% ROI Projections : Analysts say upside could outpace established altcoins. Audit-Backed Legitimacy : Dual certification by HashEx and CertiK boosts trust. Scarcity Mechanics : Rounds are selling out fast, reinforced by the PATRIOT50X bonus. Whale Participation : Large allocations confirm conviction and liquidity. Dual Appeal : Meme culture plus utility makes it a rare dual-threat token. Conclusion Altcoin season appears closer than ever. XRP is gaining momentum with ETF buzz and regulatory clarity, Solana continues to thrive on scalability and cultural adoption, and Cardano builds strength through governance and sustainability. But the frenzy will not be limited to established names. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its whispers of 11,500% ROI , audit approvals, and whale participation, is cementing itself as the presale that could reshape the meme-driven sector. As capital rotates away from overcrowded large caps, its scarcity mechanics and narrative firepower position it as the next major breakout. For investors, the message is clear: the frenzy is just beginning, and MAGACOIN FINANCE could be its defining story.

51813615,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=822328,1758015043,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51813615.jpeg,"Payments Giants Set To Join Stellar, Says CPO—Will XLM Price Follow?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/stellar-xlm/payments-giants-join-stellar-will-xlm-price-follow/,"Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) leadership is signaling a decisive push into mainstream finance for the remainder of 2025, hinting that “some of the biggest names in payments and asset management” are set to go live on the network in the coming weeks and months. Speaking alongside SDF CEO Denelle Dixon, José Fernández da Ponte—who joined SDF in mid-July and now serves as President & Chief Growth Officer—framed the acceleration as the culmination of a year spent laying technical and go-to-market groundwork. Biggest Names In Payments Coming To Stellar “We are the blockchain for financial services at scale,” Fernández da Ponte said, adding: “Over the next months, you will see some of the biggest names in payments and asset management that will continue to go live on the network.” He underscored the claim with growth figures from the on-chain economy: “If you look at TVL and DeFi for the last year, TVL in aggregate grew 2x. TVL on Stellar grew 9x… I have not seen a blockchain that has been growing there as fast.” The executive credited community-originated wallets and protocols, and the team’s continued work on “plumbing” for an open-source, permissionless stack, as catalysts for that momentum. Dixon, for her part, positioned the first half of 2025 as “laying the foundation,” and said the back half must deliver “big acceleration” on the tech side, singling out Protocol 23 as the upgrade set to make Stellar “stronger, faster, and developers’ lives easier.” Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Turns Bullish, Can the $0.386 Wall Finally Break? She also flagged the on-network expansion of the stablecoin universe—“PYUSD on Stellar was announced, new assets are coming, and others continue to scale”—plus tangible usage wins from wallet programs that have converted one-off sign-ups into weekly activity. Those remarks track with SDF’s public roadmap and adoption goals for 2025, which emphasize real-world payments, DeFi depth, and pushing toward top-tier TVL rankings. The payments-stablecoin pillar is central to that strategy. In June, PayPal disclosed plans to make its dollar stablecoin, PYUSD, available on the Stellar network, pending regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services. The move would add another high-profile issuer to Stellar’s rails and broaden PYUSD’s distribution beyond its current venues. Neither PayPal nor SDF has provided a firm mainnet date, but the companies have reiterated the intent publicly throughout the summer. On the protocol side, Stellar’s “Whisk” release—Protocol 23—anchors the second-half execution plan. SDF documentation describes a package of eight Core Advancement Proposals that include parallelized processing, unified events, fee and throughput improvements, and developer-facing refinements around Soroban smart contracts. Related Reading: Stellar About To Moon? XLM Price Prediction Calls For 400% Explosion SDF scheduled testnet and governance milestones across the summer, setting up a mainnet vote around early September. The intent is straightforward: raise performance and ergonomics to meet the institutional-grade expectations of payments processors and asset managers now circling the network. The organization will attempt to convert that pipeline into concrete announcements this week at Meridian—SDF’s flagship annual conference—held September 17–18 in Rio de Janeiro. With builders, policy voices, and would-be enterprise adopters on site, the event’s timing aligns neatly with leadership’s “coming weeks” guidance, though neither Dixon nor Fernández da Ponte named specific partners. Will XLM Price Respond? For investors asking whether XLM will respond, the market has so far treated the integration drumbeat as a “show-me” story. As of September 16, XLM trades near $0.379. XLM remains capped by mid-summer high at $0.52 that bulls will argue require either marquee partner go-lives, visible PYUSD settlement flows, or a broader macro driven rally for the entire crypto market. Crypto analyst Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) shared via X on September 15: “Demand zone tested – XLM bulls ready to charge. Why this setup? Price retracing into a bullish Orderflow Zone → demand area in play. Strong rejection expected near current support. Previous week’s high at 0.4143 serving as liquidity magnet. 4H Market Structure remains bullish, supporting upside continuation.” At press time, XLM traded at $0.378.

The company announced that support for Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and its stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD) will be added soon, making it easier to move digital assets across a growing number of wallets. The feature has a special appeal for crypto users because personal transfers like gifts, reimbursements, or splitting expenses won’t trigger tax forms when sent between known parties on PayPal or Venmo. This helps keep small transfers personal and tax-exempt, addressing long-standing concerns from crypto advocates about the tax burden on everyday crypto transactions. PayPal Links expands on the company’s existing ""PayPal Me"" system by letting users set the amount, add notes, or even emojis before sending the link. Once a request is accepted, the sender reportedly gets immediate access to their funds . Links that go unused will expire after 10 days, with the option to send reminders. The rollout starts in the U.S. and will expand to the UK and other markets later this month. This comes as PayPal reports 10% year-over-year growth in P2P payments and Venmo records its strongest payment volume in three years. PayPal has been deeply involved in crypto since 2020, launching trading services and later partnering with Paxos to issue PYUSD , which now holds a market cap of about $1.3 billion. The stablecoin also powers PayPal’s ""Pay with Crypto"" feature, enabling small businesses to accept multiple digital currencies.",,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|PYUSD|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-09-16 09:31:00

Bitcoin dropped to the $114k region on Monday but has now bounced back and is trading close to the $116k resistance level. XRP, Ripple’s native coin, tested the $2.95 support on Monday but is now back and trading at $3 per coin. However, the $3 resistance remains a tricky one for XRP as Ripple faces declining network activity. Ripple’s network activity continues to dwindle There is an increase in demand for XRP, as indicated by the rising funding rate and Open Interest (OI). However, this growing demand has not been reflected in on-chain activity. Data obtained from CryptoQuant show that active addresses on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) are down 55% to approximately 22,500 from roughly 50,000 in mid-July. This decline indicates reduced network engagement, which ultimately results in low transaction volume and a decline in the demand for the token. If the decline in the Active Addresses metric persists, XRP’s price could stagnate around the $3 mark or experience selling pressure in the near term. However, the market is still looking ahead to the FOMC meeting tomorrow as the Fed will reveal its interest rate decision. Cutting the interest rate could be a bullish signal for BTC, XRP, and the broader cryptocurrency market. XRP eyes the $3.1 resistance level despite declining network activity The XRP/USD 4-hour chart remains bearish as XRP has underperformed over the last few days. The coin is trading at $3.04, up from the $2.95 resistance level it tested on Monday. The XRP chart shows a descending trend line support around the $2.95 level, suggesting that the coin could break out in the near term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 50 after hitting 61 on Saturday, suggesting that XRP is facing selling pressure at the moment. If the RSI dips below the neutral 50, it would indicate a fading bullish momentum, and this could see XRP retest the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support at $2.95. The MACD lines are also around the neutral region, with a crossover into negative territory suggesting a bearish trend. Failure to hold the $2.95 support could see the 100-day EMA at $2.81 and the 200-day EMA at $2.56 become strong support zones. On the flip side, if the RSI goes into the positive region, with the blue MACD line remaining above the red signal line, XRP could surge towards the $3.18 resistance level in the near term. An extended bullish run would see XRP target the next major resistance level at $3.4. Traders are mainly focused on tomorrow’s event, as it would determine the price action for the remainder of the week.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant activity, and recent on-chain data reveals some truly compelling movements. In a fascinating turn of events, over $15 million in ENA tokens have been moved in the last 24 hours, signaling potential shifts in market dynamics. These substantial ENA transactions have caught the eye of analysts and investors alike, prompting questions about what these large-scale movements could mean for the future of ENA. Unpacking Recent ENA Transactions: Who’s Moving What? On-chain analyst The Data Nerd recently highlighted several notable ENA transactions that demand our attention. These aren’t just small transfers; they involve millions of dollars and key players in the crypto space. Understanding who is behind these movements can offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future price action for ENA. ParaFi Capital’s Deposit: The venture capital firm deposited a significant 4.08 million ENA, valued at approximately $2.88 million, to Binance. Such moves by institutional entities often indicate strategic portfolio adjustments or preparations for trading. Flowdesk’s Large Transfer: Another major player, Flowdesk, moved an even larger sum of 5.03 million ENA, worth about $3.51 million, also to Binance. Market makers like Flowdesk frequently adjust their holdings on exchanges to manage liquidity or execute trading strategies. New Wallet Acquisition: A newly identified wallet made a substantial purchase of 6.015 million ENA, amounting to roughly $4.3 million. The emergence of a new, large holder can sometimes precede significant market events or reflect growing confidence in the asset. Anonymous Whale’s Buy: An anonymous whale, a term used for individuals holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, acquired 6.72 million ENA, valued at an impressive $4.75 million. Whale activity is often closely watched due to its potential to influence market prices. Why Do These ENA Transactions Matter to You? These large-scale ENA transactions are more than just numbers; they represent significant capital flows that can impact ENA’s price and overall market sentiment. When institutional players or whales move such substantial amounts, it can signal a variety of intentions, from taking profits to accumulating for future gains. For the average investor, observing these movements can provide context for market volatility and potential trends. The movement of tokens to exchanges, particularly Binance, often suggests an intent to sell or increase liquidity for trading. Conversely, large purchases by new wallets or whales can imply an expectation of price appreciation. Staying informed about these on-chain activities helps investors make more educated decisions, even if direct correlation to immediate price action is not always guaranteed. Understanding the Implications of Whale and Institutional Movements The crypto market is highly sensitive to the actions of large holders. When ParaFi Capital and Flowdesk deposit millions of ENA to an exchange, it could be a precursor to increased selling pressure, potentially leading to a price dip. However, it could also be part of a broader strategy to rebalance portfolios or provide liquidity for market making activities, which are essential for healthy trading environments. On the other hand, the substantial purchases by a new wallet and an anonymous whale demonstrate strong buying interest. These buyers are betting on ENA’s future, injecting significant capital into the ecosystem. This duality of large deposits and large purchases creates an intriguing dynamic, suggesting both potential for increased supply and robust demand within the ENA market. What Actionable Insights Can We Gather from ENA Transactions? For those interested in ENA, these recent movements offer a few key takeaways. First, heightened whale and institutional activity often precedes periods of increased volatility. Second, monitoring on-chain data, as highlighted by The Data Nerd, can provide an early warning system for potential market shifts. While not financial advice, here are some points to consider: Stay Informed: Continue to follow reputable on-chain analysts for real-time updates on ENA and other assets. Observe Market Reaction: Pay attention to how ENA’s price reacts to these large transactions. Does it dip after deposits, or does strong buying absorb the supply? Consider Risk: Large movements can lead to sudden price swings. Always manage your risk exposure carefully. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term trading strategies influenced by these movements and ENA’s long-term fundamental value. The crypto market is a complex ecosystem, and large ENA transactions are just one piece of the puzzle. However, they are a significant indicator that warrants close observation, helping investors navigate the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets. Conclusion: The Ongoing Saga of ENA Transactions The past 24 hours have been particularly active for ENA, with over $15 million in tokens changing hands through various significant transactions. From institutional deposits to anonymous whale acquisitions, these movements underscore the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. As these large players continue to position themselves, the ENA community will be watching closely to see how these pivotal transactions shape its immediate future. Understanding these capital flows is crucial for anyone looking to comprehend the forces at play in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is ENA? ENA is the native token of Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. It provides a crypto-native, scalable solution for money that is censorship-resistant and stable, independent of traditional banking infrastructure. Why are large ENA transactions significant? Large transactions, especially those involving whales or institutional entities, can signal potential market shifts. They can indicate an intent to buy or sell substantial amounts, influencing price volatility and overall market sentiment. Who is The Data Nerd? The Data Nerd is an on-chain analyst who specializes in tracking and reporting significant cryptocurrency transactions and market movements across various blockchain networks. What does it mean when tokens are deposited to Binance? Depositing tokens to an exchange like Binance often suggests that the holder intends to sell them, use them for trading, or provide liquidity for market-making activities. It increases the available supply on the exchange. How can I track ENA transactions myself? You can track ENA transactions using various blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics platforms that monitor wallet addresses and transaction flows on the Ethereum network.

The firm which is backed by UAE sovereign wealth fund ADQ, with shares also owned by Phoenix Group, has changed its business plan and will now focus on serving high-net-worth individuals (HNWI), family offices, institutional investors and corporate treasuries, offering them digital asset investment solutions. Globally there has been a rising demand for institutional investment in digital assets. An EY survey reported that nearly 60% of institutional investors plan to allocate over 5% of their portfolios to digital assets. M2 believes this appetite is even stronger in the UAE. Sovereign wealth funds like Mubadala have already invested in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF fund. M2 will offer customized investment strategies and institutional-grade infrastructure. In addition, the exchange is focused on client service, and best-in-class security. M2 has partnerships with Sui, Ethena, Polygon, Haruko, FireBlocks, NiceHash, and FearsOff. The exchange’s advanced cybersecurity and enhanced operating model enables the provision of regulated custody, yield products, liquidity solutions, and treasury optimization. James Greenwood, CEO of M2 explained that the company’s strategic direction is to be a trusted bridge between the agility of digital asset markets and the standards of traditional wealth management. He states, “With this in mind, we have redefined our proposition around the evolving priorities of our clients: enhanced custody, deeper engagement, and institutional-grade opportunities within the digital asset economy. M2 stands at the intersection of private capital and precision, where digital wealth is managed with the same discipline, discretion, and depth as any other asset class.” M2 is one of only few firms worldwide offering Bitcoin-backed mining loans because of its affiliation with UAE Phoenix Group. The firm can also equip institutional clients with robust APIs for seamless portfolio diversification, aligning with the standards of traditional financial providers and bridging the gap between conventional finance and the digital asset economy. Kim Wong, Managing Director and Head of Treasury at M2, added, “This strategic realignment reflects a long-considered move toward where the industry is headed, and where we are well positioned to serve those navigating it.” It is noteworthy that M2 Custody Limited is licensed and regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), while M2 Global Wealth Limited (M2GW) is licensed and regulated by the Securities Commission of The Bahamas (SCB). The UAE has become a competitive environment for crypto exchange and brokerage offerings. This competitiveness is growing as UAE banks enter the scene.

These moves include Trump signing an executive order on the US strategic Bitcoin reserve and Senator Cynthia Lummis' Bitcoin reserve bill. While expectations for the BTC reserve continue, an important meeting will be held in Washington today in the USA. According to The Block, the meeting will be hosted by Cynthia Lummis, the senator behind the BITCOIN Act, and will be attended by prominent figures such as Strategy founder Michael Saylor and Bitmine president Tom Lee. Accordingly, the meeting will discuss the adoption and support of a bill aiming to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States. “Our focus will be on ensuring the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve advances in a budget-neutral manner and building the coalition needed to advance the BITCOIN Act.” Participants are expected to include crypto industry executives such as Strategy founder Michael Saylor, Ethereum startup BitMine chairman and Fundstrat CEO Tom Lee, MARA Holdings CEO Fred Thiel, and CleanSpark CEO Matt Schultz. Lummis previously introduced a bill that would require the US government to purchase 200,000 BTC annually for five years, accumulating a total of one million BTC. The BITCOIN Act, introduced back in March by Senator Cynthia Lummis, could be the next major focus of lawmakers on crypto legislation, following efforts to pass the GENIUS Act in July. The bill proposes that the US acquire 1 million Bitcoins, worth over $115 billion at current prices, as strategic reserves within five years through a budget-independent strategy, that these purchases be spread over five years (200,000 BTC per year), and that the purchases be made with resources that will not burden taxpayers, that is, the public. *This is not investment advice.

Most larger-cap alts experienced even more substantial declines yesterday, but have turned green on a daily scale. BTC Eyes $116K Again The primary cryptocurrency plunged hard at the beginning of the previous business week, dropping below $111,000. However, the asset reacted well and defended that level. Moreover, it initiated a notable leg up in the following week that saw it jump past $116,000 by Friday. Bitcoin tried to break out even further to the north during the weekend and on Monday morning. Nevertheless, the bears returned when BTC was close to $117,000 at the beginning of the current business week and pushed it south almost immediately. As a result, the cryptocurrency dropped by nearly two-and-a-half grand to $114,400 (on Bitstamp). It bounced off to challenge $116,000 once again earlier today, but couldn’t break past that level. As of now, the asset trades at around $115,500 with more volatility expected in the following days due to the highly anticipated FOMC meeting. Bitcoin’s market cap has calmed at $2.3 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts stands at 56%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView AVAX Flies Ethereum is among the few altcoins that continue to be slightly in the red on a daily scale. The asset slipped below $4,500 earlier today but has managed to bounce just above that level. Ripple’s XRP has defended the $3 support, while BNB, DOGE, LINK, SOL, TRX, and SUI are slightly in the green. Avalanche’s native token has taken the main stage with a 7% surge that has pushed it to well over $30. XLM, XMR, and MNT are also with notable gains. IMX has returned to the top 100 alts following a 15% surge that has driven its price to just over $0.73. Data from CoinGecko shows that the total crypto market cap has added over $40 billion since yesterday’s low and is up to $4.110 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Such good news for Bitcoin is perhaps tempered by nervousness that when the potential cut is announced, it will be treated by the market as a ‘sell the news’ event. Rate cut almost certain, but potential price manipulation will keep market guessing Only one day away, and the market is probably as certain as it can be that a rate cut will be announced by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday at the FOMC meeting. The CME Group Fedwatch tool is currently showing a 96.1% chance of a 25 basis points cut in interest rates, while there is a faint 3.9% chance of a 50 basis points reduction. This is certainly good news for risk assets such as Bitcoin, and the US stock market is also likely to benefit. That said, at times like this where a big price-changing event is announced, the market will often choose to go in the opposite direction. In this instance, an initial dip could result from the rate cut news release. In addition, market makers could be tempted to use the increased price volatility around the announcement to spike the price up and down in order to liquidate both the long and short positions. $BTC breaks out of small descending channel/bull flag Source: TradingView The current correctional movement for the $BTC price has so far been very shallow. Instead of a downward thrust, the price has generally moved sideways and only slightly downward, which could be taken as a fairly bullish period of price action. It can be observed that a channel within a channel has formed, and that the price has just broken out of this latest small-scale descending channel. The price is currently coming back and is likely to test the top of the channel and also confirm the $115,700 horizontal level as support again before potentially going higher. It might be argued that this channel could in fact be a bull flag. If it is, the measured move for the pole and flag would take the price up to around $120,000 - the last bit of resistance before the all-time high. Big challenge for $BTC ahead Source: TradingView The daily chart puts the resistance levels into perspective. It can be seen that the $BTC price still has a challenge in front of it to pierce through this band of horizontal resistance. The 50-day SMA (blue line) is now acting as support, and depending on the price action over the next couple of days, it could start to angle upwards again. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators either have a long way to go back to the bottom, or they will start to bounce along the top, perhaps like they did previously through the last part of June and until mid-July. Inverse head and shoulders pattern to take $BTC to $120,000? Source: TradingView Zooming more into the same daily chart a real bonus pattern becomes clearer. This comes in the form of an inverse head and shoulders, which is a bullish formation. The right shoulder broke through the neckline after completing the pattern, and the next daily candle confirmed it. A measured move for the pattern takes the price to … $120,000. $117,500 is key resistance level Source: TradingView Finally, the weekly chart view reveals how important it is that the $117,500 resistance is overcome, if the bull market is to continue. One major signal in favour of the bulls is the cross-up of the indicators in the Stochastic RSI. If this week closes in a bullish manner, these indicators will likely be signalling large upside price momentum that can take the $BTC price into the next stage of its bull run.

The group, headquartered in Abu Dhabi, consolidates four entities from both traditional finance and digital assets: Mount TFI, a private debt specialist and licensed fund manager in Poland, Monterra Capital, a multi-strategy digital hedge fund in Malta, blockchain engineering studio Nextrope and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Soil compliant with MiCA, the EU's crypto framework. Already licensed in Poland and Malta, the group is seeking approval from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market to expand services in the Middle East, a region it sees as a hub for regulated digital asset growth. ""It's an opportunity to become a global on-chain asset manager,"" ORQO CEO Nicholas Motz said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""We have all the pieces: the off-chain asset management, and on-chain, too."" ORQO's effort is part of a larger trend that's been reshaping crypto markets: moving traditional financial instruments like private credit, U.S. Treasuries, or trade finance deals onto blockchain networks. The process is also known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). Data from rwa.xyz shows that the RWA market has grown into a nearly $30 billion sector, though it remains tiny compared to traditional finance markets such as the $2 trillion private credit sector . Still, the growth potential is immense: the tokenized RWA market could reach $18.9 trillion by 2033, a joint report by Ripple and BCG projected. Yield platform Soil is a key piece in ORQO's gameplan, connecting the firm's RWA access with crypto capital capital. It aims to provide returns on stablecoins deposits from tokenized private credit, real estate and hedge fund strategies. As part of the next stage, the firm plans to open several credit pools targeting holders of Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin in the near future, allowing investors such as institutional treasuries or protocol reserves to earn a yield on their holdings.

They have described this moment as an American “golden age of innovation.” Their optimism is encouraging investors who are scanning the crypto market for opportunities. At the same time, a new token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is drawing attention as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Investors are accumulating during its presale, seeing both short-term gains and long-term potential. Gemini Co-Founders Back Innovation The Gemini co-founders are praising policies that have supported cryptocurrency adoption. They are highlighting how the White House has consistently promoted growth across crypto coins. Furthermore, they are pointing to Bitcoin as one of the most important assets of the past decade. This support, combined with growing institutional interest, is bolstering optimism across crypto predictions. In addition, Gemini’s launch of a Mastercard-backed Bitcoin credit card is reinforcing crypto investing as a mainstream habit. Each swipe channels spending into crypto investment, which encourages accumulation and rewards user loyalty. Consequently, their comments about innovation are giving fresh momentum to investors searching for the top crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance Presale Growing Fast Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. This marks a 250% increase from the first phase price of $0.01. Since the presale began, $15,800,000 has been raised, with 16,300 holders now onboard. Phase 6 is selling quickly, and once sold out, phase 7 will lift the price to $0.04, a 14.3% jump. The token is scheduled to launch at $0.06. Buyers in the current stage are positioning for returns between 300% and 500% once trading begins. Consequently, those asking what crypto to invest in are considering MUTM before the next price lift. Moreover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized its Certik audit, securing a strong 90.00 rating. No security issues have been reported in the past 90 days. To reinforce confidence further, the project has opened a Bug Bounty Program with $50,000 USDT allocated for rewards. Critical, major, minor, and low-tier findings are all eligible for compensation. This structured approach underlines a clear focus on safety and transparency. Lending Models And Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is introducing a dual lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract for stablecoins and Peer-to-Peer for speculative assets. This design is offering flexible borrowing and lending choices, appealing to diverse crypto investment strategies. Moreover, the site has interest rate mechanisms that stabilize the liquidity by modifying the cost of borrowing funds when the pools become tight and/or loose. This helps stabilize the activity in times of volatility, and prevents imbalances. Over-collateralization protects loans and liquidation mechanisms protect liquidity providers from elaborate price movements. Another security is the deposit and borrow limits which prevent exposure to volatile assets. Together, these measures create a reliable framework for users concerned about what is going on with crypto today. As crypto charts shift daily, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a steady option among altcoins. Strong Community Incentives Community engagement is continuing to expand around Mutuum Finance. A new dashboard with a leaderboard is rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, encouraging strong accumulation. In parallel, the team has announced its biggest giveaway yet, distributing $100,000 in MUTM across 10 winners. Each winner is receiving $10,000 in tokens. Eligibility requires a minimum $50 investment in the presale, ensuring active participation. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is enhancing visibility by offering holders a direct role in governance and platform growth. This community-first approach aligns with broader trends in crypto investing, where participation matters as much as price. For those evaluating whether crypto is a good investment, such initiatives provide reassurance. Investors Acting On Optimism The momentum seen in Gemini’s call for a golden age is now resonating with investors eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The presale is offering one of the best crypto prices today before the next increase. Those entering at $0.035 are setting themselves up for significant gains at launch. Consequently, investors are not only aligning with market optimism but also securing tokens with clear safeguards, proven audits, and strong utility. For anyone asking what crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is standing out as a clear choice.

51814810,581720,1758016834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51814810.jpeg,Dogecoin Open Interest Hits New ATH – Here’s What Happened The Last Time,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-open-interest-ath/,"Dogecoin has hit a new milestone after rallying more than 20% last week. The meme coin saw its open interest balloon over the weekend as investors poured in to take advantage of the price increase. This pushed its open interest quickly, and now, it has reached a new all-time high for the second time this year. Dogecoin Open Interest Crossed $6 Billion According to data from the on-chain aggregation website Coinglass, the Dogecoin open interest has now crossed $6 billion. This increase happened over the weekend following the Dogecoin price hitting $0.3 for the first time in over six months. Coincidentally, the open interest will hit its highest level in over six months as well. On Sunday, the total open interest came in at $6.01 billion, marking a new peak to beat its January 2025 record. Back in January, when the crypto market was still reeling from the surge that began back in November 2024, the Dogecoin open interest had risen to $5.51 billion and remained that way, despite the May 2025 run-up. The rise to a new all-time high in open interest is a direct representation of the interest that the meme coin is now seeing from crypto investors. This is because open interest takes into account all of the long and short contracts in the market. This means that crypto traders are placing more bets on the Dogecoin price, depending on the position they believe that it is headed in next. The Long/Short ratio on the website shows that crypto traders are favoring the Dogecoin price to decline during this time. The ratio comes in 0.9161, with 47.81% of traders betting on a price increase and 52.19% of traders expecting the price to keep falling. What Happened After The Last Open Interest Peak? Looking at the Dogecoin open interest chart, it paints a clear picture of what happens each time it hits a new all-time high. After the January peak, the open interest had begun to decline, and the Dogecoin price had followed suit. This led to a multi-month accumulation trend that ended toward the end of the 3rd quarter of the year. If this trend holds, then it is likely that the current Dogecoin correction is only the start.

Five-wave count suggests the asset could now enter Wave 3 or Wave 5 of a macro trend. ABC and WXY patterns together support the idea that XRP’s throwback phase is now complete. XRP May Have Completed Its Correction XRP is showing early signs that its recent price correction may be ending. Crypto market analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has shared an Elliott Wave-based review suggesting the asset could be preparing for its next move. The analysis shows what looks like a flat correction. In this setup, three waves are visible: A, B, and C. EGRAG noted that “Wave B didn’t quite reach Wave A,” but added that this can happen in some market conditions. The main focus is whether this pattern marks the end of the broader correction. #XRP – The Throwback Phase Is Finished If… (Update): Let me Zoom In to illustrate to illustrate the Elliot Wave Flat Corrective Structure. Zooming In: (1/5) I want to take you through a step-by-step breakdown of how I’m constructing this corrective wave. It could be… https://t.co/msT6UEOOHW pic.twitter.com/HWWA5Rq03z — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 16, 2025 This wave pattern might be the second or fourth wave in a larger market cycle. While the exact placement isn’t confirmed, the structure suggests that XRP may now be past the throwback phase. Chart Patterns Support a Shift in Trend A simplified chart shared by EGRAG shows an ABC pattern, which is commonly seen during market pullbacks. Alongside this, a WXY pattern is also present. This type of structure is often used to describe more complex market behavior when prices pause before resuming a trend. The combination of ABC and WXY patterns points to a possible conclusion of the correction . EGRAG also stated that when the B wave in an ABC structure shows strong upward movement, it can mean the market is getting ready to move higher again. A separate wave count was also shared, showing five smaller waves forming after the correction. In Elliott Wave Theory, this is a sign that the market may be starting a new upward phase. The five-wave count is being viewed as a sign that XRP is either starting Wave 3 or Wave 5 in a longer cycle. “The strength of the 5-wave pattern… reinforces the notion that the corrective phase has ended,” EGRAG posted. The placement depends on whether the last correction was Wave 2 or Wave 4. If it were Wave 2, XRP could now be entering Wave 3, which tends to show stronger price action . XRP Price and ETF Update XRP was trading at $3.03 at the time of writing, with a 24-hour volume of $5.1 billion. The price is up 2% in the past 24 hours and has slight gains over the past week. Meanwhile, the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (ticker: XRPR) is expected to launch this week after earlier delays.

Bittensor (TAO) is gaining traction through price insight that highlights its potential path, while Dogecoin (DOGE) has regained attention as trading activity builds on ETF speculation. Both remain closely monitored as discussions continue about the best crypto to buy. BlockDAG (BDAG), however, is setting itself apart by combining large-scale adoption with strong security. Its $0.0013 entry tied to the upcoming Deployment Event has already helped push the presale to over $405 million with over 26.2 billion coins sold. With more than 3 million X1 app miners, 312,000 holders, 19,800+ hardware units sold, single whale entries of $4.3M and $4.4M, and independent audits from CertiK and Halborn, BlockDAG (BDAG) has achieved both credibility and scale. Bittensor Price Signals Room for Growth Bittensor (TAO) has become one of the more notable projects under review, with analysts studying recent movements to gauge longer-term strength. Current Bittensor price insight suggests the coin could extend its upward momentum if trading volumes stay elevated and sentiment holds positive. This price view also reflects Bittensor’s position as a blockchain project integrated with artificial intelligence. That design has attracted interest from traders who see it as part of the rising AI-focused trend in crypto. Still, experts note that TAO’s volatility keeps it in speculative territory, with growth dependent on market enthusiasm and the ability to expand its ecosystem. For those looking at the best crypto to buy, Bittensor carries upside potential but with risk, as sustainability depends on whether demand can remain strong over time. Dogecoin Buzz Builds with Trading Activity Dogecoin (DOGE) has stepped back into the spotlight as trading activity increases. Growing talk about ETF approval odds has fueled speculation about its ability to test higher levels. This Dogecoin trading buzz highlights its lasting visibility as a retail-driven coin. The trading surge has also raised expectations, with some market watchers pointing to a possible rise toward $0.50 if ETF momentum grows. However, critics argue that Dogecoin still lacks the functional use cases seen in competitors, leaving its future shaped largely by headlines and sentiment rather than measurable adoption. For those considering the best crypto to buy, DOGE remains a widely followed asset, but one where risk is elevated due to its reliance on speculative moves. Its trading buzz is strong, but whether that converts to sustained growth is still uncertain. BlockDAG Builds Market Trust Through Strong Security BlockDAG is distinguishing itself by pairing rapid adoption with strict security practices. Access to its presale has been locked at $0.0013 ahead of the BDAG Deployment Event in Singapore. So far, the presale has raised over $405 million, with more than 26.2 billion coins sold. Holders from Batch 1 have already seen 2,900% returns, while those entering at $0.0013 are positioned for possible gains of 38x once BDAG hits its confirmed $0.05 launch price. Adoption data reflects consistent traction: over 3 million mobile app users, 312,000 coin holders growing by about 1,000 each day, and a 325,000-strong community. Hardware expansion has also scaled, with 19,800+ miners sold across 130+ countries and shipments continuing at 2,000 units per week. Large-scale confidence has been shown through whale entries of $4.3M and $4.4M, underscoring strong belief in BlockDAG’s direction. What sets BlockDAG apart is its focus on network safety. Independent audits by CertiK and Halborn confirm that its smart contracts and system infrastructure meet the highest standards. Supporting features like the BlockDAG Explorer and Demo Dashboard V4 give real-time tracking of wallets, referrals, and transactions, ensuring visibility. Together with live use of the X1 app and X10 Series Miners producing 200 BDAG daily, BlockDAG demonstrates that its framework is secure, transparent, and already functional before its official listing. Assessment of Broader Market Position Bittensor’s price outlook highlights the opportunity in AI-driven crypto, while Dogecoin’s trading buzz shows how speculation can influence short-term value. Both play an active role in the market, though their volatility raises questions about sustained growth. BlockDAG presents a stronger case. Its $0.0013 entry stage, over $405 million raised in crypto presale , 26.2 billion coins sold, and millions of users signal genuine adoption. With 19,800+ miners sold, 312,000 holders, whale entries above $4 million, and developer activity expanding, its foundation is solid. Most importantly, the CertiK and Halborn audits confirm its reliability. For those considering the best crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG offers assurance built on participation and verified safety.

Key Takeaways: Pump.fun surpassed Hyperliquid in daily protocol revenue, hitting over $1 billion in trading volume and ranking third among DeFi platforms. The memecoin market cap surged to a 30-day high of $83 billion, reflecting strong retail interest and token launches. Pump.fun is expanding into livestreaming, paying $4 million to creators as it aims to rival platforms like Rumble and Kick. The milestone comes as memecoin trading continues to rally in September, fueled by a sharp spike in market activity and token launches. On Monday, Pump.fun recorded over $1.02 billion in daily trading volume, up from $942 million the day before, as shown by decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter . Memecoin Market Cap Hits $83B High Amid Ongoing Sector Rally The surge coincided with a broader memecoin sector rally, where the total market cap hit a 30-day high of $83 billion on Sunday, holding above $80 billion through Monday. While the sector has slightly cooled to $76 billion at press time, the interest in meme tokens remains elevated. Pump.fun’s total value locked (TVL) also hit a record high of $334 million on Sunday, underscoring growing capital inflow into the platform’s smart contracts. The protocol ranked third in daily DeFi revenue, behind only Tether and Circle, while beating out Hyperliquid for two consecutive days. This marks a notable shift in protocol rankings as retail interest floods into memecoins again. Beyond trading volume, Pump.fun is pushing aggressively into livestreaming. On Monday, the platform announced it had distributed $4 million in rewards to content creators, the majority of whom were first-time streamers. yesterday, pump fun paid out over $4m in Creator Rewards, most of which went to first-time creators that are now able to realize the potential of their dreams a cambrian explosion of ideas is well underway, powered by tokenization Ascend. — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) September 15, 2025 Pump.fun co-founder Alon claimed the platform’s livestreaming tool surpassed Rumble in average concurrent streams, edging toward 1% of Twitch’s share and 10% of Kick’s. However, these claims remain unverified by third-party analytics platforms. The memecoin sector’s latest momentum also lifted major tokens like Dogecoin, which gained 11% over the past week despite the delay of a proposed US-listed Dogecoin ETF. Other lesser-known meme tokens, including Memecore (M), Moo Deng (MOODENG), and DORA, posted double-digit gains as well. already flipped Rumble in terms of average number of concurrent live streams currently inching at ~1% of Twitch's market share and ~10% of Kick's market share we're nibbling on their lunch and COMING FOR MORE — alon (@a1lon9) September 13, 2025 Pump.fun’s breakout underscores how fast-growing meme culture continues to disrupt both DeFi economics and Web3 entertainment platforms, as it evolves beyond speculation into creator-driven ecosystems. Pump.fun Acquires Kolscan In July, Pump.fun announced its acquisition of the wallet tracking tool Kolscan, aiming to revolutionize on-chain trading. The integration will merge Kolscan’s analytics with Pump.fun’s social trading features, enhancing transparency, wallet tracking, and copy-trading capabilities. Co-founder Alon Cohen emphasized that trading is a “social sport,” highlighting the importance of community and shared insights in driving success within the ecosystem. As part of the deal, all Kolscan services will be made free to users. Pump.fun has already attracted tens of thousands of users and intends to build a scalable crypto social media platform, leveraging Kolscan’s tools to grow its community and influence.

On-chain efficiency and integration with wider markets have long been focal points for the project, and new functionality may soon further expand these capabilities. A recent revelation suggests that Ripple could be preparing to integrate an Oracle network directly into the XRPL framework. Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) recently published screenshots to prove the existence of Oracle functionality on the XRPL. The images show an options interface labeled “XRPL price oracle,” as well as a “Receive Payments” window where exchange rates are applied through the oracle system. The screenshots suggest that users could select a target currency such as USD, EUR, JPY, or others, with payments processed based on conversion rates sourced from the XRPL Price Oracle. This development indicates that Ripple is testing a native price oracle that can provide real-time exchange data across multiple fiat currencies. Proof of XRPL Price Oracle Functionality Revealed https://t.co/Mwym0pV6mg pic.twitter.com/oxAWKyotzi — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 15, 2025 The Importance of the XRPL Oracle This is not the first time SMQKE has drawn attention to the topic. On August 25, he revealed that Ripple was building an Oracle network that could displace Chainlink, with documents to back his claim. Oracles are critical components of blockchain ecosystems because they allow decentralized applications to access external data, including price feeds that determine fair settlement values. If Ripple deploys a fully functioning oracle system within XRPL, it could remove reliance on external services and create a more self-sufficient infrastructure. Why Is This Important for XRP? Another expert recently described this process as XRP’s path to becoming Wall Street’s data highway . While the scope and timeline of deployment remain unknown, the presence of an interface highlights that Ripple is moving forward with tangible testing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Oracle networks play an essential role in bridging blockchains with real-world data. In decentralized finance, accurate and secure price feeds ensure that transactions, smart contracts, and settlements occur with reliability. Chainlink has long dominated this sector, providing feeds to numerous blockchains and protocols. While XRP and Chainlink have been compared in other aspects , Ripple’s attempt to build an internal price oracle could position XRPL as a direct competitor. For XRP, this advancement could enhance its appeal to institutional and retail users by providing a stronger infrastructure for payments and settlement. With reliable oracle functionality, exchanges and payment applications on XRPL can manage conversions across global currencies more efficiently.

What It Is: The BuyBack Vault is an unprecedented opportunity for the R0AR community: A minimum of 1% above market value is being offered for 1R0R tokens, with potential for higher rates depending on conditions. Wallets transferring assets to the R0AR Chain may become eligible for upcoming airdrops, platform rewards, and gated benefits. Participants who did not engage in the 1R0R pre-sale, Executive R0AR Society NFT mint, DeFi programs, or early Node offerings may still qualify as early adopters ahead of the R0AR Chain reaching its initial 10,000-user milestone. Why It Matters The BuyBack Vault is more than a buyback—it’s a signal of intent: By incentivizing total value locked (TVL) and broader participation, the initiative aims to reinforce the structural and transactional strength of the R0AR Chain. Rather than conducting token repurchases on external networks, the focus remains on building value directly within the R0AR infrastructure. The BuyBack Vault is one of several forthcoming developments, with future updates expected to introduce new token burn mechanisms and expanded ecosystem integrations designed to support long-term functionality and visibility. What It Means for the Ecosystem The BuyBack Vault directly fuels the growth engine of R0AR: Depletes the supply of 1R0R on the open market. Grows TVL on R0AR Chain—one of the ecosystem’s key metrics. Drives visibility and community hype , setting the stage for exponential growth. This initiative is the first of five strategic announcements rolling out over the next five weeks, each designed to throw gas on the fire of community energy, ecosystem participation, and chain adoption. A Word from R0AR “The BuyBack Vault is about more than buying tokens—it’s about rewarding loyalty, strengthening our foundation, and proving to the world that the R0AR Chain is here to dominate. Participation is the key to growth, and we’re rewarding it at every level.” Dustin Hedrick, chief technology officer About R0AR R0AR is a next-generation blockchain ecosystem uniting DeFi, NFTs, and community-driven innovation. Anchored by the $1R0R token and the Executive R0AR Society NFT collection, R0AR is building the infrastructure, tools, and rewards system to power the next wave of decentralized adoption.

The highest decrease is 3% by Dogecoin (DOGE) , currently standing at $0.2669. One coin, however, is green, but its change is so low that it’s practically unchanged. Binance Coin (BNB) is up 0.2% to $931. When it comes to the top 100 coins, of the 12 green coins, Pump.fun (PUMP) appreciated the most: 6.6% to $0.00834.

Small caps & financials pic.twitter.com/HoEW6VgdDt — Tom Lee Tracker (Not actually Tom) (@TomLeeTracker) September 15, 2025 ‘All Eyes on the US Fed Meeting’ Bitunix analysts commented that markets widely expect the US Federal Reserve to announce its first rate cut since last year this Wednesday. With internal policy divisions and political pressure intertwining, they write, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision “could spark sharp volatility.” Traders should reduce leverage exposure and “closely watch the battle between BTC 117,000 resistance and 114,000 support.” From a technical perspective, the analysts continue, “BTC liquidation heatmaps show price rallying toward 116,800, with heavy liquidation clusters between 117,000–118,000 forming a major near-term resistance band. Support lies at 114,000 and 111,000, with a potential drop toward the 108,500 liquidity zone if these levels break.” Moreover, Bitget’s Chief Analyst Ryan Lee adds that a rate cut would reduce borrowing costs and boost liquidity, providing a tailwind for risk assets. “Under this scenario, Bitcoin could climb toward $150,000–$200,000 by year-end, while Ethereum may advance to the $5,800–$8,000 range on the back of ETF rotations and network expansion. Together, these trends reflect a maturing market where Bitcoin and Ethereum drive industry growth in tandem, provided inflation stays contained and no major geopolitical shocks disrupt sentiment.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Tuesday morning, BTC trades at $115,864. The coin has seen a choppy trading day. It started at $115,895, then dropped to the intraday low of $114,509, before climbing to $116,000. BTC is consolidating at $116,000–$116,750, which is below key resistance. Should it fall below $114,400, it could see further drops to the $112,000 and $108,250 levels. On the other hand, moving above $116,750 could lead to $119,500, followed by $122,200 and $124,500. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently trading at $4,508. It started the day with the intraday high of $4,604, before dropping to the low $4,476, and trading relatively sideways since.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis After some brief consolidation in the last couple of days, Bitcoin is back in the green today. It’s now comfortably above the $115K mark. Despite speculation of a slightly deeper correction after yesterday’s action, Bitcoin was quick to jump back above short-term moving averages, like the 10 and 20 EMAs, on the 4-hour chart. While technically it’s still entirely possible that $BTC could trade a bit lower in the next couple of days, the upcoming FOMC meeting is expected to be very bullish for crypto, including Bitcoin. Combined with a rate cut, Bitcoin’s strong technical setup provides the perfect platform for the token to reclaim its current all-time highs and set some new ones.

An address widely believed to be linked to the prominent crypto venture capital firm Maven 11 has executed a significant move, pulling 21.156 million ENA tokens – valued at an astounding $15.1 million – directly from Binance. This substantial transfer, reported by on-chain analyst EmberCN, has naturally sparked considerable discussion and speculation within the crypto community. What does such a massive ENA withdrawal truly signify, and what insights can we glean from the strategic maneuvers of institutional players like Maven 11? What Does This Strategic ENA Withdrawal Signify? Maven 11 is recognized as a key player in the crypto venture capital landscape, known for its strategic investments in promising blockchain projects. When a firm of this caliber makes such a substantial move, it rarely happens without careful consideration. This particular ENA withdrawal could indicate several strategic intentions: Long-Term Staking: Maven 11 might be moving the ENA tokens to a dedicated staking wallet to participate in the Ethena protocol’s governance or to earn staking rewards, signaling a long-term bullish conviction. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large institutional transfers sometimes precede an OTC sale, where tokens are sold directly to another party without impacting exchange liquidity. However, this is less common for withdrawals to a known VC address without immediate subsequent transfers. Enhanced Security Measures: Moving assets from an exchange to a cold storage solution or a multi-signature wallet enhances security, reflecting a commitment to safeguarding significant holdings. Participation in Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The tokens could be earmarked for deployment in various DeFi protocols, such as providing liquidity or collateral, to generate further yield. The ENA token, native to the Ethena protocol, is central to a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. Its value and utility are tied to the protocol’s performance and adoption, making Maven 11’s interest a noteworthy endorsement. How Do We Track Such Significant Crypto Movements? The ability to track such an extensive ENA withdrawal is thanks to the transparency of public blockchains and the work of dedicated on-chain analysts like EmberCN. These analysts utilize sophisticated tools to monitor transactions, identify wallet addresses, and connect them to known entities or patterns. This provides invaluable insights into market dynamics and institutional behavior. Blockchain Explorers: These tools allow anyone to view transaction details, including sender and receiver addresses, amounts, and timestamps. Wallet Tagging: Over time, specific wallet addresses become associated with exchanges, venture capital firms, or prominent individuals, enabling analysts to identify the parties involved in transactions. Pattern Recognition: Analysts look for unusual large transfers, frequent movements, or specific interactions with smart contracts to infer potential strategies. Binance, as one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, serves as a primary gateway for many large-scale transactions. While the exact internal reasons for Maven 11’s decision to initiate this ENA withdrawal remain speculative, the on-chain data offers a clear trail of the assets’ movement post-exchange. What Could Be the Broader Market Implications of This ENA Withdrawal? A significant ENA withdrawal by a major VC firm like Maven 11 can send ripples through the market, even if it doesn’t immediately cause price volatility. Such actions are often interpreted by the wider investor community as a signal of confidence or a strategic repositioning. While it’s crucial to avoid direct correlation without further data, here are some potential implications: Increased Investor Confidence: A large withdrawal for potential staking or long-term holding can be seen as a bullish signal, suggesting the VC firm believes in ENA’s future growth. Supply Dynamics: If the tokens are moved off-exchange for staking, it reduces the immediate circulating supply available for trading, which could, in theory, contribute to price stability or upward pressure over time. Enhanced Visibility for Ethena: Maven 11’s involvement brings more attention to the Ethena protocol, potentially attracting other institutional or retail investors. Learning from Institutional Strategies: For retail investors, observing these large-scale movements can provide valuable lessons in long-term asset management and strategic accumulation, rather than short-term trading. It’s important for investors to conduct their own research and not solely rely on the actions of others. However, understanding the context behind a significant ENA withdrawal like this can certainly enrich one’s market perspective. In conclusion, the substantial ENA withdrawal by a Maven 11-linked address from Binance is more than just a large transaction; it’s a window into the strategic thinking of institutional crypto investors. Whether for staking, enhanced security, or future DeFi deployments, such a move underscores a deliberate long-term perspective on the Ethena protocol and its native token. As the crypto market continues to mature, tracking these sophisticated movements becomes increasingly vital for understanding underlying trends and potential future developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ENA? A1: ENA is the native governance and utility token of the Ethena protocol, which aims to provide a decentralized, censorship-resistant synthetic dollar (USDe) built on Ethereum. Q2: Who is Maven 11? A2: Maven 11 is a prominent crypto venture capital firm that invests in and supports various blockchain projects and decentralized technologies, often taking significant positions in promising digital assets. Q3: Why would a firm withdraw such a large amount of ENA from an exchange? A3: There are several reasons, including moving tokens for long-term staking, deploying them in DeFi protocols, enhancing security by transferring to cold storage, or preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction. Q4: Does this ENA withdrawal guarantee a price increase for ENA? A4: No, a large withdrawal does not guarantee a price increase. While it can be interpreted as a bullish signal due to reduced exchange supply or long-term holding intentions, market prices are influenced by many factors, and speculation should be avoided. Q5: How can I track similar institutional movements? A5: You can track institutional movements using blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens) and following reputable on-chain analysts on social media or dedicated crypto analytics platforms. Q6: Is Ethena a safe investment? A6: All cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks. While Ethena aims for stability with its synthetic dollar, it is subject to market volatility, smart contract risks, and regulatory changes. Always conduct thorough due diligence before investing.

One such pivotal moment is the recent announcement regarding the Mirror shutdown , a well-known Web3 content distribution platform. This news has certainly captured the attention of creators and enthusiasts within the decentralized publishing space, prompting questions about the future of their content and the broader landscape. Understanding the Mirror Shutdown: What Happened? In a move that underscores the dynamic nature of Web3, Mirror revealed its decision to cease operations within the next month. This development follows a strategic acquisition last year by Paragraph, another prominent platform in the decentralized content sphere. Essentially, the Mirror shutdown is not an end but rather a consolidation, as all of Mirror’s existing services are slated for integration into the Paragraph platform. Acquisition by Paragraph: Last year, Paragraph acquired Mirror, setting the stage for this transition. Service Integration: All functionalities and content from Mirror will be seamlessly integrated into Paragraph. One-Month Timeline: Users have a limited window to understand the changes and prepare for the transition. This integration aims to streamline the experience for creators and readers alike, bringing together the strengths of both platforms under a unified banner. However, it naturally raises questions about what this means for those who have built their presence on Mirror. Why is the Mirror Shutdown a Pivotal Moment for Web3 Creators? For many creators, Mirror represented a unique space for publishing content, funding projects through NFTs, and engaging with a decentralized audience. The Mirror shutdown therefore marks a significant shift, impacting how creators will manage and distribute their work going forward. This transition presents both challenges and exciting new opportunities for the Web3 community. Creators who have utilized Mirror for their articles, newsletters, and funding campaigns will need to adapt to Paragraph’s environment. This means understanding new tools, features, and community dynamics. While change can be daunting, it often leads to innovation and improved functionalities. Seamless Transition? Exploring Paragraph’s Role Post-Mirror Shutdown Paragraph is positioned to absorb Mirror’s services, aiming for a seamless transition for creators. But what exactly does Paragraph offer, and how will it enhance the experience previously provided by Mirror? Paragraph is known for its robust features tailored for Web3 native publishing, including: Creator Tools: Advanced publishing tools, subscription management, and NFT integration. Community Focus: Features designed to foster engagement and build a strong creator-reader relationship. Decentralized Infrastructure: Continued commitment to Web3 principles, ensuring content ownership and censorship resistance. The integration means that creators can potentially benefit from an expanded suite of tools and a more comprehensive platform for their decentralized publishing needs. This consolidation could lead to a more powerful and user-friendly experience, building upon the foundations laid by Mirror before its Mirror shutdown . Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights After the Mirror Shutdown For creators impacted by the Mirror shutdown , understanding the next steps is crucial. It’s time to explore Paragraph’s platform and familiarize yourself with its offerings. Here are some actionable insights: Explore Paragraph: Dive into Paragraph’s features, interface, and community guidelines. Migrate Content: Understand the process for migrating your existing Mirror content to Paragraph. Ensure all your valuable articles and data are secured. Engage with the Community: Connect with other creators and the Paragraph team to ask questions and share experiences during this transition period. Leverage New Features: Look for new functionalities within Paragraph that could enhance your content strategy or audience engagement. The transition underscores the importance of staying agile in the fast-paced Web3 world. While the Mirror shutdown might feel like an ending for some, it represents a new chapter for decentralized content creation, promising a consolidated and potentially more powerful platform for the community. In conclusion, the Mirror shutdown marks a significant, yet ultimately transformative, event for the Web3 content landscape. While the pioneering platform will cease independent operations, its integration into Paragraph signals a strategic consolidation aimed at fostering a more robust and feature-rich environment for decentralized publishing. This evolution encourages creators to embrace new opportunities and continue building the future of content in Web3. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the main reason for the Mirror shutdown? The Mirror shutdown is primarily due to its acquisition by Paragraph last year. The services will not disappear but will be integrated into the Paragraph platform, aiming for a unified and enhanced Web3 publishing experience. 2. How long do I have before Mirror’s services are completely shut down? Mirror announced that its services will shut down within one month from the announcement date. Users should check official communications from Mirror or Paragraph for the exact timeline and any migration instructions. 3. What will happen to my content published on Mirror after the shutdown? All of Mirror’s services, including published content, are expected to be integrated into the Paragraph platform. Creators should follow Paragraph’s guidelines for migrating or accessing their content post-integration to ensure a smooth transition. 4.

As a Layer 1 blockchain, Cardano processes transactions on its leading network, which can impact throughput during peak demand. It’s a key player in the altcoin space. Recent market analysis projects a significant downturn for Cardano, with predictions suggesting ADA could drop over 40% by 2026. Macroeconomic headwinds and increasing competition from more agile Layer 2 solutions contribute to this cautious outlook. Institutional portfolios are diversifying, and while Cardano maintains a strong community, its growth potential is being questioned amidst a volatile crypto bull run. Layer Brett presale gains momentum as Cardano faces market pressure Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is making waves with its presale, giving early backers a shot at one of the most talked-about low-cap crypto plays of 2025. Built on Ethereum’s Layer 2 framework, it compresses fees, scales throughput, and delivers meaningful staking rewards that set it apart from meme-only projects. The team’s rallying cry, “Brett is done being ordinary,” signals its ambition to carve out real market share. On top of that, a $1 million giveaway program sweetens the deal for early adopters. While Cardano consolidates and faces pressure from projected downturns, Layer Brett presents a striking alternative, offering both community energy and technical utility. Its blockchain is designed for speed, scale, and experimentation, allowing users to stake and earn while engaging with a growing ecosystem. By merging meme culture with real performance, $LBRETT is shaping up as a next-generation contender. Still in presale, Layer Brett positions itself as more than hype—it’s a bold experiment with straightforward utility at its core. Join the top Ethereum Layer 2 token now.

Binance Coin (BNB) has cemented its dominance once again, reaching a fresh all-time high above $940 and pushing its market cap past $130.64 billion. That milestone means BNB now outranks Swiss banking giant UBS in valuation, underscoring crypto’s steady encroachment on traditional finance. In the last 24 hours, BNB rose 3.52%, with trading volume surging over $2.68 billion — an 11% increase as momentum builds. On a weekly basis, BNB has climbed 10.7%, and over the past year, the token has delivered nearly 73% gains. This consistent performance has kept BNB in the spotlight as one of the top cryptos to buy now for traders who favor large-cap altcoins with institutional traction. Technical Outlook: Why Analysts Are Targeting $1,300 Technical analyst Ali has identified that BNB recently broke out of a correction phase, opening the door to higher targets. Current projections call for a climb to $1,300, which represents a 38% upside from present levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 71.25, high, but not yet in overbought territory, suggesting BNB still has room to run before exhaustion sets in. Short-term, the $1,000 psychological barrier looms as the next key resistance. A sustained breakout above that level could fuel further upward price discovery. Across multiple timeframes, BNB continues to impress: Monthly performance : +11% 6-month performance : +56.3% Year-to-date performance : +34% All signs point to sustained bullish momentum, supported by rising institutional interest. Institutional Confidence and Market Position BNB now battles with Solana for the fifth-largest crypto spot by market cap. At the time of writing, Solana leads with $131.47B, compared to BNB’s $130.76B, a gap of less than $1 billion. This rivalry continues to draw investor attention, with both tokens appealing to institutions. Confidence in BNB’s long-term growth was underlined recently when Nano Labs acquired $90 million worth of BNB for its corporate treasury. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has openly challenged banks to integrate BNB for payments, trading, and blockchain applications, signaling a push for mainstream adoption. These moves enhance BNB’s fundamentals, but they also highlight the maturity of the token. For whales seeking sharper upside, presale-stage projects are starting to attract more capital. BlockchainFX Presale: The Rising Alternative While BNB continues to surge toward its $1,300 target, some investors are shifting their attention to early-stage opportunities where the growth potential is even sharper. Enter BlockchainFX ($BFX), a project that is quickly becoming one of the top cryptos to buy now for 2025. The presale has already proven its strength, raising over $7.46 million and reaching 99.5% of its $7.5M soft cap, with nearly 10,000 participants locked in. This level of traction not only validates market interest but also signals strong community confidence. With the token priced at just $0.023 and a confirmed launch price of $0.05, presale buyers are effectively securing a 117% built-in upside at listing. For whales and retail traders alike, that kind of entry point is rare among the top cryptos to buy now. But the real appeal of BlockchainFX goes beyond speculative pricing. The project is positioning itself as a multi-asset super app, something the market has been demanding for years. By offering access to 500+ assets, spanning crypto, stocks, ETFs, bonds, and forex, all from a single platform, BlockchainFX bridges the gap between decentralized finance and traditional markets. That kind of cross-market integration is what sets the top cryptos to buy now apart from the rest. Its deflationary tokenomics add further strength. A full 70% of fees are redistributed back to the community: 50% flow into staking pools (paid in both BFX and USDT). 20% fund daily buybacks, with half of those tokens permanently burned. This structure reduces supply while rewarding holders, a system designed for long-term sustainability, a quality often missing in many presale tokens but essential for those hoping to be counted among the top cryptos to buy now. BlockchainFX Presale Snapshot $7.46M raised (99% of $7.5M goal) 9,600+ investors already in $0.023 now → $0.05 launch price 117% upside locked Use code BLOCK30 for +30% tokens 🎉 $500K Gleam Giveaway Don’t miss your chance to grab part of $500,000 in BFX tokens . 10 winners will share the pool Open to all presale buyers BlockchainFX is also leaning heavily into real-world utility, something many projects promise but fail to deliver. Holders gain access to the BlockchainFX Visa card, which allows for global spending and ATM withdrawals of up to $10,000 monthly. The card integrates directly with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making it practical for everyday transactions. Add to that an AI-powered trading suite, instant asset swaps, and daily USDT rewards, and the picture becomes clear: BlockchainFX is offering tangible tools alongside financial incentives. Another factor fueling momentum is its community-driven growth model. The project includes tiered contribution bonuses, referral programs, and competitions worth over $600,000. This gamified element encourages ongoing participation and has helped BlockchainFX maintain near-viral presale traction. For investors weighing whether to stick with established large-cap coins like BNB or to diversify into growth-stage tokens, BlockchainFX stands out. Its blend of real-world application, strong tokenomics, and early-stage upside make it a standout in any list of the top cryptos to buy now heading into 2025. Comparison: BNB vs BlockchainFX Feature BNB (Binance Coin) BlockchainFX ($BFX) Presale Current Price ~$918 $0.023 (presale) Market Cap $130.76B ~$7.5M soft cap (nearly filled) Growth Potential +38% to $1,300 target +117% upside at launch Utility Exchange token, payments, DeFi backbone Multi-asset app: crypto, stocks, forex, bonds Institutional Adoption Nano Labs $90M purchase, CZ’s push to banks 9,600+ presale buyers, global retail demand Rewards Network-driven value 70% fees redistributed, staking, buybacks Conclusion BNB has firmly established itself as one of the most reliable large-cap altcoins. With new highs above $940, bullish targets of $1,300, and institutional adoption growing, it remains a cornerstone in the conversation about the top cryptos to buy now . That said, its growth trajectory is steadier compared to presale-stage tokens. For investors chasing explosive upside and utility-packed ecosystems, BlockchainFX offers a compelling alternative. With nearly $7.5M raised, strong tokenomics, and a built-in presale-to-launch price gap, it stands out as one of the most attractive entries in today’s market. In 2025, both strategies hold value: BNB for stability and institutional alignment, BlockchainFX for early-stage opportunity and exponential growth potential.

The cryptocurrency world is a dynamic landscape, constantly evolving with new narratives and digital assets capturing investor attention. Among the most intriguing recent phenomena is the rise of the TRUMP meme coin , a digital asset that blends political fervor with the speculative excitement of the crypto market. This coin has generated significant buzz, leading many to ponder its trajectory. Will this politically charged token continue its ascent, or is its journey fraught with volatility? For those interested in cryptocurrencies, understanding the factors that could drive its value is crucial. This comprehensive guide delves into the potential future of $TRUMP, offering a detailed TRUMP price prediction for the coming years. Understanding the Phenomenon: What is the TRUMP Meme Coin? The TRUMP meme coin , often denoted as $TRUMP, emerged as a unique blend of political commentary and cryptocurrency speculation. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that often aim for technological innovation or real-world utility, meme coins derive their value primarily from community sentiment, social media trends, and cultural relevance. In the case of $TRUMP, its identity is inextricably linked to the former U.S. President, Donald Trump. This connection provides a distinct appeal to a specific demographic of crypto enthusiasts and political supporters, creating a dedicated community around the token. Key characteristics of the TRUMP meme coin include: Political Association: Its primary driver is its connection to a high-profile political figure, leveraging existing public discourse and media attention. Community-Driven: Like many meme coins, its value is heavily influenced by the engagement and enthusiasm of its holders and supporters. Speculative Nature: Investment in $TRUMP is largely speculative, betting on the coin’s ability to maintain relevance and attract new buyers based on political events or broader crypto market sentiment. Lack of Inherent Utility: Typically, meme coins like $TRUMP do not offer significant technological innovation or practical use cases beyond their function as a tradable asset. The emergence of such politically themed tokens highlights a fascinating intersection between digital finance and political movements, creating a new avenue for expression and speculation within the broader meme coin market . Historical Performance and Market Drivers for TRUMP Price Prediction Analyzing the historical performance of the TRUMP meme coin offers valuable insights into its volatility and the factors that have influenced its price movements. Since its inception, $TRUMP has experienced periods of rapid growth and significant corrections, typical of the highly speculative meme coin sector. Its price trajectory has often correlated with major political events, news cycles surrounding Donald Trump, and broader sentiment shifts in the cryptocurrency market. Several key factors contribute to the unpredictable nature of any TRUMP price prediction : Political Events: Elections, political rallies, legal developments, and public statements by Donald Trump can directly impact investor sentiment and, consequently, the coin’s price. Positive news or increased media attention often leads to price surges. Broader Crypto Market Trends: As an altcoin, $TRUMP is not immune to the overall movements of the cryptocurrency market. A bull run in Bitcoin and Ethereum often creates a ripple effect, lifting many altcoins, including meme coins. Conversely, market downturns can lead to significant sell-offs. Social Media Hype and Community Engagement: The strength of the $TRUMP community on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, and Reddit plays a crucial role. Viral trends, celebrity endorsements (even indirect ones), or strong community narratives can drive demand. Liquidity and Trading Volume: Higher trading volumes and better liquidity on exchanges can indicate growing investor interest and make the coin more accessible, potentially supporting price growth. Developer Activity and Tokenomics: While meme coins often lack complex development, factors like token burns, staking opportunities (if introduced), or partnerships can influence supply and demand dynamics. Understanding these intertwined factors is essential for anyone attempting to forecast the future value of this unique digital asset within the volatile meme coin market . TRUMP Meme Coin Price Prediction 2025: Navigating the Meme Coin Market Forecasting the price of any cryptocurrency, especially a meme coin, involves a degree of speculation, but by analyzing potential market conditions and political landscapes, we can form educated projections for the TRUMP meme coin . The year 2025 is expected to be a pivotal period, shaped by several macro and micro factors affecting the broader meme coin market . Optimistic Scenario for TRUMP Price Prediction 2025 In an optimistic scenario, several factors could converge to propel the TRUMP meme coin upwards. If Donald Trump maintains a strong presence in the political arena, particularly leading up to or following a significant election, the coin could benefit from renewed media attention and supporter enthusiasm. A generally bullish sentiment across the wider cryptocurrency market, potentially driven by institutional adoption of Bitcoin ETFs or favorable regulatory environments, would also provide a tailwind. Increased liquidity and listings on major exchanges could further enhance its visibility and accessibility. Under these conditions, a TRUMP price prediction could see the coin reaching new all-time highs. We might observe: Mid-Range: $15 – $25: This range could be achieved if political momentum is strong and the crypto market experiences moderate growth. High-End: $30 – $40: A highly favorable political outcome combined with a robust crypto bull run could push the price towards this ambitious target, attracting significant speculative capital. Pessimistic Scenario for TRUMP Price Prediction 2025 Conversely, a pessimistic outlook suggests challenges. A decline in Donald Trump’s political relevance, negative media coverage, or significant legal setbacks could diminish the coin’s appeal. Furthermore, a bearish turn in the overall crypto market, perhaps due to regulatory crackdowns or global economic instability, would likely drag down meme coins disproportionately. A loss of community interest or the emergence of new, more captivating meme coins could also divert attention and capital away from $TRUMP. In such a scenario, the TRUMP price prediction could see a significant retraction: Mid-Range: $5 – $10: A period of political stagnation or a cooling crypto market could see the coin settle in this range. Low-End: Below $5: Extreme political headwinds or a severe crypto bear market could lead to substantial losses, with the coin struggling to maintain its previous value. It’s important for potential investors to consider both sides of the coin when evaluating the future of the TRUMP meme coin within the volatile meme coin market . TRUMP Price Prediction 2026-2030: Long-Term Crypto Investment Outlook Extending a TRUMP price prediction out to 2030 requires even greater foresight, as the long-term viability of a meme coin is often questioned. The landscape of crypto investment is constantly shifting, and what holds true today may not apply five years from now. However, by considering potential long-term trends in politics, technology, and market behavior, we can sketch out possible paths for $TRUMP. Factors Influencing Long-Term TRUMP Price Over the longer term, the price of the TRUMP meme coin will likely be influenced by: Sustained Political Relevance: For $TRUMP to maintain significant value, Donald Trump would need to remain a prominent and influential figure in global politics. Any fading of his public presence could severely impact the coin’s core appeal. Evolution of Meme Coin Utility: While meme coins traditionally lack utility, some are exploring avenues like NFTs, gaming, or decentralized applications. If $TRUMP were to successfully integrate some form of utility, even minor, it could bolster its long-term value proposition. Regulatory Environment: Governments worldwide are increasingly looking to regulate the crypto space. Future regulations could either legitimize and stabilize the market or impose restrictions that hinder speculative assets like meme coins. Technological Advancements: The underlying blockchain technology continues to evolve. Any shifts in dominant blockchain platforms or new innovations could impact the ecosystem in which $TRUMP operates. Changing Investor Demographics: As new generations enter the crypto market, their investment preferences and risk appetites might shift, potentially affecting the appeal of politically themed meme coins. Long-Term Price Scenarios for TRUMP Meme Coin Given these considerations, here are potential long-term scenarios for the TRUMP price prediction : Year Optimistic Price Range Pessimistic Price Range Key Drivers 2026 $20 – $45 $4 – $12 Sustained political engagement, moderate crypto bull run vs. political decline, market consolidation. 2027 $25 – $55 $3 – $10 Continued political influence, potential for broader crypto adoption vs. waning interest, regulatory pressures. 2028 $30 – $65 $2 – $8 Significant political event (e.g., next election cycle), strong market fundamentals vs. severe political setbacks, bear market. 2029 $35 – $75 $1 – $6 Entrenched political relevance, successful utility integration (if any) vs. complete loss of political traction, meme coin fatigue. 2030 $40 – $80+ $0.50 – $4 Exceptional political impact, sustained market growth, niche community longevity vs. irrelevance, market crash. The question of whether $TRUMP can hit $50 by 2030 is certainly within the realm of possibility under highly optimistic conditions, particularly if its political namesake remains a dominant figure and the broader crypto market experiences sustained growth. However, it also faces significant hurdles typical for any long-term crypto investment in the meme coin sector. Challenges and Risks for TRUMP Meme Coin: Analyzing Future Crypto Trends While the potential for significant gains is often highlighted, it is crucial for any potential crypto investment in the TRUMP meme coin to acknowledge the substantial challenges and risks involved. The volatile nature of meme coins, combined with their specific drivers, makes them particularly susceptible to rapid price fluctuations. Understanding these risks is vital for making informed decisions and anticipating future crypto trends . Inherent Volatility of Meme Coins Meme coins, by their very definition, are highly volatile. Their value is largely driven by sentiment, social media trends, and speculative interest rather than fundamental utility or technological innovation. This means: Pump and Dump Schemes: Meme coins are often targets for coordinated buying and selling, leading to artificial price surges followed by sharp crashes. Sudden Shifts in Sentiment: Public interest can wane quickly, causing prices to plummet as investors move on to the next viral trend. Low Barriers to Entry: The ease of creating new meme coins means constant competition for attention and capital, potentially diluting interest in existing tokens. Political Dependencies and Unpredictability The explicit link of the TRUMP meme coin to a political figure introduces a unique set of risks: Political Unpredictability: Political fortunes can change rapidly. Negative news, electoral losses, or diminished public influence for Donald Trump could directly and negatively impact the coin’s value. Regulatory Scrutiny: Politically themed tokens might attract specific regulatory attention, potentially leading to restrictions or even bans in certain jurisdictions. Polarization: While the political association attracts a dedicated base, it also alienates others, limiting its broader appeal compared to more neutral cryptocurrencies. Broader Market and Regulatory Risks Beyond its specific characteristics, $TRUMP faces risks common to the entire crypto market: Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Harsher regulations could suppress the entire market. Economic Downturns: In times of economic recession, investors often retreat from high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies, leading to market-wide corrections. Technological Vulnerabilities: While less about the coin itself, the underlying blockchain or exchange infrastructure could face security breaches or technical issues. Navigating these challenges requires a deep understanding of market dynamics and a cautious approach, especially when considering the role of meme coins in future crypto trends . Actionable Insights: Crafting a Crypto Investment Strategy for TRUMP For those considering a crypto investment in the TRUMP meme coin , a well-thought-out strategy is paramount. Given its speculative nature and political dependencies, a cautious and informed approach is recommended. Here are some actionable insights to guide your decision-making, especially when evaluating its long-term potential and understanding the future crypto trends . 1. Research Thoroughly and Stay Informed Before investing, conduct extensive research. This includes: Understanding the Project: While a meme coin, know its origins, community size, and any unique aspects (e.g., potential future utility, though rare for meme coins). Tracking Political Developments: Since $TRUMP is politically tied, stay updated on news, polls, and events related to Donald Trump. These will be major price drivers. Monitoring Crypto Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. A rising tide lifts all boats, but a falling tide can sink many. Analyzing Social Media Trends: Meme coins thrive on hype. Follow relevant crypto communities and social media discussions to gauge sentiment. 2. Manage Risk Effectively Due to the high volatility, risk management is crucial: Invest Only What You Can Afford to Lose: This is the golden rule for any high-risk asset, especially meme coins. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one meme coin. Balance your portfolio with more established cryptocurrencies or other asset classes. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the price moves against your position. Avoid Emotional Decisions: The meme coin market can be driven by fear of missing out (FOMO) and fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Stick to your strategy. 3. Consider Your Investment Horizon Decide whether you are looking for short-term gains or long-term potential: Short-Term Trading: This involves trying to capitalize on rapid price swings. It requires constant monitoring and a high tolerance for risk. Long-Term Holding (HODLing): This strategy bets on the coin’s sustained relevance and potential growth over several years. For $TRUMP, this largely hinges on the enduring political influence of its namesake. 4. Evaluate Entry and Exit Points Technical analysis can provide insights into potential entry and exit points, even for meme coins: Support and Resistance Levels: Identify historical price levels where buying or selling pressure has been strong. Volume Analysis: Look for increases in trading volume accompanying price movements, which can indicate conviction. Market Cycle Awareness: Understand that meme coins often perform best during broader crypto bull markets. By integrating these actionable insights, investors can approach the TRUMP meme coin with a more structured and disciplined crypto investment strategy, navigating the complexities of future crypto trends with greater confidence. Conclusion: Will TRUMP Meme Coin Soar to $50? The journey of the TRUMP meme coin from a niche political token to a significant player in the speculative crypto market is a testament to the power of community, social media, and political narratives within the digital asset space. Our detailed TRUMP price prediction for 2025, 2026, and up to 2030 illustrates a range of possibilities, from conservative estimates to ambitious targets like $50 and beyond. Achieving such a milestone is certainly plausible under highly favorable conditions, including sustained political relevance for Donald Trump, a robust overall cryptocurrency market, and continued strong community engagement. However, it is equally important to acknowledge the inherent volatility and unique risks associated with this particular crypto investment . The meme coin market is characterized by rapid shifts in sentiment, a lack of fundamental utility, and susceptibility to broader market downturns. The political nature of $TRUMP adds another layer of unpredictability, tying its fate closely to real-world political developments and their potential impact on future crypto trends . Ultimately, investing in the TRUMP meme coin is a high-risk, high-reward proposition. While the allure of significant gains is strong, potential investors must conduct thorough research, manage their risks diligently, and understand that such assets are highly speculative. Whether $TRUMP ultimately soars to $50 or beyond will depend on a complex interplay of political events, market dynamics, and the enduring enthusiasm of its dedicated community. As with all cryptocurrencies, prudent investment practices and a clear understanding of personal risk tolerance are essential.

At the same time, DOGE holders are searching for newer and more rewarding opportunities. Layer Brett ($LBRETT) , a new Layer 2 meme coin, is making headlines with its presale surpassing $3.7 million at a rate of $0.058 per token. With staking APYs reaching 712% for early participants, many consider Layer Brett a powerful alternative. Experts are now eyeing Dogecoin price movements alongside Layer Brett’s explosive potential. Layer Brett: the Ethereum layer 2 token making waves in the crypto scene Layer Brett isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a Layer 2 blockchain built for a purpose. Unlike older tokens, Layer Brett leverages Ethereum’s security while delivering lightning-fast transactions and gas fees as low as $0.0001. This infrastructure unlocks throughput, bridging scalability with meme culture. Ethereum Layer 2s are projected to process over $10 trillion annually by 2027. Layer Brett aims for dominance in this expanding sector. It offers a clear path for growth beyond simple virality. Layer Brett transforms the original Brett concept into a high-utility Layer 2 solution. It fuses meme culture with real blockchain scalability on Ethereum. This project provides a decentralized platform for high-speed, low-cost interactions. It’s an evolving ecosystem that includes staking and token rewards. The project notes: “Brett is done being ordinary.” Layer Brett processes transactions off-chain, minimizing congestion on Ethereum’s mainnet. This design compresses fees and shrinks wait times, ensuring a smoother user experience. It supports instant buying and staking of $LBRETT with ETH, USDT, or BNB. Early buyers benefit from amplified staking rewards enabled by these lower operating costs, giving them significant incentives. How will traditional meme coins keep up? Dogecoin price prediction and market outlook Dogecoin stands as one of the original and most recognizable meme coins, initially created as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin. Launched in 2013, it quickly gained a cult following due to its Shiba Inu dog mascot. While popular for its community and tips on social media, Dogecoin primarily functions as a peer-to-peer digital currency without significant utility beyond transactions. Its value largely stems from social sentiment and celebrity endorsements. The outlook for Dogecoin price reaching $1 in 2026 remains highly speculative, with experts citing a 50:50 chance. While its strong community support can drive rallies, the lack of intrinsic utility presents a challenge.

Iespējams, ka jā, jo mēmu monētas vecākais brālis Maxi Doge (MAXI) jau mazāk nekā sešās nedēļās ir ieguvis vairāk nekā 2 miljonus dolāru iepriekšpārdošanas finansējumā. Maxi Doge tika izveidots, lai atgūtu to, ko DOGE ir zaudējis gadu gaitā – īstu jautrību, vērojot vērtības pieaugumu, kopienu pieaugumu un pat miljardieri Īlonu Musku, kurš runā par DOGE kā traks mēmu monētu pravietis. Tur, kur DOGE ir pazudis korporatīvā komfortā, MAXI atgriež īstu sajūsmu. Ja DOGE dabūja Masku, MAXI grib Zakerbergu – muskuļotu, gatavu cīņai ringā un atbalstītu ar mārketinga kasi, kas izveidota, lai pārpludinātu arēnu. Šī cīņa norisinās uzmanības centrā, un šoreiz tajā piedalās suņi. Tiem, kas ir gatavi pievienoties MAXI grupai, pašreizējā iepriekšpārdošanas kārtā žetoni maksā tikai 0,000257 ASV dolārus. Līdz nākamajai cenu paaugstināšanai ir palikušas mazāk nekā trīs dienas, tāpēc tagad ir īstais brīdis iegādāties žetonus, kamēr tie ir lēti. Volstrītā ir DOGE, savukārt cilvēkiem ar maziem ienākumiem ir MAXI Dogecoin jau ir stingri ieprogrammēts kriptovalūtā kā ”blue chip” suņu tematikas žetonos. Nesen DOGE kļuva par pirmo mēmu monētu, kas saņēma Volstrītas atzinību, uzsākot savu ETF, un pat ASV prezidents Donalds Tramps tagad ir ieinteresēts šajā kriptovalūtā.Bet tieši šis panākums ir monētas problēma. Tas, kas sākās kā joks par Bitcoin, ir kļuvis nopietns. Laiki, kad Masks valsts televīzijā kliedza “uz Mēness”, ir sen pagājuši, un DOGE nekad nav sasniedzis augstākos rādītājus, ko tas sasniedza 2021. gada trakumā. https://twitter.com/MaxiDoge_/status/1966140741735883201 Tieši šeit uz skatuves parādās Maxi Doge – vienkāršāks, izsalcis un tāds cīnītājs, kuru varētu cienīt pats Zakerbergs. MAXI daudzi uzskata par DOGE dvēseles reinkarnāciju – par to jautrības un haosa dzirksteli, ko oriģināls atstāja aiz sevis, kļūstot par ”blue chip”. Maxi Doge simbolizē “viss vai nekas” domāšanas veidu – zaudēt 1000 dolārus vai iegūt 1 miljonu dolāru. Un tas neapstāsies, kamēr pat mazākā cenu kāpuma spēks spēs pārvērst turētājus par miljonāriem. Maxi Doge atkal padara frāzi “uz Mēness” lielisku un, iespējams, pārvērš to par kaut ko tuvāku frāzei “uz Marsu”. Vai vecie turētāji zaudē interesi par DOGE un atbalsta MAXI? Dogecoin panākumus var attiecināt uz kulta līmeņa sekotāju pulku, ko tas spēja apvienot. Bet tagad, kad DOGE ir nonācis Volstrītā, rodas jautājums, vai tas kādreiz spēs radīt tādu pašu pieprasījumu. Augusta beigās daži no Dogecoin lielākajiem turētājiem sāka izpārdot savas monētas cenu krituma dēļ. Viens no lielajiem turētājiem pārvietoja 900 miljonus DOGE, kas tobrīd bija vērti 207 miljonus dolāru, uz Binance – šis solis satricināja uzticību DOGE tuvākā laika atgūšanās iespējām. Tas varētu būt īslaicīgs notikums, bet veco turētāju aiziešana bieži vien liecina par kaut ko lielāku, un tas ir vai nu ticības zaudējums, vai pāreja uz jaunām iespējām. Ņemot vērā to, ko tas nozīmē, un to, ka aptuveni 40 % no tā iepriekšpārdošanas finansējuma ir veltīti mārketingam, ir tikai laika jautājums, kad cilvēki sāks uzskatīt MAXI par nākamo DOGE. Vai MAXI var atkārtot DOGE leģendāro panākumu? MAXI augšupejošais potenciāls izriet no tā iepriekšpārdošanas cenas – 0,000257 ASV dolāri – un salīdzinoši zemās vērtības salīdzinājumā ar jau iedibinātajām mēmu monētām, kas dod tam daudz lielākas izaugsmes iespējas. ā jau minēts, liela daļa no iepriekšpārdošanas līdzekļiem tiek novirzīti mārketingam, un projekts ir strukturēts tā, lai ātri palielinātu atpazīstamību. Ja kotēšana biržās, pieņemšana un mēmu monētu noskaņojums sakritīs, Mai Doge ir strukturāla asimetrija, kas varētu pavērt durvis uz milzīgiem daudzkārtējiem pieaugumiem. DOGE, kura tirgus kapitalizācija ir 32 miljardi dolāru, vairs nevarēs sasniegt 302 000 % pieaugumu. No otras puses, MAXI joprojām nelielais apjoms nozīmē, ka laukums ir plaši atvērts – augsts risks, protams, bet ar tādu potenciālu, kas nostiprināja DOGE leģendas statusu. Maxi Doge ir gatavs, kad vien jūs esat gatavi Maxi Doge piedāvājums var tikt rezumēts vienā lietā – atbalstīt tos, kas tic viņam. Jo mēmu monētu pasaulē ticība ir visstiprākais dzinējspēks. Ja redzat MAXI kā nākamo DOGE, jūs varat nopirkt Maxi Doge iepriekšpārdošanas vietnē izmantojot labāko kriptovalūtas maku – Best Wallet. Jūs varat apmainīt ETH, BNB, USDT vai USDC – vai maksāt tieši ar bankas karti. Best Wallet var lejupielādēt bez maksas Google Play un Apple App Store. Jauniegādātās MAXI monētas var nekavējoties ieguldīt, izmantojot vietējo protokolu, ar dinamisku APY 156 %. Palieciet informēti, pievienojoties diskusijai Maxi Doge X un Telegram kontos.

Based in Abu Dhabi, the company has launched with $370 million in assets under management (AUM) and aims to establish a yield platform specifically for Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin. ORQO Launches in Abu Dhabi with $370 Million in Assets ORQO was created by merging four organizations from the traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems: Mount TFI, a Polish private debt fund; Monterra Capital, a Malta-based multi-strategy digital hedge fund; Nextrope, a blockchain engineering studio; and Soil, a DeFi protocol compliant with the EU’s MiCA regulation. Licensed in Poland and Malta, the group is now awaiting approval from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSR) at Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM). “We've put all the pieces together to become a global on-chain asset manager,” CEO Nicholas Motz said in a statement. The company's vision is part of a growing trend to bring traditional financial instruments like private credit, U.S. Treasury bonds, and trade finance to the blockchain. This process is known as “real-world asset tokenization” (RWA). The RWA market has already reached $30 billion. According to a joint report by Ripple and BCG, this space is projected to reach $18.9 trillion by 2033. ORQO's DeFi protocol, Soil, will combine tokenized private lending, real estate, and hedge fund strategies with stablecoin investments. The next phase plans to open private lending pools to holders of Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin, providing regular returns to institutional treasuries and protocols. *This is not investment advice.

For many, Dogecoin represents the power of community and viral momentum, often defying traditional financial logic. The burning question on every investor’s mind is: what does the future hold for this beloved meme coin? Specifically, what is the Dogecoin Price Prediction for the coming years, and will it finally hit the elusive $1 mark? This article dives deep into the potential trajectory of DOGE from 2025 to 2030, exploring the factors that could drive its value and the challenges it faces. Understanding Dogecoin: More Than Just a Meme? Dogecoin, often abbreviated as DOGE, was launched in 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. It was created as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, inspired by the popular ‘Doge’ meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog. Despite its whimsical origins, Dogecoin quickly gained a passionate community and found practical use for tipping online content creators and charitable causes. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has an inflationary supply, meaning there’s no cap on the number of coins that can be mined, with approximately 10,000 new DOGE entering circulation every minute. This unique economic model has always been a point of discussion regarding its long-term value proposition. The coin’s journey has been anything but conventional. It has seen periods of explosive growth, largely fueled by social media trends, celebrity endorsements (most notably from Elon Musk), and its strong, active community. This communal spirit is a cornerstone of Dogecoin’s identity, often rallying behind the coin during market fluctuations. However, its price action often remains highly speculative, making accurate long-term predictions a complex task. Factors Influencing DOGE Price Target: What Drives the Value? Predicting the future price of any cryptocurrency, especially one as unique as Dogecoin, involves analyzing a multitude of factors. These elements can significantly impact the DOGE Price Target , pushing it up or pulling it down. Here are some key considerations: Community and Social Media Hype: Dogecoin’s price is heavily influenced by its vibrant community and social media trends. Endorsements from prominent figures or viral campaigns can trigger rapid price surges. Utility and Adoption: While often seen as a meme coin, increasing real-world utility—such as acceptance as a payment method by major retailers or integration into decentralized applications (dApps)—could provide a strong foundation for sustained growth. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Trends: Dogecoin often moves in tandem with the overall crypto market. A bullish sentiment across Bitcoin and Ethereum typically bodes well for DOGE, while a downturn can drag it down. Technological Developments and Upgrades: Although Dogecoin’s core technology is relatively stable, any significant upgrades to its network, such as improvements in transaction speed or security, could enhance its appeal. Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic factors, including inflation, interest rates, and regulatory changes, can impact investor sentiment towards riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Supply and Demand Dynamics: With an ever-increasing supply, sustained demand is crucial for Dogecoin’s price appreciation. This demand needs to outpace the new coins entering circulation. Dogecoin Price Prediction 2025: What’s on the Horizon? As we look towards 2025, the cryptocurrency market is expected to mature further, potentially bringing more stability and institutional adoption. For Dogecoin, this period could be pivotal. The market’s cyclical nature suggests that after periods of consolidation, significant rallies can occur, especially for established coins with strong brand recognition. In 2025, we might see Dogecoin benefiting from increased mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. If more businesses integrate DOGE as a payment option, its utility would grow, providing a fundamental basis for price appreciation beyond mere speculation. Furthermore, potential upgrades or collaborations within the Dogecoin ecosystem could enhance its technical capabilities and appeal to a broader user base. Elon Musk’s continued interest, or even specific projects involving DOGE, could also provide significant catalysts. Considering these factors, our Dogecoin Price Prediction for 2025 suggests a range of possibilities: Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2025 $0.15 $0.28 $0.45 These figures are based on the assumption of continued market growth, increased adoption, and a relatively stable regulatory environment. However, volatility remains a key characteristic of the crypto market, and unforeseen events could alter this trajectory. Navigating the Dogecoin Future: A Look Towards 2026-2030 Peering further into the Dogecoin Future from 2026 to 2030 requires a broader perspective, considering long-term trends in technology, finance, and global adoption. By this time, the cryptocurrency landscape is likely to be vastly different. We could see a clear distinction between coins with strong utility and those that struggle to find a purpose beyond speculation. For Dogecoin to thrive in the long term, it will need to evolve. While its community and brand recognition are powerful assets, sustainable growth will likely depend on developing more robust use cases, enhancing its underlying technology, or integrating deeply into established platforms. The competition from newer, more technologically advanced cryptocurrencies will intensify, pushing Dogecoin to innovate or risk being left behind. If Dogecoin can successfully transition from primarily a meme coin to a more functional digital currency, perhaps as a preferred tipping mechanism across web3 platforms or a low-cost payment solution, its long-term outlook brightens. Institutional interest, which has historically focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum, might also broaden to include established altcoins like DOGE, providing significant capital inflows. Here’s a potential long-term Dogecoin Price Prediction for 2026-2030: Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $0.25 $0.40 $0.60 2027 $0.35 $0.55 $0.80 2028 $0.45 $0.70 $0.95 2029 $0.50 $0.85 $1.10 2030 $0.60 $0.95 $1.30 These projections are speculative and depend heavily on the evolution of the crypto market, Dogecoin’s own development, and external economic factors. The path to higher valuations is not linear and will undoubtedly involve significant price swings. Will DOGE Reach 1 Dollar? Analyzing the Path to a Major Milestone The question, “Will Dogecoin 1 Dollar?” , is perhaps the most frequently asked question by investors and enthusiasts alike. Reaching $1 would be a monumental achievement for DOGE, signifying a market capitalization in the hundreds of billions of dollars, placing it among the top digital assets globally. While ambitious, it is not an impossible feat, especially given Dogecoin’s history of defying expectations. For DOGE to hit $1, several conditions would likely need to align: Massive Market Inflows: Significant capital would need to flow into Dogecoin, either from retail investors or increasingly from institutional players. Sustained Mainstream Adoption: Widespread use as a payment method, potentially integrated into major e-commerce platforms or social media networks, would create constant demand. Strong Positive Sentiment: Continued positive media coverage, celebrity endorsements, and community support would be crucial to maintain momentum. Technological Enhancements: While not strictly necessary for a meme coin, any upgrades that improve Dogecoin’s efficiency, security, or functionality could bolster investor confidence. Overall Bull Market: A general bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin and Ethereum reaching new all-time highs, would provide a favorable environment for altcoins like DOGE to surge. The journey to $1 will be fraught with challenges, including its inflationary supply, which requires ever-increasing demand to absorb the new coins. However, Dogecoin has proven its ability to leverage viral trends and community power. If it can combine this with growing utility and a favorable market, the $1 target, while ambitious, remains within the realm of possibility by the end of the decade. Challenges and Opportunities for Dogecoin’s Growth Every investment comes with its own set of challenges and opportunities. Dogecoin is no exception, and understanding these can provide a clearer picture of its future trajectory. Challenges: Infinite Supply: Unlike Bitcoin’s fixed supply, Dogecoin’s inflationary nature means its supply constantly increases. This requires continuous demand growth to prevent price dilution. Lack of Unique Utility: While it serves as a payment method, Dogecoin often lacks the advanced smart contract capabilities or decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems that drive the value of other cryptocurrencies. High Volatility: Dogecoin’s price is notoriously volatile, often experiencing dramatic swings based on social media trends rather than fundamental developments. This makes it a high-risk investment. Competition: The crypto space is crowded with thousands of coins, many offering more advanced technology or specific use cases, posing significant competition to Dogecoin. Opportunities: Strong Community and Brand Recognition: Dogecoin boasts one of the most passionate and recognizable communities in crypto. Its brand is global, making it easily accessible and understandable. Potential for Real-World Adoption: Its low transaction fees and fast confirmation times make it suitable for micro-transactions and tipping, offering a clear path to practical utility. Elon Musk’s Influence: The Tesla CEO’s continued support and integration of DOGE into his ventures (like X payments) could provide powerful catalysts for adoption and price growth. Developer Support: Despite its meme status, there is an ongoing effort by developers to improve Dogecoin’s core infrastructure and integrate new features, which could enhance its long-term viability. Actionable Insights for Potential DOGE Investors For those considering an investment in Dogecoin, here are some actionable insights to guide your decisions: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on hype. Understand Dogecoin’s fundamentals, its history, and its potential future developments. Diversify Your Portfolio: Dogecoin is a high-risk asset. It’s prudent to allocate only a small portion of your investment portfolio to DOGE and balance it with less volatile assets. Understand the Volatility: Be prepared for significant price swings. Emotional decisions based on short-term gains or losses can be detrimental. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, community developments, and any announcements from key influencers or developers that could impact Dogecoin’s price. Consider Long-Term Potential: While short-term gains are possible, Dogecoin’s path to higher valuations, especially to the $1 mark, is likely a long-term play requiring patience. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear entry and exit strategies, and stick to them. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for the Original Meme Coin The journey of Dogecoin has been a fascinating one, evolving from a playful internet joke to a cryptocurrency with a substantial market presence. Our exploration of the Dogecoin Price Prediction for 2025, 2026, and up to 2030 reveals a path filled with both promise and uncertainty. While the dream of DOGE 2025 reaching significant highs and eventually hitting the coveted Dogecoin 1 Dollar mark is ambitious, it’s not entirely out of reach given its unique community power and potential for increased utility. The DOGE Price Target will be heavily influenced by its ability to secure more real-world use cases, maintain its strong community engagement, and navigate the broader crypto market’s evolution. Ultimately, Dogecoin’s future hinges on its capacity to transcend its meme origins and establish itself as a truly valuable and functional digital currency. Investors should approach DOGE with a clear understanding of its risks and rewards, keeping a long-term perspective in mind. The crypto world is dynamic, and Dogecoin continues to prove that in this space, anything is possible.

His remarks centered on the vast size of markets and settlement volumes, drawing a comparison between XRP’s circulating supply and the trillions processed in financial systems. The Crypto Philosopher supported his position, pointing out another patent that references XRP. The patent, issued by DTCC, identified XRP and XLM as networks compatible with its framework for liquidity tokenization. Within that filing, XRP was described as a fast, low-cost, and highly liquid operational infrastructure. The DTCC processes nearly $4 quadrillion in securities annually, making its choice of language significant. By naming XRP in its patent, DTCC effectively acknowledged the token’s capability to serve in high-volume financial environments. The Crypto Philosopher suggests that using XRP as a bridge in this massive market on the XRP Ledger could send the asset to thousands of dollars. 6T per $100 for Xrp DTCC is quadrillions which 1 is 1,000 trillion based on the available supply 45B Xrp is going to thousands Clear as day lol https://t.co/yhHhfNYAIC — The Crypto Philosopher (@TheCryptoP73649) September 15, 2025 How XRP and XLM Compare in Market Positioning The connection between XRP and DTCC highlights how the token is being positioned in conversations about institutional settlement. By appearing in a patent from such an influential organization, XRP gains recognition not just as a retail investment but as a potential tool within critical financial infrastructure. The acknowledgment of XRP and XLM helps distinguish them from other digital assets that lack clear pathways into established markets. Both assets have often been compared to each other and paired up in discussions of the future of global finance. However, XRP stands out because of its significant dominance in the tokenization market. Notably, the DTCC has previously announced plans to tokenize the stock market , giving XRP an even more prominent role in this system. For investors and supporters, the patent reference strengthens the narrative that XRP’s design aligns with the needs of high-volume systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Its limited supply, combined with the efficiency of its network, creates conditions where significant institutional usage could translate into rising demand . This perspective supports The Crypto Philosopher’s claim that XRP has the capacity to reach valuations far beyond its current levels. A Positive Outlook for Adoption The alignment of institutional infrastructure and XRP’s technical strengths paints a positive outlook. The patent reference demonstrates that XRP is being considered within frameworks that aim to modernize global settlement systems. This document validates years of advocacy that the token offers not only theoretical utility but also real-world applications suited to some of the largest transaction networks in existence.

Strive, a company launched following the merger of Asset Entity and Strive, has officially declared its intent to acquire the innovative Web3 media platform , MSTR True North. This move signals a significant step towards shaping the future of decentralized content and user engagement. Understanding the Power of a Web3 Media Platform For many, the concept of Web3 might still feel new. Essentially, Web3 represents the next generation of the internet, built on decentralized blockchain technology. A Web3 media platform , therefore, leverages these principles to offer a more transparent, user-centric, and creator-friendly environment for content creation and consumption. Decentralization: Unlike traditional platforms controlled by a single entity, Web3 media platforms distribute power among users and creators. Tokenization: Content, engagement, and even ownership can be tokenized, creating new economic models. User Ownership: Users often have greater control over their data and digital assets, moving away from centralized control. MSTR True North stands out in this emerging landscape, having built a reputation for its innovative approach to digital storytelling and community engagement within the decentralized web. Their focus on user-generated content and unique digital experiences positions them as a key player. Strive’s Strategic Vision: What Drives This Web3 Media Platform Acquisition? Strive, formed from the merger of Asset Entity and Strive, is clearly looking to make a bold statement in the digital realm. While the financial details of the acquisition remain undisclosed, the strategic intent is evident: to position itself at the forefront of the Web3 revolution and capitalize on the growing decentralized economy. This acquisition brings several potential benefits to Strive’s portfolio and future trajectory: Expanded Reach: Integrating MSTR True North’s established audience and content capabilities will significantly broaden Strive’s market presence in the Web3 sector. Technological Synergy: Strive can leverage MSTR True North’s existing Web3 infrastructure and specialized expertise to accelerate its own decentralized initiatives. Innovation Hub: The combined entity has the potential to become a powerhouse for developing new Web3 content formats, advanced monetization strategies, and unique community engagement models. The move suggests a strong belief in the long-term viability and growth potential of decentralized media, indicating Strive’s commitment to pioneering new digital frontiers. The Future of Content: How Will This Web3 Media Platform Impact You? For content creators, this acquisition could open new avenues for monetization, creative freedom, and direct audience interaction. Web3 promises more equitable revenue sharing models, often facilitated through smart contracts and token-based incentives, bypassing traditional intermediaries who take significant cuts. Imagine creators having true ownership of their work and direct channels to their communities, fostering greater loyalty and value.

Solana's sol (SOL) stood out with near-record open interest in the CME-listed futures. Privacy-focused monero (XMR) rose 6% over 24 hours, looking past the massive blockchain reorg that raised centralization concerns. Other gainers were IMX, up nearly 13%, AVAX, adding 6%, and HASH, which traded 4% higher. Key market signals painted a mixed picture, warning of an uptick in volatility after the Fed decision. ""On the surface, the ETF MVRV has climbed to 2.29, and liquidity prints show strong institutional bids,"" Timothy Misir, head of research, BRN , said in an email referring to the market value to realized value ratio. ""Below the surface, spot cumulative volume delta weakened even as momentum indicators turned overbought. That mismatch momentum without broad participation is the classic set-up for a headline-driven retracement or a sharp follow-through if the Fed meets market hopes."" Derivatives Positioning By Omkar Godbole Most major cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH, continued to experience capital outflows from futures, leading to a decline in open interest. AVAX stands out with OI rising over 14% as the token's market cap looks to climb above $13 billion for the first time since Feb. 2. Solana OI has reached a record high of over 70 million SOL, with positive funding rates pointing to bullish capital inflows. On the CME, OI in solana futures pulled back to 7.63 million SOL from the record 8.12 million SOL on Sept. 12. Still, the three-month annualized premium holds well above 15%, offering an attractive yield for carry traders. BTC CME OI continues to improve, but overall positioning remains light relative to ether and SOL futures. On Deribit, the bias for BTC and ETH put options continues to ease across all tenors as traders anticipate Fed rate cuts. SOL and XRP options remain biased bullish. On OTC network Paradigm, block flows featured BTC calendar spreads and shorting of call and put options. Token Talk By Oliver Knight As the crypto market stays within a tight range after a brief peak and trough on Monday, one token is running its own race: IMX is up 15% in the past 24 hours with daily trading volume doubling to $144 million. The rise lifted IMX, the native token of Web3 gaming platform Immutable, to a five-month high. Bullish sentiment around Immutable can be attributed to an SEC probe that was dropped earlier this year and general optimism around the gaming sector. Gaming is estimated to reach $200 billion in revenue this year with further growth forecast in 2026 alongside the release of Rockstar Gaming's Grand Theft Auto 6. Immutable is well positioned to capitalize on that growth after teaming up with gaming giant Ubisoft on the next iteration of Might and Magic Fates in April. Blockchain technology could have a key role to play in gaming if trends shift toward in-game ownership of items, which could see the implementation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within a game that could then be collected or sold on for crypto tokens. IMX is currently trading at $0.736 having broken out of a key level of resistance. It will likely come back to test $0.70 as support before potentially moving higher, provided trading volume can sustain at these levels.",Markets|Markets|Crypto Markets Today|market analysis|Derivatives|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|SOL|IMX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-16 12:00:00

By 2028, ADA/USD could reach $3.28. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $9.36 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.8728 Market Cap $32.23B Trading Volume (24-hour) $1.39M Circulating Supply 44.99B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.8727 24-hour Low $0.8548 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.73% 50-day SMA $ 0.830101 14-Day RSI 56.60 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 50%) 200-day SMA $ 0.737168 Cardano (ADA) price analysis ADA is consolidating on the daily chart near $0.85 support with resistance at $0.92 and RSI showing neutral momentum. On the 4-hour chart, ADA is stabilizing around $0.87 as bearish pressure weakens and short-term buyers emerge. A rebound toward $0.92 is possible if momentum builds, but failure could lead to another retest of $0.83 support. Cardano price analysis 1-day chart: Cardano (ADA) holds key support as bulls eye recovery toward $0.92 Cardano (ADA) on the 1-day chart shows signs of stabilizing after recent declines, currently trading around $0.86. The RSI at 53 indicates neutral momentum, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. ADAUSD 1-day price chart by TradingView The price is holding above the mid-Bollinger Band at $0.85, acting as short-term support. A sustained close above this level could trigger a move toward $0.92, the upper Bollinger Band, while a breakdown below $0.85 risks a decline toward $0.78 support. The MACD remains positive, hinting at potential continuation of bullish momentum if buyers step in. Overall, ADA faces a decisive phase, balancing between recovery and downside pressure. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: Cardano (ADA) eyes recovery amid stabilization on 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, Cardano (ADA) shows signs of stabilizing after a bearish stretch. The price is trading near $0.87, holding just above the lower Bollinger Band at $0.83, which acts as immediate support. ADAUSD 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative, though its histogram suggests bearish momentum is easing. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power (BoP) indicator points to strengthening buying pressure, hinting at potential recovery. If bulls maintain momentum, ADA could test the mid-band resistance at $0.89 and possibly aim for $0.95. Failure to sustain current levels, however, may invite renewed selling, pulling ADA back toward the $0.83 support zone.

Cardano (ADA) shows mixed momentum across the 1-day and 4-hour charts. On the daily timeframe, ADA has bounced near $0.85 support but faces resistance around $0.92, with RSI holding neutral at 51, suggesting a cautious recovery attempt. Bollinger Bands indicate consolidation with slight upward bias. On the 4-hour chart, ADA is stabilizing near $0.87 after a pullback, with MACD showing weakening bearish momentum and the Balance of Power turning slightly positive. This hints at short-term buyers regaining control. Overall, ADA may attempt a rebound toward $0.92 if momentum strengthens, but sustained weakness risks another retest of $0.83 support. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that’s over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely likely. With ADA’s current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto’s craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn’t happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano Cardano plans to issue both virtual and physical payment cards in Q4 2025, which will support Apple Pay/ Google Pay. This suggests partnerships with fintech firms to enable ADA (or related) usage in fiat/crypto bridging. Cardano Card is expected to launch in Q4 this year. 💳 Both virtual and physical cards should be available, compatible with Google and Apple pay. https://t.co/qX8LzRWPm8 — Cardanians (CRDN) (@Cardanians_io) September 9, 2025 Cardano price prediction September 2025 As for September 2025, Cardano could cost anywhere from $0.7097 to $0.7984.

By 2026, Cardano’s price could trade at a maximum of $2.45. Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history by Coingecko Cardano was founded in 2015 and went live in 2017. It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. Cardano (ADA) started 2025 trading between $1.02-$1.09 in January but declined to $0.9 by month-end, then continued falling through February and March, reaching lows around $0.60. In April, ADA dropped below $0.55 before surging back to $0.7030, then skyrocketed to $0.8 in early May before settling at $0.7599 by month-end. Throughout June 2025, ADA traded between $0.513-$0.705. In July, the coin is trading between $0.7777 and $0.8287. ADA fell from approximately $0.7392 on July 31, 2025 to about $0.7142 by August 1, a decline of roughly –3.2%. The token dipped further to around $0.6976 on August 2, slightly rebounded to $0.7270 on August 3, and closed near $0.7399 on August 4. Here’s the cleaned version without links: In early August Cardano traded near $0.74 and gradually climbed to a range between $0.92 and $0.96 by mid-month, showing strong upward momentum. During late August the price eased back to around $0.85 to $0.86, marking a pullback following the earlier rally. By September 5 the token had settled near $0.81, holding relatively steady after slight fluctuations in the preceding days.",Crypto Price Predictions|ADA,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-16 12:00:00

Lyno AI Boosts Tech Sentiment & SpacePay Simplifies Payments,https://timestabloid.com/blockdags-presale-surge-over-405m-draws-in-millions-lyno-ai/,"The race for top crypto presales in 2025 is heating up, with SpacePay, Lyno AI, and BlockDAG emerging as standout names. SpacePay is focused on practical utility, enabling crypto to be used with existing card payment systems. Lyno AI, on the other hand, is designing an arbitrage platform that employs artificial intelligence to scan across 15+ blockchains and execute rapid trades within milliseconds. While both present compelling features, BlockDAG (BDAG) is operating at a scale few can rival. With its current presale entry at $0.0013, over $405 million raised, and more than 26.2 billion coins sold, it has achieved levels of adoption others aspire to. Already, it supports 3 million mobile miners, has sold 19,800+ mining rigs, and boasts 312,000 global holders. Early Stage 1 buyers at $0.001 are already seeing returns, yet the wider focus lies on its ambitious climb toward $1, a journey that hints at gains surpassing 76,815%. Why SpacePay’s $SPY Presale Gains Attention SpacePay is making strides in bridging crypto with daily payments by letting merchants accept it directly through their card machines. Supporting over 325 wallets and ensuring quick conversion to cash at just 0.5% fees, it removes the complexity that hinders mass crypto usage. The presale has brought in more than $1.2 million so far, with $SPY priced at $0.003181. Holders gain not only governance rights but also revenue-sharing benefits and loyalty rewards such as early feature access and airdrops. What sets SpacePay apart is its focus on solving an actual payment barrier. By merging crypto with widely used infrastructure, it offers a simple entry to daily use. Should mainstream adoption expand, the current presale valuation may later appear like a milestone moment. Lyno AI at $0.05 Presale Fuels 1,200% Excitement Lyno AI is drawing eyes with its presale as it offers retail users access to institutional-level arbitrage tools. Through its AI-driven system, it monitors over 15 blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Chain, while executing near-instant trades previously reserved for hedge funds and major trading desks. Retail users can participate at $0.05 during the Early Bird phase, with more than 394,000 tokens already sold and nearly $20,000 collected. Additional presale incentives include a 100K-token giveaway for early entrants. Backed by a Cyberscope audit, Lyno AI strengthens trust around its vision. For those eyeing presale coins, Lyno AI provides a balance of technology, affordability, and cross-chain reach, all before mainstream recognition potentially multiplies its traction. BlockDAG Whales Target $1 Long-Term Vision Retail participants often concentrate on BlockDAG’s near-term jump. From the current presale entry at $0.0013, the path to its expected $0.05 listing already suggests 3,740% upside. While impressive on its own, whale buyers are signaling an even bolder strategy. Multi-million-dollar purchases, including single orders of $4 million and $3.6 million, reveal that these players are looking beyond short-term surges. They are aiming for BlockDAG’s eventual leap to $1, where the rewards stretch past 76,815% from Stage 1’s $0.001 starting point. This move reflects confidence in BlockDAG’s wider foundation. With 3 million app miners, 19,800+ rigs sold, and 312,000 active holders, it has already laid down global infrastructure. Raising over $405 million and selling more than 26.2 billion coins further positions it for large-scale activity far beyond niche speculation. The irony is that despite such massive scale, entry costs are still close to pennies, offering a ground-floor chance rarely witnessed in crypto history. While retail may chase small near-term gains, whales are setting their sights on larger outcomes. BlockDAG is already shaping up as not just the highlight of 2025 but a defining project for the decade ahead. To Sum Up! SpacePay’s model provides a merchant-friendly approach to crypto payments, while Lyno AI introduces advanced arbitrage tools to retail access. Each carries growth potential, yet both remain in early adoption stories. BlockDAG, in contrast, represents traction in action. Having raised more than $405 million, sold 26.2 billion coins, and secured a global user and mining base, BlockDAG has advanced beyond early-stage speculation. For retail participants, the focus may be on the move to $0.05 for a 3,740% climb, but whale buyers accumulate because they foresee the pathway to $1, where Stage 1’s $0.001 price transforms into 76,815% growth. Among the top crypto presales of 2025 , BlockDAG already stands as a cycle-defining project, setting the pace for long-term dominance.

Whale transactions suggest the token may face additional price pressure. Hyperliquid’s native token HYPE may face selling pressure as whales reverse their positions. HYPE traded off the week’s peak of $58.85, sliding to $53.22. Traders are becoming more cautious, as HYPE open interest inched down from over $2B to $1.9B. HYPE sank from its lows, leading to whales reconsidering their positions. | Source: Coingecko In the past day, the token saw $1.75M in long liquidations, as traders decided to sunset the latest rally to a new all-time peak. HYPE successfully broke the $55 barrier, but the token may face setbacks as the altcoin market consolidates. HYPE whale shifts to short positions A well-known high-profile whale with a bearish HYPE strategy is back in the game. The whale opened another $16M leveraged short position on Hype. Previously, the whale made up to $50M from shorting HYPE. This time, the position immediately shifted to an unrealized loss of above $348K. For HYPE, shorting is the unpopular position, with a 42% share of all trades. Despite being unpopular, HYPE long positions are also saddled with growing fees. One of the whales is facing over $309K in fees for extending the position. Additionally, one of the top leaderboard traders opened a smaller risky short position on HYPE, with a smaller risk of liquidation. Staking whale removes HYPE share The ongoing price climb of HYPE comes from its high percentage of staked tokens. Over 430M HYPE are staked based on airdrop incentives. On-chain data shows one whale held HYPE for nine months, unstaking 2M tokens in the past week. A whale who bought and staked 2M $HYPE (cost $17.4M, now worth $107.2M) 9 months ago at $8.68 avg has now unstaked it and is very likely to sell for profits! 9 months ago, this whale deposited 17.4M $USDC into #Hyperliquid through 3 wallets and bought 2M $HYPE at $8.68 avg, then… pic.twitter.com/1DTkfWSqrQ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 16, 2025 The tokens may be sold soon, extending the price pressure on HYPE. While the platform encourages long-term holding, and HYPE has seen predictions of triple-digit prices, whales still take profits on altcoins, as seasons and rallies are usually short-lived. This whale may make around $89.8M in net gains. Currently, HYPE is still being evaluated for the effect of Native Markets, the winner of the USDH ticker. Holding the token in staking may still be key to new incentives and airdrops for more ecosystem tokens. Predictions for HYPE range between bearish, seeing the token slide to under $50 in the short term, and as low as $18 in a deeper drawdown. Crypto trader @cobie predicts a hike to $150 or even $200, though with an unknown timeline. Based on the recent whale leveraged positions, short traders are betting on a big downward move.

51819620,582259,1758024038,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51819620.jpeg,China’s Biggest Bitcoin Treasury Firm Plans $500M Stock Sale To Buy More Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/chinas-biggest-bitcoin-treasury-firm-plans-500m-stock-sale-to-buy-more-crypto/,"Next Technology Holding (NASDAQ: NXTT) said it filed for a shelf registration that would let the company offer up to $500 million of common stock, and reports say some of the money could be used to buy more Bitcoin . According to the filing, the move gives the company flexibility to raise cash over time. Company Plans And Holdings Based on reports and regulatory filings , Next Technology records show it holds 5,833 BTC. The company’s March 2025 10-Q lists a book value for its Bitcoin holdings of roughly $480 million. The shelf registration itself does not force an immediate sale of shares, but it does allow NXTT to sell stock when management chooses and market conditions look right. Investors Reacted Quickly To Past Moves NXTT’s strategy of using corporate cash to build a Bitcoin treasury has moved its share price before. When the company disclosed large purchases earlier this year — including a buy of 5,000 BTC that was reported in filings — the stock experienced sharp swings. Some traders see new share sales tied to Bitcoin buys as a way to accelerate the company’s asset-growth plan, while other shareholders warn about dilution if a large offering is completed. Regulatory And Funding Details According to the documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the registration appears to be a standard S-3 shelf filing. A shelf lets a firm register securities in advance and then sell them in one or more offerings without repeating the full registration process each time. What It Could Mean For Bitcoin Prices If Next Technology were to sell shares and use the proceeds to buy more BTC, the company’s purchases could add to demand in the spot market. That said, the scale matters. At 5,833 BTC on the books now, a follow-on buy funded by equity could be meaningful but would still be a small fraction of daily global trading volumes. Analysts say market moves depend on timing, the size of any buy, and whether other large holders act at the same time. Based on the filing language, Next Technology can move slowly or act fast — it will be up to management. Risks include share dilution, price volatility for NXTT stock, and the mechanics of custody and accounting for additional Bitcoin. Any plan to spend capital on crypto will be judged by investors against those trade-offs.

In a post on X, Grok highlighted “top ETFs filed under the ’40 Act” and projected that a forthcoming XRP ETF could attract anywhere from $150 million to $20 billion in initial inflows. A Bold Projection Grok’s range is striking because it mirrors the explosive debuts of other landmark crypto products. Rector underscored that the estimate is not mere hype but grounded in precedent: Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), for example, drew billions soon after key structural changes opened the door to wider investment. If an XRP fund were to capture even the low end of Grok’s range, it would rank among the most successful crypto ETF launches to date. I asked Grok “What are the top ETFs filed under the 40 act?” It is already noting how big the XRP ETF could be… “$150 Million- $20 BILLION debut surge” inflow potential! pic.twitter.com/ZJS3VK9MXL — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) September 16, 2025 The Regulatory Pathway The potential XRP ETF —filed under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940—has already cleared a critical hurdle. According to recent reports, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s 75-day review window expired on September 10, 2025, without objection. Under the ’40 Act, that means the fund can proceed to market unless the SEC raises new concerns. This automatic “go-live” mechanism is a key reason analysts believe substantial early inflows are possible. Lessons from Earlier Crypto ETFs Historical context supports Grok’s projections. GBTC remains the largest crypto-linked ETF by assets under management, showing that billions can flow into a digital-asset fund once regulatory clarity is achieved. More recently, REX’s Solana-focused ETF (ticker SSK) demonstrated how quickly demand can build for an altcoin product, attracting significant capital soon after launch. Those precedents suggest investors are ready to back innovative crypto funds when they appear on mainstream brokerage platforms. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Factors That Could Shape Inflows Despite the optimism, several variables will determine whether an XRP ETF can truly match Grok’s upper forecast. Market sentiment, XRP’s price action, custodial arrangements, and the fund’s expense ratio will all influence uptake. Institutional adoption—particularly from asset managers and large trading firms—will also be critical. As with all ETFs, early trading volume, liquidity, and tight bid-ask spreads will provide the clearest signal of long-term viability. Bottom Line Grok’s insights, combined with Zach Rector’s reporting, create a compelling narrative around a potential milestone event in the history of crypto ETFs, suggesting this launch could be among the most impactful. With regulatory clearance effectively in place and investor appetite for digital-asset exposure still strong, the proposed XRP ETF now enters the final stretch toward market debut. Whether initial inflows land closer to $150 million or approach $20 billion, the coming weeks will reveal just how big this next chapter for XRP—and the broader crypto-ETF space—can be.

51819772,581936,1758024378,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51819772.jpeg,Ethereum News: ETH über 4.600 Dollar – was steckt hinter dem krassen Höhenflug?,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-staking-investitionen-kurs-allzeithoch/,"Ethereum hat die Marke von 4.600 US-Dollar überschritten und sorgt für Begeisterung. Institutionelle Investoren und das Staking treiben die Entwicklung. Doch Experten sehen auch Risiken, die den Kurs kurzfristig ausbremsen könnten. Ethereum sorgt derzeit für Schlagzeilen. Der Kurs kletterte über 4.600 Dollar und entfacht neue Hoffnungen auf einen Rekordlauf. Was macht die Kryptowährung so besonders, und warum sprechen Analysten von einem historischen Moment? Ein Blick auf die Hintergründe zeigt, dass Ethereum mehr ist als nur ein digitaler Coin – es ist ein Ökosystem mit enormem Potenzial. Ein Sprung über die 4.600-Dollar-Marke Ethereum hat Anfang September ein starkes Signal gesetzt: Der Kurs durchbrach die Schwelle von 4.600 US-Dollar. Dieser Sprung bedeutet nicht nur ein neues Hoch, sondern zeigt auch, wie groß das Interesse am zweitgrößten Krypto-Projekt nach Bitcoin wieder geworden ist. Viele Anleger hatten auf ein solches Signal gewartet. Nach einer längeren Phase von Schwankungen und Unsicherheit sehen viele Beobachter in dieser Bewegung den Startschuss für einen neuen Aufwärtstrend. Die Stimmung am Markt ist entsprechend optimistisch. Warum Ethereum so wichtig ist Während Bitcoin vor allem als digitales Gold gilt, geht Ethereum einen Schritt weiter. Es ist nicht nur ein Zahlungsmittel, sondern die Basis für sogenannte „Smart Contracts“. Das sind digitale Verträge, die automatisch ausgeführt werden, ohne dass eine Bank oder ein Notar nötig ist. ICYMI: $ETH just pulled back from $4,772 to $4,500 — but @BitgetGlobal 's chief analyst sees a run to $5,800–$8,000 this year ETF inflows, network expansion, the Fusaka upgrade and Fed rate cuts are fueling the bullish call pic.twitter.com/eZfEDJViZo — crypto.news (@cryptodotnews) September 15, 2025 Auf dieser Grundlage sind ganze Branchen entstanden, etwa im Bereich DeFi (dezentrale Finanzen), bei NFTs oder in neuen Apps, die direkt auf der Blockchain laufen. Ethereum ist damit mehr als eine Währung – es ist ein digitales Fundament, auf dem neue Geschäftsmodelle entstehen. Große Investoren entdecken Ethereum Ein Grund für den aktuellen Höhenflug ist das steigende Interesse von großen institutionellen Anlegern. Fonds und Unternehmen kaufen inzwischen massiv Ethereum, weil sie das Potenzial erkennen und ihr Portfolio breiter aufstellen wollen. Das bringt Stabilität in den Markt. Während private Trader oft kurzfristig handeln, setzen institutionelle Investoren meist auf langfristige Strategien. Dadurch wird Ethereum zunehmend als seriöse Anlage gesehen – ähnlich wie es Bitcoin bereits seit einigen Jahren ist. Staking verändert den Markt Ein weiterer Treiber ist das sogenannte „Staking“. Dabei legen Anleger ihre Ethereum-Coins im Netzwerk fest, um Transaktionen zu sichern und dafür Zinsen zu erhalten. Wer staked, nimmt seine Coins aus dem Umlauf – und genau das reduziert das Angebot an den Börsen. Wenn weniger Coins verfügbar sind, steigt die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass der Kurs stabil bleibt oder sogar weiter klettert. Gleichzeitig stärkt Staking das Vertrauen in das Ethereum-Netzwerk, das auf ein umweltfreundlicheres System als Bitcoin setzt. Trader erwarten bald 5.000 Dollar Die Stimmung unter Anlegern ist so optimistisch wie seit Langem nicht mehr. Viele glauben, dass Ethereum bald die Marke von 5.000 US-Dollar erreicht. Besonders auffällig: In Umfragen stieg die Zahl der Trader, die an einen weiteren Anstieg glauben, in wenigen Tagen deutlich an. Doch auch hier gilt Vorsicht. Kryptowährungen sind bekannt für schnelle Schwankungen, und nicht jeder Widerstand im Chart lässt sich sofort überwinden. Rücksetzer gehören zur Natur des Marktes. Hier gehts zu einer detaillierten und langfristigen Prognose für Ethereum (ETH) Langfristig mehr als nur Spekulation Ethereum unterscheidet sich von vielen anderen Kryptowährungen, weil es nicht nur gekauft und verkauft wird, sondern echten Nutzen im Alltag hat. Unternehmen, Entwickler und Künstler bauen Anwendungen auf der Plattform auf. Diese Verbindung von Technologie und Praxis macht Ethereum einzigartig. Genau deshalb sehen viele Experten Ethereum langfristig sogar stärker aufgestellt als Bitcoin. Während Bitcoin vor allem eine Wertaufbewahrung darstellt, ist Ethereum ein Werkzeugkasten, mit dem sich neue Ideen in die Realität umsetzen lassen. Risiken und Unsicherheiten bleiben Trotz aller Euphorie gibt es auch Risiken. Ein zu schneller Anstieg kann Korrekturen nach sich ziehen, die Anleger verschrecken. Zudem bleibt unklar, wie Regierungen weltweit Kryptowährungen in Zukunft regulieren werden. Sollten strengere Auflagen kommen, könnte das den Zufluss von neuem Kapital bremsen. Dennoch sehen viele Analysten Ethereum besser gewappnet als in früheren Zyklen. Die Kombination aus institutioneller Stärke und echtem Nutzen im Alltag verleiht der Kryptowährung eine solide Basis. Während also BTC und ETH als gewohnt starke und dominante Coins Investoren überzeugen und für Stabilität und Sicherheit stehen, sollte der Blick aber auch immer auf lohnenswerte Altcoins und neue Projekte im Krypto-Space wandern. Eins von den Projekten, die es sich auf jeden Fall lohnt näher zu betrachten, ist Bitocin Hyper. Bitcoin Hyper – Der Turbo für Bitcoin Bitcoin ist das Urgestein der Krypto-Welt: sicher, bekannt, wertvoll – aber eben auch so behäbig wie ein Oldtimer. Ethereum hat uns gezeigt, was mit Smart Contracts und einem bunten Ökosystem alles möglich ist, doch auch dort knirscht es längst im Getriebe. Jetzt kommt Bitcoin Hyper: der sportliche Neuwagen mit Bitcoin-Motor. Transaktionen? Blitzschnell. Gebühren? Kaum mehr als ein Trinkgeld. Anwendungen? Von DeFi bis Gaming – alles läuft direkt auf Bitcoin, ohne dabei die Sicherheit des Originals zu verlieren. Mit der cleveren Brücke zu BTC wird aus dem alten „digitalen Gold“ ein moderner Alltagsbegleiter – quasi der Sprung vom Taschenrechner zum Smartphone. Hier gehts zu einer ausführlichen Analyse von Bitcoin Hyper. Darin wagen wir auch einen Blick in die Zukunft! $HYPER – Deine Chance, früh einzusteigen Der $HYPER-Token ist das Benzin für dieses neue Ökosystem: Er bezahlt die Gebühren, bringt satte Staking-Rewards und gibt dir ein Mitspracherecht im Projekt.

Keine Insider-Deals, keine Hintertürchen – hier bekommt die Community den ersten Zugriff. Und mal ehrlich: Wer gesehen hat, wie Solana dank großer Partner durchgestartet ist, weiß, dass auch Bitcoin Hyper die Rakete schon gezündet hat.

KindlyMD (Nasdaq: NAKA) dropped 55.4% during Monday’s session, closing at $1.24. The downturn is the lowest trading level since February and extended the stock price slide, now 96% from its all-time high. Trading volume surged to more than 89 million shares, the largest since February 12 when 219 million shares were traded during a late-session rally, according to Yahoo Finance. In a shareholder letter shared on X late Monday, CEO David Bailey warned NAKA holders of a stock price plummet in the coming days, and encouraged them to “exit” if they couldn’t ride the storm. “For those shareholders who have come looking for a trade, I encourage you to exit,” Bailey wrote. He later doubled down on the same sentiment on social media, posting that “almost 80 million shares have traded today,” and deeming the selloff “a day of transition” toward long-term investors. Shares saw a slight 4.8% rebound in after-hours trading and were priced $1.29 at around 6:40 AM Eastern Time Tuesday, according to Google Finance data. PIPE deal rallies stock, plunge commences on funding day KindlyMD announced details of a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal last Friday, although it was signed much earlier in the week. Per the agreement, investors could now purchase shares at a discount and resell immediately beginning September 16, which piled downward pressure on the stock when trading reopened. The company’s subsidiary Nakamoto Holdings committed to invest up to $30 million in Metaplanet Inc., Japan’s first publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company. The PIPE may have raised cash for KindlyMD, but it also made shareholders jittery enough to let go of their holdings. NAKA saw a 77.2% uptick during the announcement, sending shares to $8.08. By Monday, that optimism had reversed, with shares tumbling to $1.24, 71% lower than its level five days ago, and 89% in the last month. Under Nasdaq rules, companies that close below $1 per share for 30 consecutive days receive a notice of non-compliance and are given 180 days to resolve the issue. KindlyMD traded below $1 frequently in November 2024, and even though this week’s slump has not reached those levels, it is the most sustained pressure since then. The firm is dangerously close to another warning if the share price does not stabilize. Market value falls below Bitcoin holdings KindlyMD’s plunge has dragged its multiple of net asset value (mNAV) down to 0.7, and the firm’s market capitalization now sits at $466 million, significantly below the value of its Bitcoin holdings. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, the company controls 5,765 BTC valued at more than $665 million. Bailey, however, reiterated that the company’s long-term plan is to continue adding more crypto reserves, admitting that it might come at the expense of negative stock price corrections. “After more than 13 years of building through Bitcoin’s cycles, including four bear markets with 70%+ drawdowns, we know resilience and discipline separate those who endure from those who fade,” he wrote. In his communications, Bailey listed KindlyMD’s progress since changing its medical business operations into a Bitcoin-focused firm. He said the company had raised $742 million, completed a corporate merger, and established a treasury of more than 5,700 BTC. The CEO also talked about a $5 billion at-the-market program launched with the help of eight financial institutions, including TD Securities. KindlyMD closed its first investment into Dutch Bitcoin treasury company Treasury alongside Winklevoss Capital .

This isn’t just a casual observation; it reflects a growing sentiment among influential figures about the evolving nature of value and currency in our digital age. For many, Bitcoin represents a significant shift, challenging traditional perceptions of wealth and investment. Why is Bitcoin Considered Modern-Day Gold? The comparison between Bitcoin and gold isn’t new, but Eric Trump’s endorsement brings it into mainstream focus. Historically, gold has been valued for its scarcity, durability, and role as a hedge against inflation. When we look at Bitcoin , we find striking parallels. Scarcity: Just like gold, Bitcoin has a finite supply, capped at 21 million coins. This inherent scarcity is a core part of its value proposition. Divisibility: Gold can be divided, but Bitcoin offers far greater granularity, allowing for tiny fractions to be transacted. Portability: While moving physical gold can be cumbersome and risky, Bitcoin can be transferred across the globe in minutes, securely and efficiently, using only a digital wallet. Decentralization: Gold’s value is not tied to any single government or institution, and neither is Bitcoin . Its decentralized nature makes it resistant to censorship and government control, a quality often sought in times of economic uncertainty. These characteristics position Bitcoin as a compelling alternative, or even a complement, to traditional safe-haven assets. The Future of Finance: Is Cryptocurrency the Key? Eric Trump’s vision extends beyond just Bitcoin , embracing cryptocurrency as the future of financial markets. This perspective highlights a broader trend: the digital transformation of finance. Cryptocurrencies offer innovative solutions to long-standing financial challenges. Consider the benefits: Efficiency: Transactions can be faster and cheaper, especially for international transfers, bypassing traditional banking intermediaries. Inclusivity: Cryptocurrencies can provide financial services to the unbanked and underbanked populations globally. Transparency: Blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin , offers a transparent and immutable ledger of all transactions. However, the journey isn’t without its hurdles. Volatility remains a concern, and the regulatory landscape is still evolving. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone exploring this new frontier. Navigating the World of Digital Gold: What You Need to Know About Bitcoin For individuals interested in this burgeoning asset class, Eric Trump’s comments serve as a prompt to learn more. Investing in Bitcoin , or any cryptocurrency, requires careful consideration and a clear understanding of the market. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research: Before investing, thoroughly understand how Bitcoin works, its underlying technology, and its market dynamics. Security First: Prioritize securing your digital assets. Use strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and consider hardware wallets for larger holdings. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin offers significant potential, it’s wise to diversify your investments and not put all your eggs in one basket. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Keep up-to-date with news, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Treating Bitcoin as ‘modern-day gold’ implies a long-term investment perspective, focusing on its store-of-value properties rather than short-term speculative gains. What Does Eric Trump’s Stance Mean for Bitcoin? When public figures like Eric Trump endorse Bitcoin , it lends credibility and increases public awareness. Such statements can influence market sentiment and potentially accelerate institutional and retail adoption. It underscores a growing recognition that digital assets are not a fleeting trend but a significant component of the financial future. His remarks contribute to a narrative that views Bitcoin as a legitimate and powerful asset, much like gold, capable of weathering economic shifts and maintaining value. In conclusion, Eric Trump’s assertion that Bitcoin is the modern-day gold resonates with a growing number of investors and enthusiasts who see its potential as a store of value and a cornerstone of future financial systems. While challenges exist, the fundamental characteristics of scarcity, portability, and decentralization make Bitcoin a compelling asset. As the financial landscape continues its digital evolution, understanding and engaging with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will become increasingly vital for anyone looking to navigate the future of wealth.

The fund is expected to launch in 2026, with participation from investors in the Middle East. Operating member Gautam Jain revealed the plans during the Money 20/20 fintech event in Riyadh on Monday, signaling the firm’s intention to expand its role in the growing global fintech and digital assets ecosystem. According to Jain, the capital will fund financial services, particularly in sectors like tokenization, blockchain technology, and other regulated digital asset plays. SC Ventures Eyes $100M Africa Fund, Expands Crypto Strategy Alongside the $250 million initiative, SC Ventures aims to create a $100 million fund for Africa. The unit is also considering its first venture debt fund as part of its wider strategy. Jain did not confirm whether the Africa or debt funds will specifically target digital assets or fintech startups. Founded in 2018, SC Ventures was established to back technology startups and develop innovative projects for Standard Chartered. The firm launched operations in Saudi Arabia in January 2025 and intends to create a dedicated team in the kingdom. By 2026, it plans to establish a domestic Saudi fund focusing on minority investments and new business launches. The development adds to Standard Chartered’s expanding digital asset strategy. Earlier this year, the bank became the first globally significant financial institution to offer spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum through its U.K. branch.

Similarly, Standard Chartered (Hong Kong) earlier partnered with Animoca Brands and HKT to launch an HKD-backed stablecoin under HKMA’s new regime, aiming to improve payment efficiency and drive wider adoption of digital assets in Hong Kong and beyond. @StanChart , @animocabrands , and HKT team up to launch a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin. #Stablecoin #HongKong https://t.co/6eWEGHcKCz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 17, 2025 In the early days of 2025, Standard Chartered secured a Luxembourg license t o provide crypto custody under the EU’s MiCA framework. The move leverages Luxembourg’s strong regulatory environment to meet rising client demand. This came after the bank launched crypto custody services in the UAE after obtaining a DFSA license in Dubai. MENA Fintech Surges as Standard Chartered Expands; Africa Heats Up Notably, the timing of this SC Ventures announcement coincides with rapid growth in the Middle East and North Africa fintech sector. While the investors were not mentioned in Standard Chartered, Binance received a record $2B stablecoin investment from Abu Dhabi’s MGX earlier this year, giving the firm a minority stake and advancing AI–blockchain integration. Weeks later, the Saudi Central Bank took its first indirect step into Bitcoin by buying 25,656 shares, $60 billion, of Strategy, suggesting continuous digital asset exposure in the region. A major oil economy quietly inches toward digital asset exposure, hinting at broader changes in how sovereign wealth might evolve in a tokenized future. #BTC #SaudiArabia https://t.co/gjWjmlzTNL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 16, 2025 According to data platform Magnitt , fintech startups in the region raised $274 million in the first half of 2025, with Saudi Arabia leading the way. Investment activity was concentrated in payment solutions, lending, and insurance. Similarly, Saudi Arabia aims to host 500 fintech companies by 2030, compared with fewer than 300 today. The Money 20/20 Riyadh event reflected this ambition, drawing more than 1,000 investors and 150 startups to the kingdom. Alongside SC Ventures’ plans, several significant deals were unveiled at the conference. Saudi payments provider Hala raised $157 million in one of the region’s largest early-stage funding rounds, led by TPG and Sanabil, a unit of the Public Investment Fund. Buy now, pay later firm Tamara secured an asset-backed facility of up to $2.4 billion from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. In another development, STV and Wamid, the technology arm of the Saudi Tadawul Group, agreed to launch the country’s first trading platform for private assets. Global technology players also made announcements. Google confirmed the rollout of Google Pay and Google Wallet in Saudi Arabia, with services available initially to Al Rajhi Bank and Riyad Bank customers. Meanwhile, ride-hailing firm inDrive said it will begin operations in the kingdom later this month. Notably, Blockchain.com announced the opening of Nigeria’s first major international crypto office while also targeting Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa in its African expansion. https://t.co/tS5rnGl2nq Launches African Push in Nigeria, Ghana, opening Nigeria’s first major international crypto office this quarter. #Crypto #Africa https://t.co/cevOmmBjcI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 27, 2025 Similarly, Ripple partnered with Chipper Cash to power low-cost, faster cross-border payments across nine countries, and Coinbase teamed up with stablecoin exchange Yellow Card to expand access in 20 nations.

This strategic move signals a new chapter for the popular DEX aggregator, promising evolution and new possibilities. If you’re involved in crypto, understanding this transition is key to navigating the future of decentralized exchanges. What Does the Velora VLR Token Migration Entail? Velora, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, is making a pivotal change by migrating its existing governance token, PSP, to a new token called VLR. This development, as reported by The Block, means that the PSP token will no longer serve its previous functions within the Velora ecosystem. This includes its utility for governance decisions, staking rewards, and other incentive programs. Essentially, the old token is stepping aside for a new one designed to power Velora’s updated vision and framework. This kind of migration is a common, yet crucial, event in the rapidly evolving blockchain space, often reflecting a project’s growth and strategic realignment. Why is Velora Undertaking This Crucial Token Migration? The decision to initiate the Velora VLR token migration stems from a broader rebranding effort and a desire to enhance the platform’s capabilities and governance model. While specific details about Velora’s long-term vision are still emerging, such migrations typically aim to: Improve Governance: Introduce a more robust and efficient governance framework for community participation. Enhance Utility: Potentially unlock new features or use cases for the token within the ecosystem. Reflect Rebranding: Align the token’s identity with the project’s new brand, Velora, fostering a fresh market perception. Optimize Technology: Implement technical upgrades that might not be feasible with the older token contract. This move is about setting a stronger foundation for Velora’s future growth and its role in the competitive DEX aggregation landscape. What Does the Velora VLR Token Migration Mean for PSP Holders? For individuals currently holding PSP tokens, the Velora VLR token migration is a critical event requiring attention. Since PSP will lose its utility, holders will need to migrate their tokens to VLR to maintain their participation in Velora’s governance and benefit from any future rewards or staking opportunities. Here are some key considerations: Action Required: PSP holders must actively participate in the migration process. Velora will provide clear instructions on how to swap PSP for VLR. Timelines: Pay close attention to official announcements regarding migration windows and deadlines. Missing these could result in loss of utility or access to the new token. Official Sources: Always rely on Velora’s official channels (website, social media, announcements) for migration details to avoid scams. Staying informed and acting promptly will ensure a smooth transition and continued engagement with the Velora ecosystem. Navigating the Future After the Velora VLR Token Migration The successful completion of the Velora VLR token migration marks a new era for the platform. It positions Velora to potentially offer enhanced services, attract new users, and solidify its standing as a leading DEX aggregator. This kind of strategic evolution is vital for projects in the fast-paced DeFi sector, allowing them to adapt to market demands and technological advancements. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, projects like Velora that demonstrate adaptability and a clear vision for improvement are often the ones that thrive. The VLR token will now be at the heart of Velora’s decentralized governance, enabling its community to shape its path forward. In conclusion, the Velora VLR token migration from PSP to VLR is more than just a name change; it’s a strategic evolution designed to propel Velora into a more robust and future-proof phase. For PSP holders, understanding and actively participating in this transition is essential. For the broader DeFi community, it represents Velora’s commitment to innovation and its ongoing efforts to provide an efficient and powerful DEX aggregation experience. This is a pivotal moment that underscores the dynamic nature of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Velora, and how is it related to ParaSwap? Velora is the new brand identity for ParaSwap, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator. It helps users find the best prices across various DEXs for their crypto trades. 2. Why is the PSP token being migrated to VLR? The migration is part of Velora’s strategic rebranding and aims to introduce an enhanced governance model, new functionalities, and better align the token with the project’s future vision and technological upgrades. 3. What actions do current PSP token holders need to take? PSP token holders will need to actively migrate their PSP tokens to the new VLR tokens. Velora will release official instructions and a dedicated platform for this swap. It’s crucial to follow only official announcements. 4. Will the VLR token offer new functionalities compared to PSP? While specific new functionalities are often detailed post-migration, token migrations typically aim to introduce improved governance mechanisms, expanded utility within the ecosystem, and potentially new staking or reward structures. 5.

LITS has so far bought around 929,548 Litecoin. It has become the first US exchange-listed company holding Litecoin as its primary reserve asset. Using LITS’s pre-PIPE cash plus updated Litecoin holdings, I estimate LITS currently trades at approximately 0.8x its total assets. Going forward, its cash burn will probably trend towards G&A expenses of $2.4 million per quarter. That gives LITS a comfortable runway to maneuver in the near term. In my view, LITS offers compelling value based on valuation numbers alone. But in the long run, investors are essentially betting on Litecoin’s price performance. Lite Strategy Inc. ( LITS ) was formerly known as MEI Pharma, Inc. and traded under the ticker “MEIP.” LITS was an oncology firm working on two drug candidates, vorucliclib and ME-144, which could have been helpful as oncology combo therapies. However, recently, LITS became the first US exchange-listed company to adopt a Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) treasury. This pivot was funded by a $100 million PIPE, which was used to buy around 929,548 Litecoin. Also, its BitGo Prime loan framework gives LITS “borrow not sale” liquidity if needed. Lastly, I think there’s enough value at these levels to justify a “Buy” rating, but in the long run, LITS investors are essentially betting on the price of Litecoin itself going forward. Pharma Turned Into Litecoin Treasury Lite Strategy Inc. was originally a clinical-stage oncology company that developed cancer therapies. But surprisingly, in 2025, they also adopted a Litecoin treasury strategy funded by a $100 million PIPE funding to purchase Litecoin as a reserve asset. In the process, they also rebranded from MEIP into LITS as the first US public company to hold Litecoin as a key reserve holding. This echoes a similar transition that MicroStrategy followed until it became Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ). MicroStrategy used to rely on its consulting business, but over time became increasingly focused on only accumulating Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as an investment vehicle for retail stock investors interested in the cryptocurrency. Source: Corporate Overview Presentation. May 2025. In that sense, you can think now of LITS as the MSTR of Litecoin, though time will tell if it works out as well as it did for MSTR. You see, unlike MSTR, LITS actually didn’t have any revenues at the time it decided to pursue its crypto-strategy pivot. Back then, its track included a pipeline with two drug candidates, vorucliclib and ME-144, that aimed to address resistance mechanisms to conventional cancer therapies. Voruciclib is an oral CDK9 inhibitor for relapsed/refractory (r/r) AML treated with two or more prior lines. LITS planned to start a Phase 2 trial in 2025 (subject to FDA advice), based on the results of their previous Phase 1 study that included 42 patients on the combo with venetoclax (Venclexta). Likewise, Vorucliclib was supposed to suppress MCL-1 and overcome venetoclax resistance. The company wanted to prove that voruciclib could be used across a wide range of AML, in a mutation-agnostic way, unlike menin, FLT3, or IDH inhibitors. Roughly 50% to 55% of AML patients lack actionable driver mutations, and they can’t receive FLT3/IDH/menin-directed drugs. About 30% carry NPM1, 30% FLT3, and 20% IDH1/2, with overlap among these groups. Therefore, a mutation-agnostic therapy, like CDK9 inhibition, could have helped around half of the population left without targeted options. On paper, this seemed compelling as the total US market size for r/r AML is forecasted to grow to $4.7 billion by 2030. Moreover, thousands of those patients are treatable, with about half lacking actionable mutations. Thus, these patients currently have poor outcomes, and vorucliclib can potentially fill this unmet medical need. Additionally, voruciclib completed a Phase 1/1b trial for solid tumors , especially KRAS-mutant cancers. For this purpose, voruciclib was tested on 77 patients (alone and in combination with vemurafenib). The data showed good tolerability and efficacy, and supported future combination trials rather than a single-agent solid tumor therapy. Source: Corporate Overview Presentation. May 2025. Lastly, LITS had ME-344 for HER2-negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer in combination with bevacizumab. ME-344 was a mitochondrial oxidative-phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibitor, which reduces tumor cells’ ATP generation and increases oxidative stress. This helped produce a tumor cellular energy crisis and death, especially in combination settings. Its Phase 1/1b trials were completed with encouraging activity and an acceptable safety profile. Another study for solid tumors with VEGF inhibitors, bevacizumab & tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, was in a pre-IND stage as well. First-Mover Litecoin Treasury Nevertheless, LITS suddenly pivoted towards becoming a Litecoin treasury company and raised $100 million via a private investment in public equity ( PIPE ) to fund this ambition. With this funding, MEIP bought approximately 929,548 Litecoin. In fact, Litecoin’s creator , Charlie Lee, joined LITS’s board to advise on digital-asset and treasury management. In practice, this effectively made LITS the first US exchange-listed company to formally hold Litecoin as a primary asset. It’s worth mentioning that Litecoin also has some improvements over Bitcoin, like lower fees and faster settlement, which suggests it could be better as a treasury and reserve asset. However, cryptocurrencies’ intrinsic value is complex , but seems largely tied to their network effects, rather than solely fundamental characteristics. So, it’s uncertain whether or not this Litecoin strategy will work as well as it did for MSTR with Bitcoin. Source: Litecoin dot com. In any event, by September 3, 2025, LITS entered a master loan agreement with BitGo Prime . This is an institutional prime-broker platform for trading, financing, and custody services for crypto. This new agreement created a framework to borrow cash or digital assets from time to time against Litecoin, which could give LITS flexibility without selling treasury holdings. Also, LITS’s treasury strategy now sits at the holding-company level with board-approved policies. Its corporate governance covers allowed counterparties (i.e., brokers, lenders, and market makers), custody, leverage (if LITS can borrow against Litecoin), and liquidity policies. Valuation And Risk Analysis Now, from a valuation perspective, LITS’s Q1 2025 report showed their balance sheet held $20.5 million in cash, no debt (only regular operating liabilities), and a book value of $19.5 million. At the time, there were roughly 6.7 million shares outstanding. By July 2025, they raised their $100 million PIPE to purchase Litecoin and issued 29.2 million new shares in the process. Thus, I estimate there are now around 35.9 million shares outstanding, which at the current $2.93 PPS implies a $105.2 million market cap for LITS. Source: LITE’s Q1 2025 10-Q report. Then, by August 2025, management disclosed they had purchased 929,548 Litecoin at an average price of $107.58 per token (approximately a $100 million purchase). And according to their Q1 10-Q, they’ve discontinued their biotech R&D, though it appears they’re willing to seek licensing deals or asset sales if possible. So, that means they probably still have their pre-PIPE cash of $20.5 million, plus 929,548 Litecoin valued at $105.5 million at the current price-per-token of $113.50 . Since cash and Litecoin (about $126.0 million) are the large majority of its assets today, I estimate LITS trades at approximately 0.8x its assets, while holding no debt . Lastly, their cash burn is probably going to be minimal going forward as well. Their OpEx has wound down significantly from $9.8 million in Q1 2024 to just $2.8 million in Q1 2025. Most of their current OpEx is G&A expenses, which I suspect will probably become the cash burn run rate for a Litecoin treasury company like LITS. Thus, if we assume their quarterly cash burn will trend towards its latest G&A of $2.4 million, it would imply a cash runway of around 8.5 quarters. In my view, this is more than enough time for them to find new revenue sources (or license their legacy biotech assets). This aligns with their new Litecoin-centric strategy, though it’s still definitely a risk worth considering. Source: LITE’s website. In short, LITS is no longer pure-play biotech. Instead, it’s more of a balance-sheet management tool that runs under updated board rules. Additionally, if LITS needs additional funding, they can potentially sell a portion of their Litecoin treasury (or borrow against it) with CFO approval. If the action fits within their policy, the CFO can execute. If not, board approval will be required. However, in practice, I get the impression LITS’s focus is no longer on R&D, but rather simply accumulating shareholder value through its Litecoin treasury and managing it. Conclusion: Compelling Value For Now Overall, the main risk with LITS now is essentially the price of Litecoin itself. Obviously, if the price of Litecoin plunges, then LITS will probably follow the same path. And remember, LITS’s main asset right now is Litecoin, so it should track the cryptocurrency’s price very closely going forward. But on the flip side, I think that at these levels, LITS is probably somewhat undervalued if we look at the cash it held before its pivot and the value of its Litecoin holdings today. In that sense, I have to lean bullish on the shares as I believe there’s a compelling entry price. But in the long term, the investment thesis is basically Litecoin, and that depends on each investor’s take on this particular cryptocurrency’s prospects.",LTC-USD|LITS,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|LTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-16 12:17:12

The UNDP said on Monday that it will work with the Exponential Science Foundation, a nonprofit that supports blockchain and AI, to create and launch the academy. UNDP launches blockchain academy to guide governments UNDP said many governments use blockchain and AI technologies on a small scale , but lack the skills, knowledge, and structure to implement them in real programs that improve services for citizens. The agency wants to help policymakers deal with gaps in digital infrastructure and prepare them for the rapid changes happening in the global economy. The academy will teach governments to build digital credentials for citizens to access healthcare, education, and welfare services, especially in areas with weak record systems. On matters of finances, the program will promote digital payments and financial services for communities where people still have no access to banks. Moreover, the academy will guide policymakers on how to use blockchain to reduce fraud, waste, and misuse of funds by making transactions easier to track and verify. When it comes to climate control, the program will explore ways in which governments can use tokens and smart contracts in climate finance, like monitoring carbon credits and supporting green environmental projects. Irena Cerovic, who leads the UNDP’s work for Europe and Central Asia, said the Government Blockchain Academy will help governments deal with the issues that traditional methods failed to solve effectively. Academy prepares for phased launch starting in 2026 The UNDP announced that the Government Blockchain Academy will roll out in stages, starting with selected countries in 2026. The agency said it will first design the curriculum and test pilot projects to help governments learn from practical examples before scaling up. The academy will use in-person workshops combined with online courses and regional forms to make sure government officials get steady support and guidance as they develop blockchain initiatives. The new academy is not the UNDP’s first attempt at using blockchain to support development, as it worked with the Algorand Foundation in 2023 to launch a staff-focused blockchain academy. This program claims to have trained approximately 22,000 UNDP employees across 170 countries to advise governments and communities. The new academy will directly train government officials, particularly policymakers, who are responsible for creating and implementing laws. The academy’s launch coincides with a time when many countries are rapidly embracing blockchain and crypto-related tools. A 2024 report by Chainalysis found that India, Pakistan, and Vietnam ranked among the top adopters of crypto technologies worldwide. This trend shows that most countries are eager to use new technologies to increase access to financial services. However, they still face risks such as weak oversight, unclear rules, and limited technical knowledge. The UNDP aims to ensure the adoption follows clear guidelines encouraging transparency, sustainability, and public trust. In related efforts, Bitget, the leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company, recently partnered with UNICEF out of Luxembourg to drive blockchain literacy and digital capacity among global youth. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, over the next three years, Bitget will become a member of UNICEF’s Office of Innovation Game Changers coalition. It will support 300,000 young people, including adolescent girls and their parents, mentors, and teachers, bringing blockchain knowledge to 8 countries: Armenia, Brazil, Cambodia, India, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Morocco, and South Africa.

Analyst Eyes Late-2025 Rally,https://cryptopotato.com/btc-calm-before-the-storm-analyst-eyes-late-2025-rally/,"TL;DR Bitcoin holds steady near $115,500, with analysts expecting sustainable growth before a 2025 overheated phase. Sell-Side Risk Ratio drops below 0.1%, showing low selling pressure and continued accumulation among holders. Analysts watch $117K closely as $3B in shorts could be liquidated, fueling a stronger rally. Market Sentiment and Long-Term Outlook Bitcoin traded at around $115,500 at press time, unchanged on the day, with a 3% gain over the week. Daily trading volume reached $44.3 billion. Analysts describe the market as steady, though momentum remains muted. Daan Crypto Trades observed , “The market has now been 10 months since the last period where it was truly overheated.” He noted the last overheated phase came after the election, when Bitcoin and altcoins surged immediately. He added that the current market is a “slow grind up” with neutral sentiment and little new retail activity. Looking ahead, he expects another overheated phase toward the end of 2025, but added, “If we end up taking a different route and extend the cycle into 2026, I’ll simply be patient for a little longer.” Funding rate data from Coinglass shows Bitcoin and major altcoins trading in a balanced state over the past year. Funding rates, which reflect the cost of holding long or short futures positions, often signal overheated or fearful trading when extreme. Source: Daan Crypto Trades/X For most of the year, funding has hovered around neutral or slightly positive levels, with only short bursts of high numbers. This suggests traders aren’t aggressively chasing rallies at the moment. With no prolonged extremes, neither Bitcoin nor altcoins are going through extensive highs or lows, supporting the notion that the market may be consolidating in a healthy manner. On-Chain Data Points to Accumulation Ali Martinez reported that Bitcoin’s Sell-Side Risk Ratio has dropped below 0.1%, saying this level “often signals local bottoms, accumulation phases, and low sell pressure.” The metric compares realized profits and losses, and a reading this low shows that few holders are securing gains. Bitcoin $BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio just dropped below 0.1%. This level often signals local bottoms, accumulation phases, and low sell pressure. pic.twitter.com/lbP8JOe8Of — Ali (@ali_charts) September 16, 2025 Past drops below the same threshold in 2023, 2024, and early 2025 matched phases where Bitcoin consolidated before recovering . This pattern suggests current market conditions favor accumulation as selling pressure remains low. Key Levels and Liquidation Risks CryptoWZRD described the latest daily close as indecisive but sees room for a bullish impulse toward $120,000 ahead of rate-cut sentiment from the Federal Reserve. They cautioned that “a move below $114,800 would keep Bitcoin weak.” On intraday charts, BTC pushed above $117,000, which could open another trade setup if sustained. At the same time, Kyle Chassé warned that “$3B in shorts will be liquidated when $BTC hits $117K.” Exchange liquidation data shows a large cluster of short positions just above the current price, suggesting that if Bitcoin moves higher, a wave of forced liquidations could add fuel to the rally.

At this point, Fidelity Digital Assets said in a new report that long-term Bitcoin holders and institutional companies will own 42 percent of the total circulating Bitcoin by 2032 and will take it out of circulation. Fidelity stated that approximately 28% of the total Bitcoin supply will effectively disappear from circulation by the end of 2025. The report stated that long-term holders refer to people who have not moved Bitcoin from their wallets for at least 7 years. Addresses that have been dormant for over seven years and institutional Bitcoin holding companies will hold over 6 million Bitcoins by the end of this year. This figure represents 28% of Bitcoin's total supply of 21 million. “Moreover, by 2032, their holdings will reach 8.3 million Bitcoins. This corresponds to 42% of the circulating supply.” Fidelity finally stated that this forecast does not include Bitcoin purchases by newly publicly traded companies, adding that the supply shortage could worsen if new companies also start stockpiling BTC. Analysts said, “The decrease in Bitcoin circulation will create a supply shock in the market. This will have a positive impact on the rise of BTC.” *This is not investment advice.

These moves signal a clear strategic direction for the company, blending traditional financial maneuvers with a bold stance in the digital asset space. What’s Behind SharpLink’s Strategic Share Buyback? SharpLink Gaming, a strategic investor in Ethereum, announced on X that it has repurchased one million of its own shares. This action is not a standalone event but part of a larger, ambitious $1.5 billion share buyback plan. To date, the company has already acquired a total of 1.94 million shares under this program. Boosting Shareholder Value: Share buybacks often aim to reduce the number of outstanding shares, which can increase earnings per share (EPS) and potentially drive up the stock price. Confidence in Future Growth: Such a significant buyback signals that the company’s management believes its shares are undervalued, reflecting strong confidence in its future prospects and financial health. Capital Allocation Strategy: It represents a strategic decision to return capital to shareholders while optimizing the company’s capital structure. This commitment to its own stock underscores a belief in SharpLink’s core business, even as it navigates the volatile world of cryptocurrency investments. Unpacking SharpLink’s Astounding ETH Holdings Beyond the share buyback, SharpLink’s other major announcement truly captured the market’s attention: its impressive SharpLink ETH holdings . The company holds a staggering 838,000 ETH, which was valued at approximately $3.86 billion as of September 14. This positions SharpLink as a significant player in the institutional adoption of Ethereum. Such a substantial investment in a single cryptocurrency highlights several key aspects of SharpLink’s forward-thinking strategy: Diversification into Digital Assets: While SharpLink is a gaming company, its significant ETH position shows a clear intent to diversify its asset base into high-growth, albeit high-risk, digital assets. Long-Term Bullish Stance: Holding such a large quantity of Ethereum suggests a long-term bullish outlook on the cryptocurrency’s potential, anticipating continued growth and utility. Strategic Investor Role: SharpLink isn’t just buying; it’s positioning itself as a strategic investor, potentially leveraging its holdings for future ventures or yield generation within the Ethereum ecosystem. The sheer scale of these SharpLink ETH holdings makes the company’s financial strategy particularly unique in the Nasdaq-listed space. Why SharpLink’s Dual Strategy Matters for Investors SharpLink’s simultaneous share buyback and substantial SharpLink ETH holdings present a fascinating case study for investors. It showcases a company balancing traditional financial stewardship with an aggressive foray into the future of finance. For investors, this dual approach means: Potential for Dual Growth Drivers: Shareholders could benefit from both the traditional uplift of a share buyback and the potential appreciation of a significant cryptocurrency portfolio. Increased Risk Exposure: While Ethereum offers immense potential, it also comes with significant volatility. This introduces a higher level of market risk to SharpLink’s overall financial profile. Transparency and Disclosure: SharpLink’s open announcement of its ETH holdings contributes to greater transparency, allowing investors to make more informed decisions about the company’s risk-reward profile. Understanding the implications of these moves is crucial for anyone considering an investment in SBET. The Future Outlook for SharpLink and Its ETH Holdings The path forward for SharpLink Gaming will undoubtedly be shaped by the performance of its core business and, significantly, by its massive SharpLink ETH holdings . As the cryptocurrency market evolves, so too will the value and strategic importance of these digital assets to the company. SharpLink’s decision to embrace Ethereum as a core asset could pave the way for other traditional companies to follow suit, especially as regulatory clarity and institutional infrastructure for digital assets continue to mature. This makes SharpLink a company to watch, not just in gaming, but in the broader intersection of traditional finance and the crypto world. In conclusion, SharpLink Gaming’s recent announcements paint a picture of a company with a bold and innovative financial strategy. By combining a substantial share buyback with massive SharpLink ETH holdings , the company is positioning itself for potential growth in both conventional and emerging markets. This dual approach offers intriguing possibilities for investors, while also highlighting the inherent risks of such a diversified and forward-looking portfolio.

51820611,https://cryptonews.com/?p=423831,1758025558,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51820611.jpeg,"Coinbase Defends Stablecoins Against Banking Threat Claims, Says ‘Math Doesn’t Add Up’",https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-defends-stablecoins-against-banking-threat-claims-says-math-doesnt-add-up/,"Coinbase published a comprehensive defense against banking industry claims that stablecoins threaten traditional financial stability, arguing the “deposit erosion” narrative is a “ myth ” designed to protect banks’ $187 billion annual payment processing monopoly. The exchange released research titled “ Beyond the Deposit Debate ,” challenging Treasury estimates of $6 trillion in potential deposit outflows from yield-bearing stablecoins. Research Challenges Banking Industry’s Deposit Flight Claims The defense comes as five major U.S. banking trade organizations lobby Congress to tighten GENIUS Act regulations, warning that stablecoin platforms offering competitive yields could trigger mass deposit flight similar to the 1980s money market fund crisis. Citigroup analysts particularly compared current dynamics to those of the 1980s , when money market funds expanded from $4 billion to $235 billion in seven years, draining traditional bank deposits. However, Coinbase argues that banks park $3.3 trillion in Federal Reserve reserves, earning $176 billion risk-free annually rather than extending additional loans, contradicting claims of deposit shortages. The company contends most stablecoin activity occurs internationally, strengthening the U.S. dollar’s global role without significantly affecting domestic deposits. The stablecoin market has grown from $4 billion in 2020 to over $285 billion today, with projections reaching $1 trillion in annual payment volume by 2030 and potentially comprising 10% of the U.S. money supply. Citi executive warns stablecoin interest payments could drain bank deposits like the 1980s crisis amid GENIUS Act loophole concerns. #Stablecoin #Banks https://t.co/aaHxz9bXHM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 25, 2025 Banks Fight Innovation While Exploring Stablecoin Opportunities Themselves Last month, major banking associations, including the American Bankers Association and Bank Policy Institute, urged Congress to close perceived GENIUS Act loopholes allowing crypto exchanges to offer stablecoin yields. The groups cite Treasury estimates that yield-bearing stablecoins could trigger $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows, fundamentally altering bank funding mechanisms. The banking lobby warns that joint marketing arrangements between issuers and exchanges could accelerate deposit flight during financial stress, reducing credit supply and raising borrowing costs. However, platforms like Coinbase and PayPal continue offering stablecoin yields , arguing that prohibitions apply only to issuers rather than intermediaries. Banking opposition faces contradictions as major institutions simultaneously explore stablecoin opportunities. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser confirmed the bank is “looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin” while developing tokenized deposit services for corporate clients seeking 24/7 settlement capabilities. Earlier in June, JPMorgan also launched JPMD deposit tokens for institutional blockchain payments while CEO Jamie Dimon was questioning its use case . The bank served as lead underwriter for Circle’s IPO, which has climbed over 500% since its $31 offering price. It also appears that some institutions are showing approval to control stablecoins, as seen in the recent Bank of England’s proposal for strict ownership . The bank caps between £10,000 and £20,000 for individuals and £10 million for businesses, which triggered widespread backlash. UK’s central bank wants to cap how much stablecoin people can hold, but crypto groups are fighting back, warning the move could choke innovation and leave Britain trailing rivals. #bankofengland #stablecoins https://t.co/lSNMQrEp7z — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 Critics argue that the approach puts Britain at a disadvantage compared to the U.S. and the European Union, which have embedded stablecoins into their financial systems without such restrictions. Institutional Adoption Accelerates Despite Regulatory Pressure Earlier this month, Fireblocks launched a stablecoin payment network with over 40 institutional participants, including Bridge, Circle, and Zerohash, processing $212 billion in monthly volume. The multi-stablecoin infrastructure supports seamless cross-border transfers and regulatory compliance across different token standards. Research reveals 90% of financial institutions actively use or explore stablecoin integration, with major corporations including Amazon and Walmart reportedly considering stablecoins to reduce transaction fees. Similar to Coinbase, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan criticized banking complaints about competition , arguing banks should offer better deposit rates instead of “ abusing depositors as a free source of capital for decades .” Average U.S. savings accounts yield 0.6% while stablecoin platforms offer up to 5% returns, creating competitive pressure. Coinbase’s research found no meaningful correlation between stablecoin adoption and deposit flight for community banks over the past five years. Stock price correlations between major banks and crypto firms like Coinbase and Circle remain positive at 14%, indicating investors view stablecoins as complementary rather than competitive. Source: Coinbase Report According to a recent Keyrock projection , stablecoins will capture $1 trillion in annual payment volume by 2030, facilitating 12% of global cross-border flows. Adoption is accelerating globally, with payment giants rushing to adopt crypto payments. Recently, Visa partnered with Yellow Card Financial for stablecoin payments across 20 African countries, while Mastercard enables 3 billion cardholders to purchase crypto through blockchain integration. While banks are standing against adoption, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent supports stablecoin adoption , arguing digital dollars will “expand dollar access globally and increase demand for U.S. Treasuries” as backing assets. The technology offers payments up to 13 times cheaper than traditional banks, with instant settlement, making it suitable for the next generation of financial services.

The current market reality has caused investors to scramble for the best cryptos to buy, especially as names like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) keep popping in the meme coin market. However, global analysts are tipping a new Ethereum-based meme coin called Layer Brett (LBRETT) as the next 100x crypto following its massive presale run. Despite being in its early days, the Layer Brett project has raised over $3.7 million, causing it to be dubbed as the next PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB in one. Let’s find out why. Layer Brett presale steals the bullish spotlight The crypto market is bullish again and Layer Brett is emerging as the next big meme coin in the market. For many, the attraction for Layer Brett is due to its meme coin structure that offers a promising potential compared to other established tokens like SHIB and DOGE. With meme tokens making crypto millionaires in the past, new investors are optimistic that Layer Brett can follow a similar trajectory, especially since strong momentum is building up around it before it fully launches. But that’s not all. Layer Brett is causing FOMO among traders and investors because of its extensive use cases. Built on Ethereum Layer 2 technology, the Layer Brett platform offers users access to fast transactions at low costs. Considering that blockchains like Ethereum are plagued with challenges like high gas fees and low throughput, Layer Brett is stepping up as a scalable solution. Additionally, Layer Brett is offering early investors the opportunity to make life-changing gains before its full launch. That’s because these investors can stake their LBRETT tokens for up to 712% staking rewards while waiting for the potential exchange launch and post-launch pump. The combination of meme hype and use cases is causing optimistic 100x projections among global analysts in the short term and up to 15,000x long-term gains. Dogecoin: The pioneer with limitations DOGE broke into the crypto market at a time when nobody took meme coins seriously. However, the joke coin rallied by multiple zeros and turned little investments into massive returns. Still, despite being a pioneer meme coin, DOGE’s growth has been limited by lack of utility. Being a meme token backed by only hype, the DOGE token has struggled to maintain value, especially in the face of strong competition from newer meme coins like SHIB and LBRETT. For context, since reaching an all-time high price of $0.7376 in 2021, the DOGE price has been on a decline. Its September price of $0.26 is over 660% down from its peak price. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s projections are a fraction compared to Layer Brett’s potential 100% upside this month. Shiba Inu’s ambitions have been stretched thin Like Dogecoin, SHIB has had great runs when it was the hottest token on the market. The SHIB price rallied in 2023, leading the market with its hype. However, the SHIB ecosystem has expanded with features like ShibaSwap (DEX), NFTs, and the Shibarium Layer-2 network. It has also fostered one of the largest online communities in crypto. Still, the current multibillion SHIB market cap doesn’t give room for exponential gains. That’s why SHIB investors are pitching their tents with Layer Brett for its better upside potential. Conclusion In the battle among meme coins, LBRETT offers what no other token does: up to 712% staking rewards and 100x potential in September. Join the Layer Brett presale to back the best crypto to buy now.

However, a new entrant, Layer Brett (LBRETT) , is starting to turn heads with its innovative offerings and substantial pre-sale success. The Rising Star: Layer Brett's Market Entry Among the fresh faces in the cryptocurrency market, Layer Brett has distinguished itself through a successful fundraising initiative, amassing over $3.7 million. This new meme coin, riding on the Ethereum network, promises a blend of popular elements from DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE, setting it apart as a potential major player in the meme coin arena. Layer Brett stands out not just for its meme appeal but also for its practical utility. The platform utilizes Ethereum Layer 2 technology to facilitate faster transactions at reduced costs—a significant advantage over the main Ethereum blockchain, which is often criticized for high gas fees and lower transaction throughput. Investors are particularly excited about the staking opportunities with LBRETT, offering up to 712% in staking rewards, which is an attractive proposition for those looking to earn while they hold. Traditional Favorites: Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin, a pioneer among meme coins, gained fame and value rapidly, albeit with limited utility beyond the hype. Although it demonstrated the potential of meme coins in achieving high returns, its value has seen significant fluctuations, with its current trading price showing a steep decline from its peak in 2021. Similarly, Shiba Inu made waves in the market with its sharp price increases and community-driven initiatives such as ShibaSwap and various NFT projects. Why Investors are Watching Layer Brett The crypto community is keenly watching Layer Brett as it brings together the virality of meme coins with real-world utility. The enthusiasm around its launch is palpable, with projections suggesting a potential 100x return in the short term. For those interested in participating in this burgeoning crypto, the Layer Brett presale is an opportunity not to be missed. It's not just about buying into a cryptocurrency; it's about supporting a platform with the potential to scale and provide real utility.

Roundtable Scheduled with Lawmakers The event, scheduled for Tuesday morning, will be hosted by Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Nick Begich, Republican cosponsors of the BITCOIN Act. More than a dozen industry executives are expected to attend, including Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor , Fundstrat CEO Tom Lee, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, Bitdeer Chief Strategy Officer Haris Basit, Riot’s Senior Vice President of Public Policy Brian Morgenstern, and Cleanspark CEO Matt Schultz. The roundtable is being organized by The Digital Chamber and its affiliate, the Digital Power Network (DPN). Hailey Miller, DPN’s director of government relations and public policy, underscored the central objective: “The focus will be on ensuring the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is advanced in a budget-neutral way and building the coalition needed to move the BITCOIN Act forward.” The Bill’s Foundation and Scope The BITCOIN Act, formally titled the ""Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide Act,"" was reintroduced by Sen. Lummis in March. The bill expands on an executive order signed earlier this year by President Donald Trump, which requires that bitcoin and other digital assets seized through criminal or civil proceedings be held in a permanent government fund. The proposed legislation goes a step further, directing the Federal Reserve and Treasury to purchase one million bitcoins using budget-neutral methods. Options floated include reassessing Treasury gold certificates and using tariff revenues, ensuring that the purchases do not burden taxpayers. Key Goals for Today’s Meeting Industry executives are expected to press lawmakers on what has hindered the bill’s progress over the past six months and to identify objections that have stalled momentum. Supporters will also pitch bitcoin as a bipartisan priority, framing it as critical for national security and U.S. economic competitiveness. Miller highlighted the urgency: “There is a lot that’s been done in the digital asset space these last couple of months, and there are a whole lot more items on the agenda. Our real push is to ensure that the BITCOIN Act and a strategic bitcoin reserve remain a priority.” Political Landscape and Next Steps Currently, the bill has backing only from Republican lawmakers, with no Democratic support. For the legislation to advance, hearings before the House Financial Services Committee and Senate Banking Committee will be required, though no dates have yet been scheduled. To reinforce the bipartisan case, DPN plans to circulate a briefing that presents the legislation as a “bipartisan opportunity.” Advocates hope today’s session will help build a broader coalition around the bill. The roundtable could mark a pivotal step in determining whether momentum for the BITCOIN Act can be revived. While challenges remain, industry leaders are expected to make their strongest case yet for establishing a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve.

Customers can now buy and sell Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Polygon, and Cardano directly through the bank’s investment platform, with plans to add more tokens over time. Spain is next. The bank confirmed that Spanish customers will get access to the same crypto features in the coming weeks. This rollout comes after the full implementation of the EU’s MiCA regulations, which now provide a legal framework for crypto services across the bloc. The move adds pressure on other European banks to keep up, especially as US institutions, now encouraged by President Donald Trump’s support and new stablecoin legislation , are taking similar steps. Openbank charges flat fee ahead of full rollout Coty de Monteverde, head of crypto at Grupo Santander, said in the statement, “By incorporating the main cryptocurrencies into our investment platform, we are responding to the demand of some of our customers.” Openbank has set a 1.49% trading fee, with a €1 minimum per transaction, and confirmed it will not charge any custody fees. Openbank currently operates in Spain, Germany, Portugal, and the Netherlands. The bank says it could extend crypto trading to all these countries within the year, pending regulatory approval. The announcement also revealed that Santander is looking into launching its own stablecoin, still in early planning. That project was first reported in May. These types of tokens are designed to maintain a fixed value, usually pegged to fiat currencies like the euro or dollar, and are being used more frequently by both consumers and businesses. Stablecoins, while originally used mainly by crypto traders, are now getting broader attention. Many firms have started using them for international money transfers and digital payments, and some investors are turning to them for blockchain-based settlements, including for bond trading. In the US, Trump’s return to the White House and his open endorsement of crypto have pushed American banks to explore their own stablecoin projects. Some are now discussing a possible joint token, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. Earlier this year, World Liberty Financial, owned by the Trump family, launched a new stablecoin called USD1 . Analysts at Standard Chartered recently said that if the stablecoin bill passes in the US, the value of dollar-backed stablecoins could hit $2 trillion by 2028, up from around $250 billion today. BBVA, SocGen and Deutsche Bank move in on euro-backed coins Across Europe, competition is rising. BBVA, one of Spain’s biggest banks and a direct rival to Santander, said in March that it will roll out retail crypto trading once it gets approval from the country’s market supervisor. BBVA already gives access to crypto for clients in Switzerland and Turkey, and is currently testing Visa’s new platform for creating and transferring digital bank tokens. In France, Societe Generale has already issued a euro-pegged stablecoin through its crypto division, joining a small but growing list of banks tokenizing fiat currencies for use on blockchain rails. Meanwhile, in Germany, Deutsche Bank’s DWS Group, together with Flow Traders and Galaxy Digital, is building another euro-backed stablecoin. These moves are part of a broader push by European banks to get ahead of what could become a massive change in how crypto assets are traded and settled. But Santander has been in the game far longer than most of its peers. The bank was one of the first traditional institutions to invest in blockchain startups, putting money into Ripple Labs through its venture arm years ago. It has also participated in cross-industry blockchain initiatives, like Fnality International, which aims to build out payment infrastructure using distributed ledgers. The bank even used blockchain in a payments app nearly ten years ago, long before most major players were talking about Web3. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

With a recent $1.5 million pre-seed funding round valuing it at an impressive $30 million, MicroFactory is not just building robots; it’s redefining the very concept of a robot factory . For those closely watching the intersection of tech, investment, and efficiency, this compact yet powerful manufacturing solution presents a compelling narrative of future possibilities, echoing the disruptive spirit often seen in the cryptocurrency space. The Rise of the Compact Robot Factory While many robotics firms pursue grand visions of human-sized automatons or fully automated industrial complexes, MicroFactory has taken a different, arguably more ingenious, path. Their core innovation is a general-purpose, tabletop manufacturing kit, remarkably sized to fit within a dog crate. This isn’t just a miniaturized factory; it’s a paradigm shift in how we approach production. According to Igor Kulakov, co-founder and CEO, the design prioritizes general-purpose functionality without the complexities of humanoid forms. This approach significantly simplifies both hardware and AI robotics development, making advanced manufacturing more accessible. MicroFactory’s system is an enclosed, transparent workstation featuring two robotic arms. This allows real-time observation of the manufacturing process, a stark contrast to hidden factory floors. It’s engineered for high-precision tasks, including: Circuit board assembly Component soldering Intricate cable routing This “factory-in-a-box” concept aims to democratize sophisticated manufacturing, bringing automation capabilities to a wider range of businesses and applications. AI Robotics That Learns from You One of MicroFactory’s most compelling features is its intuitive learning mechanism. Unlike traditional programming methods that can be time-consuming and complex, MicroFactory’s robots can be trained through human demonstration. Users can physically guide the robotic arms through specific motions, allowing the system to learn intricate manufacturing sequences rapidly. Kulakov emphasizes that this hands-on approach is not only faster but also leads to a better understanding by the robot of the required task. This method mirrors the human learning curve, where direct instruction often yields quicker results than abstract coding. The integration of advanced AI models further enhances this learning capability, allowing the robots to refine their movements and optimize processes autonomously. This blend of human-guided learning and artificial intelligence makes MicroFactory’s solution particularly agile and adaptable to diverse manufacturing needs, from electronics assembly to unexpected applications like processing snails for escargot. This human-in-the-loop training represents a significant leap forward in making automation technology user-friendly and efficient. Driving Manufacturing Innovation with MicroFactory Startup The genesis of MicroFactory stems from co-founder Igor Kulakov’s firsthand experience with the challenges of traditional manufacturing. Alongside Viktor Petrenko, he previously ran bitLighter, a company producing portable lighting equipment. Kulakov recounts the difficulties associated with consistently training new employees for precise manufacturing tasks. This bottleneck sparked the idea that advancements in AI could offer a viable solution to automate such intricate work, leading them to seize the opportunity and launch MicroFactory in 2024. Their journey began with a rapid five-month development of a prototype. The market response has been overwhelmingly positive, with hundreds of preorders already secured. These early adopters plan to utilize the machines for a wide array of applications, showcasing the versatility and broad appeal of MicroFactory’s approach to manufacturing innovation . This demonstrates a clear demand for solutions that simplify and accelerate complex production processes. Fueling Growth: MicroFactory’s Automation Technology and Funding MicroFactory’s ambitious vision has quickly attracted significant investment. The company recently closed a $1.5 million pre-seed funding round, which notably included participation from executives at the prominent AI company Hugging Face and renowned investor-entrepreneur Naval Ravikant. This investment round has propelled the young startup to an impressive $30 million post-money valuation, underscoring investor confidence in its disruptive potential. The secured funding will be strategically deployed to scale production, converting the existing prototype into a commercial product ready for shipment within approximately two months. Furthermore, MicroFactory plans to expand its team with key hires and continuously enhance its underlying automation technology and AI models. Kulakov outlines an aggressive growth trajectory, aiming to increase production tenfold each year, starting with 1,000 robots in the first year—a target of about three units per day—demonstrating a strong commitment to scaling their innovative solution. The Future of Manufacturing, One Compact Factory at a Time MicroFactory is not just another robotics company; it represents a bold step towards a future where advanced manufacturing is agile, accessible, and highly intelligent. By focusing on compact, general-purpose robots that learn intuitively from human input, they are addressing critical pain points in traditional production processes. The rapid development, strong market interest, and significant early funding highlight the immense potential of this San Francisco startup to revolutionize how goods are made, from intricate electronics to niche culinary ingredients. As MicroFactory gears up for commercial launch, its innovative approach promises to deliver unparalleled efficiency and adaptability, proving that sometimes, thinking small can lead to the biggest breakthroughs.

Solana on the Crypto Market's Agenda Ahead of the Fed's Decision Galaxy Investment CEO Michael Novogratz said Solana could become a settlement infrastructure for global finance. Novogratz emphasized that Solana's daily trading capacity of more than 6 billion transactions per day is comparable to the 400-700 million daily trading volume of global securities markets. At its BaseCamp 2025 event, Coinbase’s layer-2 network announced its plan to increase cross-chain interaction with the Solana bridge, while also hinting at a token launch. Pantera Capital founder Dan Morehead announced that Solana is the largest investment in his fund's portfolio, with a value of $1.1 billion. Morehead stated that Solana has outperformed even Bitcoin over the past four years. Additionally, Kyle Samani, Chairman of Nasdaq-listed Forward Industries, announced that the company plans to deploy new funds to support the Solana-based DeFi ecosystem. The general market expectation is that the Fed will cut the rate by 25 basis points. However, a surprise 50 basis point move could increase volatility. In this scenario, SOL/BTC and SOL/ETH pairs could gain traction. SOL, which approached $250 over the weekend, is currently trading around $235. While other major cryptocurrencies remain stable, stocks continue to test new highs.

The buzz around Solana price prediction is undeniable, with many investors and enthusiasts keenly watching its trajectory. As one of the fastest blockchains, Solana has captured significant attention, prompting questions about its long-term potential. Could SOL truly target $500 in the coming years? This comprehensive guide dives deep into the factors influencing Solana’s future, offering insights into its potential path from 2025 to 2030 and beyond. The Solana Phenomenon: What Makes It Stand Out? Solana emerged as a formidable contender in the blockchain space, often lauded for its high throughput and low transaction costs. Unlike many of its peers, Solana was designed from the ground up to handle a massive volume of transactions, making it a favorite for decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Its unique consensus mechanism, Proof of History (PoH) combined with Proof of Stake (PoS), allows for processing thousands of transactions per second, a crucial advantage in a rapidly expanding digital economy. The network’s ability to scale without sharding has been a significant draw for developers seeking efficient and cost-effective solutions. This technological edge is a primary driver behind optimistic Solana price prediction models, as increased utility and developer adoption naturally translate into demand for the native SOL token. Decoding the SOL Price Trajectory: Key Influencers Understanding the potential future of Solana requires analyzing a multitude of factors that influence its market value. The SOL price is not just a reflection of its technology but also a complex interplay of market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and ecosystem developments. Broader Crypto Market Trends: Solana, like most altcoins, is often influenced by the overall market sentiment, particularly Bitcoin’s performance. A bullish Bitcoin market tends to lift altcoins, while a downturn can exert downward pressure. Technological Advancements and Upgrades: Continuous innovation, such as the upcoming Firedancer upgrade designed to further enhance transaction processing capabilities, plays a crucial role. These improvements signal network health and future potential. Ecosystem Growth and Developer Activity: The number of active developers, new dApps launched, and the total value locked (TVL) within Solana’s DeFi ecosystem are vital indicators of adoption and utility. A thriving ecosystem boosts demand for SOL. Institutional Adoption: Increased interest from institutional investors, venture capitalists, and large financial firms can inject significant capital, driving up the SOL price . Partnerships with traditional financial entities also lend credibility. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving cryptocurrency regulations worldwide can impact market sentiment and investor confidence. Favorable regulations can provide clarity and encourage investment, while restrictive measures can cause uncertainty. Network Stability: Past network outages have raised concerns. Solana’s ability to maintain consistent uptime and improve network resilience is critical for sustained growth and investor trust. Solana 2025: Short-Term Outlook and Potential As we look towards Solana 2025 , the short-term outlook is shaped by several immediate catalysts and market dynamics. The cryptocurrency market is cyclical, and 2025 could potentially fall within a post-halving bull run, which historically benefits altcoins like Solana. Key drivers for this period include: Continued DeFi and NFT Expansion: Solana’s low fees and speed make it attractive for emerging DeFi protocols and NFT projects. Sustained growth in these sectors will drive utility. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with major brands or technology companies could significantly expand Solana’s reach and use cases. Technological Maturity: The full implementation and stabilization of major upgrades, such as Firedancer, could cement Solana’s position as a leading high-performance blockchain. Based on these factors, many analysts project a positive trajectory for Solana in the near term. While predicting exact figures is challenging, a range of $150 to $300 by the end of 2025 is often discussed, contingent on overall market conditions and Solana’s continued execution. The journey to $500 often begins with strong short-term performance. Year Potential Low Price Potential Average Price Potential High Price 2025 $120 $220 $300 Navigating the Mid-Term: Solana’s Journey to 2026 Extending our view to 2026, Solana’s trajectory will largely depend on its ability to maintain momentum and overcome potential hurdles. By this time, the network’s resilience and decentralization efforts will be under closer scrutiny. The competition among Layer 1 blockchains is intense, and Solana must continue to innovate to retain its market share. Key considerations for 2026 include: Decentralization Efforts: Enhancing the number and geographical distribution of validators to improve network robustness. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Developing stronger bridges and integrations with other major blockchains to facilitate seamless asset transfer and communication. Enterprise Solutions: Attracting more traditional businesses to build on Solana, leveraging its speed and low costs for various enterprise-grade applications. If Solana successfully addresses its scalability and decentralization challenges, and the broader crypto market continues its growth, the SOL price could see steady appreciation. A price range moving towards the $300-$400 mark by the end of 2026 is plausible, setting the stage for more ambitious long-term targets. Solana 2030: The Long-Term Vision and Aspirations The long-term outlook for Solana 2030 is where the conversation around the $500 target truly intensifies. Achieving such a milestone would require Solana to become a dominant force in the blockchain industry, akin to how major tech companies command their respective sectors. This vision hinges on several critical developments: Widespread Adoption: Solana needs to move beyond crypto-native users and see mass adoption across various industries, including gaming, social media, supply chain, and digital identity. Sustained Innovation: The core development team must continue to push boundaries, introducing new features and improvements that keep Solana at the forefront of blockchain technology. Robust Security and Stability: Proving its resilience against attacks and maintaining consistent uptime will be paramount to building long-term trust and attracting institutional capital. Regulatory Clarity: A clear and supportive global regulatory environment would significantly de-risk investments and encourage broader participation. If Solana can successfully navigate these complexities and establish itself as a foundational layer for the internet’s next generation, a SOL price of $500, or even higher, becomes a distinct possibility. This would represent a significant market capitalization, placing Solana among the top-tier global assets. Year Potential Low Price Potential Average Price Potential High Price 2030 $350 $550 $700+ Expert Crypto Forecasts: What Do Analysts Predict? When it comes to the Solana price prediction , various analysts and platforms offer diverse perspectives. These crypto forecast models often leverage technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and machine learning algorithms to project future prices. Here’s a summary of common sentiments: Bullish Outlook: Many analysts are optimistic, citing Solana’s technological advantages, growing ecosystem, and strong developer community. They believe that with continued innovation and market adoption, SOL has significant room for growth, potentially reaching and surpassing the $500 mark by 2030. Moderate Outlook: Some forecasts are more conservative, acknowledging Solana’s strengths but also highlighting potential challenges like network stability issues and intense competition. They project steady growth but perhaps at a slower pace, with targets ranging from $300-$450 by 2030. Bearish Outlook: A minority of analysts express caution, focusing on the risks associated with network centralization concerns, regulatory crackdowns, or a prolonged crypto bear market. These forecasts tend to predict slower growth or even potential declines if critical issues are not addressed. It is important to remember that these are predictions based on current information and assumptions, and the crypto market is known for its volatility. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider multiple sources. Navigating the Challenges and Risks for Solana While Solana’s potential is significant, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks that could impact its future growth and SOL price . No investment is without its downsides, and Solana is no exception. Network Stability and Outages: Historically, Solana has experienced several network outages, which can erode trust and deter developers and users. While improvements are being made, consistent uptime is paramount. Centralization Concerns: Critics sometimes point to Solana’s high hardware requirements for validators, which can lead to a more centralized network compared to some peers. Efforts to decentralize further are ongoing. Intense Competition: Solana operates in a highly competitive environment with other Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum (with its Layer 2 solutions), Avalanche, Polygon, and others, all vying for developer and user adoption. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Unfavorable regulations, particularly regarding staking or specific token classifications, could negatively impact Solana. Market Volatility: The entire cryptocurrency market is subject to extreme price swings. External macroeconomic factors, global events, and sudden shifts in investor sentiment can drastically affect the SOL price . Addressing these challenges effectively will be key to Solana realizing its ambitious long-term targets and strengthening its position in the blockchain ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Potential Investors For those considering an investment in Solana, or simply curious about its future, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on price predictions. Understand Solana’s technology, its use cases, the team behind it, and its competitive landscape. Understand Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a lump sum investment, consider investing a fixed amount regularly.

Technical indicators give bearish signals, whereby the price charts support the bulls. Is NEM Coin a good investment? Based on the current bearish trend, heightened volatility, and strong selling pressure indicated by technical indicators like the RSI and moving averages, XEM Coin (NEM) may not be considered a favorable investment. Investors should exercise caution due to the uncertain market direction and potential for further price declines in the near term. Why is NEM up? NEM is up after some correction amidst negative market sentiment, as despite negative signals by technical indicators, the market seems unwilling to accept a price below the current price level. Will NEM recover? The recovery of NEM depends on reversing the current NEM sentiment which is bearish and stabilizing market conditions. Watch for signs of decreased selling pressure, potential positive catalysts, and a shift in technical indicators indicating oversold conditions, which could signal a potential recovery in future price movements. Will NEM reach $0.00500? According to the 2026 NEM price predictions, NEM is expected to reach an average price of $0.005757, suggesting it may exceed the $0.005066 mark throughout the year. However, in the best-case scenario, NEM Coin might surpass the $0.006448 mark. Will NEM reach $0.01000? The forecast for 2028 anticipates a peak price of $0.011054, indicating that NEM could potentially surpass the $0.010363 mark during that year, assuming the bullish momentum and positive market conditions persist. Will NEM reach $1? No, market analysts doesn’t expect NEM tokens to reach $1 during the next five years. By 2031, the prediction suggests a maximum price of $0.017962 for NEM, indicating less than one-fourth of the said $1 price. However, this would also depend on sustained growth, market dynamics, and broader adoption factors for market capitalization to increase. Does NEM have a good long-term future? The long term forecast from 2025 to 2031 indicate a generally positive outlook for XEM Coin, with projected growth of double and triple surges in average and maximum prices over the years. This suggests potential for NEM to establish itself as a valuable asset in the crypto market, subject to market developments and adoption trends. The highest NEM could potentially reach is $0.017962 by 2031 which is significantly higher than the current NEM price. Recent news/opinions on NEM Ecosystem Developments or Pump or Dump Scheme? NEM’s recent Twitter and Reddit activity has been notably quiet, marked by discussions surrounding technical glitches that have afflicted the network.

NEM initially had a quiet start, with very low trading volumes and minimal price movement. During its early months and all through 2016, NEM’s price remained under $0.01, often fluctuating within a narrow range. In early 2017, the cryptocurrency market experienced a significant bull run, and NEM’s price began to gain traction. NEM’s price rapidly increased, breaking through the $0.1 mark and reaching new highs. By May 2017, NEM’s price reached around $0.25, showcasing substantial growth over a short period. NEM reached its all-time high of $2.09 on January 4. The cryptocurrency market soon experienced a major correction throughout the remainder of 2018. By the end of 2018, NEM’s price had dropped closer to $0.07, reflecting the broader market downturn. 2019 was a year of relative stability and consolidation for NEM’s price. For most of the year, it hovered around the $0.03 to $0.10 range, with periodic fluctuations in response to market sentiment. In 2020, a mix of positive and negative factors affected NEM’s price. The price fluctuated within the $0.05 to $0.30 range, with occasional spikes due to market news and developments. In early 2021, as the overall cryptocurrency market gained renewed attention, NEM’s price began showing upward movement, reaching about $0.8 in March. However, like many cryptocurrencies, NEM experienced increased volatility during this period, leading to a market price of $0.1261 by December 2021. In 2022 NEM’s price faced consistent downward pressure, as selling pressure outweighed buying interest throughout the year. By mid-2022, NEM’s price had retraced significantly from its previous highs, moving below key support levels to reach $0.039. NEM dipped further to $0.0282 by the end of the year. The bearish sentiment spilled into 2023. For the entire 2023, NEM remained range-bound, trading in a narrow range of $0.0263 and $0.0486. In January 2024, NEM started gaining some traction and reached $0.0500 by the end of the month. Finally, it peaked at $0.0605 in March, which was its highest price since April 2022. In mid-March 2024, NEM started its descent and fell below its support zone at the start of June, dipping to $0.0248. NEM observed further lows in July, with the lowest dip of $0.0122. NEM traded in a range of $0.0140 to $0.0240 from August to October, but it recovered in November with a peak price of $0.0424 at the start of December 2024. In January 2025, NEM was trading near the $0.0275 range and gradually came down to $0.169 by May. NEM went into a free fall by the middle of May and sank to $0.00185 by the middle of June, losing significant value. In late July 2025, NEM volatility decreased significantly, and the token traded in a very narrow range throughout August and September. At the time of writing, NEM is trading at $0.00230, as current sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-16 13:50:00

Alchemy Pay, a pioneer in crypto payment solutions, has launched its groundbreaking Alchemy Pay RWA platform . This innovative platform is set to transform how everyday investors access real-world assets by bridging the gap between traditional fiat currencies and tokenized investments. Imagine investing in properties, art, or commodities directly from your bank account – this is the future Alchemy Pay is making a reality, notably through its integration with xStocks, Kraken’s tokenized stock platform. What Exactly is the Alchemy Pay RWA Platform? At its core, the Alchemy Pay RWA platform is designed to simplify investing in Real World Assets (RWAs). But what exactly are RWAs? Simply put, they are tangible assets like real estate, fine art, commodities, or even intellectual property that are tokenized, meaning their ownership is represented on a blockchain. This process transforms illiquid assets into digital tokens, making them more accessible and divisible. Alchemy Pay’s new platform acts as a crucial gateway. It allows users to convert their fiat money (like USD, EUR, or GBP) directly into these tokenized RWAs. This removes the complexities often associated with traditional crypto exchanges, offering a streamlined investment experience for a broader audience. The integration with xStocks, a platform powered by Kraken, further enhances its appeal by offering a range of tokenized stocks. Why is the Alchemy Pay RWA Platform a Game-Changer for Investors? This new development by Alchemy Pay brings several compelling benefits to the investment landscape, truly making it a game-changer: Unprecedented Accessibility: Previously, investing in high-value assets like commercial real estate or exclusive art was reserved for institutions or the ultra-wealthy. The Alchemy Pay RWA platform democratizes access, allowing anyone to participate. Fractional Ownership: Tokenization enables fractional ownership. Instead of buying an entire property, you can own a small, affordable portion of it. This significantly lowers the entry barrier for many aspiring investors. Enhanced Liquidity: Traditional real-world assets can be illiquid, meaning they are hard to sell quickly. Tokenization on a blockchain can improve liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell their fractional holdings. Transparency and Security: Blockchain technology provides an immutable record of ownership, enhancing transparency and reducing the risk of fraud compared to traditional asset management. Moreover, the ability to use fiat directly eliminates the need for users to first acquire cryptocurrency, simplifying the entire investment journey and attracting a wider demographic. Navigating the New Frontier: Opportunities and Considerations for the Alchemy Pay RWA Platform While the opportunities presented by the Alchemy Pay RWA platform are vast, it is also important for investors to consider the evolving nature of this new frontier. The platform opens doors to a diverse range of assets, potentially offering new avenues for portfolio diversification beyond traditional stocks and bonds. However, as with any emerging technology, understanding the underlying risks is crucial. These may include: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for tokenized assets is still developing globally. Changes could impact the platform’s operations or the value of the assets. Market Volatility: While RWAs are tied to tangible assets, their tokenized forms can still be influenced by cryptocurrency market sentiment and overall economic conditions. Platform Security: Users should always exercise due diligence regarding the security measures of any investment platform. Alchemy Pay’s established reputation in the crypto payment space provides a degree of assurance, but vigilance is always recommended. Engaging with the Alchemy Pay RWA platform requires a balanced perspective, acknowledging both its innovative potential and the inherent considerations of a nascent market. The launch of the Alchemy Pay RWA platform marks a significant milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. By simplifying the process of investing in real-world assets using fiat currency, Alchemy Pay is not just offering a new product; it is helping to redefine investment accessibility for a global audience. This initiative, bolstered by its link to Kraken’s xStocks, positions Alchemy Pay at the forefront of a financial revolution, promising a more inclusive and efficient future for asset ownership. It’s an exciting time to watch how this platform will empower investors worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions about Alchemy Pay’s new RWA investment platform: Q1: What does RWA stand for? A1: RWA stands for Real World Asset. These are tangible assets like real estate, art, or commodities that are tokenized and represented on a blockchain. Q2: How does Alchemy Pay make RWA investing easier? A2: The Alchemy Pay RWA platform allows users to directly invest in tokenized real-world assets using fiat currencies (like USD or EUR), eliminating the need to first acquire cryptocurrency. Q3: Is the Alchemy Pay RWA platform linked to any major exchanges? A3: Yes, the platform is linked with xStocks, which is Kraken’s tokenized stock platform, providing access to a range of tokenized stock offerings. Q4: What are the main benefits of investing in tokenized RWAs? A4: Key benefits include increased accessibility, fractional ownership (allowing smaller investments), enhanced liquidity compared to traditional assets, and the transparency and security offered by blockchain technology. Q5: Are there any risks associated with RWA investments? A5: Yes, like any investment, risks exist. These can include evolving regulatory landscapes, potential market volatility for tokenized assets, and general platform security considerations. It’s important to conduct your own research.

On Tuesday, September 16, 2025, the company purchased more than $620 million worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum (ETH) in a single day. Data shows that BlackRock added 2,270 BTC, worth about $262.7 million, and 78,922 ETH, worth $357.4 million. This brings its total Bitcoin stash to more than 757,000 BTC, valued at $87.23 billion, and Ethereum holdings to 3.68 million ETH, valued at $16.95 billion. According to analyst Thomas Fahrer, BlackRock now controls 762,000 BTC through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). A chart of IBIT flows shows how quickly BlackRock has been stacking Bitcoin since the fund launched.

Total BlackRock crypto portfolio According to Arkham data, the company’s total crypto portfolio jumped from $99.88 billion on September 9 to $104.18 billion on September 16, a one-week increase of $4.31 billion. Most of that came from gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum. BTC rose by nearly $4,000 (+3.59%) in the week, adding $3.66 billion in value to BlackRock’s position, while ETH climbed about $292 (+6.78%), adding $645 million. BlackRock crypto portfolio. Source: Arkham One surprising detail is that while Ethereum’s dollar value grew, the number of ETH in BlackRock’s wallets actually fell by nearly 100,000 tokens during the same period. This drop in token count, combined with the higher price, highlights how volatile institutional trading activity can appear on-chain. Overall, BlackRock’s move adds to the growing narrative of Wall Street giants cementing their dominance in digital assets. With Bitcoin and Ethereum still the top two cryptocurrencies by market value, the company’s aggressive buying shows that large financial players continue to see long-term potential.

BNB’s recent spike to $884 before getting dumped shows us the ceiling game, but check this – Layer Brett just smashed past $3.7 million raised and is sitting pretty at $0.0058, primed for a potential 155x moonshot to $0.90 that’ll make BNB’s gains look like pocket change. Corporate backing drives BNB toward $1,000 target while revealing asset constraints BNB’s fundamentals are absolutely crushing it right now. CEA Industries just expanded their bag to 388,888 BNB tokens worth $330 million, and Binance futures hit $2.63 trillion trading volume in August. That’s serious institutional backing for this Binance coin price prediction run to $1,000. But here’s where it gets spicy – BNB spiked to $884 then immediately got slapped down to the $850-$855 range. Classic resistance behavior for a token already sitting at massive market cap levels. Even with ADA’s 19% pump temporarily knocking BNB out of third place, we’re still looking at incremental gains on an already pumped asset. The math is brutal but honest: BNB needs to climb roughly 17% to hit that $1,000 target. Solid gains for the suits, but for degens hunting life-changing plays? That’s not gonna cut it when Layer 2 opportunities are serving up potential 100x plates. 155x potential emerges through $0.0058 entry as Layer 2 technology meets viral adoption While BNB holders are celebrating 17% potential upside, Layer Brett holders are staring down a potential 155x explosion from $0.0058 to $0.90. We’re talking about turning $1,000 into $155,000 instead of the measly $1,170 BNB might deliver. Layer Brett isn’t just another memecoin gambling play – this beast is built on Ethereum Layer 2 architecture delivering lightning-fast transactions and microscopic gas fees. While BNB relies on exchange utility and trading fee discounts, $LBRETT combines viral meme energy with actual Layer 2 blockchain infrastructure that solves real problems. The staking game alone is absolutely bonkers – over 700% APY for early stackers. That means your bag is literally multiplying while you sleep, creating compound gains that make traditional exchange tokens look prehistoric. Plus, they’re running a $1 million giveaway that’s got crypto Twitter buzzing harder than a Shiba pump. Early-stage presale mathematics demolish mature token dynamics for maximum gains Here’s the alpha that separates paper hands from diamond degens: presale mathematics absolutely demolishes mature token dynamics every single time. BNB already captured most of its exponential growth during the 2021 bull run – now we’re fighting for scraps on an asset trading near all-time highs. Layer Brett’s presale structure creates that perfect storm of early entry pricing, limited supply pressure, and massive FOMO building as each phase sells out. We’ve already seen millions flow in faster than expected, proving smart money recognizes the opportunity before mainstream adoption kicks in. The convergence is perfect – institutional money validates Layer 2 infrastructure while retail rotation seeks the next 100x plays outside oversaturated exchange tokens. Layer Brett captures both trends with institutional-grade technology wrapped in a community-first meme package that drives viral adoption. Conclusion: $0.0058 positioning captures 155x potential beyond traditional exchange tokens Bottom line – BNB’s $1,000 target represents solid but predictable gains for traditional investors, while Layer Brett’s presale positioning offers genuine wealth-creation potential through Layer 2 efficiency and community-driven growth dynamics. The choice is crystal clear: settle for 17% gains on a mature asset, or position for potential 155x returns on the next-generation memecoin built for speed, staking, and serious profits.

While signs of bullish momentum are emerging, the next move will largely depend on whether the price can break through nearby liquidity levels or face rejection and pull back for renewed accumulation. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC is trading inside a well-defined range between $107K support and $123K resistance. The recent influx of buyers at the lower boundary fueled a sharp rebound, allowing the asset to reclaim the 100-day moving average and advance toward the range high. This structure reflects renewed demand, as participants defend key supports. The decisive trigger now lies at the $123K upper boundary. A breakout above this level would not only mark a new all-time high but also confirm bullish continuation for the broader trend. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin has rallied close to the $117K swing high, where notable buy-side liquidity is positioned just above. While the bullish structure remains intact, a short pullback into the decision-point demand zone at $110.7K–$113.1K cannot be ruled out. This area has previously attracted strong buying interest, and a successful retest would reinforce the bullish case. If buyers defend this zone and reclaim momentum, the liquidity above the swing high could act as a magnet, potentially fueling a continuation move toward higher levels. On-chain Analysis By Shayan The 1-week Bitcoin liquidation heatmap highlights a dense cluster of liquidations sitting just above the recent swing high, aligning with the liquidity discussed in the 4-hour chart. Markets often accelerate into such zones, as stop orders and forced liquidations amplify momentum. A clean push through the swing high would likely trigger this cascade, forcing shorts to cover and driving price higher. This reinforces the outlined scenario: while a brief pullback into demand remains possible, the path of least resistance increasingly points toward liquidity absorption above the swing high, a setup that could serve as a catalyst for continuation toward new highs.

These are the main topics we will touch upon in the following lines. Spot XRP ETF Coming This Week Perhaps the most important news surrounding Ripple and its native token is the upcoming launch of an exchange-traded fund with XRP as the underlying token. The issuer of the product, REX-Osprey, described the investment vehicle as the first spot XRP ETF in the US, but the popular journalist Eleanor Terrett provided more details about it. She claimed the product will operate as a “spot ETF with extras” and will hold XRP tokens, cash, Treasuries, and some derivatives. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas recently said the ETF (with the ticker XRPR) is scheduled to go live on September 18 . Other spot XRP ETFs, though, continue to face setbacks. Earlier this month, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) extended the review period for the product filed by Franklin Templeton for another 60 days, which means that the new decision deadline is November 14, 2025. Ripple’s Multi-Million Donation On September 15, the company disclosed a $25 million investment in Accion Opportunity Fund and Hire Heroes USA. The funding, delivered in RLUSD, aims to expand access to capital for small business owners and create more career opportunities for veterans and military spouses. “It will also equip entrepreneurs with digital payment tools so communities across the US can thrive in today’s rapidly evolving economy. This marks Ripple’s second $25 million donation this year, underscoring the company’s ongoing commitment to giving back and expanding economic opportunity,” the announcement reads. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, said small businesses and veterans are two of “the most powerful engines of American progress, yet both face barriers that limit their full economic impact.” The crypto firm announced the news on its X account, claiming that this funding highlights how stablecoins can drive real-world impact. RLUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin launched by Ripple towards the end of 2024. Over the past several months, it has undergone some serious progress, and currently, its market capitalization is approximately $730 million. XRP Returns to Green Territory Probably driven by the hype surrounding the launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF, the price of Ripple’s native cryptocurrency has reclaimed the $3 mark and currently trades at $3.04 (per CoinGecko’s data). X user CRYPTOWZRD recently suggested that the asset may experience an “impulsive bullish move” should it clear the $3.1320 resistance target. At the same time, Ali Martinez warned that $2.80 is the most important support level. Meanwhile, the amount of XRP coins stored on leading crypto exchanges continues to rise, signaling an increased selling pressure. Currently, over 3.6 billion tokens are held on Binance alone, representing the highest level ever.

After weeks of compression, ADA has finally broken out of its triangular squeeze, climbing close to $0.90. Traders are asking one simple question: will Cardano hit $1 before the quarter ends? But while ADA bulls are setting their sights on the $1 milestone, another storyline is quietly unfolding in presale markets. BlockchainFX ($BFX), a new multi-asset crypto project, is on the verge of completing its presale, already raising over $7.46 million with just a sliver of room left before hitting its $7.5M soft cap. With its token price set to double upon launch, some investors argue that BFX could deliver its own version of “$1” faster than ADA itself. So, which happens first: Cardano breaking $1 or BlockchainFX doubling for early backers? Let’s dive in. Cardano Price Prediction: Closing in on the $1 Barrier Cardano’s current market position is one of cautious optimism. After finally breaching resistance around $0.88–$0.90, ADA has found new support at this level. Trading near $0.90, the coin now has a clearer path toward the $0.95–$1.00 zone, where psychological resistance and technical ceilings converge. Upside case : A breakout above $1 could spark a rally toward $1.10–$1.20, with ambitious projections reaching $1.30–$1.50 if momentum accelerates and institutional inflows pick up. Downside case : Failure to defend $0.88 could drag ADA back to $0.75 or even $0.70, undoing much of the breakout hype. On-chain data shows large investors accumulating ADA, a bullish sign that whales are preparing for the next leg higher. Meanwhile, scaling upgrades like Hydra and the Midnight sidechain bolster ADA’s fundamentals. Still, volatility remains a factor, and ADA’s march to $1 is far from guaranteed. The BlockchainFX Presale: A Different Kind of $1 Race As Cardano fights to secure its place above the $1 mark, BlockchainFX ($BFX) is giving investors a much faster path to potential returns. With the presale price at $0.023 and a confirmed launch price of $0.05 , early buyers are looking at a built-in 117% upside from day one. To put that into perspective, it’s the equivalent of ADA leaping from $0.90 to nearly $2.00 overnight. But BlockchainFX isn’t just about speculation, it’s building what it calls a multi-asset super app, designed to let users trade more than 500 different assets in one place. This spans not only cryptocurrencies, but also stocks, ETFs, bonds, and forex, making it one of the few platforms attempting to fully merge traditional finance with decentralized markets. Deflationary Tokenomics That Reward Holders One of the most compelling aspects of BlockchainFX is its deflationary model, built to create long-term scarcity while rewarding loyal participants. Here’s how it works: 70% of all platform fees are redistributed to the community. 50% flows directly into staking pools, paying rewards in both $BFX and USDT. 20% is used for daily buybacks, with half of those tokens permanently burned, reducing supply and steadily increasing scarcity. This system does more than provide passive income opportunities, it strengthens the long-term value proposition of $BFX. Projects with these mechanics often emerge as the best cryptos to buy now, since they combine immediate presale upside with sustainable tokenomics that reward holders well beyond launch. BlockchainFX Quick Snapshot Presale Price : $0.023 Launch Price : $0.05 (117% upside locked in) Funds Raised : $7.46M+ (99.5% of $7.5M soft cap) Tradable Assets : 500+ (crypto, stocks, ETFs, bonds, forex) Rewards : 70% fees redistributed; staking in $BFX + USDT Token Burns : Daily buybacks with permanent supply cuts Utility : AI trading suite, instant swaps, Visa card with $10K ATM withdrawals, Apple Pay & Google Pay integration ADA vs BlockchainFX: Which Hits $1 First? To investors, ADA and BFX represent two very different types of opportunity: Metric Cardano (ADA) BlockchainFX ($BFX) Current Price ~$0.90 $0.023 (presale) Target $1 (short-term milestone) $0.05 confirmed launch price Growth Potential +11% to $1.00 +117% at listing Catalysts Whale accumulation, Hydra upgrades, ETF narratives Multi-asset super app, staking rewards, deflationary buybacks Risks Market rejection below $0.88 Presale-stage uncertainty, execution risks In simple terms: ADA has momentum, but BlockchainFX has built-in upside. ADA may or may not clear $1 this quarter, while $BFX is mathematically set to double at launch. That’s why many whales are hedging bets by holding both. Conclusion: Two Paths, One Goal Cardano has reclaimed attention with its breakout and is closer than ever to the psychological $1 barrier. Its fundamentals, scaling upgrades, DeFi growth, and whale interest — make a bullish case for the months ahead. But short-term risks linger, and ADA’s climb will likely be a battle. On the other hand, BlockchainFX offers investors a guaranteed upside as it transitions from presale to launch. With its super app vision, deflationary tokenomics, and nearly full $7.5M soft cap, BFX represents the kind of early-stage play that many believe can rival established altcoins in growth potential. So, which will hit “$1” first, Cardano in the markets, or BlockchainFX for its presale backers? The race is on, and the outcome could redefine how investors think about risk and reward in 2025.

The financial world often sees traditional markets as a bellwether for broader investor confidence, and today’s news certainly adds to that narrative. The three major U.S. stock indexes opened higher at the start of trading, with the S&P 500 up 0.17%, the Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.18%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.08%. While these are modest gains, they signal a positive start to the trading day, and this optimism can often spill over into the dynamic world of digital assets, influencing overall crypto market sentiment . Why Do Rising Stocks Matter for Crypto Market Sentiment? It might seem like two separate worlds, but the performance of traditional stock markets, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq, frequently correlates with movements in the cryptocurrency space. When investors feel confident about the economy and traditional assets are performing well, they often become more willing to take on risk in other areas, including cryptocurrencies. Risk Appetite: Positive stock market performance often increases overall investor risk appetite. This means more capital might flow into speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Macroeconomic Indicators: Stock market movements are often driven by broader economic data and central bank policies. These same macroeconomic factors also significantly impact the crypto market sentiment . Institutional Interest: Many institutional investors now hold both traditional stocks and digital assets. Their portfolio decisions can create a ripple effect across both markets. Conversely, a downturn in stocks can lead to a ‘risk-off’ environment, where investors sell riskier assets to move into safer havens, potentially dampening crypto market sentiment . It’s a complex dance between old and new finance. Navigating the Interplay: What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Holdings? While a rising tide lifts all boats, it is crucial to remember that cryptocurrencies also have their own unique drivers. Bitcoin’s halving events, regulatory news, technological advancements in specific altcoins, and even social media trends can independently shape crypto market sentiment . However, ignoring the broader market signals would be a mistake. For investors, today’s positive stock market opening could be seen as a supportive backdrop for digital assets. It suggests that the general economic outlook, at least for now, is leaning towards growth rather than contraction. This can foster a more optimistic environment, encouraging both retail and institutional players to consider increasing their exposure to cryptocurrencies or holding onto their existing positions. Key Considerations: Always conduct your own research (DYOR) before making investment decisions. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes. Stay informed about both traditional market news and specific crypto developments. Maintaining a Clear Perspective on Crypto Market Sentiment In conclusion, the initial higher opening of major U.S. stock indexes offers a potentially positive, albeit indirect, boost to crypto market sentiment . It reflects a broader sense of economic optimism that often encourages risk-taking. While cryptocurrencies maintain their own distinct market dynamics, their increasing integration into the global financial landscape means that traditional market performance is an important factor to monitor. Observing how Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets react to this initial stock market uptick will provide further insights into the current state of investor confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Do stock market movements always predict crypto movements? A1: Not always, but there’s a notable correlation, especially with major macroeconomic shifts. Cryptocurrencies also have their unique drivers, but broad investor sentiment often impacts both. Q2: Which stock index is most relevant to crypto? A2: The Nasdaq Composite, which is heavily weighted towards technology stocks, often shows a stronger correlation with crypto markets due to shared investor demographics and risk profiles. Q3: How quickly does the stock market impact crypto? A3: The impact can be quite immediate, especially during significant market events. Major news in traditional finance can cause swift reactions in crypto prices as investors adjust their positions. Q4: Should I base my crypto investments solely on stock market performance? A4: No. While the stock market is a factor, it should not be the sole basis for crypto investment decisions. Fundamental analysis of crypto projects, technological developments, and regulatory news are equally, if not more, important. Q5: What is ‘risk-off’ sentiment? A5: ‘Risk-off’ sentiment describes a market environment where investors become more cautious, selling off riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies in favor of safer investments like government bonds or cash.

One such exciting development comes from Kernel DAO, a prominent BNB-based crypto restaking protocol. They are set to launch KUSD, a groundbreaking reward-bearing stablecoin that promises to redefine how we perceive stable digital assets and connect them to real-world finance. What Makes KUSD a Revolutionary Reward-Bearing Stablecoin? Kernel DAO’s KUSD isn’t just another stablecoin; it’s designed with a unique advantage: it bears rewards. This means that simply holding KUSD can potentially generate returns for its users, unlike most conventional stablecoins that maintain a fixed value without offering inherent yield. Collateralized by Real-World Assets: KUSD is backed by real-world short-term bonds, providing a tangible and stable foundation for its value. This linkage to traditional finance offers a layer of security and trust. BNB-Based Protocol: Built on the robust BNB ecosystem, KUSD benefits from its speed, efficiency, and growing user base, ensuring seamless integration and accessibility within the DeFi space. Yield Generation: The ‘reward-bearing’ aspect stems from the underlying bonds. As these bonds generate returns, a portion of that yield is passed on to KUSD holders, creating a passive income opportunity. How Does KUSD Bridge Real-World Finance and DeFi? Kernel DAO envisions KUSD as the cornerstone of an ‘Internet of Credit.’ This ambitious project aims to seamlessly integrate the stability and earning potential of KUSD with everyday financial activities. Imagine a future where your digital assets work harder for you, effortlessly connecting with the traditional financial world. The protocol’s plans extend beyond mere stablecoin issuance. They aim to leverage KUSD to facilitate: Payments: Enabling faster, more efficient, and potentially reward-generating digital payments for goods and services. Salary Disbursements: Offering a novel way for employers to pay salaries, potentially allowing employees to earn passive income on their wages from the moment they receive them. Broader Financial Inclusion: By making real-world assets accessible through a digital, reward-bearing stablecoin, Kernel DAO could open doors for a wider audience to participate in yield-generating opportunities. This initiative represents a significant step towards blurring the lines between traditional finance and the decentralized economy, making DeFi more tangible and beneficial for everyday users. The Mechanics Behind This Innovative Reward-Bearing Stablecoin Understanding how KUSD generates rewards is key to appreciating its innovation. The process involves a sophisticated interplay between real-world assets and the blockchain. Here’s a simplified look at the mechanism: Bond Acquisition: Kernel DAO acquires short-term, high-quality real-world bonds. These bonds typically offer a fixed interest rate. Collateralization: These bonds serve as collateral for minting KUSD tokens. This ensures that every KUSD is backed by a tangible asset. Yield Distribution: As the bonds mature and generate interest, Kernel DAO processes these returns. A portion of this yield is then distributed to KUSD holders, effectively making it a reward-bearing stablecoin . This model aims to provide both stability, characteristic of stablecoins, and yield, typically associated with more volatile assets or traditional investments. It’s a compelling proposition for those seeking both security and growth in their digital holdings. What Are the Benefits of Using a Reward-Bearing Stablecoin Like KUSD? The introduction of KUSD brings several compelling advantages for users, potentially setting a new standard for stable digital assets. Passive Income Potential: Holders can earn rewards simply by holding KUSD, transforming a static asset into a dynamic, income-generating one. Enhanced Stability: Collateralization by real-world short-term bonds provides a strong peg to real-world value, mitigating the volatility often seen in other cryptocurrencies. Bridging Traditional and Decentralized Finance: KUSD acts as a crucial link, allowing DeFi users to access returns from traditional financial instruments without leaving the crypto ecosystem. Increased Utility: Beyond just being a store of value, KUSD’s reward-bearing nature and integration into an ‘Internet of Credit’ enhance its utility for payments, remittances, and other financial services. This innovative approach positions KUSD as a significant player in the evolving landscape of stablecoins, offering a blend of security, utility, and earning potential. Kernel DAO’s venture into a reward-bearing stablecoin with KUSD is more than just a new token launch; it’s a strategic move to integrate real-world finance with the agility and innovation of DeFi. By collateralizing KUSD with short-term bonds and planning an ‘Internet of Credit,’ Kernel DAO is not only offering a stable asset that generates yield but also paving the way for a more interconnected and efficient global financial system. This initiative has the potential to reshape how we save, spend, and earn, making the benefits of decentralized finance accessible and rewarding for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is KUSD and how does it differ from other stablecoins? KUSD is a reward-bearing stablecoin launched by Kernel DAO. Unlike most stablecoins that simply maintain a peg to a fiat currency without generating returns, KUSD is collateralized by real-world short-term bonds, allowing its holders to earn passive rewards from the interest generated by these underlying assets. What are real-world short-term bonds, and why are they used as collateral? Real-world short-term bonds are debt instruments issued by governments or corporations that mature within a year. They are considered relatively low-risk and stable investments. Kernel DAO uses them as collateral to provide a strong, tangible backing for KUSD, ensuring its stability and generating the rewards distributed to holders. How can I earn rewards by holding KUSD? The rewards for holding KUSD are generated from the interest earned on the real-world short-term bonds that collateralize the stablecoin. Kernel DAO manages these bonds and distributes a portion of the yield back to KUSD holders, creating a passive income stream for them. What is the ‘Internet of Credit’ that Kernel DAO plans to build with KUSD? The ‘Internet of Credit’ is Kernel DAO’s vision to connect real-world financial activities, such as payments and salary disbursements, with the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem using KUSD. This aims to create a seamless, efficient, and potentially reward-generating financial network that bridges traditional and digital finance. Is KUSD safe to hold, given its connection to real-world assets? KUSD’s safety is enhanced by its collateralization with real-world short-term bonds, which are generally considered stable and secure assets. However, like any financial instrument, it carries inherent risks related to the performance of the underlying assets and the operational security of the protocol.

He compared the potential impact to the 2019 “ETF Rule,” which tripled traditional ETF launches, and argued that easier access will position crypto assets for stronger rallies when their fundamentals improve. Hougan called the change a “coming of age” moment. Crypto ETFs Near Breakthrough Moment Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, believes the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) work on generic listing standards could transform the crypto market and spark what he called an “ETPalooza.” In a note to clients , Hougan said the market is set up for a spectacular end-of-year rally, fueled by factors like rate cuts, growing exchange-traded product (ETP) inflows, dollar concerns, and momentum around tokenization and stablecoins. While September’s seasonality weighed on performance, he argued that approvals and legislative progress often take time to impact prices, and the stage is now being set for a broader surge. Hougan’s note to clients Currently, every new spot crypto ETP requires a lengthy, one-off SEC review process that can last up to 240 days with no guarantee of approval. Generic listing standards will change this by allowing issuers to launch ETPs for any crypto asset that meets predefined criteria, likely tied to the existence of regulated futures markets on exchanges like CME or Cboe. Hougan pointed out that the change would cut approval times to as little as 75 days and unlock a wide range of products, including Solana, XRP, Chainlink, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, Hedera, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Hougan pointed to the SEC’s adoption of the “ ETF Rule ” in 2019 as an example of the potential impact. That change simplified approval processes for traditional ETFs, and led to a tripling in annual launches and a surge in issuers. He expects crypto to follow the same trajectory, with dozens of single-asset and index-based ETPs appearing quickly once the new standards are in place, possibly as soon as October. (Source: Bitwise ) While the existence of more ETPs alone won’t guarantee inflows, Hougan thinks that they make it far easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to crypto by turning tokens into recognizable tickers on brokerage platforms. This increased accessibility positions assets to rally more sharply when fundamentals improve. Calling the shift a “coming of age” moment for the industry, Hougan said the adoption of generic listing standards will be the start of crypto’s entry into the financial big leagues.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|BCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-16 14:00:53

Đây là thời kỳ khi dòng vốn thường chảy vào các altcoin vốn hóa nhỏ, ngay cả khi không có tin tức lớn nào xuất hiện. Dữ liệu on-chain cho thấy một số altcoin có vốn hóa thị trường dưới 200 triệu USD đang ghi nhận sự sụt giảm mạnh trong lượng dự trữ trên sàn giao dịch. Điều này thường là tín hiệu cho thấy hoạt động tích lũy đang gia tăng. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) là một dự án Layer-2 xây dựng trên mạng lưới Bitcoin, nhằm mang lại tốc độ giao dịch nhanh hơn, chi phí rẻ hơn và mở rộng khả năng hỗ trợ smart contract, dApp và DeFi thông qua Canonical Bridge cùng Solana Virtual Machine. Tổng cung token: 21 tỷ HYPER. Giai đoạn presale: bắt đầu từ giữa tháng 5/2025. Giá khởi điểm presale: khoảng $0,0115 (tăng dần theo từng vòng). Số vốn huy động: hơn 16,2 triệu USD tính đến hiện tại. Theo dữ liệu thị trường, vốn hóa hiện tại của HYPER dao động quanh mức 300–350 triệu USD, đưa dự án này vào nhóm altcoin vốn hóa vừa và nhỏ. Dữ liệu on-chain cho thấy lượng HYPER còn lại trên các sàn giao dịch đang có xu hướng giảm dần, trong khi nhiều nhà đầu tư lựa chọn nắm giữ trong ví riêng hoặc staking để tận dụng lãi suất cao. Đây thường được coi là tín hiệu tích lũy mạnh mẽ, khi nguồn cung trên sàn thấp có thể tạo ra áp lực tăng giá trong tương lai. Ngoài ra, kế hoạch niêm yết trên các sàn giao dịch lớn sau presale cùng sự kiện Token Generation Event (TGE) dự kiến sẽ thu hút thêm nhiều sự chú ý từ nhà đầu tư. Nếu xu hướng tích lũy tiếp tục, HYPER có thể trở thành một trong những altcoin nổi bật trong mùa altcoin hiện tại. Maxi Doge (MAXI) Maxi Doge (MAXI) là một meme-coin mới trên mạng Ethereum, hiện đang trong giai đoạn presale và nhanh chóng thu hút sự quan tâm từ cộng đồng. Tổng cung: 150,24 tỷ MAXI. Phân bổ: 40% cho presale (hơn 60 tỷ token), 25% cho quỹ Maxi Fund (thanh khoản, marketing, hợp tác), 15% phát triển, 15% thanh khoản, 5% staking rewards. Giá presale: bắt đầu từ $0,00025 và sẽ tăng dần qua 50 giai đoạn lên khoảng $0,0002745. Số vốn huy động: hơn 2,2 triệu USD tính đến hiện tại. Mặc dù vốn hóa thị trường hiện tại của MAXI còn khiêm tốn, tín hiệu tích cực là lượng token trong presale được bán ra khá nhanh, cho thấy dòng vốn đang dần tích lũy. Việc nhiều nhà đầu tư lựa chọn staking cũng góp phần giảm nguồn cung lưu hành, một yếu tố thường được coi là xu hướng tích lũy mạnh mẽ. Nếu dòng vốn trong mùa altcoin này luân chuyển đúng như kỳ vọng, những meme-coin vốn hóa thấp như Maxi Doge hoàn toàn có thể trở thành điểm đến mới cho nhà đầu tư. Với staking rewards hấp dẫn, cộng đồng đang mở rộng và kế hoạch tiếp thị mạnh mẽ, MAXI có tiềm năng nổi bật trong giai đoạn sắp tới. Wall Street Pepe (WSPEPE): Meme Coin Tiềm Năng Trong Mùa Altcoin 2025 Wall Street Pepe (WSPEPE) là meme coin lấy cảm hứng từ Wall Street Bets và Pepe the Frog, nhanh chóng tạo sức hút lớn trong cộng đồng. Với tổng cung 420,69 tỷ token, trong đó hơn 93% phân bổ cho cộng đồng, WSPEPE đã niêm yết trên các sàn lớn như MEXC, BitMart và Uniswap. Vốn hóa thị trường hiện khoảng 10–15 triệu USD, nhưng dữ liệu on-chain cho thấy nguồn cung trên sàn đang giảm, báo hiệu xu hướng tích lũy. Nhờ hiệu ứng meme, cộng đồng mạnh mẽ và thanh khoản sớm trên cả CEX lẫn DEX, WSPEPE được xem là một trong những ứng viên sáng giá của mùa altcoin 2025.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|SOL,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-16 14:03:04

The protocol aims to address fragmentation in decentralized finance (DeFi) through decentralized validator curation and composable staking tokens. Kintsu is changing how liquid staking works on Hyperliquid by introducing a governance model that plays out like a game: delegates stake governance tokens and campaign for delegations by curating high performing validator teams. Validators compete for stake, delegates compete for reputation and voting power, and the entire system is driven by transparent performance. The result: validator performance fuels yield, and yield powers a more resilient, composable LST designed for the Hyperliquid ecosystem. “By transforming simply staked assets into programmable collateral, we catalyze growth by infusing the highest risk-adjusted yields and boosting chain GDP. At scale, liquid staking must be controlled transparently and programmatically, it is necessary and inevitable that LSTs become truly community governed, not run in an opaque discretionary fashion. After two years of research and development, we are proud to announce that Kintsu is expanding to Hyperliquid and bringing a new level of resilience to liquid staking on the HyperEVM.” — Stephen, Founder of Kintsu. Why Hyperliquid Hyperliquid has emerged as one of DeFi’s most important hubs, averaging billions in daily trading volume and strengthened by HIP-3’s permissionless market creation. By launching sHYPE on Hyperliquid, Kintsu delivers: Validator Competition and Yield Structure — The decentralized validator registry enables open competition among validators, with yields determined by performance metrics. Validator output directly influences yield distribution, which in turn underpins the sHYPE token model. Composability and Integration — sHYPE is designed for direct integration with HyperEVM based decentralized finance applications and yield strategies. Through CoreWriter contracts, it also connects with Hyperliquid’s native staking layer, expanding interoperability across the ecosystem. Liquidity and Governance Alignment — Unlike traditional locked staking mechanisms, sHYPE maintains liquidity for participants while supporting composable capital allocation. Governance structures oversee validator selection and curation, with the objective of ensuring transparency and incentive alignment across stakeholders. Battle Pass Multiplier NFT Over 300,000 participants engaged with the Beta Pass NFT, marking a significant milestone for the project. Building on this response, the team has introduced the Battle Pass Multiplier NFT. Individuals who join the waitlist will be entered into a selection process for a Battle Pass. Participation can be increased through referrals, staking sHYPE, and engaging with supported integrations. Selected participants will receive the Battle Pass Multiplier NFT, which provides 1.5x Kintsu Points, offering an early advantage in rank progression. The initiative is designed around a community driven model of liquid staking, with validator performance and participant activity serving as key factors in shaping outcomes.

This collaboration marks a significant step, as Sharps Technology will engage in Bonk Solana staking , leveraging Bonk’s infrastructure to generate yield from its substantial Solana holdings. This strategic move highlights a growing trend where established companies explore innovative avenues within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. It’s a clear signal of increasing institutional confidence in the potential of digital assets and the underlying blockchain technology. What Does This Strategic Bonk Solana Staking Partnership Entail? Under this newly forged agreement, Sharps Technology plans to utilize Bonk’s specialized liquid staking infrastructure. Specifically, its 2.14 million SOL holdings, currently valued at an impressive $500 million, will be staked on the BonkSOL platform. This isn’t just about holding assets; it’s about actively putting them to work. Here’s what makes this partnership particularly noteworthy: Yield Generation: Sharps Technology aims to earn yield on its significant Solana investment, transforming a static asset into a productive one. Liquid Staking Advantage: By using BonkSOL, Sharps benefits from liquid staking, meaning its staked SOL remains accessible and tradable in the form of BonkSOL tokens, rather than being locked up. Market Signal: This partnership underscores the increasing utility and acceptance of memecoin ecosystems like Bonk, moving beyond mere speculation to providing valuable DeFi services. Why Liquid Staking with BonkSOL for Such a Large Holder? Liquid staking offers a compelling solution for large institutional holders like Sharps Technology. Traditional staking often involves locking up assets for a set period, which can limit flexibility and capital efficiency. However, liquid staking protocols like BonkSOL issue a liquid staking derivative (LSD) token in return for the staked asset. For Sharps, this means: Their Bonk Solana staking still earns rewards. The issued BonkSOL tokens can be used in other DeFi protocols, potentially generating additional yield or serving as collateral. It provides a balance between earning staking rewards and maintaining liquidity, which is crucial for a publicly traded company managing significant assets.

In a TradingView chart, the analyst highlights similar structural patterns in both markets, suggesting that XRP, the dominant asset within TOTAL3, could be poised for a dramatic move. Gold’s Breakout Sets the Stage Gold has climbed to fresh all-time highs in recent months, driven by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts , ongoing ETF inflows, and persistent demand for safe-haven assets. Technical analysts point to gold’s long-term ascending channel, which has guided its price higher through multiple market cycles. $Gold & #Total3 . The leader leading Total3 is $XRP . Gold then XRP 1,000% Rise is not an impossible dream. https://t.co/vRY1qBLZBr pic.twitter.com/RaV7k435EJ — (X)=chi (R)esurrected (P)=rho (@Cryptobilbuwoo0) September 16, 2025 According to the chart, gold’s current breakout could mirror the kind of secular expansion that has delivered extraordinary percentage gains in the past. That historical precedent forms the backbone of the comparison to crypto’s TOTAL3 index. TOTAL3’s Cup-and-Handle Formation The TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin and Ethereum, now shows a large cup-and-handle pattern. Technical traders often view this formation as a bullish continuation signal, marking the potential for an explosive upward move once resistance levels are cleared. Analysts tracking TOTAL3 think a clear breakout might spark a widespread altcoin surge, with XRP poised to take the lead due to its significant market presence and substantial liquidity, potentially driving momentum across the broader altcoin market. The 1,000% Math XRP currently trades around $3.03 with a market capitalization of nearly $180 billion. A 1,000% rally—representing an elevenfold increase—would lift XRP’s price to roughly $33.33 . With a circulating supply of about 59.7 billion tokens, that would imply a market cap approaching $2 trillion, putting XRP on par with the world’s most valuable crypto assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While those numbers sound ambitious, the analyst argues they are not impossible if TOTAL3 achieves the kind of expansion that gold has historically demonstrated. Key Conditions Such an outcome hinges on several factors: a sustained breakout in TOTAL3, continued macroeconomic tailwinds like easier monetary policy and robust ETF inflows, and a strong rotation of capital from Bitcoin into major altcoins. If these align, the roadmap outlined by (X)=chi (R)esurrected (P)=rho could become reality. However, technical analogies are not guarantees, and investors should treat them as one scenario among many. Bottom Line The comparison between gold’s long-term channel and the altcoin market’s current structure offers a bold vision of what could unfold for XRP. A 1,000% price surge may sound extraordinary, but when viewed through the lens of historical market expansions and present technical setups, it remains within the realm of possibility.

The protocol aims to address fragmentation in decentralized finance (DeFi) through decentralized validator curation and composable staking tokens. Kintsu is changing how liquid staking works on Hyperliquid by introducing a governance model that plays out like a game: delegates stake governance tokens and campaign for delegations by curating high performing validator teams. Validators compete for stake, delegates compete for reputation and voting power, and the entire system is driven by transparent performance. The result: validator performance fuels yield, and yield powers a more resilient, composable LST designed for the Hyperliquid ecosystem. “By transforming simply staked assets into programmable collateral, we catalyze growth by infusing the highest risk-adjusted yields and boosting chain GDP. At scale, liquid staking must be controlled transparently and programmatically, it is necessary and inevitable that LSTs become truly community governed, not run in an opaque discretionary fashion. After two years of research and development, we are proud to announce that Kintsu is expanding to Hyperliquid and bringing a new level of resilience to liquid staking on the HyperEVM.” — Stephen, Founder of Kintsu. Why Hyperliquid Hyperliquid has emerged as one of DeFi’s most important hubs, averaging billions in daily trading volume and strengthened by HIP-3’s permissionless market creation. By launching sHYPE on Hyperliquid, Kintsu delivers: Validator Competition and Yield Structure — The decentralized validator registry enables open competition among validators, with yields determined by performance metrics. Validator output directly influences yield distribution, which in turn underpins the sHYPE token model. Composability and Integration — sHYPE is designed for direct integration with HyperEVM based decentralized finance applications and yield strategies. Through CoreWriter contracts, it also connects with Hyperliquid’s native staking layer, expanding interoperability across the ecosystem. Liquidity and Governance Alignment — Unlike traditional locked staking mechanisms, sHYPE maintains liquidity for participants while supporting composable capital allocation. Governance structures oversee validator selection and curation, with the objective of ensuring transparency and incentive alignment across stakeholders. Battle Pass Multiplier NFT Over 300,000 participants engaged with the Beta Pass NFT, marking a significant milestone for the project. Building on this response, the team has introduced the Battle Pass Multiplier NFT. Individuals who join the waitlist will be entered into a selection process for a Battle Pass. Participation can be increased through referrals, staking sHYPE, and engaging with supported integrations. Selected participants will receive the Battle Pass Multiplier NFT, which provides 1.5x Kintsu Points, offering an early advantage in rank progression. The initiative is designed around a community driven model of liquid staking, with validator performance and participant activity serving as key factors in shaping outcomes.

51824613,582844,1758031617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51824613.jpeg,Whales Buy $58K Bitcoin Hyper in One Day: Could This Be 2025’s Best Presale?,https://bitcoinist.com/buy-hyper-bitcoin-looking-for-best-presales-in-2025/,"We have just identified two new whale buys into $HYPER, totaling $58K. Bitcoin has come a long way since the days of paying 50 $BTC for a pizza. It’s now the uncontested #1 cryptocurrency worldwide. The market cap for Bitcoin alone is around $2.30T , and history suggests that Bitcoin is only likely to trend upward. Unfortunately, Bitcoin is intentionally slow. It can only handle roughly 7 to 10 transactions per second . Ideally, your transaction might be confirmed within ten minutes, but it’s common to wait over an hour for a $BTC transfer to go through. That’s what Bitcoin Hyper aims to address. The developers behind this innovative Layer-2 project are using a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to supercharge the Bitcoin network. Whales are already taking action to buy the $HYPER token that powers the project, as we’ve seen with two large purchases: $31.5K and $27.1K . Let’s explore exactly why Bitcoin needs a new Layer-2 and what Bitcoin Hyper is offering. Why is Bitcoin so Slow? It’s not a technical problem – Bitcoin intentionally operates slowly. The Bitcoin network is created to add new blocks to the blockchain approximately every ten minutes. Since blocks have a fixed size limit, there’s a strict cap on how many new transactions can be processed through the Bitcoin network. Partly, that’s why Bitcoin appeals to long-term investors. Each transaction is seen as fully authoritative, so there are no security concerns with Bitcoin. However, most schools of thought on blockchain development agree that prioritizing security and decentralization comes at an unavoidable cost to scalability. That’s not such a big issue for investors. Unfortunately, it’s a real problem if you try using Bitcoin like fiat currency. There will be a very long line behind you if you try to pay for items at a retail store with Bitcoin, to say the least. That also means Bitcoin fees will only increase as the network becomes more congested, and urgent transactions come with a premium that allows them to be processed quickly. How Does $HYPER Solve These Issues? It introduces a second processing layer on top of the Bitcoin network that can handle transactions faster by utilizing Solana’s lightning-fast parallel processing. You can think of Bitcoin Hyper as a temporary, secondary ledger: $BTC enters the blockchain, is processed quickly using the SVM, and then is settled back onto the Bitcoin layer later. The transactions between the two layers are managed by a Canonical Bridge. On Layer-1, you send $BTC to the Canonical Bridge address, where it is held in custody on your behalf. In return, an equal amount of wrapped $BTC is created by the Canonical Bridge and sent to your wallet on Layer-2. For more details on how Bitcoin Hyper operates behind the scenes, check out our comprehensive “ What is Bitcoin Hyper ” guide. Why is $HYPER Set to Rise? As the official token of Bitcoin Hyper, $HYPER is poised to gain from increased capital flows through the Bitcoin Hyper network. Using it lowers the cost of interacting with smart contracts and performing crypto swaps, providing inherent value for Bitcoin users who already benefit from Bitcoin Hyper’s fast network. Our price prediction for $HYPER estimates at least $0.15 by the end of 2025, with potential highs of $0.32, which is over a 10x increase from the current presale price of $0.012925. While $HYPER is likely to be a victim of a potential downturn in the crypto market as a whole come 2026, our projections for 2030 tell us it could hit a spectacular high of $1.50. We also anticipate that $HYPER’s value will be enhanced by on-chain adoption. The Bitcoin Hyper developers plan to enable smart contracts that restrict exclusive features to $HYPER holders only, creating an ecosystem where $HYPER allows you to unlock the full potential of Bitcoin Hyper’s dApps. Check out the official Bitcoin Hyper website if you want to buy some $HYPER before the presale ends. Don’t wait too long, though – the project has already raised over $16.2M in presales, and the recent whale purchases suggest demand for $HYPER is growing stronger. $HYPER isn’t the only presale that has gained significant momentum before its release.

The stock is down around 6% on Tuesday, trading at $30.42, and has dropped nearly 24% over the past week. The sharp decline follows an initial surge after the company raised $425 million in its IPO, pricing shares at $28 and valuing the firm at $3.3 billion before trading began. On its first day, GEMI spiked to $45.89 before closing at $32 — a 14% premium to its offer price.

The closure left around 45,000 holders unable to convert more than $25 million worth of tokens. One community member summed up the frustration: “Thousands of retail investors suddenly found themselves holding assets they can’t use or trade. In our group alone, people lost more than $200,000 in value.” The bridge shutdown had been approved in a December 2024 community vote, where participants decided to end support for the wethDYDX smart contract. After a six-month transition period, support officially ended. As a result, ethDYDX tokens can no longer be traded, listed on decentralized (DEX) or centralized exchanges (CEX), or migrated to native DYDX. Any attempt to use the old bridge now results in tokens being permanently locked. Supply Cut After Migration Deadline According to official figures, more than 41.6 million ethDYDX tokens were left unmigrated at the time of closure. These tokens have now been excluded from both the total and circulating supply. This adjustment reduced the total DYDX supply to 958.3 million, while the circulating supply now stands at 750.2 million. Community Pushes for a Second Chance For affected investors, the only path forward is the dYdX governance forum, where a proposal is being discussed to reopen migration for ERC-20 DYDX. Meanwhile, community initiative groups on Telegram are coordinating actions to lobby for a solution. One activist explained: “People aren’t giving up. We’re organizing, pushing governance, and looking for ways to restore fairness.” It’s not the first time dYdX has made headlines.

This significant influx of new stablecoins immediately caught the attention of traders and analysts alike, prompting questions about its implications for market liquidity and the broader crypto ecosystem. Such a substantial move by Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, always warrants a closer look. What Does This Massive USDT Minting Event Signify? When Tether mints new USDT, it typically means the company has received an equivalent amount of fiat currency, usually U.S. dollars, from institutional clients or large investors. This process is fundamental to maintaining USDT’s peg to the dollar. Essentially, more demand for USDT translates into more USDT minting . This particular 1 billion USDT minting suggests a considerable appetite for stablecoins in the market, possibly indicating an intention to purchase other cryptocurrencies or to park funds securely. Increased Liquidity: A primary effect is the injection of substantial liquidity into the crypto market. This fresh supply of USDT can be used for trading, yield farming, or simply as a stable medium of exchange. Market Demand: It signals strong demand for stablecoins, which can be a precursor to bullish movements as investors often use USDT to enter positions in Bitcoin or altcoins. Treasury Movement: The minting occurred at the Tether Treasury, which acts as a central hub for issuing and redeeming USDT. Tether’s Role: How Does USDT Minting Work? Tether operates on a simple principle: for every USDT in circulation, there should be an equivalent amount of reserves backing it. The act of USDT minting is not arbitrary; it is a response to verified deposits. When a large institution wants to acquire a significant amount of USDT, they deposit fiat currency into Tether’s bank accounts. Once verified, Tether issues new USDT tokens, making them available on various blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Solana. This mechanism ensures that the supply of USDT can scale up or down based on market needs, aiming to keep its value stable at $1.00. Understanding this process is crucial for anyone following stablecoin dynamics and their impact on overall market health. The transparency of these movements, often reported by services like Whale Alert, allows the community to monitor the flow of significant capital. Impact on the Crypto Market: Is More USDT Always Good? While increased liquidity from USDT minting can be seen as a positive sign, indicating potential buying power, it also sparks discussions. Some analysts view large mints as a bullish signal, anticipating that these funds will soon flow into other cryptocurrencies, driving prices up. Historically, periods of significant USDT issuance have often preceded market rallies. However, others express concerns about market manipulation or the adequacy of Tether’s reserves. It is essential for users and investors to perform their own due diligence and understand that while USDT provides stability, its backing and the implications of its issuance are subjects of ongoing debate. The sheer volume of this latest minting event underscores the critical role Tether plays in the global crypto economy. Navigating the Waves: What Should Investors Consider? For investors, a major USDT minting event offers several insights. Firstly, it highlights the continuous growth and institutional adoption of stablecoins as a fundamental component of digital asset trading. Secondly, it can be an indicator of shifting market sentiment, where large players are positioning themselves for future moves. Key considerations include: Market Sentiment: Is the market preparing for a bull run, or are institutions simply seeking stable parking for their capital? Reserve Transparency: Always review Tether’s latest attestations and reports regarding their reserves to ensure confidence in the stablecoin’s backing. Diversification: While USDT is dominant, exploring other regulated stablecoins can be a prudent strategy for risk management. This recent 1 billion USDT minting is a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto space. It reinforces the importance of staying informed about major on-chain movements and understanding their potential ripple effects across the market. Summary: A Glimpse into Crypto’s Future The recent 1 billion USDT minting by Tether Treasury is more than just a transaction; it is a powerful indicator of ongoing institutional activity and robust demand within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While injecting significant liquidity, it also underscores the need for continued vigilance regarding stablecoin transparency and market dynamics. As the crypto landscape evolves, such large-scale movements will undoubtedly continue to shape its trajectory, making informed analysis more critical than ever. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when USDT is “minted”? A1: When USDT is “minted,” it means new tokens are created and added to circulation. This typically happens when Tether receives an equivalent amount of fiat currency (like USD) from institutional buyers, ensuring each new USDT is backed by reserves. Q2: Why did Tether mint 1 billion USDT? A2: Tether likely minted 1 billion USDT in response to significant demand from large investors or institutions. These entities deposit fiat currency with Tether, and in return, new USDT is issued to them, often for trading or liquidity purposes within the crypto market. Q3: Does USDT minting always lead to a bull run? A3: Not always, but it can be a strong indicator. Increased USDT minting suggests more capital is entering the crypto ecosystem, which often precedes buying activity in Bitcoin and altcoins. However, it can also be used for other purposes like stablecoin-based yield farming. Q4: How can I track USDT minting events? A4: Services like Whale Alert actively monitor and report large cryptocurrency transactions, including USDT minting events, across various blockchains. You can follow their reports or use blockchain explorers to track Tether Treasury addresses. Q5: What are the potential risks associated with large USDT minting? A5: Potential risks include concerns about the transparency and sufficiency of Tether’s reserves backing the newly minted tokens. Some critics also raise questions about potential market manipulation, although Tether maintains its operations are fully transparent and audited.

Swiss Bankers Association (SBA), a trade association and umbrella organisation for the Swiss financial industry, has successfully overseen a proof-of-concept involving UBS, PostFinance, and Sygnum Bank, to complete what is being called the first legally binding interbank payment executed over a public blockchain. According to the SBA’s September 16 announcement , the pilot involved the banks issuing tokenised representations of fiat bank deposits, dubbed “deposit tokens,” and using these tokens to trigger an off-chain payment that is handled by smart contracts. Multiple testing scenarios were involved, including a standard payment between customers of the participating banks and a more complex escrow-style transaction. For the latter, the banks were successfully able to swap the deposit tokens for tokenised real-world assets (RWAs), entirely using smart contracts. The transactions were carried out on the Ethereum blockchain across a permissioned setup, and it was the first time these banks had completed a legally binding transaction between two banks without relying on the traditional infrastructure. Smart contracts will play a central role SBA insiders touted several benefits inherent to smart contracts, such as automated execution , enhanced transparency, and reduced counterparty risk. However, they also stressed the importance of using a permissioned framework to ensure that payments remain legally binding and compliant with regulatory standards. At the moment, Switzerland houses a robust domestic payments network powered by technologies like the Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) system, but these traditional setups are not designed to handle programmable conditions or integrate easily with blockchain-based markets, the participating companies said. The test results have confirmed the “feasibility” of upgrading the payments infrastructure using blockchain technology, but participants believe more work is needed to reach operational scale. According to the SBA, broader implementation would require collaboration beyond the pilot banks to bring in more financial institutions, infrastructure providers, and regulatory bodies to ensure interoperability and legal clarity across jurisdictions. Scalability challenges, such as throughput capacity, on-chain privacy, and integration with existing banking systems, were also identified as areas that require further refinement. Based on the results, Christoph Puhr, who serves as the digital assets lead at UBS Group, believes “interoperability of bank money via public blockchains can become a reality,” which could translate into more “innovation around tokenized assets.” Blockchain is disrupting traditional infrastructure Blockchain as a technology has been steadily penetrating legacy financial systems across multiple use cases such as cross-border settlements, tokenized securities, programmable payments, and real-world asset (RWA) marketplaces. Recently, the London Stock Exchange Group completed the first-ever blockchain-powered fundraising. Elsewhere in Germany, the Boerse Stuttgart Group launched a blockchain-powered settlement platform that can handle cross-border tokenized asset trades in Europe. Earlier this month, some UK trade groups proposed using blockchain technology as the core of a proposed tech collaboration between the US and the UK, backed by Peter Mandelson, the UK’s ambassador to Washington.

51827940,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/pi-network-pi-sees-increased-demand-following-v23-testnet-protocol-upgrades,1758036397,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/51827940.jpeg,Pi Network (PI) Sees Increased Demand Following V23 Testnet Protocol Upgrades,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/pi-network-pi-sees-increased-demand-following-v23-testnet-protocol-upgrades,"Pi Network (PI) experienced renewed investor interest after the project successfully completed its V23 Testnet protocol upgrades on September 14, 2025. The upgrades are designed to improve node stability and enhance smart contract readiness, strengthening the network’s long-term infrastructure. But in crypto, progress is only half the story—visibility and narrative control are the other half. Just as Pi faces delays in Mainnet deployment, projects often struggle to communicate momentum effectively to sustain confidence. Agencies like Outset PR help bridge this gap by transforming complex milestones into narratives that capture investor attention, align with product-market fit, and drive measurable visibility. Infrastructure Gains vs. Mainnet Delay The V23 upgrade marks another step in Pi Network’s phased rollout strategy, signaling that the team remains focused on scalability and readiness for a broader ecosystem of dApps. Improved stability and contract compatibility will be crucial once the Mainnet is fully live. But the delays matter. For nearly seven months, Pi’s Mainnet deployment has been pushed back, creating frustration among early adopters and dampening momentum for institutional or retail inflows. Adding to the pressure, the upcoming unlock of 140.8 million PI tokens on September 30 poses a risk. If demand does not keep pace with this supply increase, the unlock could act as a drag on price performance, even with stronger infrastructure. Altcoin Rotation: A Broader Market Tailwind Beyond Pi’s internal upgrades, the broader market backdrop also played a role in its recent demand increase. The CMC Altcoin Season Index jumped 26.79% on the week to 71, signaling capital rotation into mid-cap altcoins. With a market capitalization of $2.87 billion, PI sits in a favorable position to capture part of this capital flow. Daily trading volume also reflected improving sentiment, rising 6.65% in 24 hours to $43.3 million. Still, this momentum appears more aligned with altcoin-wide capital rotation than with a standalone PI-specific catalyst. The Fear & Greed Index at 50 (neutral) reinforces the idea that speculative caution remains high, limiting the conviction behind inflows. Short-Term Optimism, Long-Term Questions PI’s 24-hour rise reflects optimism around ecosystem growth and broader altcoin momentum, but structural challenges remain: Delayed Mainnet launch since February keeps real-world adoption on hold. September 30 token unlock could pressure prices if demand lags. Trading volume remains modest relative to its market cap, suggesting a thin liquidity profile. On the other hand, the V23 upgrades lay the groundwork for stronger long-term functionality. If Pi Network can align Mainnet readiness with growing altcoin enthusiasm, it could convert short-term speculation into sustainable growth. Beyond Tech: Why Visibility Matters Crypto projects often find themselves in Pi Network’s position: meaningful technical progress paired with delays that slow adoption. In these moments, narrative control is crucial. That’s where Outset PR steps in. Unlike agencies that rely on one-size-fits-all outreach, Outset PR builds tailored strategies driven by data and media analytics. Its proprietary traffic acquisition system fuses organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation tactics, enabling clients to capture multiples more traffic than conventional PR. By engineering narratives with perfect timing, measurable impact, and product-market fit, Outset PR ensures that projects don’t lose visibility when market uncertainty slows momentum. For Pi Network and others, this kind of positioning can make the difference between being overshadowed and staying top of mind. Conclusion The V23 Testnet upgrades improve Pi Network’s technical backbone and spark optimism, but delayed Mainnet adoption and looming token unlocks temper the upside. PI’s short-term gains align more with altcoin season rotation than with standalone strength. For projects navigating similar challenges, the lesson is clear: technical milestones must be paired with strong narratives to sustain investor confidence. With Outset PR’s data-driven approach and proprietary amplification tools, crypto businesses can ensure their stories resonate—even when adoption lags.

The asset will be added to the existing bridged USDC, expanding Circle’s influence. Circle, Inc. announced the launch of a native USDC version on the Hyperliquid native chain. The version will be added to the balance of bridged USDC, at over $5.9B. The decision to integrate Circle breaks away from the scenario where USDC abandons Hyperliquid, to be replaced completely by USDH. The recent decision will mean both stablecoins will coexist on the perpetual futures DEX. Jeremy Allaire, co-founder of Circle, announced that USDC would expand with a HyperEVM version, in addition to a CCTP V2 facility for cross-chain transfers. Circle will also become one of the chain’s stakeholders after acquiring a share of HYPE tokens. Circle and USDC Expansion with Hyperliquid Today marks a major milestone in our expansion and engagement with the Hyperliquid ecosystem, with the official launch of Native USDC and CCTP V2 on HyperEVM, bringing the world’s most reliable, liquid, interoperable and globally… — Jeremy Allaire – jda.eth / jdallaire.sol (@jerallaire) September 16, 2025 The native version was announced just a day after Hyperliquid’s team prepares to launch the USDH ticker. As Cryptopolitan reported , Hyperliquid picked the Native Markets team to launch the token. Hours before the announcement, Circle also bridged 2M USDC from Arbitrum to HyperEVM, though the amount was relatively small compared to the scale of Hyperliquid’s trading. The partnership with Circle also calms the fears of USDC being transferred out of Hyperliquid. For now, the USDC token remains the main source of liquidity and pair-building. The main stablecoin on Hyperliquid may result in up to $200M in fees for the issuer. The future liquidity and growth of Hyperliquid will show if USDC and USDH are complementary or will be competing for attention. As the issuer of a native asset, Circle secured its position within the Hyperliquid ecosystem. As one of the major assets, Circle may receive a significant share of fees from trading activity. Staking HYPE may also boost the revenues of Circle from the ecosystem. Until recently, USDT and USDC were not subjected to staking requirements due to the well-established liquidity and influence of the tokens. Until September 2025, Circle held 8.20% of its supply of USDC on Hyperliquid. The issuer earned up to $109M to date from bridging and USDC usage. It remains to be seen how the native USDC will affect the activity of the Arbitrum-Hyperliquid bridge , which was the main point of entry for USDC into the Hyperliquid ecosystem. USDC measures Hyperliquid liveliness USDC deposits give a glimpse of the activity on Hyperliquid. The token has become a proxy for whale activity, as well as the liquidity trends on the exchange. USDC deposits became more frequent in September, though transferring lower amounts. | Source: Dune Analytics Deposits range from up to $49M for some of the biggest whales to a few hundred dollars for regular traders. In September, USDC inflows increased, with more regular deposits. The average deposit size is at a lower baseline of $18,150, as an average between whales and small-scale users. The bulk of deposits is for under $400 in USDC. Circle’s CCTP feature may also change the way Hyperliquid traders are depositing and moving USDC. The token is interoperable across the crypto ecosystem, meaning traders can shift the tokens more easily to another network. Circle will offer easier liquidity flows and faster cross-chain operations, potentially bringing users from multiple ecosystems.

The deal, announced on Tuesday, marks the launch of Keyrock’s Asset and Wealth Management division, a new business unit dedicated to institutional clients and private investors. Keyrock, founded in Brussels, Belgium and best known for its work in market making, options and OTC trading, said it will fold Turing Capital’s investment strategies and Luxembourg fund management structure into its wider platform. The division will be led by Turing Capital co-founder Jorge Schnura, who joins Keyrock’s executive committee as president of the unit. The company said the expansion will allow it to provide services across the full lifecycle of digital assets, from liquidity provision to long-term investment strategies. ""In the near future, all assets will live onchain,"" Schnura said, noting that the merger positions the group to capture opportunities as traditional financial products migrate to blockchain rails. Keyrock has also applied for regulatory approval under the EU’s crypto framework MiCA through a filing with Liechtenstein’s financial regulator. If approved, the firm plans to offer portfolio management and advisory services, aiming to compete directly with traditional asset managers as well as crypto-native players.

While major centralized exchanges (CEXs) generally celebrated a 4% surge in spot trading volume during August compared to July, one prominent player experienced a different fate. This article dives into the surprising figures, particularly focusing on the notable dip in Upbit trading volume , and what it might signify for the broader crypto landscape. Unpacking the Decline in Upbit Trading Volume Despite the overall market’s upward trend, the South Korean exchange Upbit faced a challenging August. Reports indicate that Upbit trading volume saw a significant 18% reduction. This decline makes Upbit the exchange with the largest drop among its major counterparts. This stark reduction contrasts sharply with the market’s general optimism. Other exchanges also experiencing declines, though less severe, included MEXC (-15%) and Gate.io (-1%). For a leading platform like Upbit, such a substantial decrease raises questions about specific regional or operational factors at play. A Broader Look: CEXs Experience Robust Growth While Upbit trading volume took a hit, the overall picture for centralized exchanges was largely positive. Spot trading volume across major CEXs collectively rose by 4% in August. This growth indicates sustained interest and activity within the crypto market. Several exchanges stood out with impressive growth rates: Bitfinex led the pack with a remarkable 39% increase. Crypto.com followed closely, boosting its volume by 30%. Bitmart also showed strong performance, recording a 25% rise. Moreover, derivatives trading volume on CEXs saw an even more substantial increase, climbing by 14% over the same period. This suggests a growing appetite for more complex trading instruments. What’s Driving Upbit’s Trading Volume Divergence? The disparity between Upbit’s performance and the broader market’s growth invites closer examination. Several factors could contribute to the decline in Upbit trading volume . Regional Market Dynamics: South Korea has unique regulatory environments and local market behaviors that can influence exchange activity. Increased Competition: The global crypto exchange landscape is fiercely competitive, with platforms constantly vying for market share. User Sentiment: Shifts in local investor sentiment or a preference for alternative platforms could impact trading activity. Understanding these underlying causes is crucial for both Upbit and its users to navigate future market conditions effectively. It highlights that even major players are not immune to market shifts. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Landscape The August trading figures serve as a powerful reminder of the diverse forces at play in the cryptocurrency market. While some exchanges thrive, others may face temporary setbacks. For traders, staying informed about these trends is paramount. Monitoring individual exchange performance, like Upbit trading volume , provides valuable insights. Diversifying strategies and understanding regional market nuances can help mitigate risks. The continued growth in derivatives also points to evolving trader sophistication and market maturity. This dynamic environment underscores the need for continuous adaptation and strategic planning for both exchanges and investors alike. Conclusion August presented a mixed bag for centralized crypto exchanges. While the overall market witnessed a healthy increase in spot and derivatives trading volumes, the significant 18% drop in Upbit trading volume stands out as a key development. This divergence underscores the complex and often localized factors that influence exchange performance, reminding us that even in a growing market, individual platforms can face unique challenges. Keeping an eye on these trends is essential for understanding the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency.

This strategic consolidation is set to redefine how businesses approach AI video content, particularly through the enhanced capabilities of digital avatars . For those following the rapid advancements in AI and its integration into various industries, this merger represents a powerful leap forward, promising innovative solutions for enterprise clients worldwide. D-ID’s Strategic Leap: Why Simpleshow? The acquisition, the financial terms of which remain undisclosed, sees Simpleshow’s robust product suite operating under the D-ID umbrella, with a planned eventual merger of the two platforms. Gil Perry, D-ID’s chief executive, highlighted the strategic impetus behind this decision, stating that Simpleshow initially approached D-ID for a partnership. However, the evident synergy between the management teams and their respective products quickly pointed towards a more comprehensive integration. Perry emphasized the need to accelerate D-ID’s capture of a larger share of the burgeoning enterprise video market, especially concerning avatar-driven content. Acquiring Simpleshow was seen as the crucial boost required to achieve this ambition. Simpleshow, founded in 2008, has an impressive history, having raised over $20 million in funding according to Crunchbase. Its global footprint, with offices in Berlin, Luxembourg, London, Miami, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, will now consolidate into key hubs in Berlin, Tel Aviv, and the United States, expanding the combined entity to 140 employees. Simpleshow’s Journey: From Agency to AI Video Pioneer Karsten Boehrs, CEO of Simpleshow, shared insights into his company’s evolution. When he joined over a decade ago, Simpleshow operated primarily as an agency, producing videos for businesses. Recognizing the need for scalability and broader international reach, the company pivoted to building a SaaS-based technology platform. This transformation led to the launch of one of its first significant tools: a text-to-video solution for clients in 2017. Boehrs explained that the recent explosion in AI capabilities prompted discussions with other industry players, such as Synthesia, for potential partnerships. Ultimately, these conversations led to the acquisition by D-ID . The value Simpleshow brings is not just its technological prowess but also its substantial client base. Simpleshow boasts more than 1,500 enterprise clients, including globally recognized names like Adobe, Audi, Airbus, Microsoft, Bayer, HP, T-Mobile, McDonald’s, eBay, and Deutsche Bank. This impressive roster is expected to significantly boost D-ID’s bottom line and accelerate its path to profitability, marking a substantial win for the acquiring company. Unlocking the Power of Digital Avatars for Enterprise Both D-ID and Simpleshow share a strong conviction in the future of digital avatars across various video applications. These include critical areas such as training, marketing, and sales. D-ID already offers a sophisticated suite of AI-powered interactive avatars to its clients, enabling dynamic and engaging content creation. The synergy with Simpleshow’s extensive client base and video creation expertise will only amplify these offerings. Looking ahead, D-ID plans to innovate further by developing interactive training videos. Imagine a scenario where users can interrupt a video presented by an avatar to ask a question or participate in a quiz, creating a far more immersive and effective learning experience. This vision highlights the transformative potential of AI in making digital interactions more personal and productive, moving beyond passive consumption to active engagement. Navigating the Competitive Landscape of Enterprise Video AI The market for enterprise video solutions leveraging digital avatars is undeniably competitive and growing. D-ID faces formidable rivals such as Synthesia and Soul Machine, both prominent players in the AI avatar space. Moreover, tech giants and consulting firms like Google and McKinsey are also actively developing their own solutions to empower clients with digital avatar capabilities. This intense competition underscores the immense potential and demand for these advanced tools in the business world. Despite the competitive environment, D-ID is well-positioned, having raised $60 million in funding to date. The company confirmed it secured additional funding specifically to bankroll the Simpleshow acquisition, demonstrating strong investor confidence in its strategic direction and growth prospects within the rapidly evolving AI video sector. Conclusion: A Bold Future for AI-Powered Communication The acquisition of Simpleshow by D-ID marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI video generation and digital avatars . By combining Simpleshow’s established B2B client base and video creation expertise with D-ID’s cutting-edge AI technology, the newly merged entity is poised to dominate the enterprise video market. This strategic move not only enhances D-ID’s capabilities and market reach but also accelerates the development of innovative, interactive communication tools that will fundamentally change how businesses train, market, and sell. The future of AI-powered communication looks more dynamic and engaging than ever before.

(Nasdaq: SBET) disclosed on Monday that it had repurchased 1,000,000 shares of its common stock as part of its ongoing buyback program. According to a press statement posted on the company’s website on Tuesday, the purchases were executed at an average price of $16.67 per share, This brings SharpLink’s total repurchases since the start of September to 1,938,450 shares. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the program was first announced in late August by management, who promised it would boost stocks and shareholder value, and encourage more investors to buy SBET “while it is still undervalued.” SharpLink resumes buyback program with no debt In its weekly recap, the company confirmed that no capital was raised through its at-the-market (ATM) facility in the last seven days ending September 14. The repurchases were instead funded directly with available cash. As of Monday, the company had reported no outstanding debt obligations and reported a net asset value (NAV) of $3.86 billion, equal to $18.55 per fully diluted share. Executives noted that future buybacks will continue, but it will depend on market conditions and may be financed using cash generated through staking crypto, operating activities, or other forms of financing. Nearly 100% of SharpLink’s Ethereum holdings are currently staked, garnering over 3,240 ETH in returns, valued at approximately $14,387,019 at current prices. SharpLink has the world’s second-largest corporate Ethereum treasury and has been aggressively adding to its treasury position in recent months. It falls second in the list to BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc, which has 2.15 million ETH tokens, totally valued at over $10 billion. Since launching its ETH-focused treasury strategy on June 2, the company’s holdings have grown to 838,152 ETH, bought at an average price of $3,603 per coin, and is now worth $3.86 billion at current prices. The firm’s ETH concentration ratio rose to 3.97, a gain of more than 98% since early June. The program has also delivered $717,312,476 in unrealized profits since it began investing in ETH. SharpLink’s ETH holdings are almost fully staked, a strategy executives insist is a business model that creates both value for shareholders and credibility for Ether as a treasury asset class. “Ethereum is rapidly emerging as the cornerstone of the digital asset economy, with momentum accelerating as institutions announce tokenization across stocks and funds, regulators provide greater clarity across global markets, and central banks prepare for easing monetary policy,” Joseph Chalom, SharpLink’s Co-Chief Executive Officer told the press earlier today. Management doubles down on stock valuation SharpLink has repeatedly stated that it views its common stock as significantly undervalued, and according to Chalom, the company’s ETH accumulation strategy is directly tied to shareholder returns. “By expanding our ETH concentration, we are reinforcing our commitment to align the long-term interests of SharpLink, Ethereum and our shareholders, while showcasing how digital assets can be responsibly and strategically deployed to drive meaningful value creation,” he added. According to SharpLink’s ETH dashboard , the firm has an ETH net asset value (NAV) of $3.86 billion, and $3.5 billion in market capitalization, with no debt. Its shares have surged by 111% over the twelve months, outpacing both the broader US market index S&P500, which rose 12.5%, and the US hospitality industry, which gained 23.2% in the same period. The pace of gains accelerated in recent months, with the company reporting a 92% rise in its stock price during the last quarter alone. Average daily trading volume for SBET over the past 30 days reached $803.6 million, which shows heightened investor activity. The company’s “ETH Standard Era” metric also recorded a 166.50% increase.

This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a massive move that has captured the attention of investors, traders, and analysts across the globe. Understanding the implications of such a large-scale token burn is crucial for anyone involved in the digital asset space. What Exactly is USDT Burning and Why Does Tether Do It? In essence, a “token burn” refers to the permanent removal of cryptocurrency tokens from circulation. Think of it like a company buying back its own shares and then destroying them to reduce the total supply. When Tether conducts a USDT burning event, they are taking a certain amount of their stablecoin out of existence forever. Tether, the issuer of USDT, primarily conducts these burns for several key reasons: Redemption Management: When users redeem their USDT for fiat currency (like US dollars), Tether often burns the corresponding USDT tokens. This ensures that the circulating supply of USDT remains accurately backed by its reserves. Supply Adjustment: Burns can be part of a broader strategy to manage the overall supply of USDT in the market, aligning it with demand and maintaining its peg to the US dollar. Transparency and Trust: By publicly announcing and executing these burns, Tether aims to demonstrate transparency in its operations and reinforce confidence in USDT’s backing. How Does This Massive USDT Burning Affect the Market? A burn of 2 billion USDT is undeniably substantial. To put it into perspective, this represents a significant chunk of USDT’s total market capitalization. Consequently, such a large USDT burning event can have several ripple effects across the crypto ecosystem. Firstly, reducing the supply of USDT could theoretically impact its liquidity. However, given USDT’s vast market presence, this specific burn is more likely a reflection of market dynamics rather than a forced reduction. Moreover, a decreased supply, while demand remains constant, could subtly reinforce USDT’s peg to the dollar, demonstrating Tether’s commitment to maintaining its stability. Is 2 Billion USDT Burning a Regular Occurrence for Tether? While Tether regularly conducts token burns, a single event involving 2 billion USDT is indeed noteworthy. Smaller burns happen frequently as part of their redemption process. However, events of this magnitude often correspond with large-scale redemptions by institutional players or strategic treasury adjustments. Whale Alert, the reporting entity, plays a vital role in bringing these large movements to public attention. Their tracking services provide valuable insights into the flow of significant amounts of cryptocurrency, helping the community stay informed about major on-chain activities like this considerable USDT burning . What Should USDT Holders Understand About This Event? For most USDT holders, this burn is a positive sign of a well-managed stablecoin. It signals that Tether is actively managing its supply in response to market redemptions, which is a core function for any stablecoin aiming to maintain its peg. It reinforces the operational integrity of USDT. Therefore, rather than a cause for concern, this event should be viewed as an indication of Tether’s ongoing efforts to ensure the stability and reliability of its token. Staying informed through official announcements and reputable trackers like Whale Alert remains the best practice for all crypto participants. The recent 2 billion USDT burning event, as reported by Whale Alert, underscores the dynamic nature of stablecoin management. It highlights Tether’s active role in maintaining the integrity of USDT by adjusting its supply in response to market redemptions. Such significant burns are not merely technical adjustments; they are crucial actions that reinforce transparency and stability within the broader cryptocurrency landscape, ensuring USDT continues to serve its vital function as a cornerstone of the digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a token burn in cryptocurrency? A1: A token burn is the process of permanently removing cryptocurrency tokens from circulation. This is typically done by sending them to an unspendable address, making them inaccessible and reducing the total supply. Q2: Why did Tether burn 2 billion USDT? A2: Tether typically burns USDT to manage its circulating supply, primarily in response to large redemptions where users exchange their USDT back for fiat currency. This ensures the remaining USDT supply remains fully backed by Tether’s reserves. Q3: Does USDT burning make USDT more valuable? A3: While reducing supply can theoretically increase value, USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Its value is intended to remain at $1. Token burns reinforce this peg by ensuring the circulating supply matches the reserves, thereby maintaining stability rather than increasing its dollar value. Q4: How can I track USDT burning events? A4: You can track USDT burning events through blockchain explorers, which show transactions to burn addresses. Services like Whale Alert also monitor and report significant on-chain movements, including large token burns. Q5: Is this a common practice for stablecoins? A5: Yes, token burning is a common and essential practice for many stablecoins, including USDT. It is a key mechanism for managing supply and maintaining the stablecoin’s peg to its underlying asset (e.g., the US dollar). Q6: What is the significance of Whale Alert reporting this? A6: Whale Alert is a prominent blockchain tracker that reports large cryptocurrency transactions. Their report confirms the authenticity and scale of the 2 billion USDT burn, providing independent verification to the crypto community.

From anonymous signups and instant crypto purchases to original blockchain-only games, these platforms are rolling out features that feel built for today’s players rather than yesterday’s models. Anonymous Play and No-KYC Models One of the biggest shifts in crypto gambling this year is the rise of casinos that don’t ask players to go through lengthy verification checks. Instead of uploading IDs or proof of address, many platforms now let people register with just an email and a connected wallet. Best no KYC crypto casinos for US players give gamblers a chance to play without handing over sensitive personal data. They offer a faster way to start, greater privacy, and a smoother overall experience for those who value discretion just as much as convenience. Direct Crypto On-Ramps Alongside anonymous signups, casinos are now adding direct crypto on-ramps . That means players can buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins on the same site where they gamble. No need to switch over to an exchange, make a purchase, and then transfer funds back. This step is especially useful for newcomers. For someone who hasn’t dealt with crypto before, being able to handle both purchase and play in one place removes a major hurdle. Blockchain-Exclusive Games The games themselves are starting to look different, too. Instead of sticking to slots and classic tables, crypto casinos are rolling out titles that only make sense in a blockchain setting. Crash – a fast-paced betting game where players try to cash out before the line drops. Plinko – modeled after the pegboard concept, with adjustable risk levels. Limbo – a prediction-based game with quick, simple mechanics. Instant Win Scratch-Offs – designed for quick play, often on mobile. What sets these apart is transparency. Built with provably fair mechanics, the outcomes can be verified directly on the blockchain. This kind of openness is becoming a defining standard for blockchain in the gambling industry , and it’s something traditional online casinos rarely provide. Expanded Features and Rewards The broader experience is getting sharper, too. Beyond anonymity and exclusive games, these casinos are introducing: Huge libraries of slots, live dealer games, and RNG-based tables. Large welcome offers and cashback for regular players. Instant deposits and withdrawals thanks to blockchain settlement. Support for a wide range of coins, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to Solana, USDT, and even privacy-focused tokens. Mobile-friendly platforms that sync easily with crypto wallets. Responsible gambling tools, which are beginning to show up even in anonymous setups. The combination of speed, privacy, and choice is creating a very different kind of online gambling environment compared to even a few years ago. Industry Impact These updates highlight how quickly crypto gambling is developing. Anonymous accounts reduce friction, integrated on-ramps simplify the first step into crypto, and blockchain-native games create a style of play that feels fresh. At the same time, instant payouts and wide coin support keep things practical. It’s a mix of privacy, accessibility, and transparency that shows where the industry is heading in 2025, and why more players are giving these new casinos a closer look.

This significant event, where such a large volume of USDT burned from circulation, naturally sparks questions about its implications. What does it mean for the world’s largest stablecoin, and how does it affect the broader crypto market? What Exactly Happens When USDT is Burned? When we talk about tokens being ‘burned,’ it might sound dramatic, but it is a standard and often beneficial process in the crypto world. Essentially, burning a cryptocurrency means permanently removing a certain number of tokens from circulation. This is done by sending them to an inaccessible wallet address, often called a ‘burner’ address, where they can never be retrieved or spent again. Permanent Removal: Once tokens are burned, they are gone forever. Supply Reduction: Burning reduces the total circulating supply of a cryptocurrency. Mechanism: Tether, through its Treasury, initiates these burns typically in response to user redemptions. The recent report of 2 billion USDT burned signifies a substantial reduction in the token’s active supply. Why Did Tether Burn 2 Billion USDT? Tether’s primary reason for burning USDT tokens is to manage its circulating supply in response to market demand. When users redeem their USDT for fiat currency (like US dollars) directly from Tether, the company takes those USDT tokens out of circulation to maintain the 1:1 peg. This process ensures that the total supply of USDT accurately reflects the reserves held by Tether. Think of it this way: If many users decide to cash out their USDT, Tether receives those tokens back. To prevent an oversupply of USDT that is not backed by reserves, Tether then burns the returned tokens. This massive 2 billion USDT burned event indicates significant redemptions have taken place, showcasing Tether’s commitment to maintaining its peg and managing its reserves responsibly. What Does This Massive USDT Burn Mean for the Market? A significant USDT burned event like this has several implications for the crypto market and Tether’s ecosystem. Primarily, it signals healthy operational activity and reinforces the stablecoin’s mechanism for maintaining its value. Here are some key takeaways: Maintaining the Peg: Burning tokens helps Tether uphold its 1:1 peg with the US dollar by ensuring that only backed tokens are in circulation. Market Confidence: Such actions can instill confidence among users, demonstrating that Tether actively manages its supply to match demand and redemptions. Reduced Supply: With 2 billion USDT burned , the total circulating supply decreases, which can, in theory, contribute to the stability and scarcity of the remaining tokens. While 2 billion USDT might seem like an enormous figure, it is crucial to remember that Tether often conducts these burns, and they are a vital part of its operational framework. In conclusion, the report from Whale Alert regarding the 2 billion USDT burned at the Tether Treasury is not a cause for alarm but rather a demonstration of Tether’s ongoing efforts to manage its stablecoin supply effectively. It underscores the operational integrity of the stablecoin, ensuring that its value remains stable and reliable for its users. This continuous adjustment of supply through burning is a fundamental aspect of how Tether maintains its crucial role in the cryptocurrency landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDT? USDT is a stablecoin issued by Tether, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. It is widely used in the cryptocurrency market for trading, remittances, and as a stable store of value. Why does Tether burn tokens? Tether burns tokens primarily to reduce the circulating supply of USDT in response to user redemptions. When users convert their USDT back into fiat currency, Tether removes those tokens from circulation to ensure that every USDT in existence is backed by an equivalent amount of reserves. Is burning USDT good or bad for the market? Generally, burning USDT is considered a good and necessary process. It signifies that Tether is actively managing its supply to maintain its peg and ensures transparency and stability in the stablecoin’s operations. It is a sign of healthy market dynamics. How does Whale Alert know about USDT burns? Whale Alert is a blockchain tracking service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions on various networks.

Following a 23.8% gain over the past 60 days, traders began locking in profits, cooling bullish sentiment and shifting focus back to support levels. Market perception is shaped not only by technicals but also by how stories are told. Just as ETF outflows or whale accumulation can shift sentiment overnight, effective PR plays a key role in guiding narratives. Agencies like Outset PR specialize in ensuring that crypto projects remain visible and strategically positioned, even when headlines focus on volatility. Technical Breakdown: Neutral Signals, Rising Risk Source: coinmarketcap The 4-hour RSI sits at 55.33, reflecting neutral momentum after retreating from higher levels earlier in the week. Meanwhile, the MACD remains in positive territory but is narrowing, suggesting fading bullish momentum and the potential for a near-term consolidation. Resistance: ETH faced rejection at $4,509 (50% Fib). Immediate support: $4,255 (78.6% Fib) now acts as the critical level. Stop-loss trigger: A sustained close below $4,255 could activate sell orders and accelerate downside pressure. This structure shows ETH at a crossroads: it must defend $4,255 to avoid deeper retracements, with $4,100 and $3,950 as lower targets if selling intensifies. Derivatives Market: Leverage Builds, Funding Cools The derivatives landscape adds another layer of complexity. ETH futures open interest surged to $926 billion, up 17.96% month-over-month. Elevated leverage suggests traders are positioning aggressively, increasing the risk of forced liquidations if prices swing. At the same time, average funding rates cooled to +0.0064%, showing that bullish speculation has moderated compared to previous weeks. Still, the imbalance between high open interest and cooling funding points to fragile positioning. Sentiment Drivers: ETF Outflows and Whale Accumulation Beyond charts and derivatives, market sentiment has been shaped by concerns over dated ETF outflows, which added to the cautious tone among traders. Yet, beneath the surface, long-term players continue to accumulate. In the past week alone, Ethereum whales added 138,000 ETH (~$500M) to their holdings, signaling confidence in Ethereum’s long-term trajectory despite short-term volatility. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s new privacy roadmap—focused on modular upgrades and scaling private transactions—provides an additional fundamental tailwind that could attract both retail and institutional interest over time. Short-Term vs. Mid-Term Outlook Short-Term: Profit-taking, ETF outflow concerns, and high leverage create a fragile setup. ETH must hold $4,255 support to prevent cascading liquidations. Mid-Term: Whale accumulation and Ethereum’s privacy roadmap highlight underlying strength, suggesting any near-term pullback could present a re-entry opportunity. Beyond Technicals: Why Narrative Control Matters Ethereum’s recent cooling phase shows how quickly sentiment can flip when traders take profits or derivatives markets overheat. For crypto projects, this underscores the importance of narrative clarity—ensuring that their milestones, roadmaps, and growth stories aren’t drowned out by market noise. This is where Outset PR makes the difference. Rather than relying on cookie-cutter outreach, Outset PR builds tailored, data-driven campaigns that align with product-market fit and deliver measurable visibility. Its proprietary traffic acquisition system merges organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation, helping clients capture multiples more traffic than traditional PR. Example: Outset PR drove a 40% sustained boost in reach for ChangeNOW by amplifying coverage through a large-scale Google Discover campaign. Example: With Step App, Outset PR’s targeted media analytics boosted engagement in key markets like the U.S. and U.K. By combining timing, precision, and performance-driven media selection, Outset PR ensures that crypto projects stay relevant and visible—even in volatile conditions like Ethereum is experiencing now. Conclusion Ethereum’s dip reflects a natural pause after a strong rally. Technical rejection at $4,509, combined with profit-taking, ETF outflow concerns, and high leverage, has weighed on short-term momentum. Yet whale accumulation and the privacy roadmap point to mid-term resilience. For projects navigating similar cycles, the lesson is clear: visibility and timing matter as much as fundamentals. With Outset PR’s bespoke strategies and proprietary tools, crypto businesses can transform volatility into an opportunity to strengthen their market presence.

Make sure to deposit your tokens into networks supported by Kraken. Deposits made using other networks will be lost. Trade on Kraken Here’s some more information about this asset : STBL (STBL) STBL is an RWA-backed stablecoin protocol that uses a yield-splitting mechanism to turn yield-bearing assets into liquid dollar-stable tokens. Users deposit high-quality RWAs (like tokenized treasuries or money-market funds), receive USST as a stablecoin and keep a separate yield claim. This lets them unlock and reuse their principal without losing yield — spending or deploying USST like USDT/USDC, reinvesting into RWAs for compounded returns or participating in DeFi strategies –while the protocol channels collateral growth into scalable, liquid stablecoin supply. Please note: Trading via Kraken App and Instant Buy will be available once the liquidity conditions are met (when a sufficient number of buyers and sellers have entered the market for their orders to be efficiently matched).

This monumental rise is more than just a number; it reflects a fascinating interplay of global economic forces and investor sentiment. For those tracking market trends, this surge in the Gold Price signals significant shifts. What exactly is propelling this precious metal to such dazzling heights, and what does it mean for your investments and the broader economic landscape? What’s Fueling the Astonishing Gold Price Surge? Several powerful factors are converging to drive the Gold Price upwards. Understanding these elements is crucial for grasping the current market dynamics. Inflationary Pressures: Persistent global inflation concerns mean that currencies lose purchasing power over time. Investors often flock to gold as a hedge, seeing it as a reliable store of value when traditional money depreciates. Geopolitical Uncertainties: Ongoing conflicts and political instability worldwide create an environment of risk aversion. In such times, gold’s status as a safe-haven asset shines, leading to increased demand and, consequently, a higher Gold Price . Central Bank Purchases: Central banks globally have been significant buyers of gold, diversifying their reserves away from traditional currencies. This institutional demand provides a strong foundational support for the metal’s valuation. Weakening US Dollar: As the US dollar weakens against other major currencies, gold, which is typically priced in dollars, becomes more attractive to international buyers. This makes the Gold Price more affordable in other currencies, boosting demand. Understanding the Historical Context of the Gold Price Gold has held a unique position in human history, often serving as a universal currency and a symbol of wealth. Its role as a store of value has been tested through countless economic cycles, and it consistently emerges as a reliable asset. Historically, the Gold Price has seen significant peaks during periods of economic distress or high inflation, such as the late 1970s or the 2008 financial crisis. The current surge to $3,700 an ounce surpasses all previous records, including the highs seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. This demonstrates the market’s current assessment of gold’s enduring value in uncertain times. This sustained upward trajectory highlights a renewed confidence in physical assets. It also reflects a broader shift in how investors perceive long-term wealth preservation in a volatile global economy. Gold Price as a Safe Haven: Investor Insights For many investors, gold is not just a commodity; it is a critical component of a resilient portfolio. It offers distinct advantages, but also presents unique considerations. Benefits of Investing in Gold: Portfolio Diversification: Gold often moves independently of stocks and bonds, providing a valuable diversification tool that can reduce overall portfolio risk. Hedge Against Inflation: As discussed, gold typically maintains its value, or even appreciates, during inflationary periods, protecting purchasing power. Protection Against Currency Devaluation: When fiat currencies lose value, gold’s intrinsic worth can offer a safeguard. Challenges to Consider: No Yield: Unlike bonds or dividend stocks, gold does not generate income. Its value comes solely from price appreciation. Storage Costs: Physical gold requires secure storage, which can incur costs. Volatility: While often seen as stable, the Gold Price can experience short-term fluctuations based on market sentiment and economic data. Therefore, understanding your investment goals and risk tolerance is essential before allocating funds to gold. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for the Gold Price? The question on everyone’s mind is whether the Gold Price can maintain this upward momentum. Market analysts offer a range of perspectives, but several key indicators will likely influence its future trajectory. Interest Rate Decisions: Future interest rate hikes or cuts by central banks will significantly impact the dollar’s strength and, consequently, gold’s appeal. Higher rates typically make non-yielding assets like gold less attractive. Geopolitical Developments: Any escalation or de-escalation of global conflicts will directly affect demand for safe-haven assets. Inflation Outlook: If inflation persists or accelerates, it will likely continue to support a strong Gold Price . Conversely, a significant cooling of inflation could temper its rise. Investors should stay informed about global economic indicators and geopolitical events. While the allure of gold is undeniable, a balanced approach to investment is always recommended. The astonishing surge of the Gold Price past $3,700 an ounce marks a pivotal moment in financial markets. It underscores gold’s enduring role as a beacon of stability amidst economic uncertainty and geopolitical turbulence. This new all-time high is not just a record; it is a testament to gold’s intrinsic value and its powerful appeal as a safe haven asset. As we navigate an ever-changing global landscape, the shining luster of gold continues to captivate investors and shape financial discussions worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions About the Gold Price Q1: Why is the Gold Price currently rising so significantly? A1: The current surge in the Gold Price is primarily driven by factors like persistent global inflation concerns, increasing geopolitical uncertainties, strong buying by central banks, and a weakening US dollar, all of which enhance gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset. Q2: Is gold a good investment in the current market climate? A2: Many experts consider gold a valuable asset for portfolio diversification and a hedge against inflation and economic instability. However, its suitability depends on individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and the overall balance of your portfolio. Gold does not offer yield, so its value comes from price appreciation. Q3: How do geopolitical tensions affect the Gold Price? A3: Geopolitical tensions, such as international conflicts or political instability, typically increase demand for safe-haven assets. Investors often move funds into gold during these times, perceiving it as a more secure store of value, which pushes the Gold Price higher. Q4: What is “spot gold”? A4: Spot gold refers to the current market price at which gold can be bought or sold for immediate delivery. It reflects the real-time supply and demand dynamics in the global market, as opposed to future contracts. Q5: Will the Gold Price continue to increase indefinitely? A5: While the Gold Price has reached an all-time high, predicting its indefinite increase is challenging. Its future trajectory will depend on evolving economic conditions, central bank policies, inflation rates, and geopolitical stability. Like any asset, gold can experience fluctuations.

The price has been fluctuating in a relatively tight range, showing resilience but also failing to establish a clear directional trend. For many traders, this period feels like the calm before a potential breakout, as the market sits at what analysts describe as a pivotal setting. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Above $115K As Market Eyes Fed’s Sept 17 Policy Move While short-term traders navigate intraday moves, long-term investors are focusing on structural signals that could define Bitcoin’s next phase. Top analyst Maartunn recently highlighted a significant on-chain dynamic: dormant whale coins are increasingly moving, and these transfers appear closely connected to recent price swings. Historically, such movements have often preceded stronger market reactions, either reinforcing bullish momentum or triggering corrective phases. This alignment between dormant whale activity and price volatility is fueling speculation that a decisive move may be imminent. With Bitcoin consolidating near critical levels, the coming days could set the tone for whether BTC attempts another push toward its highs or corrects further. Dormant Bitcoin Movements Align With Fed Decision According to onchain analyst Maartunn, a remarkable event just unfolded: 7,547 BTC aged between 3–5 years have moved onchain. This is no small occurrence, as coins of this age bracket are often considered firmly in the hands of long-term holders. Their sudden activity has historically acted as a precursor to major market moves. Maartunn emphasizes that investors should carefully note how this metric has consistently aligned with sharp price reactions in recent months. In his analysis, Maartunn presents data showing that every time this specific group of dormant coins becomes active, the Bitcoin market reacts with significant volatility. These swings can be bullish or bearish, but the common denominator is that they rarely go unnoticed. Essentially, when whales who have held coins for several years begin moving them, it signals strategic repositioning that tends to ripple across the broader market. This latest movement coincides with one of the most pivotal macroeconomic events of the year—the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, scheduled for this week. The Fed’s choice, whether to cut rates by 25bps or 50bps, will dictate investor sentiment across all risk assets. For Bitcoin, the timing of dormant whale activity could amplify the impact of this decision, potentially setting the stage for a massive price swing in the days ahead. With BTC consolidating around $115K, the convergence of long-term whale moves and macroeconomic uncertainty underscores the fragility of the current market structure. Traders and investors alike are bracing for what could be the beginning of Bitcoin’s next decisive trend, fueled by both on-chain signals and global monetary policy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Trading Volumes Decline To $322B: Market Shifts To HODL Mode Technical Analysis: Testing Resistance Levels The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin consolidating around $115,555, with the price holding above both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, currently at $114,341 and $112,378, respectively. This setup indicates short-term bullish momentum, as BTC managed to defend higher lows after its September rebound. The next major resistance lies near $116,000, where sellers are actively defending. A breakout above this zone could open the path toward the key $123,217 resistance, last tested in mid-August. However, repeated failures to clear $116K increase the risk of short-term exhaustion, especially with uncertainty ahead of tomorrow’s Fed rate decision.

Losing this level could push BTC back toward $112,000, where both the 100-day SMA and prior demand clusters converge. As long as BTC holds above $112K, the broader structure remains constructive.

While players sometimes benefit from loyalty points or occasional cashback offers, the core system has consistently ensured that casinos retain the upper hand. Spartans are now changing that dynamic. With 10% CASHRAKE , every bet earns rewards for the player, win or lose. This isn’t a short-term promotion or marketing gimmick; it’s a complete structural overhaul of the traditional casino model. By offering rakeback on every wager and cashback on all losses, Spartans is redefining fairness and positioning itself as a pioneer in the next era of online gambling. Leaving the Old Reward System Behind For decades, gambling platforms leaned on bonuses, deposit matches, and limited cashback programs to create the illusion of value. The reality was different. High wagering requirements, expiration dates, and selective eligibility meant most users never saw real returns. Spartans’ 10% CASHRAKE removes those conditions entirely. Rewards are built into every wager. Players don’t need to chase VIP tiers or wait for payout cycles. Value is real-time, transparent, and automatic. That shift moves online gambling from occasional perks to structural fairness. Instant Rewards That Actually Matter What separates 10% CASHRAKE is not just the numbers, but the immediacy of delivery. Traditional cashback might take days to arrive, often in bonus credits with restrictions. Spartans pays rakeback and cashback in real crypto, credited instantly to user accounts. This constant flow of rewards changes the rhythm of play. Every spin, every card, every sports ticket carries a guaranteed return, softening the risk and creating trust in ways promotions never could. The message is clear: players are valued in real time, not just when marketing campaigns say so. Redefining What “Fair Play” Means Regulators ensure that games are not rigged, but economic fairness has rarely been addressed in online gambling. Spartans takes that missing piece and builds it into the foundation of its platform. By giving something back on every outcome, 10% CASHRAKE changes how risk feels. Losses no longer feel final. Wins feel enhanced. The result is an environment where play becomes more sustainable, trust builds naturally, and users see the casino as a partner instead of an opponent. A Model Competitors Can’t Ignore Industry trends show that once one innovation changes expectations, competitors rush to copy it. Live betting, odds boosts, and mobile-first design all followed that path. 10% CASHRAKE is on track to do the same. Spartans will always hold the advantage of being first. It will be remembered not only as the operator that launched 10% CASHRAKE , but as the one that dared to make fairness structural. Rival casinos may attempt similar systems, but Spartans has already secured the credit as the innovator that set the benchmark. Crypto Integration That Proves Its Value Spartans has always highlighted its crypto-friendly approach, but 10% CASHRAKE turns that promise into tangible utility. The speed of blockchain transactions now matches the speed of rewards. Deposits are instant, gameplay is seamless, and rakeback and cashback arrive without delay. Unlike fiat-based casinos, where withdrawals can drag on for days, Spartans shows how crypto and fairness combine to create a modern betting experience. To make it even more attractive, new users also receive a 300% welcome bonus, adding extra fuel to the first play session. Spartans’ 10% CASHRAKE Sets New Fairness Standard Spartans’ launch of 10% CASHRAKE is more than a feature update. It’s a signal that the relationship between casinos and players can be rebalanced. Every wager carries guaranteed value, creating fairness that has long been missing from the industry. As the model gains attention, competitors will try to replicate it. But Spartans has already set the standard and proven that fairness can be built into the DNA of a casino. For anyone watching where online gambling is headed, the answer is clear: Spartans’ 10% CASHRAKE is the blueprint for the future.

51829036,582085,1758038444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51829036.jpeg,Bitcoin Treasury Grows As Capital B Makes Strategic Acquisition: Bullish Market Outlook Still Lingers,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-treasury-grows/,"With Bitcoin’s price above the $115,000 level and gradually moving towards its all-time high, it appears that accumulation among retail and institutional investors is still heavily ongoing. An area where this notable accumulation is widely present is the BTC treasury strategy, which many big companies are significantly adopting. Large Institutions Still Doubling Down On Bitcoin As the current bull market cycle progresses, Bitcoin, the crypto king, remains the top digital asset among prominent figures and institutions in the ever-dynamic financial sector. This trend, which initially began on a small scale, has gone worldwide. In the midst of this growing recognition, a Bitcoin treasury strategy has gained mainstream attention and adoption. Since the first move toward owning a BTC treasury reserve, initiated by Michael Saylor ’s Strategy, many large firms around the world have followed suit. A recent report shows that Capital B, a Europe-based private equity and investment advisory firm, has taken a decisive step into the crypto space with its BTC treasury. The firm, recognized as the first BTC treasury company in Europe, recently announced a strategic BTC purchase aimed at bolstering its growing crypto reserve. This robust adoption of the initiative since its introduction signals heightened institutional conviction in the flagship asset’s long-term value and potential. It also underscores the expanding pattern of organizations aggressively increasing their BTC reserves as a long-term tactic to maintain value and fortify balance sheets. In the announcement shared by Alexandre Laizet, the board director of BTC treasury at Capital B, it was revealed that the company has made a strategic purchase of 48 BTC. According to the director, the 48 BTC valued at approximately €4.7 million were purchased at €98,575 per coin. With this fresh buy, Capital B has strengthened its position as one of the companies that is reaffirming its belief that BTC is a vital component of modern financial stability. Following the crucial move, the company has experienced a substantial yield of 1,536.6% Year-to-Date (YTD), and a 19.4% Quarter-to-Date (QTD). As of September 15, 2025, Capital B’s holdings boast 2,249 BTC worth a whopping €206.3 million, which was purchased at €91,718 per coin. Capital B’s Sats Per Share Exponential Growth It is worth noting that Capital B has experienced its sats per share climb sharply amid its Bitcoin acquisition. Over the past 10 months, the firm’s sats per share moved from 17 to 671, reflecting a spike in investor returns tied directly to BTC’s price action. This increase demonstrates the company’s rising exposure to BTC , underscoring the potential for institutional adoption to transform conventional metrics of equity growth. Furthermore, it indicates the growing effectiveness of its treasury strategy in generating value for shareholders. According to Alexandre Laizet, Capital B’s focus since November 2024 is highly directed at BTC Yield Maximization. In addition to yield maximization, the company’s move is accompanied by its long-term vision of creating the first and largest BTC treasury company in Europe. Such an achievement will allow Capital B to lead as a cornerstone of Digital Capital Markets.",Bitcoin News|Alexandre Laizet|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Treasury|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Capital B|Digital Capital Markets|michael saylor|QTD|Quarter-to-Date|Sats Per Share|Strategy|Year-To-Date|YTD,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-16 16:00:44

By 2028, the price is projected to reach $9.26 By 2031, FIL may reach $28.57. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to securely and efficiently store humanity’s most important information. Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure.

The price is currently around $2.43, holding above the mid-Bollinger Band at $2.39, suggesting an attempt to reclaim momentum. The RSI at 52.38 indicates neutral sentiment, leaning slightly bullish as it recovers from oversold territory. If FIL sustains above $2.39, it could push toward resistance at $2.60, while failure to hold support risks a drop toward $2.18. MACD remains mildly positive, hinting at potential upward continuation, but the broader trend requires stronger confirmation before a decisive breakout. Caution with volatility is advised. Filecoin price analysis 4-hour chart analysis FILUSD chart by TradingView Filecoin (FIL) on the 4-hour chart shows a mild recovery attempt after recent selling pressure. The price trades at $2.43, testing the mid-Bollinger Band near $2.50, which serves as short-term resistance. MACD remains negative, though bearish momentum is easing, while the Balance of Power at 0.21 suggests weak buying activity. If bulls manage to push above $2.50, a move toward $2.66 is possible; otherwise, rejection could see FIL retesting support at $2.33 and $2.18. Overall, the chart signals cautious optimism, but sustained strength is needed to confirm a shift from bearish consolidation into a potential upward breakout.

For FIL to reach $100 again, it would need strong institutional adoption, increased demand for decentralized storage solutions, and a broader crypto bull market.

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic space, full of innovation and significant price movements. Among its leading assets, Binance Coin (BNB) stands out, not just as a trading token but as the backbone of one of the largest crypto ecosystems. Investors and enthusiasts often ask: what does the future hold for BNB? Specifically, can we expect the Binance Coin Price Prediction to reach the ambitious $1000 mark by 2030? This comprehensive article delves into the potential trajectory of BNB, exploring various factors that could influence its value in the coming years. The Ascent of Binance Coin: Understanding BNB’s Foundation Binance Coin, or BNB, began its journey as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain during an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2017. Its primary purpose was to offer discounted trading fees on the Binance exchange. Since then, BNB has evolved considerably, migrating to its own blockchain, the Binance Chain, and later becoming the native coin of the BNB Smart Chain (BSC), a highly popular network for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. The utility of BNB extends far beyond simple fee discounts. It is used for: Paying transaction fees on the BNB Chain and BSC. Participating in token sales on Binance Launchpad. Staking for network security and governance. Making payments to various merchants. Accessing exclusive features within the Binance ecosystem. This wide range of applications solidifies BNB’s position as a utility token central to a vast and growing ecosystem. Understanding its foundational strength is crucial for any meaningful Binance Coin Analysis . Navigating the Landscape of Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Predicting cryptocurrency prices is complex. Unlike traditional financial assets, digital currencies are influenced by a unique set of factors, often leading to rapid and significant shifts. While no prediction is guaranteed, a thorough analysis can provide informed perspectives. Our BNB Price Forecast considers both historical data and future market dynamics. Key elements that impact crypto prices include: Market sentiment and investor psychology. Regulatory developments across different jurisdictions. Technological advancements and upgrades within the blockchain network. Macroeconomic conditions and global financial trends. Competition from other cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms. These factors collectively shape the market environment in which BNB operates, making its price trajectory a subject of constant speculation and analysis. Unpacking the Historical Performance of BNB BNB’s journey has been marked by periods of remarkable growth and consolidation. After its ICO at approximately $0.10, BNB experienced significant appreciation, especially during bull markets. It has consistently ranked among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, reflecting its strong ecosystem and user base. Key historical milestones: 2017 ICO: Launched at a low price, offering early investors substantial returns. 2019 Migration: Moved to its native Binance Chain, increasing its independence. 2021 Bull Run: Reached an all-time high, driven by the overall crypto market surge and the growth of BSC. Regular Burn Events: Binance periodically conducts token burns, reducing BNB supply and potentially increasing its scarcity and value. This historical context is vital for understanding the resilience and growth potential that inform our Binance Coin Price Prediction for future years. What Drives the Future of BNB? The long-term success and price appreciation of BNB are closely tied to the expansion and adoption of the Binance ecosystem. The Future of BNB depends on several interconnected factors: Binance Ecosystem Growth: The continuous development of Binance’s various platforms, including Binance Exchange, BNB Chain, Binance Labs, and Binance Launchpad, directly impacts BNB’s utility. As more users engage with these services, demand for BNB tends to increase. BNB Chain Development: The BNB Smart Chain (BSC) has become a significant player in the DeFi and NFT sectors due to its low transaction fees and high throughput. Further enhancements, scalability solutions, and developer adoption on BSC will bolster BNB’s value. Token Burn Mechanism: Binance regularly conducts quarterly BNB burns, permanently removing tokens from circulation. This deflationary mechanism is designed to reduce supply over time, which, if demand remains stable or grows, can lead to price appreciation. Strategic Partnerships and Integrations: New collaborations with businesses, dApps, and other blockchain projects expand BNB’s reach and utility beyond the immediate Binance ecosystem. These drivers collectively contribute to the fundamental value proposition of BNB, shaping its potential trajectory. Crucial Factors for Binance Coin Analysis A comprehensive Binance Coin Analysis must consider external and internal factors that could influence its market behavior. These elements create a complex interplay that determines price movements: Regulatory Landscape: Global cryptocurrency regulations are constantly evolving. Favorable regulations could boost adoption and legitimacy, while restrictive measures could pose challenges. Binance, as a centralized entity, is particularly susceptible to regulatory shifts. Overall Crypto Market Trends: BNB’s price often correlates with the broader cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin’s performance. A general bull market tends to lift most altcoins, including BNB, while bear markets can exert downward pressure. Competition: BNB faces competition from other smart contract platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, which also host dApps and offer various utilities. The ability of BNB Chain to innovate and maintain its competitive edge is important. Technological Advancements: Continuous upgrades to the BNB Chain, such as improved scalability, security features, and interoperability, are critical for maintaining its relevance and attracting developers and users. Security and Trust: As a major player, Binance and the BNB Chain must uphold high security standards. Any major security breach or trust issue could severely impact BNB’s reputation and price. These factors underscore the need for continuous monitoring and adaptation in the dynamic crypto space. BNB Price Forecast 2025: A Near-Term Outlook Looking ahead to 2025, several elements will shape the BNB Price Forecast . The crypto market tends to operate in cycles, and 2025 could see the lingering effects of a potential post-halving bull run for Bitcoin, which often benefits altcoins like BNB. In the near term, we might observe: Continued Ecosystem Expansion: Binance’s ongoing efforts to grow its user base and introduce new products and services will likely fuel demand for BNB. Increased DeFi and NFT Activity: The BNB Smart Chain’s role in decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens is expected to grow, driving transaction volume and utility for BNB. Regulatory Clarity: While a double-edged sword, increasing regulatory clarity in major economies could provide a more stable environment for crypto investments, potentially attracting institutional capital into BNB. Given these factors, a conservative Binance Coin Price Prediction for 2025 could see BNB trading in a range between $400 and $700. Optimistic scenarios, driven by strong market momentum and significant ecosystem developments, could push it higher, potentially testing previous all-time highs. Mid-Term Projections: Binance Coin Price Prediction 2026-2027 Moving into the mid-term, the years 2026 and 2027 will likely be crucial for BNB’s sustained growth. The market might enter a phase of consolidation or continue an upward trend, depending on global economic conditions and broader crypto adoption. Our Binance Coin Price Prediction for this period considers several key developments. Factors influencing this period include: Technological Maturation: Further advancements in scalability, security, and interoperability for the BNB Chain could solidify its position as a leading blockchain. Global Economic Landscape: Interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events will play a significant role. A more stable global economy could encourage greater investment in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Institutional Adoption: Increased participation from institutional investors in the crypto market could bring substantial capital into BNB, driving up its price. For 2026, BNB could potentially range from $600 to $900. By 2027, with consistent growth and favorable market conditions, BNB might consolidate above the $800 mark, with peaks potentially reaching $1100-$1200 in very bullish scenarios. This period sets the stage for whether the BNB $1000 Target becomes a consistent reality. The Long Road to 2030: Will BNB Hit the $1000 Target? The question of whether BNB can reach and sustain a price of $1000 by 2030 is a central point of interest. A long-term Binance Coin Price Prediction requires considering sustained innovation, market maturity, and the overall growth of the digital economy. By 2030, the cryptocurrency market is expected to be significantly larger and more integrated into mainstream finance. For BNB to reach the BNB $1000 Target , it would need: Dominant Ecosystem: The Binance ecosystem must maintain or expand its dominant position in the crypto industry, continually attracting new users and developers. Mass Adoption: Widespread adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions and services would significantly increase demand for utility tokens like BNB. Favorable Regulatory Environment: A globally harmonized and supportive regulatory framework would reduce uncertainty and foster growth. Continued Deflationary Pressure: The ongoing BNB burn mechanism, coupled with increasing demand, would create a strong supply-demand dynamic favoring price appreciation. If these conditions materialize, a price of $1000 for BNB by 2030 is not only plausible but could be a conservative estimate in highly optimistic scenarios. Some analyses even project BNB to surpass this, potentially reaching $1500 or higher, driven by extreme scarcity and utility. Addressing the BNB $1000 Target: A Deep Dive Achieving the BNB $1000 Target involves more than just market sentiment; it requires fundamental growth. Let’s examine the specifics that could drive BNB to this milestone. Consider the following: Market Capitalization: To reach $1000, BNB’s market capitalization would need to grow significantly. If the circulating supply remains around current levels (approximately 150 million tokens), a $1000 price would imply a market cap of roughly $150 billion. This is a substantial figure but achievable in a maturing crypto market, especially considering that Bitcoin and Ethereum have already reached much higher valuations. Increased Utility and Demand: The more use cases BNB has, the higher the demand. If Binance expands into new markets, offers more innovative products, and the BNB Chain becomes even more dominant for dApps, the intrinsic value of BNB will increase. Comparative Growth: When compared to other major cryptocurrencies, BNB has shown strong performance. If the overall crypto market doubles or triples in size by 2030, it is reasonable to expect leading altcoins like BNB to experience proportional or even outsized growth due to network effects and established utility. While challenges exist, the path to $1000 for BNB is certainly within the realm of possibility, provided the ecosystem continues its robust development and the broader market remains bullish. Challenges and Roadblocks for Binance Coin’s Growth Despite its potential, BNB faces several challenges that could impact its Binance Coin Price Prediction and hinder its journey to $1000: Regulatory Scrutiny: Binance, as the largest centralized exchange, is frequently under the microscope of global regulators. Any significant adverse regulatory action could severely impact BNB’s price and utility. Centralization Concerns: While the BNB Chain offers some decentralization, its close ties to Binance lead to concerns about centralization. This can be a point of criticism from parts of the crypto community that prioritize full decentralization. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its extreme price swings. A sudden bear market or a significant FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) event could cause substantial price drops for BNB, delaying its growth targets. Competition: The smart contract platform space is highly competitive. Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades, along with other layer-1 solutions, constantly vie for developer and user attention, posing a threat to BNB Chain’s market share. Security Risks: As a major blockchain and exchange, Binance is a target for cyberattacks. A large-scale security breach could erode user trust and significantly impact BNB’s value. Addressing these challenges effectively will be critical for BNB to realize its full potential. Actionable Insights for Potential BNB Investors For those considering investing in BNB or already holding it, here are some actionable insights based on our Binance Coin Analysis : Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Understand the technology, the team, the market, and the risks involved. Consider Long-Term Potential: Cryptocurrency investments, especially for significant price targets like $1000, often require a long-term perspective. Short-term market fluctuations can be misleading. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio across different assets to mitigate risk. BNB is a promising asset, but it is not without risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with news regarding Binance, BNB Chain developments, regulatory changes, and broader crypto market trends. Information is key in this fast-moving sector. Understand the Ecosystem: The strength of BNB lies in its ecosystem. Familiarize yourself with Binance’s various offerings and how BNB integrates into them. These strategies can help investors navigate the complexities of the crypto market and make more informed choices regarding BNB. Conclusion: The Enduring Potential of Binance Coin The journey of Binance Coin from a simple exchange token to a foundational asset of a vast blockchain ecosystem is remarkable. Our in-depth Binance Coin Price Prediction for 2025-2030 suggests a promising future, with the ambitious BNB $1000 Target appearing increasingly attainable under favorable conditions. The strength of the Binance ecosystem, the ongoing utility of BNB, its deflationary tokenomics, and the continuous innovation on the BNB Chain are powerful drivers. While challenges like regulatory hurdles and market volatility remain, BNB’s track record and strategic positioning provide a strong foundation for future growth. Investors who understand its fundamentals and maintain a long-term outlook may find BNB to be a compelling asset in their portfolio.

The “Times” has resorted to lying about your Favorite President (ME!), my family, my job, the America First Movement, MAGA, and our country as a whole for decades.

This is the largest illegal election aid ever committed.” Stating that the lawsuit was filed in Florida, Trump said that the New York Times' years-long campaign of lies and smear campaign against him had ended. “The New York Times has been allowed to lie, smear, and slander me freely for far too long, and it ends NOW!” *This is not investment advice.

Netherlands: The Critical Hub at Risk “The Netherlands is literally at the heart of global banking,” Barron wrote, noting that one of SWIFT’s only three worldwide data centers is located there. This facility processes all European financial messages for more than 11,000 banks. Dutch regulators are part of the G-10 central banks that oversee SWIFT, giving the country unmatched influence over global financial messaging. Barron emphasized the importance of data sovereignty, pointing out that “all EU financial messages stay in Dutch/Swiss centers (not US),” reinforcing the Netherlands’ role as guardian of European payment data.

A large-scale migration from SWIFT to XRP’s ledger would sharply reduce that centrality. SWIFT’s Legacy Versus XRP’s Speed SWIFT is a secure messaging system: it transmits payment instructions but relies on banks’ correspondent relationships for actual settlement. This process creates delays and allows banks to profit from nostro/vostro balances and intraday liquidity. XRP’s ledger, by contrast, offers atomic settlement in three to five seconds, effectively collapsing reconciliation windows and the “float” that many institutions monetize. Barron warned that this is not merely a technical upgrade: “This is an architectural replacement —messaging plus delayed settlement gives way to ledger-native instant settlement.” That shift would undermine revenue streams for correspondent banks, payment processors, and reconciliation vendors. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Geopolitical Consequences SWIFT has long been a geopolitical tool; exclusion from its network has served as a key economic sanction. Barron argues that if major transaction flows migrate to decentralized rails, “the power of message control will erode, forcing regulators and states to rethink sanctions architecture.” Compliance and enforcement would have to move on-ledger, changing how governments exert economic pressure. Winners and Losers The entities most vulnerable to potential disruptions include large correspondent banks, payment processors dependent on messaging fees, and SWIFT itself, which would likely face reduced message volumes and costly infrastructure adjustments as transaction patterns evolve. States that rely on SWIFT for policy leverage would lose a critical instrument of foreign policy. On the other hand, fintech companies and corporates adopting instant settlement are likely to benefit from reduced costs and accelerated transaction speeds, potentially enhancing their operational efficiency and competitiveness. As Barron concluded, “If settlement lives on-ledger, the power shifts away from message control to ledger governance and compliance—and those who built wealth on delay have the most to lose.” Barron’s analysis underscores that an XRP takeover of SWIFT transactions would not be a gentle market evolution. It would be a politically charged redistribution of revenue and influence, forcing both institutions and governments to adapt to a world where speed and transparency replace the profitable opacity of legacy banking.

EGRAG CRYPTO outlines two scenarios, with price targets ranging from $2.65 to $3.70. A close above $3.13 may cancel bearish signals and confirm the next bullish wave. XRP Breaks Out of Downward Channel XRP has recently moved above the upper edge of a long-standing downward channel. The move follows a chart pattern known as an ascending triangle, often seen before price increases. This breakout is now being tested, as the price returns toward the top of the same channel. Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO shared that this retest is happening at a lower level than the breakout point. This change is expected, as the slope of the descending channel lowers over time. The key question now is whether XRP can stay above this zone or slip back into the range it just escaped. #XRP Cross & Push ( What’s Next): Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how I built my analysis and anticipated the upcoming move under the post Titled ” Cross & Push) Go through the thread and take a look! and get into the details and explore what’s likely to happen… pic.twitter.com/wTuisEjziF — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 16, 2025 Notably, support appears strong at $2.85, but there is room for a drop to $2.65 if sellers take control. EGRAG CRYPTO warned that this lower level could be reached if XRP cannot hold above short-term resistance. The first resistance level to monitor is $3.02. “We need to see a close above $3.07 and $3.13. If we can achieve that, we’ll be in a much stronger position,” EGRAG said . Holding above these levels would help cancel out the risk of a continued pullback and could set the stage for a higher move. Two Clear Price Scenarios Ahead Two price paths are now possible. In the first, XRP breaks below $2.85 and moves toward $2.65. This would confirm a bearish shift, but it could also lead to a bounce. A return above $3.02, $3.07, and then $3.13 would signal a strong recovery and open the way to higher targets, possibly around $3.70. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO/X The second scenario avoids a deeper drop. XRP would hold above $2.85 and slowly climb past $3.02. If buyers push it through $3.07 and $3.13, the chart would confirm a breakout and support continued growth without further correction. XRP price chart Moving Averages Hold the Key The 100 EMA is acting as short-term support, helping keep XRP steady. At the same time, the 21 EMA is showing signs of flattening. If the two lines cross downward, it could push the price lower. This would make a close above $3.07 and $3.13 even more critical in the days ahead. Alongside chart patterns and moving averages, EGRAG CRYPTO has also shared an update based on Elliott Wave structure. CryptoPotato has previously covered this Elliott Wave framework in detail . Traders are now focused on the next few candles. If XRP can clear these resistance levels soon, the trend may turn more clearly in favor of buyers. If not, the lower support levels may be tested before the market decides its next direction.

The question on many minds isn’t just about the next bull run, but specifically, what does the future hold for Ethereum? Our in-depth Ethereum price prediction explores the potential trajectory of ETH, examining whether the digital asset can truly reach the ambitious $10,000 mark by 2030. This comprehensive analysis will delve into the technological advancements, market dynamics, and broader economic factors that could propel Ethereum to new heights, offering clarity on its long-term prospects. Understanding Ethereum’s Foundations: Why Does ETH Matter? Ethereum isn’t merely another cryptocurrency; it serves as a foundational layer for a decentralized internet, often referred to as Web3. Its revolutionary smart contract functionality allows for self-executing agreements, removing the need for intermediaries. This innovation paved the way for decentralized finance (DeFi), where users can lend, borrow, and trade assets without traditional banks, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have transformed digital ownership. The network’s robust infrastructure supports thousands of decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from gaming to supply chain management, cementing its critical role in the digital economy. The transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, known as The Merge, was a monumental step, significantly reducing Ethereum’s energy consumption and laying the groundwork for future scalability upgrades. This evolution directly impacts the long-term viability and intrinsic value of ETH, making it a critical factor in any Ethereum price prediction . The network’s continuous development, led by a global community of developers, ensures its adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing technological landscape. Understanding these core principles is essential to appreciating the long-term value proposition of ETH. Past Performance and Current State of ETH Price Target To truly gauge future potential, we must first look back. Ethereum’s journey has been marked by remarkable highs and challenging lows. From its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014, ETH has seen meteoric rises, particularly during the 2017 and 2021 bull markets, reaching all-time highs that captivated global attention. These periods demonstrated the immense demand and growth potential inherent in the network, driven by increasing utility and speculative interest. However, like all nascent technologies, it has also experienced significant corrections, often mirroring broader crypto market sentiment and macroeconomic shifts. Understanding these cycles is crucial for setting a realistic ETH price target . Currently, Ethereum stands as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, boasting a vast and vibrant ecosystem that continues to attract developers and users globally. Its market dominance, while fluctuating, remains a testament to its strong network effect and continuous innovation. Analyzing historical data provides valuable context for projecting future movements, highlighting patterns of growth and consolidation that are characteristic of the crypto market. Key historical milestones for ETH include: 2014: Initial Coin Offering (ICO) at approximately $0.31 per ETH. 2017: First major bull run, reaching over $1,400. 2021: All-time high above $4,800 amidst a surge in DeFi and NFTs. 2022: The Merge, transitioning to Proof-of-Stake. Post-2022: Navigating market corrections and gradual recovery. Key Drivers for Ethereum’s Future Growth What truly propels Ethereum forward? Several fundamental drivers are shaping Ethereum’s future trajectory. First, scalability remains paramount. While The Merge improved sustainability, true scalability will come through sharding and the continued development of Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync. These technologies allow Ethereum to process transactions faster and cheaper, enhancing user experience and supporting wider adoption. As these solutions mature, they will significantly reduce network congestion and gas fees, making Ethereum more accessible for everyday use and enterprise-level applications. Second, institutional adoption is gaining momentum. As regulatory clarity emerges in various jurisdictions, more corporations and financial institutions are exploring Ethereum-based solutions, from tokenized assets to enterprise blockchain applications. The potential for Ethereum ETFs in major markets could unlock significant capital inflows, further legitimizing the asset class and driving demand for ETH. Large financial players recognizing Ethereum’s potential as a settlement layer is a major bullish signal. Third, the sheer breadth of its ecosystem continues to expand. DeFi innovations, the burgeoning NFT market, blockchain gaming, and the metaverse are all heavily reliant on Ethereum, driving demand for ETH as the network’s native gas token. New use cases are constantly emerging, reinforcing Ethereum’s position as the leading platform for decentralized innovation. The network effect created by this expansive ecosystem is a powerful barrier to entry for competitors and a strong driver for sustained growth. Finally, Ethereum’s economic model, particularly with EIP-1559 introducing a burn mechanism for transaction fees and staking rewards incentivizing holding, creates a deflationary pressure under certain conditions. This reduction in the circulating supply of ETH, combined with increasing demand from network usage, could have a profound positive impact on its price over time. The economic design of Ethereum is evolving to reward long-term holders and network participants, aligning incentives for sustained value appreciation. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025: The Road to Recovery? Looking ahead to 2025, the landscape for Ethereum is influenced by a confluence of factors. Crypto markets typically operate in cycles, often correlated with Bitcoin’s halving events, which historically precede bull runs. Should a broader market recovery materialize, Ethereum is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on this upward momentum due to its strong fundamentals and established ecosystem. The next Bitcoin halving, expected in 2024, could serve as a catalyst for a renewed bull market across the entire crypto space, with Ethereum likely leading the altcoin charge. Macroeconomic conditions, such as global interest rates and inflation, will also play a significant role. A more favorable economic environment, characterized by lower inflation and stable interest rates, could encourage greater risk-on investment, benefiting assets like ETH. Conversely, persistent economic uncertainty might dampen investor enthusiasm. From a technical perspective, analysts will be watching key support and resistance levels, alongside indicators like moving averages and trading volumes, to gauge market sentiment and potential price targets. Sustained breaks above critical resistance levels would signal strong bullish momentum. Our Ethereum price prediction for 2025 suggests a strong potential for recovery, potentially pushing ETH well past previous highs if market conditions align. Factors such as continued Layer 2 adoption, progress on sharding, and increasing institutional interest could see Ethereum trade in a range of $4,000 to $7,500, with an optimistic scenario potentially reaching $8,000 to $9,000 if a full-blown bull market takes hold. This period is expected to be a crucial phase for Ethereum’s price discovery, as the market re-evaluates its intrinsic value post-Merge and with enhanced scalability. Can ETH Reach $10k by 2030? Analyzing the $10,000 ETH Target The question of whether ETH $10k is achievable by 2030 is perhaps the most exciting and debated topic among investors. Reaching this milestone would signify a massive increase in Ethereum’s market capitalization, placing it among the world’s most valuable assets. This ambitious target hinges on several long-term trends and the successful execution of Ethereum’s roadmap, transforming it into a truly global settlement layer for digital value. The bull case for $10,000 ETH by 2030 posits Ethereum becoming the dominant global settlement layer for decentralized applications, digital assets, and even tokenized real-world assets. Imagine a future where a significant portion of global finance and digital commerce flows through Ethereum, secured by its robust network and powered by its efficient transaction processing. This vision requires continued technological advancements, robust security, widespread regulatory acceptance, and seamless integration into traditional financial systems. If Ethereum can effectively scale to billions of users and trillions of dollars in value, then $10,000 becomes a conservative estimate. However, it’s not without challenges. Competition from other Layer 1 blockchains and potential unforeseen regulatory crackdowns could impede growth. Yet, if Ethereum maintains its network effect, innovates continuously, and successfully scales to meet global demand, the $10,000 mark becomes a tangible, albeit ambitious, goal. This price point represents a fundamental belief in Ethereum’s ability to transform global digital infrastructure, much like the internet transformed information exchange. The long-term trajectory is underpinned by Ethereum’s proven track record of development and its position as the preferred platform for innovation in Web3.

Navigating the Broader Crypto Market Trends and Their Impact on ETH Ethereum does not exist in a vacuum; its trajectory is intrinsically linked to broader crypto market trends . Regulatory developments worldwide are perhaps the most critical external factor. Clear, favorable regulations can unlock significant institutional capital and mainstream adoption, while restrictive policies could stifle growth. Governments and financial bodies globally are grappling with how to integrate digital assets, and their decisions will have far-reaching consequences for ETH and the entire market. The evolving landscape of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) also presents a dynamic challenge and opportunity. While CBDCs represent a centralized approach, their existence might also normalize digital assets, indirectly benefiting decentralized cryptocurrencies like ETH by increasing public familiarity and acceptance of digital forms of value. Furthermore, the increasing institutionalization of crypto, with more traditional financial products and services emerging, lends legitimacy and liquidity to the market. The entry of major banks and investment firms into the crypto space can significantly boost market confidence and capital flows into established assets like Ethereum. Technological advancements on competing blockchains, often dubbed ‘Ethereum killers,’ also warrant attention. While Ethereum enjoys a first-mover advantage and network effect, continuous innovation is essential to maintain its lead. Projects offering faster transactions or lower fees can draw users away, necessitating Ethereum’s ongoing commitment to upgrades and ecosystem development. Staying informed about these overarching trends is crucial for any investor looking to understand Ethereum’s long-term prospects and make informed decisions. Challenges and Risks for Ethereum’s Growth While the potential for Ethereum is immense, it’s vital to acknowledge the challenges and risks that could impact its journey towards higher valuations. One persistent challenge, despite ongoing upgrades, is scalability. High network demand can still lead to increased gas fees and slower transaction times, which could deter new users and developers. While Layer 2 solutions are addressing this, their widespread adoption and seamless integration are still ongoing processes. Security risks, including potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts or exploits on bridges connecting different blockchain networks, remain a concern. While Ethereum’s core protocol is robust, the vast ecosystem built on top of it presents numerous attack vectors that require constant vigilance and innovation in security measures.

First and foremost, conduct your own thorough research (DYOR). Understand the technology, the development roadmap, the competitive landscape, and the market dynamics before committing capital. Relying solely on price predictions without understanding the underlying fundamentals is a risky approach. Second, assess your personal risk tolerance. Cryptocurrencies are high-risk, high-reward assets. Only invest what you can afford to lose and ensure your crypto allocation fits within your broader financial strategy. A prudent strategy often involves dollar-cost averaging (DCA), where you invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This approach helps mitigate the impact of market volatility by averaging out your purchase price over time. Third, consider diversifying your portfolio. While Ethereum offers significant potential, spreading your investments across various assets, including other cryptocurrencies and traditional asset classes, can help reduce overall risk. This prevents over-exposure to any single asset and balances potential gains with risk management. Finally, stay informed. The crypto space evolves rapidly. Follow reputable news sources, engage with the community, and keep abreast of technological upgrades, regulatory changes, and broader market trends that could impact Ethereum’s valuation. Continuous learning is key to navigating this dynamic market successfully.
