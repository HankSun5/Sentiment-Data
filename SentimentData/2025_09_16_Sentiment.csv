It’s likely that short-term traders have taken some profits following the market’s rally over the weekend, although most coins are still up in the past seven days. This includes XRP, Pump.fun and Hyperliquid, which are all showing strong momentum despite correcting a little today. But if the FOMC does cut rates later this week, they could all rebound strongly, bringing traders more profits. Crypto Price Prediction Today 15 September XRP ($XRP): Ripple Expansion Means Altcoin Could Be Biggest Winner of Bull Market It’s down by 3.5% today, but XRP remains one of the most bullish tokens in the top-100 by quite some margin. At $2.98, it remains up by 1.5% in a week and by 6% in a fortnight, although it is down by 5% in the past month. This monthly decline is arguably bullish, however, since it indicates that XRP is due to correct upwards in the near future. Its chart also invites this suspicion, given that its had yet to reach an overbought position prior to its decline today. Source: TradingView In other words, today likely represents a blip within a medium-term upswing, which could get into motion as and when the much-hoped-for rate cut arrives on Wednesday. More fundamentally, XRP is in a great position to ride any end-of-year bull rally, given Ripple’s encouraging growth in recent weeks. It has signed partnerships with major banks , made important acquisitions, and also expanded into Dubai and Africa, so the future looks very bright for the firm. In view of this, the XRP price could hit $3.50 by the end of the month, and close 2025 at over $5. Pump.fun ($PUMP): Growth of Launchpad Could Push New Token to Record Highs by End of Week PUMP is currently priced at $0.007989, which marks a 1.5% loss today, having set a new ATH of $0.008819 within the past 24 hours. The altcoin is also up by an astonishing 129% in a month, making it one of the best-performing tokens in the market across this timeframe. And fundamentally, PUMP is in a strong position, given that Pump.fun remains the biggest token launchpad on Solana, with 8 million unique active wallets in the past month , as well as a volume of $1 billion. Looking at its chart, its indicators suggest that it may be close to peaking, yet it’s also possible that the FOMC meeting later this week could give it a second wind. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) has bounced up again after dipping from 80 over the weekend, suggesting that it has momentum left to spare. Some whales are continuing to invest more deeply in PUMP , despite the possibility that it could peak soon, indicating confidence in its long-term prospects. It has already bounced within the past hour, so we could see it testing new highs later in the week, potentially passing $0.0950 by the weekend. Hyperliquid ($HYPE): Altcoin Hitting New Highs As Native DEX Platform Continues to Grow HYPE has declined by 1.5% today, but its current price of $53.51 marks a 5% gain in a week, with the coin hitting a new ATH over the weekend. Hyperliquid is another token that has the advantage of having a strong platform behind it, with the Hyperliquid DEX now boasting a total value locked in of $2.6 billion . This makes it the eighth-biggest platform in crypto in terms of TVL, and its on-chain value only continues to grow. For this reason, we can expect the Hyperliquid price to keep climbing in the medium- and long-term. Source: TradingView Its indicators suggest that it may also be close to peaking, but given that the wider market is entering a bullish phase, it could continue to rise into Q4. We could therefore see the HYPE price reach $75 by the end of the month, $100 by the end of October, and $150 by 2026. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): L2 Network Raises $16 Million As Launch Quickly Approaches The crypto price prediction for these 3 tokens is very positive right now, but the incoming bull market will also see many other coins outperforming averages. This is likely to include presale tokens, with one of the most exciting presale coins right now being Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new L2 project for Bitcoin . Bitcoin, but faster. Introducing Bitcoin Hyper: the Layer-2 that brings speed & scalability back to BTC. pic.twitter.com/tPe1eQmYWv — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 14, 2025 Bitcoin Hyper has raised $16 million in its ongoing presale, with investors excited by its plans to launch a true layer-two network for Bitcoin. In its role as an L2, it will offer low transaction fees and fast confirmation times, provide an ecosystem in which BTC holders can put their holdings to work. It’s aiming to become a DeFi and trading layer for Bitcoin, tapping into its network’s huge value, and providing Bitcoin holders with opportunities to make additional profits. Using Solana’s Virtual Machine and zero-knowledge rollups, it will provide an unparalleled level of scalability and security. Its native token, HYPER, will be necessary to pay transaction fees, so it could witness lots of demand once the network launches. Investors can join its sale by heading over to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as MetaMask or Best Wallet. HYPER now costs $0.012925, but this will rise repeatedly as the sale progresses.

The Solana price is still drawing eyes, Chainlink is making headlines, but experts argue that only Remittix is positioned as the best crypto to buy now in Q3. With its wallet beta launch imminent, a $250,000 giveaway live, and a 15 per cent referral program already paying out daily in USDT, the window to act is closing. Find out more in this article. Solana Price Performance and Outlook Solana price is floating at around $246.91, which is an indicator of an unexpected stability in the market where there is volatility. Its blazing-fast blockchain and minimal gas charges are appreciated by analysts, which spur developers and DeFi projects need. In the recent past, there has been the deployment of new platforms on the network of Solana increasing the liquidity and adoption. However, as the Solana price looks healthy, traders are undecided whether the next upward move will be robust or temporary. Predictions are optimistic so long as the ecosystem continues to grow, although the gain might be limited relative to smaller tokens that have higher growth potential. Chainlink’s Latest Developments and Market Impact The latest Chainlink news has kept its token in the spotlight. Integrations across DeFi continue to multiply, reinforcing its position as the industry’s leading decentralized oracle provider. Secure data feeds are now more critical than ever, and Chainlink is a name institutions trust to deliver. As positive as these developments are, some question whether Chainlink has already priced in much of its growth. Why Remittix Stands Out As Best Crypto To Buy Now This is where Remittix changes the game. Unlike Solana and Chainlink, Remittix is targeting a global market worth trillions of dollars. It is not about speculation, it is about solving payments for businesses, freelancers, and everyday users. Remittix has sold over 662 million tokens, raised more than 25.6 million dollars, and is priced at just $0.1080. A BitMart listing was locked in after the 20 million milestone, LBANK followed after 22 million, and a third CEX is on deck. Momentum is undeniable. With the wallet beta launching on September 15 and a massive $250,000 giveaway underway, the race to accumulate RTX has never been hotter. Analysts are already calling it the best crypto to buy now , and for good reason: • RTX is solving a real world 19 trillion dollar payments problem. • Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries. • The tokenomics are deflationary and designed for long term growth. • Project momentum is accelerating ahead of the beta launch. • The referral program pays 15 percent in USDT, claimable daily via the dashboard. Every signal points to scarcity. The market is tightening, listings are lining up, and demand is accelerating. Investors who wait risk watching the value slip away to early movers. Remittix is not another speculative play. It is a payments solution backed by tech, listings, and adoption. That is why experts rank it as the best crypto to buy now, and why buyers are rushing in before the wallet launch activates its utility.

In a thread posted on September 12 and expanded over the weekend, analyst Nik Patel (@cointradernik) said the current positioning backdrop “is less like March and Dec ’24 crossovers and more like Dec ’23,” warning that the market is set up for a “multi-week whipsaw going into early/mid Oct.” He added a specific liquidation map: “Give me $1.5bn in shorts liqs on the weekly and then $2.8bn of long liqs into Oct 7th pls.” pic.twitter.com/LVsY4bU99o — Nik (@cointradernik) September 12, 2025 What Is Different This Time For Bitcoin? What makes this setup different, in his view, is the balance between spot and derivatives flows and the breadth of basis trades. “Spot vol as % of total vol [is] lower here than prior crossovers for Others OI vs BTC OI (March ’24 and Dec ’24),” he wrote, arguing that if spot demand were truly in the driver’s seat “we should expect spot vol as a % of total vol to be higher not lower.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Above Mid-Term Holder Breakeven – Is A Fresh Rally Brewing? Instead, he sees “a combination of basis trade across a broader range of markets than just BTC & ETH but also more directional levered shorts than prior occasions,” with the immediate “upside risk… even greater for a short liq cascade first.” Funding, he noted, is “benign” relative to those earlier peaks. Real-time funding data broadly corroborate the “benign” characterization. Across major venues, BTC perpetual funding hovered close to flat in recent sessions—generally in the +0.005% to +0.01% per-8-hour range—well below the overheated prints typical of euphoric tops. That keeps the door open to a squeeze without the need to first unwind extreme long leverage. Sentiment, Nik argued, is still closer to “disbelief” than euphoria. He contrasted March 2024’s ETF frenzy and December 2024’s post-election optimism with today’s more skeptical tone, pointing to a still-elevated pool of sidelined capital. “Both prior crossovers had stablecoin dominance trough at 5% ish. We are currently at 6.1% — imo this is textbook disbelief/Sidelined September positioning,” he wrote. In his base case, that war chest ultimately fuels year-end risk-taking once the whipsaw plays out: “We will almost certainly get the positioning whipsaw and bear trap during that quarterly end & monthly open window of weakness, but there are a lot more stables ready to be deployed here into year-end.” In a self-aware aside, Nik even shared a machine-generated distillation of his view: “ChatGPT coming to a similar conclusion here after I fed all these charts in, idk if that inspires confidence or concern about my view though lol.” Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is A Strong Buy If It Overcomes $118K — Here’s Why ChatGPT wrote: “Past crossovers: signaled end-phase altseason blowoffs, fueled by euphoric longs with no dry powder left. This crossover: signals pre-phase potential — leverage is already there, but it’s balanced/shorter, with capital still on the sidelines (stables). This is why the funding differential is so important: • High funding + low stables = top-like conditions. Low funding + high stables = squeeze-ready conditions.” Renowned crypto analyst CRG (@MacroCRG) consented: “Agree with him that a big short liq event is likely before a big long liq event still lots of positioning to unwind imo from ppl expecting a bearish September. In saying that, would like the coins to bounce soon, many are at/near key pivots.” As ever with path-dependent derivatives tape, the trigger matters. Nik cautioned that a “massive short liquidation event” in the coming week could flip the script if it invites “late longs” and spikes funding into October. But absent that sudden shift, his base case remains a two-step: an upside liquidation cascade that resets shorts, followed by a rug-pull on over-eager longs into the October 7 window. Traders watching for confirmation will focus on whether funding stays contained as price lifts, whether spot participation actually broadens rather than fades, and whether stablecoin deployment reduces the cash cushion he cites. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $114,852.

Over the weekend, the address acquired 3,976 ETH worth approximately $18.9 million, according to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence. The purchase was executed using 18.9 million DAI, a stablecoin, and split across multiple transactions before being consolidated into the buy. The transaction came just as Ethereum broke above $4,700, marking its highest level in more than two weeks. Currently, ETH trades at $4,538, down 2.9% in the past 24 hours. A Pattern of Bold Acquisitions This is not the first time the wallet has made waves. In July, it bought 4,863 ETH for $12.6 million and later added 649 ETH at $3,562 per token. Just last month, the same wallet scooped up $8 million worth of Solana (SOL), though that position has since slipped below entry price. Analysts say the strategy shows deliberate fund consolidation, often seen in money laundering tactics. Breaking transactions into smaller amounts and using privacy tools allows the hacker to mask movements, making tracking more difficult. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT previously estimated that the Coinbase-related social engineering scam drained at least $330 million from victims, warning that the real figure may be significantly higher. Growing Concerns Over Rising Crypto Hacks The latest Ethereum purchase shows broader concerns in the crypto industry, where hack-related losses reached $163 million in August alone, according to security firm PeckShield. With exploits shifting from smart contract bugs to social engineering and cross-chain bridge vulnerabilities, wallets like this continue to pose a major threat to investor confidence. Despite Coinbase offering a $20 million reward for information on the perpetrators and tightening security, the hacker remains unidentified. The latest $19M ETH grab proves the resilience and boldness of cybercriminals operating in the space. As crypto rallies and institutional inflows grow, the question remains: is the hacker simply riding bullish momentum, or is this part of a deeper strategy to launder stolen funds? Regulators and blockchain investigators are watching closely, but for now, the crypto world is left with more questions than answers.

Popular with retail investors, the trading platform revealed it filed plans with regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for this new fund dubbed Robinhood Ventures Fund I. Robinhood makes a shift towards inclusive venture capital According to the firm, the fund is meant to democratize access to private startups and potentially shape how everyday retail investors participate in high growth opportunities that have for long been a preserve of the elite – venture capital firms, institutions and the ultra-wealthy. This move also comes on the backdrop of rising interest in private markets where valuations have surged due to AI and digital innovations. Data cited by Robinhood’s newsroom post on Robinhood Newsroom shows that the number of listed domestic firms in the US has decreased, pushing more capital into private entities that often yield outsized returns for institutional players. “For decades, wealthy people and institutions have invested in private companies while retail investors have been unfairly locked out,” said Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev in a statement. “With Robinhood Ventures, everyday people will be able to invest in opportunities once reserved for the elite.” Tenev. If SEC approves the Robinhood Ventures Fund I, it will subsequently list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker RVI. According to a statement, its shares will be accessible to the public via various brokerages among them Robinhood’s own platform. The fund is expected to focus on investing in “a concentrated portfolio of private companies at the frontiers of their respective industries,” according to Robinhood. The Monday announcement is the latest in a series of strategic expansions by Robinhood as it recently coveted a spot on the S&P 500 and introduced a new social media feature known as Robinhood Social within its app during the past two weeks alone. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , the social media app will roll out next year with a select group of customers having invitations before rolling out to all users. The new fund aligns with the firm’s ecosystem The fund announcement also comes following the firm’s and controversial entry into tokenized equities in Europe, which offered exposure to private giants like the ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SpaceX. This initiative attracted criticism from OpenAI and scrutiny from European regulators, highlighting the complexities of innovating in the private market space. The filing also underscores the firm’s aggressive pivot from its origins as a commission-free stock trading app towards a more “diversified, multilane financial platform,” a transformation which has been significantly powered by the firm’s booming cryptocurrency business. Earlier this year, the firm revealed that transaction based revenues had climbed 77% year-over0year, largely driven by crypto trading. Its second quarter earnings also highlighted this momentum as revenue from crypto products surged 98% year-over-year to $160 million. According to the firm, total crypto trading volumes reached $35 billion. This growth, Robinhood said, was substantially driven by the June acquisition of the veteran European crypto exchange Bitstamp, which brought with it over 50 regulatory licenses and accounted for $7 billion in trading volume in second quarter alone from its institutional client base. Now, the introduction of the Robinhood Ventures Fund I marks a direct challenge to the traditional structures of private equity and represents a significant step in the company’s stated mission “to democratize finance for all.” Market watchers have also noted that this fund could lower barriers for retail investors, who have historically been left out due to high minimum investments and accreditation requirements. A report by WealthManagement.com shows how the fund, pending approval by SEC will enable ordinary users to gain exposure to startups before they can go public, potentially through tokenized assets or direct equity stakes.

Ever since SHIB’s legendary rally in 2021, investors have been searching for signs of another breakout moment. With its community-driven growth, the expansion of its Shibarium Layer 2 network, and broader developments in the meme coin sector, the question lingers: is SHIB preparing for its next big surge? At the same time, new entrants such as Layer Brett (LBRETT) are shifting the narrative, offering utility-backed alternatives that may influence how traders view meme tokens going forward. The current state of Shiba Inu Right now, Shiba Inu price prediction discussions focus on volatility, supply, and adoption. SHIB trades near $0.000014 , with a market capitalization in the $7–8 billion range . While far below its October 2021 all-time high of $0.00008845 , analysts note that new network developments could support a rebound. Shibarium, SHIB’s own Layer 2 solution, has introduced lower fees and faster transactions, a crucial element for long-term sustainability. These upgrades form the backbone of a more optimistic Shiba Inu price prediction. Still, headwinds remain: token supply remains enormous, transaction activity fluctuates, and competition from emerging meme coins is growing. Layer Brett: A rising contender While SHIB continues to capture attention, Layer Brett has become part of the same conversation. Its presale recently crossed $3.6 million , with tokens priced at $0.0058 Unlike many meme coins, Layer Brett is built as a Layer 2 solution on Ethereum, designed for scalability, speed, and low-cost transactions. For those tracking the Shiba Inu price prediction, Layer Brett presents a useful point of comparison. Where SHIB relies heavily on community strength and branding, Layer Brett layers in technical innovation, claiming gas fees as low as $0.0001 and offering staking rewards through its dApp. By combining meme appeal with utility, it is carving a different trajectory in the meme coin market. Comparing Forecasts: SHIB vs. Layer Brett A realistic Shiba Inu price prediction requires examining community behavior, on-chain activity, and network growth. Optimistic analysts suggest SHIB could double in price if Shibarium gains wider adoption. Others caution that without a major catalyst, SHIB may stay range-bound. Either way, its future rests on more than hype—it needs functional traction. In contrast, Layer Brett’s forecasts lean on its presale dynamics and tokenomics. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens and high staking incentives for early adopters, it attracts a different kind of speculation. Many commentators now mention Layer Brett in the same breath as the Shiba Inu price prediction, highlighting how new entrants may influence market sentiment. Conclusion The Shiba Inu price prediction remains a key topic in the meme coin sector. For SHIB, the path to another historic rally depends on adoption of Shibarium, reductions in transaction costs, and ongoing community engagement. For investors, this means keeping a close watch on SHIB’s technical developments as well as external market sentiment. Layer Brett, meanwhile, offers a contrasting approach—utility-driven growth layered onto meme culture. Its presale strength, low gas fees, and staking rewards give it momentum of its own. For some traders, balancing exposure between SHIB and Layer Brett could provide a hedge between history and innovation.

Japanese financial giant Credit Saison has just announced the launch of an ambitious blockchain fund , signaling a powerful new wave of institutional interest in the digital asset space. This move isn’t just about investing; it’s about pioneering the future of finance, specifically targeting the burgeoning real-world asset (RWA) sector. What is Onigiri Capital and its Blockchain Fund Focus? Credit Saison’s new venture, aptly named Onigiri Capital, is set to deploy up to $50 million into innovative startups. This dedicated blockchain fund will primarily concentrate on companies building solutions within the Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization domain. Imagine transforming traditional assets like real estate, commodities, or even intellectual property into digital tokens on a blockchain. This is precisely where Onigiri Capital sees immense potential. Investment Size: Up to $50 million. Primary Focus: Startups in the Real-World Asset (RWA) sector. Goal: Drive innovation and adoption of tokenized assets. Why Are Real-World Assets Crucial for a Blockchain Fund? The RWA sector is gaining incredible traction, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). Tokenizing RWAs offers numerous advantages, fundamentally changing how we perceive and interact with assets: Increased Liquidity: Assets that were once illiquid can be traded more easily on global markets. Fractional Ownership: Allows smaller investors to own a piece of high-value assets, democratizing access. Transparency: Blockchain records provide an immutable and transparent ownership trail, enhancing trust. Accessibility: Global access to investment opportunities, breaking down geographical barriers. Credit Saison’s strategic decision to focus its blockchain fund here highlights a forward-thinking approach, recognizing the massive untapped value in digitizing tangible and intangible assets. This move positions them at the forefront of financial innovation. Japan’s Growing Embrace of Blockchain Innovation This launch by Credit Saison isn’t an isolated event; it reflects a broader trend in Japan. The nation has been increasingly open to exploring blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, albeit with a cautious regulatory stance. Financial institutions are now actively looking for ways to integrate this technology into their core businesses. A dedicated blockchain fund from a firm of Credit Saison’s stature could inspire other traditional players to follow suit, further accelerating institutional adoption in Asia. The establishment of Onigiri Capital demonstrates a clear commitment to fostering growth in the Web3 ecosystem, particularly within a regulated financial framework. This institutional backing provides much-needed credibility and capital for promising startups, helping them scale and innovate. Navigating the Challenges and Seizing the Benefits of a Blockchain Fund While the potential of a blockchain fund focused on RWAs is immense, challenges certainly exist. Regulatory clarity, technological scalability, and market acceptance are all factors that need careful navigation. However, the benefits for early movers like Credit Saison are substantial: Pioneering Position: Establishing leadership in a rapidly evolving and competitive market. Diversification: Adding a new, high-growth asset class to their portfolio, reducing overall risk. Innovation Driver: Fostering new technologies that can benefit their existing financial services and create new revenue streams. Credit Saison’s move is a powerful statement about the future of finance, indicating a definitive shift towards a more digitized, transparent, and accessible financial system globally. This strategic investment solidifies their role as an innovator.

But moving away from Siberia and the North Caucuses is presenting miners with a new set of problems, media outlets in the nation have reported. Per a report from the Russian newspaper Vedomosti Yug , the B2B electrical equipment platform TenderPro has compiled a top 10 of areas where demand for crypto mining rigs and other related equipment is highest. Topping the table were Moscow and the Moscow Oblast (the region surrounding the capital). This area is now responsible for 21.9% of mining hardware purchases. Russian Crypto Miners: Relocating to Bigger Cities? The figure for the capital dwarfed demand figures (6.7%) in the Siberian oblast of Irkutsk. The latter is the birthplace of the Russian Bitcoin mining industry. A Russian crypto mining-related facility. (Source: Artemy Lebedev/VK) However, mining in much of Irkutsk is now illegal. Those mining farms that do have the right to operate in the Siberian region already reportedly “near full capacity.” The drift toward urban centers appears to be real: St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region took third spot with 4.7%. Krasnodar Krai, in the southwestern part of the North Caucasus region, took fourth place. Krasnodar is Russia’s third most populous federal subject. Kuban, also in the North Caucasus, rounded out the top five. The Total Hash Rate for the Bitcoin network over the past 12 months. (Source: Blockchain.com) The platform calculated that overall demand for mining equipment from commercial enterprises in the Russian South fell by 19.3% over the first eight months of 2025. A ‘Market Correction’ Olga Gorchitsyna, TenderPro’s Director of Digital Products Development, said that this fall in demand may be attributable to a market correction. She suggested that the Kremlin’s decision last year to legalize the crypto mining sector may have caused an exceptional spike in demand. Gorchitsyna explained: “A year ago, after the legalization of industrial mining, we saw a sharp increase in demand for crypto mining equipment. However, since the beginning of this year, the excitement around the sector has gradually begun to subside.” Russian prosecutors are targeting Denis Shtengelov's KDV Group, one of the country’s largest snack producers, for expropriation https://t.co/Ahk6oLYrm8 — Bloomberg (@business) September 15, 2025 In previous years, crypto miners made a beeline for the Northern Caucasus and Southern Siberia , attracted mainly to these areas’ famously low energy prices. But these areas are traditionally sparsely populated, meaning their generally more moderst power generation capabilities can easily be overloaded. The introduction of seasonal bans and police crackdowns on illegal miners in these regions has scared off many industrial miners. The statistics, it appears, now indicate that miners are preferring to set up shop in areas where power shortages are rare, and other mining firms are few and far between. Noise Concerns However, moving into the more densely populated European part of Russia is posting a new challenge for some Russian miners, as well as their international backers. Russia revives barter trade to dodge Western sanctions https://t.co/QnvdRaS1NU https://t.co/QnvdRaS1NU — Reuters (@Reuters) September 15, 2025 Some 260km southeast of Moscow, in the village of Kiritsy, Ryazan Region, a mining firm named Integral has faced a backlash after launching a crypto mining facility. The village has a population of over 3,000 people, who have complained bitterly about high noise levels since the firm turned on its rigs in April this year. Per the Ryazan branch of Top 24 News , Rospotrebnadzor, the Russian federal well-being and consumer rights agency, ordered Integral to suspend its operations for 30 days. The agency acted after residents complained that noise levels from the facility were rising above 50 decibels. Kiritsy residents said they were suffering from “headaches, hearing loss, and a general deterioration in health.” Watchdog Steps In, Russian Crypto Miners Face New Problems? Rospotrebnadzor told Integral it must install special equipment that will help suppress the noise. The firm has brought in “specialists from China” who will help install equipment aimed at reducing the farm’s noise levels. In August, Argumenti y Facti reported that residents say the mining facility uses gas piston turbine generators. One resident explained: “Two of these turbines are currently operational. But there are plans to install 20 more. These two turbines have already created unbearable living conditions for people here. It’s frightening to even imagine what will happen when there are 22 of them here.” Kiritsy residents complained that the turbine generators are “no more than 500 meters away” from some of their houses. They added that the village is home to a children’s tuberculosis healthcare center, where young people from all over the country come for treatment.

Behind every profitable trade lies a framework of discipline, consistency, and repeatable actions. In a market as volatile as digital assets, the traders who last are the ones who develop daily habits that keep them focused while others get distracted by noise. From Bitcoin whales to altcoin scalpers, veterans share a common truth: habits compound into results. In 2025, with ETFs driving institutional flows and altcoins preparing for their next cycle, the ability to sharpen habits may be the greatest edge a trader can have. Alongside proven methods, new opportunities are also entering conversations, one of them being MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could deliver 45× returns before major listings. Habit 1: Structured market research The first thing successful traders do daily is check the markets, but not just prices. They track macroeconomic events, ETF flows, on-chain data, and sentiment. By starting each day with structured research, they avoid reacting emotionally to sudden moves. Tools like CoinMarketCap, CryptoQuant, and Santiment provide context, whether it’s whale accumulation, exchange inflows, or funding rate shifts. This data-driven approach means they act from strategy, not impulse. Habit 2: Journaling trades A trading journal might sound old-fashioned, but it’s one of the most powerful tools for improvement. Successful traders log every position, entry, exit, rationale, and outcome. Over time, this builds a personal database that reveals patterns: strengths to lean on and weaknesses to avoid. Many beginners skip this step, but those who keep journals learn faster and cut losses earlier. As one professional once said, “Markets repeat themselves, your journal shows you how.” Habit 3: Mindset and discipline Psychology is half the battle. Top traders practice patience, emotional discipline, and resilience. They avoid revenge trading after losses and don’t let FOMO drive entries. Many have daily routines outside of charts, exercise, meditation, or reading, that sharpen focus. By grounding themselves, they bring stability into a market defined by chaos. This same principle of discipline applies to spotting new opportunities, where MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. With forecasts calling for a 45× move , the token is stirring global crypto communities. What makes MAGACOIN different is its balance of structure and energy. Traders describe it as the rare presale that blends smart tokenomics with cultural firepower, turning it into more than hype, it’s strategy in motion. Just as good habits compound in trading, presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE compound through momentum, and that synergy is why so many are watching closely. Habit 4: Continuous education Markets evolve, and traders evolve with them. The best spend at least 30–60 minutes a day studying new concepts: ETF mechanics, Layer-2 rollups, DeFi strategies, or simply reviewing macroeconomic reports. Crypto is one of the fastest-moving industries in finance; those who stop learning fall behind. Successful traders treat education as part of their routine, not an afterthought. Habit 5: Risk management rituals Every day, top traders reassess their risk. They set clear stop-loss levels, calculate position sizes, and ensure their exposure aligns with their capital plan. The traders who survive crashes are not the ones with the highest win rates, but the ones who never let a single loss wipe them out. Risk management isn’t glamorous, but it is the lifeline of every profitable career in crypto. Habit 6: Networking and community Crypto trading is no longer a solo sport. The best traders exchange ideas in private groups, Telegram channels, and Discord communities. They test strategies, share data, and learn from collective insights. Being part of a strong network keeps them updated and accountable. It also helps them spot early narratives, whether it’s ETF approvals, presale momentum, or altcoin rotations, that others miss until it’s too late. Habit 7: Reviewing and refining At the end of each day, successful traders review their performance. Did they stick to their plan? Did emotions interfere? Were entries timed correctly? This self-audit, repeated daily, builds discipline. It transforms trading from guesswork into a process. Over months and years, this refinement compounds into mastery. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is on Every Trader’s Radar Massive Upside Potential: Analysts are calling for up to 45× gains , giving it the kind of asymmetric return profile traders dream of. Deflationary Design: A scarcity-driven model ensures supply pressure favors early participants as the presale tightens. Balanced Strategy: Unlike hype-only plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE blends disciplined tokenomics with cultural firepower, making it both structured and energetic. Timing Advantage: Arriving before major exchange listings, it offers first-mover exposure that seasoned traders value for maximum upside. Conclusion: habits create longevity The crypto market rewards those who prepare, not those who gamble. The traders who thrive in 2025 are those who commit to daily habits: research, journaling, risk control, learning, and emotional discipline. These small steps add up to extraordinary results when applied consistently. At the same time, new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, forecasted for a potential 45× surge, are reminding traders that discipline isn’t just about risk; it’s also about recognizing projects with huge growth potential on time. For anyone aiming to trade successfully, combining solid habits with timely opportunities may be the most powerful strategy of all.

Remittix(RTX) , already being called “XRP 2.0,” is riding its own momentum with a 15% USDT referral program, a $250,000 giveaway, and the wallet beta launching in 24 hours, the first working product in the Remittix ecosystem. With XRP pushing toward $4 from just under $0.10, comparisons are everywhere. Will XRP’s newfound strength hold as Remittix sets the stage for its own breakout? XRP Price Prediction: Ripple’s Path to $4 Recent XRP price action shows strength. After clearing resistance near $3.01, XRP is setting up for further gains according to chart signals. Large wallet addresses have been steadily adding to their holdings, on-chain activity confirms growing participation from smaller investors, and technical analysts now view $3.66 as the next area that could attract strong buying interest. Even so, overhead barriers between $3.50 and $4 are expected to act as a real test. Catalysts such as approval of exchange-traded funds or more clarity from regulators could be what finally drives momentum past that zone. How Remittix Compares and Stands Out While XRP aims for $4, Remittix is already turning heads. Unlike XRP, whose strength depends on long-standing networks and regulatory wins, Remittix is being designed as an altcoin with working product features from the start. Its referral rewards, live utility, and near-term launch set it apart. On the funding side, Remittix has already sold more than 662 million tokens at $0.1080 each and raised over $25.6 million. Importantly, the project secured a BitMart listing right after surpassing $20 million raised, then announced an LBANK listing once the $22 million level was cleared, and is now preparing a third CEX. These milestones show how investor demand is translating into global exchange traction at a pace rarely seen in early-stage projects. Check what makes Remittix special right now: Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries Global payout rails are integrated already and expanding The project is audited by CertiK, which builds trust and transparency Early believers are already calling it “XRP 2.0” It is built for adoption, not speculation Comparing XRP’s Surge and Remittix’s Rise XRP is carving a path toward $4, pushing past key resistance and riding on institutional momentum and partnership news. Remittix, dubbed “XRP 2.0,” is not just whispering, it is building. Remittix is blending utility, community rewards, and real product rollout in a way that sets it apart. XRP may be closer to mainstream adoption and proven infrastructure, but Remittix is sprinting ahead in terms of early-stage opportunity. For those tracking XRP price prediction, keep one eye on Ripple’s charts. For those seeking high growth from low entry, Remittix offers something very different.

Analyst Projects $20+ In October 2025,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrps-biggest-rally-yet-analyst-projects-20-in-october-2025/,"XRP is trading close to $3 and has struggled to hold that level in recent sessions. According to a market analyst, a repeat of a past pattern tied to Bitcoin halvings could push XRP much higher, with a possible cycle top above $20 on Oct. 17, 2025. The timeline ties back to earlier halving cycles and a short lag that, she argues, has repeated before. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Odds, Jumps 21% Even As ETF Debut Gets Pushed Back Halving Dates And Follow-On Moves Based on reports, crypto expert Diana points to the 2016–2017 cycle as the clearest example. Bitcoin halved on July 9, 2016, and then reached a peak above $19,000 on Dec. 18, 2017 — 525 days later. XRP, she notes, followed with its high of $3.31 on Jan. 5, 2018, around 18 days after Bitcoin’s top. That sequence — Bitcoin first, XRP soon after — is central to her case. 🚨 XRP TO $15–$20? HISTORY SAYS OCT 2025 IS THE DATE ⏳🔥 History, math, and the end of SEC suppression all point to one window: mid-October 2025. This could be XRP’s most savage run yet — let’s break it down. 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/RJ6Z85b6pz — Diana (@InvestWithD) September 4, 2025 Losing Steam, Legal Pressure The pattern did not hold in the next cycle. Bitcoin halved on May 11, 2020, and then topped near $69,000 on Nov. 10, 2021, about 545 days later. XRP did not mirror that run. Reports show XRP hit $1.95 in April 2021, several months earlier than Bitcoin’s peak, after legal pressure and exchange delistings constrained its move. Diana describes that episode as a lost cycle for the token. Regulatory Clarity And Product Growth According to reports, the legal cloud around XRP eased after a July 2023 court outcome that cleared major parts of XRP’s past sales from being labeled as securities. Exchanges in the US resumed listings, and Ripple has been building out products like RLUSD and new payment corridors. Diana says those developments, together with multiple ETF filings, improve XRP’s chances this time. She puts forward three price scenarios: a modest run to $5–$7 if Bitcoin’s momentum is modest; a base case of $10–$15 assuming ETF inflows and stronger use cases; and a blow-off rally that could push XRP past $20 if big institutional liquidity arrives. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out With A 32% Surge: Time To Buy Or Too Late To Chase? XRP Forecasts Split: $12.25 Target Vs. Modest Growth Outlook Meanwhile, Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered expects XRP’s rally to continue, saying the token could take on a larger role in international finance. He also points to future XRP ETFs as a catalyst that could draw more investors. Kendrick places his price target at $12.25 by 2029, which would mean a 300%+ jump from today’s $2.95 and translate into annualized returns of about 43%. That outlook, however, is far from universal. Morningstar analysts forecast the broader crypto market to grow close to 10% per year through 2034, a rate in line with historical stock market performance.

According to on-chain data, the exchange’s cold wallets now hold only a fraction of the XRP they once did, and the decline is now more than 90%. This comes at a time when the XRP community has been closely monitoring institutional activity, with growing rumors of BlackRock and other heavyweight firms quietly building exposure to XRP. Coinbase’s XRP Holdings Crash By 90% Recent moves by Coinbase with its XRP holdings have taken most crypto investors by surprise. Previous data showed that Coinbase, which was once the fifth-largest holder of XRP, has trimmed its XRP reserve balance from approximately 780.13 million XRP to 199.47 million. This was a cutback of about 69% in its holdings since the second quarter of 2025. However, on-chain data tracked by the @XRPwallets account on the social media platform X shows that Coinbase hasn’t stepped back from slashing its XRP holdings. As recently revealed by @XRPwallets, Coinbase now has just six cold wallets holding about 16.5 million XRP each. This leaves the US-based exchange with an estimated 99 million XRP in total. By comparison, the exchange had 52 cold wallets as recently as June 9, with 10 wallets holding 26.8 million XRP each and another 42 wallets holding 16.8 million XRP each. Combined, that amounted to nearly 970 million XRP under Coinbase’s control. In other words, the most recent numbers mean that Coinbase has shed about 90% of its XRP reserves within the past three months. Such a strong reduction in the movement of XRP away from Coinbase has been linked to accumulation into institutional wallets in anticipation of the launch of a Spot XRP ETF in the US. It also corresponds with previous reports about BlackRock’s indirect involvement with XRP through Coinbase’s custodial services. What Does This Mean For XRP? The scale of outflows from Coinbase’s XRP reserves has taken many crypto investors by surprise, as seen by comments on social media platforms. For instance, XRPwallets hinted at the possibility of these huge movements being linked to BlackRock. An account on the social media platform X, known as Stern Drew , suggested that Coinbase’s sell-offs go with a deliberate strategy to suppress XRP’s price. This was met with a firm rejection by pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who was quick to push back on the manipulation claims. Although there has been no official confirmation, the most plausible explanation of these large XRP exits is mostly linked to the eventual launch of an XRP ETF. The odds of the SEC accepting an XRP ETF in 2025 are now at a 94% chance on Polymarket . Bloomberg analysts also place the odds at a 90% chance or higher. Large institutions could be accumulating XRP in anticipation of such a product, and the reduced supply on exchanges could contribute to buying pressure even before it is launched. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3, down by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.",XRP|BlackRock|coinbase|Polymarket|Spot XRP ETF|Stern Drew|US SEC|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-16 00:00:46

AllInCrypto (@RealAllinCrypto), a well-respected analyst, recently highlighted this research in a video on X, connecting Ripple and BlackRock through one of the most senior figures in digital assets today. Mitchnick’s career includes a period at Ripple before joining BlackRock in February 2018. At the time of his move, he co-authored a research report analyzing digital assets and their potential valuations. The analyst stressed that this document is significant not only for Bitcoin but also for XRP. According to him, it provided numerical scenarios that many in the community have overlooked. BlackRock's Managing Director, Robert Mitchnick, researched future possible trajectories of $BTC and $XRP . A price target of $32.91 was given to XRP based on legitimate value propositions. pic.twitter.com/hgnbFLfv1N — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) September 14, 2025 High Price Targets for XRP AllInCrypto explained that Mitchnick’s report modeled potential success and failure cases for XRP, with the double-digit estimate for the asset’s future price. According to his explanation, the same report set a low estimate of $6.37, still well above XRP’s current trading level. The report then narrowed the forecast into what it called a fundamental value range. “The resulting fundamental value range of between $1.59 to $8.23” was reached after assigning a 25% probability to the success case, with the failure case assuming XRP would be worth nothing. He contrasted this with XRP’s trading range of $0.49 to $3.72 at the time of publication. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 BlackRock Connection Adds Weight AllInCrypto emphasized the importance of Mitchnick’s role today. He noted that the same individual who contributed to that report now holds one of the most senior digital asset positions in global finance. Mitchnick has been at BlackRock for a long time, and AllInCrypto stated that the continuity of his influence makes the earlier valuations more noteworthy. While BlackRock has not filed specifically for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , its presence in the digital asset space has grown considerably. The fact that the firm’s digital asset strategy is overseen by a former Ripple employee has created natural interest around XRP among investors and market commentators. The analyst placed Mitchnick’s XRP estimates alongside his earlier views on Bitcoin. At the time of publication, the report suggested that Bitcoin was undervalued, with its trading range compressed relative to projected long-term value. By linking these assessments, AllInCrypto argued that the high estimate of $32.91 should be taken seriously.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a crucial barometer for market sentiment, currently stands at 52. This score places it squarely in neutral territory, a slight dip from yesterday but a consistent signal of balanced investor emotions. But what does this mean for your crypto strategy, and why should you pay attention to this single number? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is designed to help investors gauge the overall sentiment dominating the cryptocurrency market. It’s a powerful tool that quantifies emotions, moving from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). When the market is in ""Extreme Fear,"" it often suggests potential buying opportunities, as investors are overly cautious. Conversely, ""Extreme Greed"" might signal an impending correction, as the market could be overheating. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated composite of several key market indicators. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final score, offering a comprehensive snapshot of investor psychology: Volatility (25%): Measures the current market’s price fluctuations and drawdown relative to average values. Higher volatility can indicate fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volume and market momentum, often showing increased activity during periods of greed or panic. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related keywords, gauging public interest and sentiment. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls, providing a direct insight into individual perspectives. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors might be shifting away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to cryptocurrencies, with higher search interest often correlating with speculative greed. What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Score of 52 Imply? A score of 52, as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently shows, signifies a balanced market. It’s neither overwhelmingly fearful nor excessively greedy. This neutral zone suggests that investors are not making rash decisions based on extreme emotions. Instead, there’s a mix of caution and optimism, leading to a more stable environment compared to periods of extreme sentiment. In a neutral market, prices might consolidate, moving sideways without significant upward or downward trends. This can be a time for reflection rather than reaction. It allows investors to assess fundamentals, look for long-term value, and avoid getting swept up in short-term emotional trading. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from the Index Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be incredibly beneficial for your trading and investment decisions. It acts as a counter-indicator for many seasoned traders. Here’s how you might interpret different zones: Extreme Fear (0-24): Often seen as a potential buying opportunity. When others are fearful, smart money might be accumulating. Fear (25-49): A cautious period. Investors might be hesitant, but strong projects could still offer good entry points. Neutral (50-59): This is where we are now. It suggests a time for careful analysis. Avoid impulsive moves. Consider dollar-cost averaging or rebalancing your portfolio. Greed (60-74): A period of increasing optimism. While prices may rise, it’s also a time to be cautious about overextension. Extreme Greed (75-100): Often a signal for potential market tops or corrections. Many investors consider taking profits or reducing exposure during these times. However, it’s crucial to remember that the index is just one tool. It should always be used in conjunction with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a clear understanding of your own risk tolerance. Why the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Matters for Your Strategy This index provides a unique perspective on market psychology, which is a powerful driver of crypto prices. By understanding whether the collective sentiment leans towards fear or greed, you can potentially make more informed decisions. It helps you avoid emotional pitfalls, such as selling during a panic or buying into an unsustainable pump. For long-term investors, a neutral score might mean continuing to build positions steadily. For short-term traders, it might indicate a period of lower volatility, requiring different strategies. The index empowers you to think critically about market conditions rather than simply reacting to price movements. Conclusion: A Balanced Perspective in a Volatile Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently at 52, signals a moment of equilibrium in the often-turbulent crypto market. This neutral stance offers a valuable opportunity for investors to step back, assess their strategies, and make rational choices free from extreme emotional pressure. While not a standalone predictor, this index is an indispensable guide for understanding the underlying sentiment that shapes cryptocurrency valuations. Use it wisely to navigate the digital asset landscape with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index?

Recently, a significant indicator for many investors, the Altcoin Season Index , registered a notable drop. This key metric, provided by CoinMarketCap, now stands at 71, a decrease of two points from yesterday. But what exactly does this number signify for your crypto holdings and the broader market outlook? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index : What Does 71 Really Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool designed to help investors gauge the prevailing sentiment in the crypto market. It’s not just a random number; it’s calculated based on a very specific methodology: It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Crucially, stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from this analysis to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The comparison is made against Bitcoin’s performance over the last 90 days. An official “altcoin season” is declared when a remarkable 75% of these top altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day window. Conversely, if Bitcoin is outperforming the majority, it’s considered a “Bitcoin season.” A reading closer to 100 indicates a strong altcoin season, while a lower number points towards Bitcoin’s dominance. Why Did the Altcoin Season Index Dip to 71? The recent two-point fall in the Altcoin Season Index to 71 suggests a subtle yet important shift in market momentum. While 71 is still above the threshold typically associated with a full Bitcoin season (often considered below 50), it indicates that fewer altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin compared to very recently. This slight decrease could be attributed to several factors: Bitcoin’s Resurgence: Often, when Bitcoin experiences a strong price rally, it tends to pull capital from altcoins, as investors prioritize the perceived safety and liquidity of the leading cryptocurrency. Profit-Taking: After periods of altcoin strength, some investors may be taking profits, rotating back into Bitcoin or stablecoins. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news or global events can also influence investor sentiment, leading to a flight to quality, which often means Bitcoin. This dip serves as a reminder that market conditions are fluid and require constant monitoring. It’s not necessarily a sign of impending doom for altcoins, but rather an indication of a rebalancing act. Navigating the Current Crypto Climate: Strategies with the Altcoin Season Index For savvy investors, the Altcoin Season Index offers crucial insights, but it’s important not to view it as a standalone predictor. Instead, consider it as one piece of a larger puzzle. Here are some actionable insights: Diversification is Key: Even during a Bitcoin-dominant phase, some altcoins can still perform well due to specific project developments or niche market demand. Maintaining a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks. Monitor Trends: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index regularly. A sustained drop might suggest a prolonged period of Bitcoin strength, while a reversal could signal new opportunities in altcoins. Fundamental Analysis: Don’t solely rely on market indices. Always research the fundamentals of any altcoin you consider investing in, including its technology, team, use case, and community support. Risk Management: Understand that altcoins generally carry higher risk and volatility than Bitcoin. Adjust your position sizes and stop-loss orders accordingly. The crypto market is cyclical, and periods of altcoin outperformance will undoubtedly return. The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index simply tells us where we stand today. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us About Tomorrow? While the Altcoin Season Index dipping to 71 might seem like a setback for altcoin enthusiasts, it’s a natural part of the crypto market’s ebb and flow. It underscores Bitcoin’s foundational role and its tendency to lead market movements. For investors, this moment presents an opportunity to re-evaluate portfolios, conduct thorough research, and prepare for future market shifts. Whether we’re heading towards a stronger Bitcoin season or merely pausing before another altcoin rally, staying informed with tools like the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for making strategic decisions in this exciting financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric provided by CoinMarketCap that measures the performance of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the last 90 days. It helps indicate whether altcoins or Bitcoin are currently dominating the market. How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? It’s calculated by determining if 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins (by market cap, excluding stablecoins/wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin in the past 90 days. A higher index score indicates a stronger altcoin season, while a lower score suggests Bitcoin dominance. What does an Altcoin Season Index of 71 mean? An index of 71 means that while a significant number of altcoins are still outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days, the momentum has slightly decreased. It’s not a full altcoin season (which would be 75 or higher), nor is it a strong Bitcoin season (typically below 50), but rather a more balanced or transitioning period. Is it an Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season right now? With the Altcoin Season Index at 71, it’s closer to an altcoin season, but the recent dip indicates that Bitcoin has gained some relative strength. It suggests a mixed market where some altcoins are still performing well, but Bitcoin is also asserting its presence. How can I use the Altcoin Season Index in my trading? Use the Altcoin Season Index as an indicator of overall market sentiment. A rising index might encourage more altcoin exposure, while a falling index could prompt a more cautious approach or a focus on Bitcoin. Always combine this with fundamental analysis and robust risk management strategies. If you found this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

The shortfall is highlighted in a new report from the City of London Corporation, the local authority that presides over the country’s financial district. The report quotes a 15 billion-pound annual funding gap for the small- and medium-sized enterprises seeking to grow. It also shows a similar infrastructure investment gap from housing, energy, and transport projects to digital networks. Chris Hayward, policy chairman for the City, warned that the cost of inaction would be great: doing nothing would lead to lost opportunities, decreased productivity, and slower economic growth. The warning comes as the UK economy grapples to break out of stagnation. While markets worldwide struggle and tax increases are anticipated within the autumn budget, the government is pressured to create new money. City pushes for pension reform and more defined infrastructure plans The City calls for reform of pensions and a greater effort to direct savings into UK assets to plug the gap. It cites examples from Canada and Australia, where domestic pension funds are significant investors in infrastructure at home. The UK government has already taken steps to implement some of these recommendations. In the Mansion House Accord, 17 of the biggest pension funds in the country promised to allocate as much as 10% of their portfolios to private markets by 2030. At least half of that will likely be invested in UK assets, which could unlock a further £50 billion of fresh capital. But the City says that’s not good enough, as it would like the government to lay out a more transparent pipeline of projects, so investors know what’s coming. Transparency is necessary, it adds, to generate confidence and attract long-term private capital. Just last month, BlackRock announced it had poured $700m into UK data centres – so clearly there’s still plenty of appetite among international investors to back them if the terms are sweet enough. The new Labour government, little more than a year in office, is making strenuous efforts to increase investment. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government had wanted to steer capital into British infrastructure, green energy, and growth industries. A reshuffle has brought fresh faces to the forefront of this push. The minister for investment, who used to be Poppy Gustafsson, is businessman Jason Stockwood. Meanwhile, Lucy Rigby became city minister instead of Emma Reynolds, who was made environment secretary. The government is also establishing a new investment hub to match global funds with projects in the UK. Officials say the goal is to make Britain an easier and more appealing investment place. Pension capital sparks challenges and debates These are all advances, but there are still huge hurdles. UK pension funds have been on the decline for domestic stocks for decades. Today, pensions are invested in British stocks to only 4% in those portfolios, compared with about 50% during the 1990s. Many trustees prefer investing offshore, where they can make better returns for less risk. This trend has sparked debate. Reformers claim that switching pensions back into the UK would fuel growth and finance badly-needed infrastructure. Critics have said it could place savers at risk, or amount to trustees breaching their legal duty to act in members’ best interests. Some executives have even sounded the alarm. The chief executive of Aviva has also recently cautioned against “coercing” pension schemes to invest in Britain, arguing that it was not always the best way to maximize returns.

51793761,581294,1757984409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51793761.jpeg,Solana Price Prediction: September Outlook Brightens as Galaxy Digital Fuels Another Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-price-prediction-september-outlook-brightens-as-galaxy-digital-fuels-another-rally/,"Solana (SOL) continues to command market attention after Galaxy Digital purchased $300 million worth of SOL in 13 transactions across Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit. The digital assets investment firm has now acquired over 6.5 million SOL in the past five days, worth approximately $1.57 billion, according to on-chain data. These purchases come as part of a broader Solana-focused strategy. Galaxy, alongside Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital, recently led a $1.65 billion private placement for Forward Industries. The move places Forward Industries as a key institutional actor in the ecosystem, with Galaxy moving large batches of SOL into custody wallets on Fireblocks, signaling long-term holding intent. Novogratz: “Season of Solana” Begins Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has described the current market phase as the “season of Solana.” He emphasized that faster and cheaper blockchains like Solana are now primed for Wall Street adoption, especially as U.S. regulators hint at modernizing crypto rules. SEC Chair Paul Atkins recently noted that most crypto tokens may fall outside securities law, a stance Novogratz called a “radical departure” from past approaches. He believes this clarity will accelerate institutional adoption, especially for networks like Solana, which offer high throughput and sub-cent transaction costs without relying on Layer 2 scaling solutions. Analysts Eye $300 as Next Solana Target With SOL trading around $233.15, the token has climbed 12% in the past week and over 23% in the past month. Analysts suggest that a breakout above $253 could pave the way toward $272–$300, levels last seen in late 2023. Matt Hougan , CIO at Bitwise, noted that spot Solana ETFs awaiting SEC approval could unleash further inflows by October. He compared the momentum to Bitcoin’s treasury-driven rallies, saying Solana’s unique blend of speed, scalability, and institutional interest could amplify its price trajectory. For now, Solana sits just 16% below its all-time high, with bullish technical indicators supporting the case for another leg upward. If Galaxy’s buying spree continues and regulatory clarity arrives, September could introduce another Solana rally.

XRP Whales Have Sold 160 Million Tokens Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the latest move from the XRP whales. The analyst has cited Santiment’s Supply Distribution indicator, which measures the total amount of the asset’s supply that a given wallet group as a whole is holding right now. Whales are defined as addresses carrying between 1 million and 10 million tokens of the cryptocurrency. At the current exchange rate, the range converts to about $2.99 million at the lower end and $29.9 million at the upper end. Thus, only the market participants with a substantial amount of capital fall in this range. Related Reading: Analyst Sets Bold $1,314 Target For Solana After Cup-And-Handle Breakout These large investors can carry some degree of influence in the market, so their movements can be worth keeping an eye on. One way to do so is through the Supply Distribution. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of the 1 million to 10 million XRP group over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP whales took their supply to a high earlier in the month, but since then, these holders have participated in selling. Interestingly, most of this distribution came as the asset’s rally to the $3.1 level took place. This timing would imply that the whales were using the price surge as an opportunity to take profits and exit from the market. In total, these humongous entities have offloaded 160 million tokens of the cryptocurrency over the last couple of weeks, worth a whopping $486 million right now. The coin has declined since its high, and if selling from the whales continues, it’s possible that the drawdown may extend. From a technical perspective, however, XRP may actually be near a rebound, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges As Whales Scoop Up 181,000 LTC The reason is that the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has just given a reversal signal for the asset. The TD Sequential is an indicator that counts up candles of the same color in an asset’s price chart to identify points of trend exhaustion. Once nine candles are in, it signals that the earlier trend is over and a reversal may be about to occur. From the above chart, it’s visible that XRP has formed a TD Sequential signal with nine red candles on its 4-hour chart, suggesting a bullish turnaround could potentially take place next. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $3.02, down almost 1% over the last 24 hours.

The company has turned to its most powerful weapon to revive that dream: Jack Ma. After vanishing from public view towards the end of 2020 during an antitrust crackdown, China’s most famous entrepreneur is back in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s campus in Hangzhou more frequently than he did during the past five years, people familiar with the matter say. His influence is increasingly evident, including in the company’s renewed pursuit of artificial intelligence and its bloody price war against e-commerce competitor JD.com Inc. and Meituan. One insider said that Ma supported the company’s plan to spend as much as 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) on subsidies in response to JD.com Inc. heading into the market in a surprise challenge. Now run by longtime aides Joe Tsai and Eddie Wu, Alibaba has declined to confirm Ma’s official capacity — but several insiders say the 61-year-old founder is once again deeply involved. He insists on being kept informed about the company’s progress in AI— at one point, pestering a senior manager three times in one day to get an update. Alibaba bets big on AI and price wars Ma’s reappearance is widely seen as a symbol of Beijing’s cooling toward its once freewheeling tech titans . A handshake with President Xi Jinping earlier this year sealed his comeback, though Ma is now less assertive than in the days of Davos panels. Internally, his presence has jolted the staff’s morale, rekindling the entrepreneurial attitude of his company’s founding. Yet such a comeback carries risks. Beijing disapproves of the “vicious subsidies” behind Alibaba’s ongoing price war, and there is also a more pressing risk. Beijing frowns on the “malicious subsidies” fueling Alibaba’s latest price war, and Ma risks attracting fresh scrutiny. His 2020 speech blasting Chinese banks as “pawn shops” triggered regulators to halt Ant Group’s record IPO, unleashing a trillion-dollar crackdown that slashed Alibaba’s value by nearly $700 billion. Beijing watches as Ma rekindles influence For employees, seeing Ma is emotional after years of retreat in Tokyo and Hong Kong. Some longtime employees cried when he addressed them at Ant Group last December. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the affiliate company of the Chinese conglomerate Alibaba Group revealed in March that it has developed new techniques for training artificial intelligence models. Ant Group utilized Chinese-made semiconductors from Alibaba and Huawei. On a campus tour this April, he lauded Alibaba’s cloud, chips, and AI models, telling staff, “Technology isn’t just about conquering the stars and the oceans, it’s about preserving the spark in all of us.” Alibaba, which was once worth more than $800 billion, is still clawing its way back from those lost years. With Wu driving AI, Tsai anchoring the board, and up-and-coming star Jiang Fan reshaping e-commerce, Ma has surrounded himself with a loyal cadre of lieutenants. At the same time, the company has promised to spend more than 380 billion yuan on AI and cloud infrastructure, leading to a sharp recovery in cloud revenue and an 88 percent jump in its stock this year — though still well off its highs. Although Ma eschews formal titles, his moral authority is significant. “He’s not a day-to-day micromanager,” said Duncan Clark, author of Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built. “But his word — or displeasure — can turn the company around.” For employees, the sight of Ma once again donning an Alibaba badge is his silent but influential comeback. He once told state media, “Retirement does not mean I’ve left Alibaba. If Alibaba calls me, I’ll always be there.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|Alibaba,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-16 01:01:23

The U.S. Senate has confirmed Stephen Miran as a governor of the Federal Reserve, a development first reported by the crypto market insights platform Unfolded. This crucial appointment, approved by a narrow 48-47 vote, marks a pivotal moment for economic policy and could have ripple effects across various sectors, including the dynamic crypto market. Understanding the implications of the Stephen Miran Federal Reserve confirmation is essential for anyone tracking financial trends. Who is Stephen Miran and Why Does His Federal Reserve Appointment Matter? Stephen Miran’s confirmation to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is a significant event. As a known ally of former President Trump, his presence on the board could influence the direction of monetary policy for years to come. The confirmation process itself was closely watched, reflecting the political divisions within the Senate. The tight 48-47 vote underscores the importance and often contentious nature of such high-level financial appointments. Miran joins a board responsible for steering the U.S. economy. His background and political leanings are now part of the Fed’s diverse perspectives. This appointment fills a critical vacancy, bringing the board closer to full capacity. Decoding the Federal Reserve’s Influence and New Leadership Dynamics The Federal Reserve, often simply called ‘the Fed,’ serves as the central bank of the United States. Its primary roles include managing monetary policy, maintaining financial stability, and supervising banks. When a new governor like Stephen Miran Federal Reserve joins, it introduces a fresh voice and perspective to these critical discussions. The collective views of the Board of Governors shape decisions on interest rates, inflation targets, and other economic tools that affect everything from employment to investment. Moreover, the balance of the board can shift with each new member. This dynamic is particularly important during periods of economic uncertainty or rapid change, such as the current landscape influenced by global events and technological advancements. How Might Stephen Miran’s Stance Impact the Crypto Market? The crypto market, while often seen as distinct from traditional finance, is undeniably influenced by macroeconomic policies set by institutions like the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s decisions on interest rates, for instance, can impact investor sentiment towards riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. While Stephen Miran’s specific views on cryptocurrency may not be widely publicized, his general economic philosophy will contribute to the overall stance of the Federal Reserve. For example, if the Fed adopts a more hawkish (anti-inflation) or dovish (pro-growth) approach, these shifts can directly affect crypto valuations. Consider these potential impacts: Interest Rates: Higher rates can make traditional investments more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from crypto. Regulatory Environment: The Fed, alongside other agencies, contributes to the broader regulatory conversation around digital assets. Economic Stability: A stable economic outlook, partly managed by the Fed, generally fosters a more favorable environment for all investments, including crypto. Navigating Future Economic Shifts: What Should Investors Watch For? With the confirmation of Stephen Miran Federal Reserve , market participants should pay close attention to future statements and actions from the Fed. His contributions will be part of the larger policy narrative. Investors should monitor the following key indicators: Fed Meeting Minutes: These provide insights into discussions and potential future policy directions. Inflation Reports: The Fed’s primary focus often revolves around managing inflation. Employment Data: Another key mandate of the central bank. Miran’s Public Comments: Any statements he makes could offer clues about his specific policy leanings. Understanding these signals can help investors anticipate market movements and adjust their strategies accordingly, especially within the volatile crypto space. The confirmation of Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve is more than just a political appointment; it’s a strategic move that could reshape economic policy and indirectly influence the burgeoning crypto market. As the Fed continues to navigate complex economic challenges, the new perspectives brought by governors like Miran will be crucial. Keeping an eye on these developments will be key for investors and enthusiasts alike to understand the evolving financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Federal Reserve Board of Governors? The Federal Reserve Board of Governors is the governing body of the Federal Reserve System, responsible for overseeing the 12 Federal Reserve Banks and setting national monetary policy. It consists of seven members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. 2. How does a Federal Reserve appointment impact the economy? Each new governor brings their economic philosophy and expertise to the board, influencing decisions on interest rates, money supply, and financial regulation. These decisions directly affect inflation, employment, and the overall stability of the U.S. economy. 3. What does Stephen Miran’s background as a ‘Trump ally’ imply? While the Fed is designed to be independent, a ‘Trump ally’ designation suggests Miran might hold more conservative economic views, potentially favoring deregulation or specific approaches to monetary policy that align with past administrations. However, governors operate within the Fed’s mandate. 4. Why is the crypto market mentioned in relation to the Stephen Miran Federal Reserve appointment? The crypto market, despite its decentralized nature, is not immune to macroeconomic forces. Federal Reserve policies, such as interest rate hikes or quantitative tightening, influence overall market liquidity and investor appetite for risk, which in turn affects cryptocurrency valuations and investor behavior. 5. What should I do as a crypto investor following this news? Crypto investors should remain informed about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions and any public statements from its governors. These insights can help in understanding broader market trends and making more informed investment decisions, rather than reacting solely to crypto-specific news.

One look at names like Peanut the Squirrel or Turbo shows how wild and witty this space really is. These tokens mix humor, hype, and surprising performance, creating a playground where fortunes rise and fall faster than a bull charging a red cape. With Peanut the Squirrel holding steady despite market dips and Turbo stirring up noise, it’s clear meme culture isn’t slowing down. The buzz about MoonBull Whitelist being live right now is electric. Crypto students, degens, and even analysts know early entry is everything. Being whitelisted means front-row seats before the crowd stampede. This isn’t just another presale; it’s a ticket to Stage One with benefits that make FOMO feel real. Let’s break down MoonBull , Peanut the Squirrel, and Turbo to see why all three belong on the list of meme coins to watch in 2025. MoonBull Whitelist: Your Golden Ticket to Stage One MoonBull ($MOBU) is an Ethereum-based meme coin crafted for traders who thrive on adrenaline and upside. Designed for degens and meme coin fans chasing serious gains, it fuses meme energy with secure smart contracts. Unlike countless pump-and-dump plays, MoonBull delivers structure: staking rewards, secret token drops, and exclusive perks locked behind whitelist access. The whitelist is more than a sign-up form – it’s a VIP pass to join before the public even knows the door is open. Whitelist members get the lowest price, bonus token allocations, and private hints about the roadmap. Everything happens on a first-come, first-served basis, making this a chance that could vanish in seconds. For crypto communities in places like São Paulo, Mexico City, and Los Angeles, where meme culture blends with trading hustle, missing this chance could feel like letting a peanut slip through your fingers. The hype doesn’t stop at discounts. Whitelist members are the only ones who’ll hear whispers of upcoming updates before launch. Stage One isn’t closed to outsiders, but only whitelisted users know the exact launch date in advance. In markets where timing is everything, that edge is priceless. Picture a bull run starting, and only a handful of insiders knowing when the gate opens. That’s MoonBull’s promise. How to Secure a Spot in the MoonBull Whitelist Getting whitelisted is simple yet strategic. Submit your email through the secure whitelist form, and wait for a private notification with the launch details. Those who sign up early stand at the front of the herd. Spots are limited, so hesitation means missing out. Think of it as a rodeo – only those who grab the reins first get to ride the bull. MoonBull’s first stage is engineered for urgency. Investors who’ve watched past moonshots slip away now have a shot at redemption. Whitelist access ensures not just early entry but exclusive perks unavailable anywhere else. For anyone chasing the next 1000x, this isn’t just another listing – it’s a lifeline. Peanut the Squirrel: Nutty by Name, Serious by Numbers Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) may sound quirky, but its numbers prove it’s no joke. The live price sits at $0.2442 with a market cap of about $236 million. Ranked #308, it shows real staying power compared to other meme coins. Traders often underestimate coins like this until they realize the market has already priced in long-term potential. Daily trading volume is swinging hard. In the past 24 hours, PNUT saw $75 million in activity, marking a sharp 40% drop from the day before. While that signals cooling interest in the short term, it also suggests the coin is stabilizing after heavy moves. Like squirrels stashing nuts for winter, smart traders may see this dip as a buying opportunity. The fully diluted valuation also stands at $236 million, aligned with its market cap, suggesting supply dynamics are transparent. This kind of clarity reassures cautious investors. For crypto communities, where volatility is expected but transparency is prized, Peanut the Squirrel has carved out its niche. Turbo: Speeding Ahead or Running Out of Fuel? Turbo (TURBO) takes its name seriously, aiming for fast growth and meme-level attention. Its live price is $0.004169 with a market cap of around $277 million, placing it higher than Peanut the Squirrel in overall rankings. The all-time high was $0.01432, but current prices are nearly 72% lower, showing how volatile Turbo’s engine can be. Turbo’s fully diluted valuation mirrors its market cap, just over $277 million. With 69 billion tokens in circulation, investors must weigh the risks of dilution against the upside of meme-driven demand. This isn’t a coin for those faint of heart. As they say in Montevideo, this coin can buck like a bull or collapse like a hippo in a mud pit – fast, messy, and without warning. Despite recent underperformance, Turbo’s branding power and liquidity mean it’s far from out of the race. Meme investors love high-risk, high-reward plays, and Turbo keeps delivering the kind of rollercoaster action they crave. For anyone betting on meme coin culture in 2025, Turbo deserves a seat at the table. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, MoonBull stands out as the new meme coin to watch in 2025. With its whitelist live, it hands early supporters a rare chance to secure the lowest entry price, unlock bonus allocations, and gain access to secret staking rewards before the public rush begins. That first-come, first-served model fuels genuine FOMO, especially for traders who know timing is everything in this market. At the same time, Peanut the Squirrel shows grit by holding steady in a competitive market, while Turbo brings high liquidity and nonstop action for traders who thrive on volatility. Each coin caters to a different appetite – stability, speed, or explosive potential – but MoonBull ’s whitelist advantage tips the scales. For those who sat on the sidelines during past moonshots, this lineup feels like déjà vu with a second chance. Missing it could mean watching the herd ride off into the sunset while you’re left standing at the gate.

Presale participants see quoted APYs up to 722%, although rewards taper as adoption scales. The fixed supply of 10 billion tokens adds scarcity. This mix has placed Layer Brett high on lists of the best meme coins to buy. Furthermore, its roadmap includes NFT features, gamified staking, and bridges to other chains. While memes fuel culture, utility ensures staying power. That dual approach could give it an edge over tokens like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. Bitcoin News and Market Resilience Recent Bitcoin news shows the asset trading between $118,000 and $120,000. Analysts point to strong institutional demand, even after a whale unloaded billions in BTC. Despite selling pressure, Bitcoin’s realized cap crossed $1 trillion, a milestone that reflects long-term holder confidence. Market watchers say dips are being treated as buying opportunities. But they also caution that resistance near $125,000 could hold in the short term. This backdrop makes investors curious about alternatives, especially the best meme coins to buy. XRP Price Prediction and Ripple Momentum While Bitcoin news grabs headlines, another theme is the XRP price prediction circulating among analysts. XRP recently showed reduced selling pressure from whales, down by more than 90%. At the same time, institutions accumulated roughly $500 million worth of XRP. This accumulation has many suggesting XRP could stage a breakout. A popular XRP price prediction points to a potential 15% rally if resistance breaks. Combined with Ripple’s ongoing legal clarity and adoption by banks, the sentiment has shifted. Investors are weighing whether XRP could run alongside newer plays like Layer Brett. Why Layer Brett is the best meme coin to buy Dogecoin remains the original meme coin, while Shiba Inu built Shibarium to add utility. Yet both face challenges: slower speeds, higher fees, and diminishing staking rewards. Layer Brett enters differently. It has meme appeal but also positions itself as a Layer 2 solution with practical use cases. That’s why more commentators include it in discussions of the best meme coins to buy in 2025. Yet, the best approach to a healthy portfolio may be diversification: keep exposure to Bitcoin, consider XRP based on its price prediction, and allocate a portion to promising newcomers like Layer Brett. That way, investors ride both established giants and speculative growth. Conclusion The latest Bitcoin news highlights resilience, while an XRP price prediction suggests a rally could be near. Yet the spotlight is also on newer opportunities. Among the best meme coins to buy, Layer Brett stands out with its presale success, low price entry, and Layer 2 efficiency. Crypto thrives on cycles of trust, hype, and innovation. Bitcoin anchors the market. XRP builds bridges in finance. Layer Brett brings memes with purpose. For investors searching beyond headlines, this may be the moment to blend tradition with disruption.

51795000,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=178063,1757986223,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/51795000.jpeg,Cardano vs. Dogecoin: Which Will Outperform in 2026?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cardano-vs-dogecoin-which-will-outperform-in-2026/,"Cardano and Dogecoin couldn’t be more different, yet both remain central to discussions about which altcoins could dominate future cycles. Cardano, with its reputation for careful development and academic rigor, represents the world of utility-driven blockchains. Dogecoin, born as a meme, thrives on culture, community, and unexpected staying power. As the crypto market prepares for the next big rotation, investors are asking: which of these coins is better positioned for 2026? Some analysts point to Cardano’s ecosystem upgrades, while others highlight Dogecoin’s enduring appeal in meme-driven markets. Yet beneath this debate, a third option is emerging, one that combines meme culture with audits from biggest companies in the sector: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cardano: Utility and Patience Cardano (ADA) has always marched to its own rhythm. While Ethereum and Solana pushed forward aggressively with new features, Cardano’s approach has been methodical. Built on peer-reviewed research, its roadmap has unfolded carefully, sometimes frustrating investors seeking quick returns. Yet this patience has also been Cardano’s strength. In 2026, Cardano’s prospects revolve around Voltaire , its governance era that promises full decentralization of decision-making. Through treasury mechanisms, community voting, and on-chain governance, Cardano aims to become a truly self-sustaining ecosystem. Analysts argue that this level of decentralization could make Cardano more resilient long-term, even if it doesn’t produce the kind of explosive short-term gains meme coins generate. With institutional interest in blockchain governance growing, ADA may carve out a niche as the blockchain for long-term utility and credible adoption. But the challenge remains: will slow and steady be enough in a market addicted to hype? Dogecoin: The Meme That Won’t Die Dogecoin (DOGE) is living proof that memes can outlast expectations. Born as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin leveraged humor, simplicity, and an enthusiastic community to outlive many so-called “serious” projects. Even without smart contracts or DeFi, it continues to hold a top market cap position, a testament to culture’s power in crypto. Its staying power is reinforced by endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk, who frequently reignites Dogecoin’s visibility. Every cycle, DOGE seems to defy skeptics, producing spectacular rallies. For 2026, analysts suggest its success will depend largely on whether it can maintain cultural dominance against a new wave of meme tokens. Dogecoin’s strength lies in familiarity: it’s the meme coin everyone knows. But that same familiarity may also limit upside. With so many new meme projects promising higher multiples, DOGE may remain a cultural staple but struggle to deliver the kind of returns it once did. Security Meets High Reward Then there’s MAGACOIN FINANCE, the rising presale that is turning heads for combining meme appeal with structural legitimacy. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few presales to pass both CertiK and HashEx audits, earning recognition as a project that puts security first. Investors say this is the kind of foundation missing in most meme coins. At the same time, its market cycle analysis shows 13,500% ROI potential , putting MAGACOIN FINANCE in a class of its own for this bull run. Unlike typical presales that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN has built its story on scarcity and credibility. Every funding round has sold out faster than the last, with both whales and retail investors competing for allocations. It’s this rare combination, meme-driven branding plus structural trust, that makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out. While Cardano offers patient utility and Dogecoin offers cultural nostalgia, MAGACOIN FINANCE is pitching itself as the bridge: hype that lasts because it is built on secure foundations. How They Compare Looking ahead to 2026, Cardano анд Dogecoin each represent a different kind of opportunity: Dual audits complete: CertiK and HashEx validation give MAGACOIN FINANCE a credibility edge over most meme projects. Cardano: A long-term governance play with slow but steady growth potential. It could appeal to institutions and patient investors who value decentralization and utility. Dogecoin: The cultural stalwart of meme coins. While its upside may be capped compared to newer projects, it will likely continue to thrive on visibility and community loyalty. For investors, the choice comes down to strategy. Do you prioritize steady, utility-driven progress? Do you stick with a cultural icon? Or do you chase the presale that could multiply many times over? Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out 13,500% ROI potential: Market cycle forecasts put it among the highest-upside plays of 2025–2026. Scarcity model: Presale rounds sell out rapidly, proving demand far outpaces supply. Cultural traction: Meme branding ensures mass appeal, while credibility anchors investor confidence. This is why analysts call MAGACOIN FINANCE a “dual-threat token” , capable of attracting meme traders chasing multiples while reassuring cautious investors who want real safeguards in place. Conclusion The debate between Cardano and Dogecoin reflects the larger divide in crypto: utility versus culture. Cardano’s governance and utility upgrades could cement it as a serious blockchain contender in 2026. Dogecoin’s community and cultural cachet mean it will likely never disappear, even if it delivers smaller multiples than before. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the script. With dual audits, 13,500% ROI projections , and a presale defined by scarcity and momentum, it combines the best of both worlds. It has the hype and cultural resonance of meme coins, paired with the structural trust usually found in utility projects. For many, that makes MAGACOIN FINANCE the most intriguing option heading into 2026, an altcoin capable of delivering the kind of life-changing returns neither Cardano’s slow build nor Dogecoin’s nostalgia may achieve again.

The SEC accused the cryptocurrency platform of failing to register a cryptocurrency asset lending program before offering it to retail investors. According to reports, the settlement resolves the agency’s lawsuit over the Gemini Earn program. The settlement still needs to be approved by SEC In a letter filed on Monday in a Manhattan federal court, lawyers representing both parties indicated the settlement would “completely resolve” the lawsuit but still subject to SEC approval. The lawyers reportedly asked the US District Judge Edgardo Ramos to give them up to December 15 to submit their final paperwork, and to put all deadlines on hold. The exact terms of the settlement remain confidential pending a final approval from commissioners. However, experts familiar with similar cases are projecting the penalty will be in the region of $10 million to $20 million, which is far less severe than initially feared. These are also significantly lower penalties than those that were imposed during the previous administration. The settlement was revealed four days after Gemini raised $425 million in an initial public offering , valuing the New York based firm at about $3.3 billion in its market debut. According to a Reuters report, Gemini shares closed up 52 cents at $32.52 on Monday, which was 16% above the $28 IPO price. Gemini Earn, which launched in 2021 allowed customers to lend bitcoin and other crypto assets to the cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital in exchange for interest payments, with Gemini Trust taking fees as high as 4.29%. Gemini paused withdrawals in November 2022, the same month that Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX cryptocurrency exchange collapsed before filing for bankruptcy two months later. The exchange held $900 million assets from about 340,000 Gemini Earn customers at the time. In January 2023, the SEC sued Gemini and Genesis on allegations that they bypassed disclosure requirements for Gemini Earn that were meant to protect investors. Genesis accepted a $21 million fine to settle without admitting any wrongdoing. The SEC – Gemini settlement signals regulator’s softer approach to crypto The SEC has stopped oversight of the cryptocurrency industry since Donald Trump became president in January and appointed crypto-friendly officials to lead the agency including the new chair, Paul Atkins, who has called for clearer guidelines rather than enforcement actions. So far, the SEC has created a Crypto Task Force designed to develop appropriate frameworks for digital assets and has halted several investigations into major industry players. The resolution of the Gemini Trust case is not unique as it follows a similar pattern to other crypto settlements recently reached. These include cases against Ripple Labs, which was finalized with a leaner penalty as well as more favorable terms for the cryptocurrency firm. Industry experts view these developments as a sign that the US is becoming more receptive to cryptocurrency innovation while still maintaining consumer protections. According to Namecoin News , this also to be a shift from viewing most digital assets as securities that require strict registration to recognizing that different types of cryptocurrencies may need different regulatory treatments. And for an average crypto user, this settlement also means that established firms like Gemini can continue operating with greater regulatory certainty.

BTC Holds the Line at $115K,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/16/asia-morning-briefing-fragility-or-back-on-track-btc-holds-the-line-at-usd115k,"Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin (BTC) traded just above $115k in Asia Tuesday morning, slipping slightly after a strong start to the week. The modest pullback followed a run of inflows into U.S. spot ETFs and lingering optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut rates next week. The moves left traders divided: is this recovery built on fragile foundations, or is crypto firmly back on track after last week’s CPI-driven jitters? That debate is playing out across research desks. Glassnode’s weekly pulse emphasizes fragility . While ETF inflows surged nearly 200% last week and futures open interest jumped, the underlying spot market looks weak. Buying conviction remains shallow, Glassnode writes, funding rates have softened, and profit-taking is on the rise with more than 92% of supply in profit. Options traders have also scaled back downside hedges, pushing volatility spreads lower, which Glassnode warns leaves the market exposed if risk returns. The core message: ETFs and futures are supporting the rally, but without stronger spot flows, BTC remains vulnerable. QCP takes the other side. The Singapore-based desk says crypto is “back on track” after CPI confirmed tariff-led inflation without major surprises. They highlight five consecutive days of sizeable BTC ETF inflows, ETH’s biggest inflow in two weeks, and strength in XRP and SOL even after ETF delays. Traders, they argue, are interpreting regulatory postponements as inevitability rather than rejection. With the Altcoin Season Index at a 90-day high, QCP sees BTC consolidation above $115k as the launchpad for rotation into higher-beta assets. The divide underscores how Bitcoin’s current range near $115k–$116k is a battleground. Glassnode calls it fragile optimism; QCP calls it momentum. Which side is right may depend on whether ETF inflows keep offsetting profit-taking in the weeks ahead. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin is consolidating near the $115,000 level as traders square positions ahead of expected U.S. Fed policy moves; institutional demand via spot Bitcoin ETFs is supporting upside ETH: ETH is trading near $4500 in a key resistance band; gains are being helped by renewed institutional demand, tightening supply (exchange outflows), and positive technical setups. Gold: Gold continues to hold near record highs, underpinned by expectations of Fed interest rate cuts, inflation risk, and investor demand for safe havens; gains tempered somewhat by profit‑taking and a firmer U.S. dollar Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 topped 45,000 for the first time Monday, leading Asia-Pacific gains as upbeat U.S.-China trade talks and a TikTok divestment framework lifted sentiment. S&P 500: The S&P 500 rose 0.5% to close above 6,600 for the first time on Monday as upbeat U.S.-China trade talks and anticipation of a Fed meeting lifted stocks.

This exciting development marks a new era for investors seeking access to innovative Yunfeng Financial crypto services . What’s Driving Yunfeng Financial’s Crypto Ambition? Yunfeng Financial recently announced a substantial capital injection, raising an impressive HKD 1.17 billion, equivalent to $150 million, through a strategic new share issuance.

The S-1 form indicates the initial registration statement required by the regulatory body for new securities offerings. The filing marks Bitwise’s latest effort to expand its crypto ETF offerings beyond existing products. Coinbase will be the acting custodian of these products if the commission approves this proposal. Bitwise submits a proposal for its Avalanche ETF to the SEC In Bitwise’s S-1 filing dated September 15, the crypto-asset manager mentioned that the Trust allows investors to access the Avalanche market via a regular brokerage account. According to the firm, this enables them to avoid problems and risks associated with purchasing and holding Avalanche directly. Apart from that, the company argued that they believed the Trust’s design could assist certain investors in effectively implementing their strategic and tactical asset allocation strategies with Avalanche. Bitwise highlighted that this can be achieved by investing in Shares instead of purchasing, holding, and trading Avalanche. The SEC filing disclosed that the fund will determine its net asset value (NAV) depending on the CME CF Avalanche–Dollar Reference Rate, adding that it will retain AVAX tokens directly and will not apply any derivatives. In the meantime, it is worth noting that to obtain the NAV of an ETF, one needs to calculate the total value of its assets minus any liabilities, then divide it by the number of available shares, which will indicate the value per share of the fund. Bitwise’s proposal triggers other crypto asset managers to apply for a spot AVAX ETF Bitwise was initially founded in 2017. Since then, it has positioned itself as a leading international crypto-asset manager offering several crypto investment alternatives, such as crypto index funds and ETFs that track Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other asset management services. The crypto-asset manager has also achieved other significant milestones this year. To illustrate, it recently developed an Avalanche trust in Delaware, initiating a first step towards releasing the product. Concerning Bitwise’s proposal for its Avalanche ETF, it has triggered a trend among other crypto asset manager rivals to apply for a spot AVAX ETF. To support this claim, reports from sources have revealed that Grayscale, an asset manager and investment platform, has requested to change its Avalanche Trust into a spot AVAX ETF. Moreover, VanEck, an asset management company, is considering launching an AVAX fund. To further expand its operations, the Avalanche Foundation made public its intention to raise around $1 billion purposefully to develop two AVAX treasury firms in the US last week. The foundation stated that these companies will purchase tokens from them at a reduced price. It is worth noting that digital asset treasuries, similar to ETFs, provide investors with an alternative method of participating in the crypto markets via regular brokerage accounts. Meanwhile, Bitwise has submitted applications requesting to list several single-asset ETFs, including those that can track Chainlink and XRP’s performance. According to data from CoinMarketCap , AVAX is currently trading at $29.54, indicating a 0.25% decrease in the last 24 hours. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The Ethereum Price Prediction for September points to a battle between bulls and bears, as ETH trades in a tight range near $4,300. While investors remain hopeful for another breakout, many are starting to look beyond Ethereum for more substantial upside. One project catching that attention is Remittix (RTX) , the PayFi altcoin tipped to shake up global payments. Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Levels in Focus The Ethereum price is within the $4,250–$4,500 range. If the Ethereum price drops below $4,250, it might retest the $3,745 levels. However, if buyers go beyond $4,500, the next target is $4,957. ETH is forming bullish higher lows on the daily chart, but resistance is still strong. Traders are eyeing the $4,493 zone as the level that could set off the next rally. Despite cautious sentiment, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong. Nasdaq-listed Bitmine Immersion Technologies just purchased 446,255 ETH worth $201 million, becoming the largest corporate holder of Ethereum. That kind of buying shows institutions still see ETH as a long-term bet. Even so, many retail holders are beginning to hedge with newer tokens that promise higher returns. Remittix: The PayFi Altcoin Gaining Momentum Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming one of 2025’s standout projects. It’s addressing a genuine issue, slow and costly cross-border payments, instead of creating hype. Remittix can reduce the high fees associated with traditional money transfers and transaction times from days to hours by utilizing blockchain efficiency. Investors are drawn to the project for more than just utility. Here’s why Remittix is standing out: $250,000 Remittix Giveaway pulling in early adopters Support expanding beyond Ethereum to Solana, Avalanche, and Polygon The Remittix (RTX) Wallet enters beta testing on September 15, 2025, with instant crypto-to-fiat conversion First and second exchange listing already confirmed on BitMart and LBank Why Ethereum Holders Are Backing Remittix While ETH remains a cornerstone of crypto, its size limits explosive growth. That’s why many Ethereum holders are rotating part of their portfolios into Remittix, seeing it as a high-upside play in the PayFi sector. With staking rewards, audited transparency, and a deflationary model that reduces supply weekly, Remittix is gaining traction fast. The Ethereum Price Prediction for the months ahead points to steady gains, but analysts argue Remittix could deliver 20x or even 30x returns in the same window. For investors chasing the next big breakout, it’s quickly becoming the PayFi altcoin to watch.

The revised duty structure, enacted through an executive order signed by President Trump on September 4, directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection to collect the reduced 15% rate on passenger cars, light trucks, and auto parts from Japan. The change took effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on September 16, applying to goods entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouses afterward. According to officials, tariffs overpaid on qualifying imports since August 7 will also be refunded. The administration described the tariff cut as part of its broader strategy to rebalance trade relationships and encourage investment within the U.S. However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick cautioned that Japan could face renewed tariff hikes if it fails to meet its investment commitments in America. A few weeks ago, Ryosei Akazawa, the head of Japan’s trade negotiating team, indicated he was leading his cavalry back to Washington to push for swift action on the auto tariff cut. As reported by Cryptopolitan , Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi had also called for quicker issuance of Trump’s executive order to reduce auto tariffs. Tokyo accepts tariff cut with investment pledge After branding the measure as vital to its economic health, Japan had been urging the United States for months to deliver on a pledge to lower tariffs on shipments of automobiles . Japan’s economy is based on the car industry, contributing much of its gross domestic product, exports, and jobs. Passenger cars and parts are the single category that Japan ships to America, so tariff levels are crucial for corporate profits, wages for employees, and the broader industrial competitiveness of a nation. The announcement came after Tokyo promised to support efforts to help anchor the deal with a $550 billion fund focusing on migrating capital into American infrastructure, energy, and technology. American officials have touted the pledge to assist local industries and jobs. But there is still a residue of uncertainty. Washington presented the fund as a direct sponsorship of Trump’s economic agenda; Tokyo, in broader strokes, has called it an investment vehicle following corporate decisions. The absence of interpretation has led to speculation on whether the fund will be translated and politicized over those funds that eventually materialise in the months ahead. And beyond its headline numbers, it also contained the outlines of shared trade opportunities. Japan is committed to improving market access for United States agricultural products such as beef, pork, and dairy. It also vowed to clamp down on approvals of United States-made vehicles. It also telegraphed that both governments would work together in new tech areas like semiconductors, clean energy, and digital infrastructure, seen as strategic to future growth and global competition. Automakers respond to tariff cut Japanese automakers welcomed the news as an answer to their prayers, arguing that it would fuel less uncertainty around supply chains and pricing if duties were to come down. “It’s a good step forward for long-term planning and competitive operations,” one senior Toyota executive said. US auto policy groups were less enthusiastic. The authors noted that Japanese car companies would have a price advantage. Meanwhile, their American competitors were burdened with the higher prices they paid for steel, aluminum, and other supplies. Some lawmakers on Capitol Hill have also pushed back, warning that the agreement could jeopardize American workers as domestic manufacturers continue to lose market share. The deal, economists said, could help spur a rebound in car sales in the United States by lowering retail prices for some of America’s most popular Japanese models. The clause is also retroactive, so importers paying above the correct tariff rate for the last three months, since August, are entitled to refunds aimed at bringing fresh liquidity into the processor sector.

The firm filed a $500 million shelf registration to issue common stock while also stating that part of the capital will be channeled into the accumulation of Bitcoin. Common stock going for an aggregate initial offering price Next Technology disclosed in its SEC filing that it is establishing a shelf registration for up to $500 million in common stock, paving the way for one or more offerings in the months ahead. The announcement triggered an initial sell-off in NXTT shares, which fell almost 3% in post-market trading on Monday, according to Seeking Alpha. While the filing gives management discretion over the use of proceeds, Next Technology has indicated in past disclosures and commentary that Bitcoin acquisition remains a core corporate strategy. Next Technology’s Bitcoin strategy comes into focus Within a short span, Next Technology has managed to establish itself as one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin relative to its size. The firm reported holding roughly 5,833 BTC, including 5,000 acquired in recent months. The alignment with Bitcoin has boosted NXTT’s profile among crypto-focused investors but also raised its risk profile. Bitcoin-linked equities tend to trade with high volatility, mirroring the digital currency’s price swings. NXTT’s strategy is not so different from the moves made by Semler Scientific , which earlier this year filed a $500 million shelf registration to fund Bitcoin purchases and general corporate purposes. The trend is growing and for Next Technology, the potential to allocate part of the new proceeds toward additional BTC accumulation represents both a bet on long-term digital asset adoption and a branding exercise that aligns the company with the cryptocurrency narrative. Investor reaction and market context The longer-term impact lies in execution, and this includes how much stock is ultimately sold, at what prices, and how the capital is deployed. If a portion of proceeds is used for Bitcoin purchases, NXTT could further concentrate its balance sheet exposure to a single, volatile asset. Investors remain divided on the merits of such a strategy. Advocates argue that Bitcoin’s supply cap and growing institutional adoption justify corporate treasuries allocating capital to it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. NXTT has already tested investor tolerance for dilution. The company also recently announced a $9 million registered direct offering of stock and warrants. That sale was relatively modest compared to the new $500 million ceiling but illustrates management’s willingness to raise funds quickly. Despite the bullish narrative, risks abound. The SEC filing gives management a wide window in how to deploy proceeds, and there is no guarantee that significant sums will ultimately be directed toward BTC purchases. Shareholders face potential dilution from future issuances, while the company’s fortunes may become increasingly tethered to the volatility of digital asset markets.

That flow has pushed Solana into a fresh bout of attention from investors who watch big-wallet moves. Galaxy Digital Buying Spree According to reports, Galaxy Digital has been one of the most active buyers, taking on more than $1 billion in SOL in recent days. Transfers out of exchange addresses and into private wallets were flagged by researchers. Reports have disclosed that this type of accumulation often removes supply from the market, at least temporarily, and can leave prices more sensitive to new demand. Galaxy Digital bought $1.35 Billion in $SOL this week. That’s 5.82 million $SOL accumulated in just 7 days, the largest institutional Solana purchases this year. But they didn’t buy the cycle top.

That zone matters because it was a barrier that, once cleared, turned into a floor for buyers to defend. Short squeezes were also observed, where traders betting against SOL were pushed to close positions. Volume spiked on some of the upward moves, which made runs sharper, and that can speed up both gains and corrections. 🚀 Galaxy Digital just bought $240.58 million in $SOL in 5 hours.

Some analysts put nearer-term targets at $250 or $300 if buying continues and technicals hold. More optimistic scenarios, often framed as longer-term or best-case outcomes, extend the outlook to $350–$450. A claim that SOL could reach $460 has circulated in some corners, but clear public backing for that exact figure appears limited in mainstream outlets. $SOL Solana is showing three major levels of interest before a strong pullback is likely. The most probable targets to watch are ~$260, ~$380, and ~$460 before a major correction sets in. The RRR ratio for longs remains poor, unless additional risk is taken on through leverage. pic.twitter.com/vuQQO3tF4V — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) September 14, 2025 What $460 Would Require For SOL to climb toward $460, a chain of events probably needs to align. Large and sustained institutional inflows would help, and the creation or expansion of SOL treasuries could remove more tokens from circulation. Regulatory clarity or the launch of regulated products that let big pools buy SOL safely would widen the buyer base. Finally, stronger real-world use on the Solana chain — more transactions, apps, and revenue — would add a fundamental argument for much higher valuations. Time also matters; even strong bull cases often play out over many months.

If macro conditions tighten, or if network problems reappear, any rally can be cut short. Overbought readings on some indicators suggest a pullback is possible before further gains. Watch exchange flows, whether large wallets keep withdrawing SOL, and whether the $220–$230 band holds. Those signals should tell traders a lot about the likely next leg.

He expects demand to pick up in Q4 as portfolio managers set positions ahead of 2025. Some managers will make small moves; others could shift larger slices of their holdings into BTC, Visser said. Institutional Survey Signals Strong Bitcoin Interest According to a joint Coinbase and EY-Parthenon survey , a large share of institutional investors plan to add crypto exposure in 2025. The survey found 83% of respondents intend to increase allocations, and 59% expect to put more than 5% of assets under management into crypto or related products. Those figures suggest that many firms are preparing for wider crypto use in portfolios. Intentions Do Not Always Equal Action Plans by money managers can change. Regulation, market swings, and macro shocks can slow or halt buys. Still, when lots of institutions say they will act, it raises the odds that real flows will follow. That said, timing and size of the moves remain uncertain. ETF Flows Feeding Demand Spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled heavy inflows this year, giving institutions an easier on-ramp into the market. Recent daily net inflows reached about $642 million on one trading day, and cumulative ETF net inflows since launch are roughly $57 billion, lifting total ETF assets to about $153 billion. Those flows can provide a steady source of demand for BTC if they continue. How ETFs Change The Game ETFs give big funds a familiar product to buy. That reduces some barriers to entry. If allocations rise in Q4 as Visser suggests, ETF channels are where much of that buying could show up first. Corporate Holdings Add Another Layer Public and private firms are already holding Bitcoin on their books. Data trackers show public companies’ treasury BTC holdings are valued at roughly $112 billion across many firms. Big buyers like the Michael Saylor-led Strategy continue to add to their piles, and corporate buys make headlines when they happen. Such corporate demand can add to overall market appetite for BTC. The Period To Watch Based on reports and the surveys, late Q4 will be the period to watch. If institutions move as planned, Bitcoin could see meaningful support. But investors should expect bumps, as it’s the nature of crypto: policy shifts, rates, or a sudden liquidity squeeze could cut short flows. In short, the signs point toward more allocation from TradFi, yet execution will depend on several moving parts.

An individual recently received an 18-month prison sentence for cleverly concealing approximately 45 stolen Bitcoin (BTC) through sophisticated crypto mixing and currency exchange services, as reported by Digital Asset. This case is particularly noteworthy because the defendant had siphoned off these funds after illicitly obtaining a mnemonic code—a vital security key for a crypto wallet. The ruling itself carries immense weight, as it formally acknowledges the act of crypto mixing as a direct method of concealing criminal proceeds, setting a powerful precedent. What is Crypto Mixing and Why is it Used? Crypto mixing , often referred to as a ‘Bitcoin mixer’ or ‘tumbler,’ is a service designed to obscure the trail of cryptocurrency transactions. It works by pooling together various users’ coins and then redistributing them to their intended recipients from this mixed pool. This process makes it incredibly difficult to trace the original source of the funds. Privacy Concerns: For some, crypto mixing offers enhanced privacy, allowing individuals to transact without revealing their entire financial history on public ledgers. Illicit Activities: Unfortunately, a significant portion of mixers are utilized by criminals to launder stolen funds, evade sanctions, or finance illegal operations. The South Korean case clearly falls into the latter category, demonstrating how illicit actors leverage these tools to hide their tracks after committing theft. The South Korean Verdict: A Landmark in Crypto Crime The recent sentencing by the South Korean court marks a pivotal moment in the fight against digital asset-related crimes. The defendant’s use of crypto mixing services was not seen as a legitimate privacy measure but rather as a deliberate attempt to hide stolen assets. This distinction is vital for future legal battles. The court’s decision to hand down an 18-month prison term sends a clear message: attempting to obfuscate the origins of stolen cryptocurrency through mixers will not be tolerated. This formal recognition of crypto mixing as a concealment method provides a stronger legal framework for prosecuting similar cases worldwide. Moreover, the theft of the mnemonic code highlights a critical vulnerability. Mnemonic codes are essentially master keys to crypto wallets, and their compromise can lead to complete loss of funds. This case serves as a stark reminder of the importance of robust security practices. Navigating the Legal Landscape of Crypto Mixing The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding crypto mixing is rapidly evolving. Jurisdictions globally are grappling with how to effectively regulate these services to prevent their misuse without stifling legitimate privacy-enhancing technologies. This South Korean ruling provides a significant precedent. Global Scrutiny: Financial intelligence units and law enforcement agencies worldwide are increasing their focus on identifying and prosecuting individuals who use mixers for illicit purposes. Regulatory Challenges: Regulators face the challenge of distinguishing between legitimate privacy tools and those primarily designed for money laundering. Increased Enforcement: We can expect to see more coordinated international efforts to track funds moved through mixers and bring perpetrators to justice. This case underscores that legal systems are becoming more sophisticated in understanding and prosecuting complex cryptocurrency crimes, even those involving advanced concealment techniques. Protecting Your Digital Assets: Actionable Insights In light of such incidents, safeguarding your digital assets is more critical than ever. Here are some actionable steps to protect yourself and your investments: Secure Your Mnemonic Codes: Always store your mnemonic code offline in a secure, private location. Never share it with anyone or store it digitally where it could be compromised. Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, consider using a hardware wallet, which provides an extra layer of security against online threats. Practice Due Diligence: Be cautious of unsolicited links, phishing attempts, or services promising unrealistic returns. Always verify the legitimacy of any platform or individual you interact with. Understand the Risks: While crypto mixing can offer privacy, its association with illicit activities means that engaging with such services carries significant legal and reputational risks. Staying informed and vigilant is your best defense in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. The South Korean court’s decision marks a pivotal moment, signaling a growing legal understanding and intolerance for the use of crypto mixing in criminal enterprises. This ruling reinforces the importance of robust security practices for digital assets and highlights the increasing scrutiny on tools that can facilitate illicit activities. As the crypto landscape matures, legal precedents like this will continue to shape how digital assets are regulated and how crimes involving them are prosecuted. It’s a clear message: transparency and accountability are paramount, even in the decentralized world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is crypto mixing? Crypto mixing is a service that blends various cryptocurrency transactions together, making it difficult to trace the origin and destination of specific funds on a public blockchain. It’s used for both privacy and illicit activities. 2. Is crypto mixing illegal? While the act of crypto mixing itself isn’t universally illegal, using it to conceal stolen funds, launder money, or evade sanctions is highly illegal and subject to severe penalties, as demonstrated by the South Korean court case. 3. How did the South Korean court rule on this case? A South Korean court sentenced an individual to 18 months in prison for stealing 45 BTC and then using crypto mixing services to conceal these criminal proceeds. The ruling formally recognized mixing as a method of concealment. 4. What are the risks of using crypto mixers? The primary risks include legal repercussions if used for illicit purposes, the potential for your funds to be stolen by the mixer service itself, and being associated with criminal activity, which can lead to reputational damage or account closures. 5. How can I protect my crypto assets from theft? To protect your crypto assets, always secure your mnemonic codes offline, use hardware wallets for significant holdings, enable two-factor authentication, and be extremely cautious of phishing attempts or suspicious links.

On September 15, these investment vehicles collectively drew in an impressive $258.92 million, signaling robust and sustained investor interest in Bitcoin. This consistent positive flow underscores a growing confidence in digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, as a legitimate investment class. Why Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attracting Such Massive Inflows? This impressive streak of positive inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs isn’t just a fleeting moment; it reflects a deeper shift in how investors view and access Bitcoin. The ability to invest in Bitcoin through a regulated, traditional financial product like an ETF removes many barriers for institutional and retail investors alike. It offers a familiar structure, ease of trading, and often, enhanced security compared to direct cryptocurrency purchases. Accessibility: ETFs make Bitcoin accessible to a broader range of investors who might be hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges directly. Institutional Trust: The involvement of major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity lends significant credibility to the Bitcoin market. Market Maturation: Consistent inflows suggest a maturing market where Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a long-term asset rather than just a speculative play. Understanding the Dynamics: Who’s Leading the Spot Bitcoin ETFs Race? While the overall picture for Spot Bitcoin ETFs is overwhelmingly positive, a closer look reveals key players driving these significant inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT, for instance, continues to dominate the scene. On September 15, IBIT alone accounted for a staggering $260 million in inflows, highlighting its strong market position and investor preference. Fidelity’s FBTC also demonstrated solid performance, bringing in $7.54 million. Even Grayscale’s Mini BTC, a newer offering, saw positive movement with $6.13 million. These figures showcase a diverse interest across different fund providers, though some clearly hold a larger share of the market. However, it wasn’t entirely a one-way street. Bitwise’s BIBT experienced a net outflow of $18.81 million. This minor counter-trend reminds us that even within a booming sector, individual fund performances can vary, and investor preferences can shift based on various factors. What Does This Streak Mean for the Future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Crypto? The continuous positive flows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just daily statistics; they are a powerful indicator of evolving market sentiment. This sustained interest suggests a growing institutional embrace of Bitcoin, which could have profound implications for its price stability and broader adoption. As more traditional investors gain exposure to Bitcoin through these ETFs, it could lead to increased liquidity and reduced volatility in the long run. Moreover, this trend might encourage other financial institutions to launch their own Spot Bitcoin ETFs or similar crypto-backed products, further legitimizing the asset class. It also signals a potential shift from speculative trading to long-term investment strategies, treating Bitcoin as a valuable component of a diversified portfolio. Actionable Insight: Investors keen on gaining exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset should consider the various Spot Bitcoin ETFs available, evaluating their fees, liquidity, and underlying assets. Diversification remains key. In conclusion, the six consecutive days of net inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a significant moment for the cryptocurrency market. This sustained positive momentum, led by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, underscores increasing institutional confidence and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin. As these investment vehicles continue to attract capital, they are likely to play a pivotal role in shaping the future trajectory of digital asset adoption and market maturation. The future looks bright for Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Frequently Asked Questions About Spot Bitcoin ETFs What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. This means its value is derived directly from the current market price of Bitcoin, offering investors exposure to the asset without needing to buy and store Bitcoin themselves. Why are Spot Bitcoin ETFs important for the crypto market? They provide a regulated and accessible way for traditional investors, including institutions, to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This can increase market liquidity, legitimacy, and potentially reduce volatility, driving broader adoption of Bitcoin. Which funds are seeing the most inflows? Currently, BlackRock’s IBIT is consistently leading in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC. These funds have attracted significant capital due to their established presence and investor trust. Do all Spot Bitcoin ETFs experience positive inflows? While the overall trend has been positive, individual funds can experience outflows on certain days, as seen with Bitwise’s BIBT. Investor sentiment and fund-specific factors can influence these movements. How do Spot Bitcoin ETFs differ from Bitcoin futures ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs hold actual Bitcoin, directly reflecting its price. Bitcoin futures ETFs, on the other hand, hold futures contracts that bet on Bitcoin’s future price, which can lead to different performance characteristics and tracking errors.

Among the leaders in this niche is Remittix (RTX) , a worldwide payment project which has gradually gained increasing credibility before its launch of the beta wallet in September. Bitcoin & XRP Latest Market Figures Bitcoin remains in the news, trading at $115,451.01, falling 0.45% in the last day. Even with the marginal retreat, its market cap of $2.29 trillion confirms its position as the foundation of the crypto space. Daily volume is $31.87 billion, down 29.32% from yesterday’s high, a reminder that even when Bitcoin is targeting the $125,000 threshold, short-term corrections are still part of its trajectory. XRP, meanwhile, is at $3.02, down 4.12% in the last 24 hours. Its $179.71 billion market cap and 25.88% decline in trading to $4.93 billion still leave it holding a healthy position among top payment-biased tokens. Its more measured pace compared to the flashier new presale tokens shows, however, how slowly the market attention is shifting towards new money such as Remittix. Presale Growth, Token Sales, and CEX Listings Remittix (RTX) is priced at $0.1080 for every token and already crossed more than $25.6 million, selling more than 662 million tokens in its presale. Such milestones earned it its first officially sanctioned centralized exchange (CEX) listing announcement on BitMart when it hit the $20 million milestone, followed by the second listing on LBank when it crossed $22 million. Such listings are important for early-stage crypto investment projects because they provide access and liquidity. As opposed to speculative releases, Remittix is positioning itself with adoption pathways similar to how mainstreamed XRP in its early years, yet with more explicit focus on crypto-to-bank transfers. 24 Hours Left: Remittix Wallet Beta Testing The launch of Remittix Wallet Beta on September 15 is one of RTX’s important upcoming milestones. Supporting over 40 cryptocurrencies and over 30 fiat currencies, the wallet is useful for remitters, freelancers, and enterprises. With real-time FX conversion and no gas fees, you can send crypto directly into bank accounts of over 30 countries. How Remittix Is Building Market Steam: $25.6 million + presale capital raised to date 662 million + tokens allocated to early adopters First two CEX listings: BitMart & LBank Beta Wallet release date: September 15 $250,000 community giveaway Utility Beyond Presale Hype What sets Remittix apart from most new altcoin to keep an eye on news is that it is a functional design. It targets the $19 trillion payments space with business APIs, crypto-to-bank settlements, and minimal gas fees. This makes RTX both a cross-chain DeFi venture and a crypto solving real-world problems, which is why it’s being compared to early XRP but with a broader fiat integration roadmap.

However, fresh data from Binance crypto exchange indicates that the Bitcoin Scarcity Index recently witnessed its first spike since June 2025. Bitcoin Scarcity Index Spikes, Will BTC Rally? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, the Bitcoin Scarcity Index witnessed its first spike yesterday since June 2025. The analyst referred to the latest exchange data from Binance to confirm the spike in Bitcoin Scarcity Index. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Shift Strategy: Accumulation Over Selling Signals Stronger Bull Cycle For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Scarcity Index measures how limited the available supply of Bitcoin is on exchanges relative to immediate buying demand. A spike in the index usually indicates strong accumulation by large investors or institutions, signaling potential price pressure to the upside. In their analysis, Arab Chain remarked that the latest spike in the Bitcoin Scarcity Index means that either a large amount of BTC was withdrawn from Binance, or the volume of sell orders fell significantly on the exchange. As a result, the available supply of BTC on Binance suddenly became scarce. Notably, such movements are usually associated with the entry of large investors – such as whales or sharks – who hold substantial quantities of BTC. Arab Chain added: The index jumps when immediate buying power exceeds available supply, as if buyers are racing to acquire Bitcoin on the market This type of spike is often linked to positive news or sudden capital inflows. The same pattern occurred last June and persisted for several days, after which Bitcoin climbed to around $124,000. BTC may confirm the beginning of a strong accumulation phase and the continuation of the uptrend if the Bitcoin Scarcity Index remains positive for several consecutive days. However, if the index rises rapidly – followed by an equally quick descent – it may suggest speculative activity or order liquidations. Such a phase is often followed by a period of calm or a price correction. In recent months, the Bitcoin Scarcity Index has reached new all-time highs (ATH). The chart below shows the metric reaching as high as +6, before quickly falling toward neutral and even negative territory. Is BTC Losing Momentum? Arab Chain concluded by saying that the contrast between BTC’s high price, and the index’s quick move back to or below zero suggest that some strong buying momentum has started to decline.

For example, the flagship cryptocurrency recently broke above the mid-term holder breakeven, hinting that a fresh rally to the upside may be on the horizon. From a technical perspective, BTC recently flashed the Golden Cross, a rare bullish signal that has crypto pundits forecasting a potential price appreciation of 100%. At press time, BTC trades at $114,601, down 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

What sets the Fellowship PAC apart from previous political efforts, according to their statement, is its commitment to transparency and trust. The organization emphasizes that its mission is to foster a political environment that supports the broader crypto ecosystem rather than serving narrow interests. The new political action committee aims to build on the crypto regulatory framework being established under the Trump administration, which is viewed as a pathway for the US to become the world’s digital asset capital . Progress has already been made in the form of the passage of the GENIUS Act for dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, also known as stablecoins, being one of the most notorious successes for the cryptocurrency industry this year. Super PACs Gear Up For 2026 Midterms The Fellowship PAC’s objectives are clear: it seeks to support candidates dedicated to creating transparent and predictable regulations for digital assets. Additionally, the PAC aims to protect America’s edge in technology and entrepreneurship, ensuring that the innovation economy reflects American values of openness and fairness. A crucial focus will also be on preventing the migration of talent and entrepreneurs overseas by maintaining the US as the premier destination for innovation, supported by clear regulatory guidelines . The PAC’s press release also noted: Our differentiator is transparency and trust. This initiative is designed to align the interests of crypto entrepreneurs, policymakers, and the public, fostering accountability as we work to advance the ecosystem. This is just the beginning; we have more initiatives planned. The launch of the Fellowship PAC follows a year of notable activity among crypto-focused political action committees, which are gearing up to increase their influence in upcoming special elections across the country. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, super PACs like Fairshake, along with its affiliates Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress, have already invested approximately $136 million in supporting over 58 pro-crypto candidates during the 2024 election cycle. With over $100 million in resources ready for the 2026 midterms, Fairshake is positioned to make a significant impact, bolstered by contributions from major players in the digital asset space, including Coinbase, Andreessen Horowitz, and Ripple.

LSEG Has Launched Its Blockchain Infrastructure As announced in a press release on Monday, the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) has launched its blockchain infrastructure and facilitated its first transaction. The platform, called “Digital Markets Infrastructure” (DMI), was developed in collaboration with Microsoft and runs on the tech giant’s Azure cloud service. Related Reading: Record Bitcoin Difficulty Not Enough To Stop Miners: Hashrate Explodes To New ATH While blockchain is the same technology that powers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, LSEG’s platform isn’t about these digital currencies themselves. Rather, DMI is about applying the technology to traditional finance. Unlike many other projects that digitize only part of the process, LSEG is offering the full range of the blockchain experience, including issuance, tokenization, and settlement. “There are many processes in private markets today that can be improved,” said Head of DMI, Dr. Darko Hajdukovic. “At LSEG we are committed to significantly improving access to private markets, by streamlining workflows, enhancing distribution, and enabling liquidity.” MembersCap, an investment manager, has become the first to use LSEG’s DMI, raising capital for its MCM Fund 1. The fundraising has been facilitated with Archax, a digital securities exchange regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), acting as a nominee. According to the press release, institutional alternative asset manager EJF Capital has also been onboarded as an early adopter, with some of its funds expected to become available on the platform soon. Hjdukovic noted, The onboarding of our first clients and this first transaction are significant milestones, demonstrating the appetite for an end-to-end, interoperable, regulated financial markets DLT infrastructure. LSEG’s position as a convener of markets can bring significant scale to digital assets and effect real change. For now, DMI is only open to private funds, with LSEG planning for expansion into additional asset classes. The stock exchange said it will continue to collaborate with Microsoft to scale the blockchain platform. “Together, we’re reshaping the future of global finance to empower our customers to unlock new opportunities and drive meaningful change,” said Bill Borden, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft’s Worldwide Financial Services.

The chart below shows how the recent volatility in the coin’s price has looked. The rest of the digital asset sector has also slid down alongside Bitcoin, with some altcoins like Dogecoin even being down as much as 8%.

Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,620 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,500 level.

At the forefront of this significant market event is Ethereum (ETH), which alone accounted for a substantial portion of these liquidations. This sudden downturn primarily impacted long positions, leaving many traders feeling the pinch. Understanding these market movements, especially crypto liquidations , is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset space. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations, and Why Do They Happen? For those new to the world of crypto trading, a liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. Essentially, if a trader borrows funds to amplify their potential gains (a “leveraged” position) and the market moves against their prediction, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses once their margin falls below a certain threshold. This mechanism is a fundamental aspect of derivatives trading in the crypto market. These events are often triggered by sharp price movements, unexpected news, or broader market sentiment shifts. When a large number of positions are liquidated simultaneously, it can create a cascading effect, exacerbating price drops and leading to even more liquidations. This is precisely what we observed with the recent wave of crypto liquidations . ETH Dominates the Liquidation Landscape Over the past day, Ethereum (ETH) perpetual futures contracts saw the largest share of liquidations, totaling an astonishing $110 million. What’s particularly noteworthy is that 81.57% of these were long positions. This indicates that a significant majority of traders were betting on ETH’s price to rise, only to be caught off guard by a downward movement. But ETH wasn’t alone in this market turbulence. Bitcoin (BTC) also experienced substantial liquidations: BTC: $42.61 million liquidated, with 71.88% being long positions. SOL: $27.62 million liquidated, with a striking 88.63% from long positions. The high percentage of long liquidations across these major cryptocurrencies suggests a broad market correction or a sudden shift in investor sentiment, leading to significant losses for those anticipating upward price action. Understanding the Impact of Long Liquidations on the Crypto Market When long positions are liquidated, it means that traders who bought believing prices would increase are forced to sell their assets. This forced selling adds downward pressure to the market, potentially causing prices to fall further. This phenomenon can create a “liquidation cascade,” where one liquidation triggers another, amplifying market volatility. The sheer volume of these recent crypto liquidations , especially involving ETH, BTC, and SOL, serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading. It highlights the importance of risk management and understanding market dynamics, particularly in a rapidly evolving space like cryptocurrency. How Can Traders Navigate Volatility and Avoid Crypto Liquidations? While the allure of amplified gains through leverage is strong, the risks are equally substantial. Here are some actionable insights for traders to consider: Implement Robust Risk Management: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on leveraged positions. Never risk more capital than you can afford to lose. Avoid Excessive Leverage: While high leverage can boost profits, it also dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. Start with lower leverage ratios, especially if you are new to derivatives. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, technical analysis, and broader economic indicators that could influence crypto prices. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading investments across different assets can help mitigate risk during market downturns. Understand Market Cycles: Recognize that crypto markets are cyclical. Periods of rapid growth are often followed by corrections. These strategies can help protect your capital and navigate the often-turbulent waters of crypto liquidations . A Powerful Reminder of Market Risks The recent $180 million in crypto liquidations , spearheaded by ETH, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and risks in the cryptocurrency market, particularly when engaging in leveraged trading. The dominance of long liquidations across ETH, BTC, and SOL underscores a significant market correction that caught many optimistic traders off guard. For both seasoned and novice traders, this event reinforces the critical need for sound risk management, prudent leverage use, and continuous market education. By understanding the mechanics of liquidations and adopting cautious trading practices, participants can better protect their investments and navigate the unpredictable currents of the digital asset world. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Liquidations Here are some common questions about crypto liquidations: What is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because the market has moved against their bet, causing their margin to fall below a required threshold. This prevents further losses. Why did ETH lead the recent liquidations? ETH led the recent liquidations because a significant number of traders had open “long” positions (betting on price increases) with leverage. When ETH’s price moved downwards, these leveraged long positions were closed out by exchanges. What does it mean if long positions are liquidated? If long positions are liquidated, it means traders who expected prices to rise were forced to sell their assets. This indicates a market downturn or correction, as the collective expectation of price appreciation was met with a decline. How can I protect my crypto investments from liquidations? To protect against liquidations, it’s crucial to use robust risk management strategies like setting stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, staying informed about market trends, and diversifying your portfolio. Are crypto liquidations bad for the market? While liquidations can cause immediate price drops and increase volatility, they are a normal part of leveraged trading markets. They can help flush out excessive speculation, potentially leading to a healthier market rebalancing in the long run. Did you find this analysis of crypto liquidations helpful?

Martinez recently shared on X a crucial signal concerning the future of Bitcoin. He highlighted that the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio has dipped below 0.1%, a level traditionally interpreted as a strong indication of a Bitcoin short-term bottom . This signal suggests an opportune accumulation zone and a period where selling pressure tends to be weak. Understanding the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio: What Does it Tell Us? What exactly does the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio tell us? This metric is a powerful tool used by analysts to gauge the potential for selling pressure in the Bitcoin market. It essentially measures the risk associated with sellers. When this ratio falls below 0.1%, as Martinez pointed out, it’s not just a number; it’s a significant market signal. It often implies that long-term holders are less inclined to sell, and the overall market is experiencing reduced selling intensity. Consequently, this low ratio often precedes or coincides with an accumulation phase. During such times, savvy investors might view current prices as attractive entry points, anticipating future upward movement. The insight from Ali Martinez, therefore, provides a valuable perspective for anyone closely watching Bitcoin’s price action. Why a Bitcoin Short-Term Bottom Sparks Investor Interest? The concept of a Bitcoin short-term bottom is particularly exciting for investors. It signifies a potential turning point after a period of price declines or consolidation. For many, this represents a strategic window to acquire more Bitcoin at what could be a discounted price. Accumulation Opportunity: A short-term bottom often marks a period where the “smart money” begins to accumulate assets, expecting a rebound. Reduced Downside Risk: When selling pressure is weak, the immediate risk of further significant price drops can diminish, offering a more stable environment for purchases. Foundation for Growth: Establishing a bottom can provide a strong base from which Bitcoin’s price can build momentum for its next upward trend. However, it’s crucial to remember that while indicators provide guidance, the crypto market remains dynamic and unpredictable. Navigating the Potential Accumulation Zone: What’s Your Strategy? If the market is indeed entering an accumulation zone, what steps should investors consider? This period demands careful thought and a well-defined strategy. Understanding the implications of a Bitcoin short-term bottom is just the first step. Here are some actionable insights: Research Diligently: Always conduct your own research beyond any single indicator or analyst’s view. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider implementing a DCA strategy, buying smaller amounts of Bitcoin over time to average out your entry price. This mitigates the risk of trying to perfectly time the absolute bottom. Risk Management: Allocate only capital you can afford to lose. The crypto market is volatile, and even strong signals are not guarantees. Long-Term Vision: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment. A short-term bottom might be a great entry point for those with a multi-year horizon. The goal is to approach these signals with a balanced perspective, leveraging insights without succumbing to impulsive decisions. Historical Precedent: Does the Sell-Side Risk Ratio Hold Up for a Bitcoin Short-Term Bottom? Looking back at historical data, technical indicators like the Sell-Side Risk Ratio have often provided valuable insights into market cycles. When the ratio has previously fallen to such low levels, it has frequently coincided with periods of significant accumulation before subsequent price rallies. This historical context lends credibility to Martinez’s current observation about a potential Bitcoin short-term bottom . Nevertheless, every market cycle presents unique variables. While past performance can offer guidance, it never guarantees future results. External factors, global economic conditions, and regulatory news can all influence Bitcoin’s trajectory, regardless of internal metrics. Conclusion: Seizing the Moment with Informed Decisions The recent analysis by Ali Martinez, highlighting the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio falling below 0.1%, offers a compelling signal for a potential Bitcoin short-term bottom . This indicator points towards an accumulation zone and a period of reduced selling pressure, suggesting a potentially favorable environment for investors looking to enter or add to their Bitcoin holdings. While such signals are valuable, a prudent approach involves combining this insight with thorough personal research and a robust risk management strategy. The crypto market rewards those who are patient, well-informed, and strategic. This potential bottom could indeed be a significant moment for Bitcoin, paving the way for its next chapter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio? A1: The BTC Sell-Side Risk Ratio is a metric that indicates the potential for selling pressure in the Bitcoin market. A low ratio, especially below 0.1%, suggests that long-term holders are less likely to sell, implying weaker overall selling pressure. Q2: What does a “Bitcoin short-term bottom” mean for investors? A2: A Bitcoin short-term bottom suggests that Bitcoin’s price has reached a temporary low point, often signaling an accumulation zone. For investors, this can represent an opportunity to buy Bitcoin at potentially favorable prices before a possible rebound. Q3: Is the Sell-Side Risk Ratio a guaranteed indicator of future price movements? A3: No, while the Sell-Side Risk Ratio has historically been a reliable indicator of potential accumulation phases and short-term bottoms, no single indicator guarantees future price movements. The crypto market is complex and influenced by many factors. Q4: What strategies should I consider during an accumulation zone? A4: During an accumulation zone, strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and thorough personal research are recommended. It’s also crucial to practice sound risk management and only invest capital you are prepared to lose. Q5: Who is Ali Martinez, and why is his analysis significant? A5: Ali Martinez is a well-known cryptocurrency trader and analyst. His insights are significant because he often utilizes various on-chain and technical indicators to provide informed perspectives on market trends, which many in the crypto community follow closely.

Bitcoin has experienced a significant pullback this September, as whale sell-offs and macro uncertainties test investor conviction. Recent data shows Bitcoin spot ETFs are attracting capital while Ethereum spot ETFs are seeing record outflows, an intriguing divergence amid volatile sentiment. Capital rotation, diminished liquidity, and fading dominance are eroding BTC’s grip on the crypto market, prompting investors, especially speculators, to seek the next breakout opportunity. If momentum follows narrative power, MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its PATRIOT50X bonus code , might become investors’ rallying point for catching the next wave. Bitcoin Under Pressure ETF Flows and Liquidity Trends Between September 2–5, Ethereum spot ETFs experienced unprecedented net outflows totaling $788 million , while Bitcoin ETFs recorded $246 million in net inflows , sustaining two consecutive weeks of positive BTC flows. This divergence underscores shifting institutional sentiment. While Ethereum appears to be losing momentum with big players, Bitcoin remains a safer allocation in the short term, particularly as inflation concerns keep investors glued to assets with a longer track record. Yet, despite inflows into ETFs, Bitcoin’s price has struggled to hold support. Traders point out that ETF buying has been offset by aggressive spot selling from whales. That dynamic has left order books thin and prone to sharp intraday swings, adding to retail anxiety and increasing the appeal of smaller, high-upside assets. Whale Selling & Technical Stress A massive sell-off by a long-term Bitcoin holder, about $2.59 billion worth , sparked a $310 million flash crash , pushing BTC below critical support and triggering cascading liquidations. On-chain data highlights a worrying pattern: long-term holders are distributing more coins than they accumulate, a reversal from the earlier part of the year when accumulation was steady. Technical indicators reinforce caution. A potential “death cross” looms as the 50-day moving average threatens to slip under the 200-day, while Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings have fallen below 50. Historically, these setups often precede short-term corrections. For investors accustomed to Bitcoin’s role as a “safe haven” in crypto, such signals are undermining confidence. Seasonal Volatility & Macro Risks September has long been a difficult month for Bitcoin. Since 2016, the asset has finished in the red more often than not during this period, a seasonal trend many traders are now respecting. Analysts at Cryptodnes.bg warned that market participants could be underestimating the risks of September volatility, particularly when combined with sticky inflation, weaker U.S. jobs data, and uncertainty around Federal Reserve cuts. The broader macro backdrop is hardly comforting. The Fed remains stuck between cooling inflation and a fragile labor market, and bond yields continue to reflect skepticism about the speed of future rate cuts. That mix has spilled into risk assets, making Bitcoin vulnerable to sharper swings as traders reduce leverage and protect margins. A Flight Toward Different Narratives Even as Bitcoin’s dominance shows cracks, investors are not abandoning crypto altogether. Instead, capital is fragmenting. Part of it is rotating into Ethereum’s tokenization-driven ecosystem, while another portion is chasing smaller altcoins and presales that promise exponential multiples. This dynamic has defined every major cycle: when Bitcoin pauses or retraces, high-beta assets become the main attraction. The speculative side of the market is thriving under these conditions. Traders are gravitating toward presale projects with scarcity mechanics, cultural branding, and bonus incentives. In many ways, presales are seen as a hedge against Bitcoin’s sluggishness, offering investors exposure to asymmetric risk with smaller initial commitments. Amid Bitcoin’s latest sell-off, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the cycle’s most talked-about hidden gems. The PATRIOT50X bonus code is fueling presale acceleration, rewarding participants with 50% more tokens at a time when confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory is shaken. Forecasts of 15,000% potential upside have quickly become the centerpiece of discussions in crypto communities, with some analysts calling it the “second chance setup” for those who regret missing Bitcoin’s $10 breakout. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is how it thrives in turbulence. Instead of relying on mining economics or ETF flows, its strength comes from scarcity-driven rounds, cultural resonance, and an engaged early-mover community. This positions it not only as a speculative bet but as a potential cultural symbol of the next bull run. Broader Market Environment Liquidity Shifts & Altcoin Season Signals With Bitcoin dominance slipping toward 57%, analysts are once again monitoring “altseason” indicators. Historically, a dip below 55% has preceded massive capital rotation into altcoins. Coinbase Institutional recently noted that liquidity conditions are improving, with tighter spreads and stronger depth across altcoin order books. If Bitcoin continues to stagnate, capital may chase higher multiples in emerging tokens. Institutional Reassessment Coinbase’s report also highlighted that September could mark the beginning of a broader altcoin shift. Analysts like Michael van de Poppe argue that Bitcoin’s current weakness may serve as a catalyst, as it has historically been the prelude to powerful alt rallies. That shift would open the door for speculative presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE to dominate narratives. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be Bitcoin’s Second-Chance Play 15,000% ROI whispers : Market chatter frames MAGACOIN FINANCE as the boldest speculative bet of 2025. Scarcity + bonus edge : Rapid presale sellouts and the PATRIOT50X code create urgency and amplify rewards for early movers. Cultural + credible fusion : Combines meme-driven appeal with legitimacy through completed audits, something few presales achieve. Momentum from all sides : Retail buzz aligns with whale positioning, ensuring liquidity and visibility at launch. Bitcoin contrast : As BTC wavers, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a narrative of redemption for those who missed Bitcoin’s earliest breakout. Conclusion Bitcoin’s September sell-off, driven by whale distribution, ETF divergences, and macro uncertainty, has reinforced its reputation for volatility. For some, this is a reminder of Bitcoin’s cyclical nature; for others, it’s a signal to look elsewhere for growth. Ethereum remains the backbone of tokenization and institutional adoption, but the speculative edge of crypto is where fortunes are often made. In that corner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a defining story, a presale blending scarcity, cultural branding, and auditable legitimacy, supercharged by the PATRIOT50X bonus code. For risk-on investors, it could represent the long-awaited “ second chance ” after missing Bitcoin’s historic rise.

This latest initiative, led by the head of France’s financial watchdog, Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, is part of a broader push to shift regulatory oversight to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), based in Paris. France Pushes For Centralized Crypto Oversight According to an exclusive coverage made by Reuters on Monday, the urgency of this move stems from concerns that under the EU’s new regulatory framework, known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, crypto companies are gravitating towards jurisdictions with more lenient licensing processes. Barbat-Layani emphasized that there are significant inconsistencies in how national regulators are applying the new rules, raising alarms about the potential for inadequate supervision of cross-border firms. In a coordinated effort, France has joined Italy and Austria in advocating for ESMA to assume supervisory responsibilities over major crypto firms. This was outlined in a position paper shared with Reuters, highlighting a collective concern about the regulatory landscape. The head of France’s financial watchdog warned that France would not shy away from employing what she termed an “atomic weapon”—the possibility of challenging the validity of licenses granted by other EU member states. This could disrupt the established “passporting” mechanism that allows companies approved in one country to operate throughout the European Union. Barbat-Layani also pointed out that some crypto platforms are engaging in “regulatory shopping,” seeking out jurisdictions with less stringent requirements to gain favorable licenses. France And Allies Seek Major Changes For MiCA Rules The call for enhanced oversigh t comes after a review by ESMA, which found that certain national regulators, like Malta, faced scrutiny for their licensing processes. In some cases, the review indicated insufficient risk assessment when granting licenses to crypto firms. As part of this ongoing transition, crypto companies are in the process of applying for MiCA licenses, with jurisdictions like Luxembourg and Malta already granting approvals to prominent platforms such as Coinbase (COIN) and Gemini (GEMI). However, the French, Italian, and Austrian regulators are advocating for revisions to MiCA that would impose stricter rules on crypto activities outside the EU, enhance cybersecurity measures, and refine how authorities manage new digital asset offerings . France has consistently championed the idea of expanding ESMA’s regulatory powers, a sentiment echoed by ESMA’s head, Verena Ross. However, this proposal faces resistance from certain EU member states, highlighting the challenges ahead in establishing a cohesive regulatory approach for the digital asset market.

Analysts from The Bull Theory, a crypto research firm, have emphasized the significance of this upcoming period, suggesting it could determine the fate of what they term “mega altseason” in the fourth quarter (Q4) of the year. Could Global Economic Data Trigger A Surge In Crypto Prices? The urgency of this new prediction for the broader crypto sector, comes in light of recent economic data from China, which revealed signs of weakening demand. Retail sales grew by only 3.4% year-on-year, falling short of the expected 3.9%. Similarly, industrial production increased by just 5.2%, marking the slowest growth in twelve months, while urban unemployment rose to 5.3%. These indicators suggest that the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, leading to speculation that quantitative easing (QE) may be the only viable solution moving forward. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Eye $0.54 ‘Final Boss’ Breakout, Says Top Analyst China has already begun injecting substantial liquidity into its economy, and further measures could significantly boost the global money supply. The situation in the United States adds another layer of complexity, as markets are anticipating a 25 basis point cut in the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rates on September 17. If Fed Chair Jerome Powell not only confirms this cut but also signals the possibility of additional easing, The Bull Theory claims that this situation could lead to a surge in liquidity. Historically, such moves have prompted sharp upward movements in crypto and Bitcoin prices, often ranging from 5% to 10% within weeks. Moreover, Ethereum (ETH) could see increased inflows, particularly from exchange-traded funds (ETFs), while altcoins may benefit from an expanded risk appetite among investors. However, if the Federal Reserve hesitates to implement further cuts, risk assets across the board could face a sharp correction. Potential Rate Cuts From Key Central Banks The following days will also see critical decisions from other central banks, including the Bank of England (BOE) on September 18. Should the BOE signal a willingness to cut rates, it would reinforce the narrative of synchronized global easing. This could align with potential dovish moves from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on September 19, which would further weaken the yen and facilitate more dollar liquidity flowing into the market. Related Reading: The Big PEPE Price Breakout: Falling Wedge Pattern Points To 64% Rally According to the firm’s analysis, in the macroeconomic landscape the best-case scenario would involve a coordinated global easing strategy, featuring cuts from the Federal Reserve, a dovish BOJ, and a supportive BOE. They assert this could lead to massive liquidity inflows, potentially pushing Bitcoin past the $120,000 mark, accelerating exchange-traded fund inflows into Ethereum, and prompting stronger performance from altcoins. The Bull Theory concludes that if global central banks align their policies towards easing, the next ten days could very well mark the beginning of a robust altcoin season.

Despite the progress, PI is in red territory today, while the multi-million token unlocks scheduled for the next month and the major supply stored on exchanges signal heavy potential selling pressure. Moving Forward as Scheduled The controversial crypto project, officially launched in 2019, continues to make adjustments and implement developments to strengthen its ecosystem. Most recently, the X account Pi News revealed that Pi Network is gradually upgrading from protocol v19 to v23, covering Testnet, Testnet2, and Mainnet. Moreover, the Testnet has been successfully upgraded to v22. The goal is to improve performance and network stability, thereby enabling further ecosystem advancements. Earlier this month, the project’s team explained that Version 23 is based on Stellar v23, but it’s custom-made for Pi Network. It aims to provide users with more control and a few functionalities, including Know-Your-Customer (KYC) authorities into the protocol that will “maintain PI as a KYC-verified blockchain, while offering a more distributed community-driven KYC process at the protocol level.” Some users commenting on the latest progress news claimed verifications remain an issue. “Will this improve KYC approvals? They need to hurry the hell up and purge all UNVERIFIED Pi that doesn’t have KYC so we can go back to 1 dollar,” one person asked. PI Price Outlook Despite the latest upgrade status, the native token of the crypto project remains in red territory today (September 15). As of this writing, it trades at approximately $0.34 (per CoinGecko’s data), which is a staggering 88% decline compared to the all-time high of around $3 registered at the start of the year. And while some community members believe that PI could mark a significant revival in the short term, important metrics signal that the pullback may even intensify. Data indicates that over 137 million tokens will be unlocked within the next 30 days, providing an opportunity for people to offload coins they have been waiting for a long time, thereby increasing sell pressure. PI Token Unlocks, Source: piscan.io In addition, the amount of PI stored on crypto exchanges continues to rise and is currently above 440 million. Almost half of that stash is stored on Gate.io, while Bitget comes in second with 147 million. This suggests that many investors have transitioned from self-custody methods to centralized platforms, which is often interpreted as a pre-sale step.

Senators voted 48–47, which split mostly along partisan lines in the GOP-controlled chamber. Nonetheless, Miran’s confirmation breaks nearly a century of precedent, becoming the first active White House aide to serve on the Fed’s board since its reorganization in the 1930s. He will join the Fed team in Washington on Tuesday, as they begin a crucial two-day meeting to shape the nation’s economic course. Policymakers are set to discuss interest rates, which, depending on their call, could affect how much Americans pay on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. Most economists are betting on a rate cut this time, at least a quarter-percentage point rate cut, to boost the labour market. Lawmakers are worried that Miran may not act independently as a member of the Fed Board On September 4, during his confirmation hearing, Miran told Congress he would take an unpaid leave of absence from his White House job while serving at the Fed. His decision, however, raised some concern about whether he could act independently, as some had expected him to resign from the position altogether. Miran, however, emphasized during the hearing that the Fed’s independence is “critical.” In the past few months, Trump has not hidden his ambition to steer the Federal Reserve, openly outlining plans to create “a majority” on the Fed’s board, a move that critics say could threaten its long-standing independence. Some have seen his clashes with Chair Jerome Powell over interest rates and criticism of several senior Fed officials as interference in the central bank’s work. Now, with his backing of Miran, some have hinted that he intended to assert influence on the board. Senator Elizabeth Warren even voiced fears that Miran might be perceived as a puppet rather than an impartial board member. Miran has backed some of Trump’s economic policies, including his global tariff strategy . He believes that the import duties won’t stoke inflation and that tighter immigration policies would ease housing demand and bring down prices. Trump attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook Miran’s appointment comes as Fed Governor Lisa Cook fights to keep her seat on the central bank’s board. Trump has moved to oust Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud and asserting his constitutional authority to remove her. Earlier, Bill Pulte, appointed by Trump to help regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, had connected Cook to three mortgage properties in two referrals to the Justice Department. The mortgages date back to 2021, before former President Biden tapped Cook to serve on the Federal Reserve board. Nonetheless, Trump acted on these accusations to fire her. Cook has denied the claims and even filed a lawsuit to challenge her dismissal. Over the last several meetings, she has voted to maintain current interest rate levels, contrary to the President’s demand. On a turn of events, Trump has been denied the right to dismiss Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors for now. As reported by Cryptopolitan , a federal appeals court decided in an emergency ruling Monday, just hours before the central bank begins its two-day monetary policy meeting.

The ebb and flow of traditional finance, particularly central bank policies and currency valuations, often dictate broader market sentiment, influencing everything from investor appetite for risk assets to the stability of stablecoins. Right now, a significant shift is underway: the anticipation of a Fed rate cut . This pivotal moment is not just about interest rates; it is about a potential rebalancing of global economic power, with profound implications for the US Dollar, Asian currencies, and indirectly, the crypto sphere. Let us delve into how these crucial shifts are shaping the future of finance. Understanding the Impending Fed Rate Cut : What is Driving the Shift? The prospect of a Fed rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve has become a central theme in global financial discussions. For months, markets have speculated on when and how aggressively the Fed would pivot from its hawkish stance, adopted to combat persistent inflation. Several factors are now aligning to make these rate cuts a more tangible reality: Inflation Moderation: While still above the Fed’s 2% target, inflation data has shown a consistent downward trend. This suggests that the aggressive rate hikes implemented over the past two years are having their intended effect. Economic Slowdown Concerns: Recent economic indicators, including some employment data and manufacturing surveys, point to a potential cooling of the U.S. economy. The Fed aims for a ‘soft landing,’ where inflation is tamed without triggering a severe recession. Rate cuts could provide necessary stimulus to avoid a sharp downturn. Global Economic Headwinds: Slower growth in other major economies and ongoing geopolitical tensions also factor into the Fed’s calculations. A global slowdown could dampen U.S. export demand and overall economic activity, necessitating a more accommodative monetary policy. A reduction in the federal funds rate would lower borrowing costs across the U.S. economy, impacting everything from mortgages to corporate loans. Globally, it would reduce the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets, potentially leading to capital outflows from the U.S. and into other markets, particularly those offering higher returns or perceived growth potential. Why is Asia FX Outlook Brightening? The Dollar’s Retreat Explained The anticipation of a Fed rate cut directly influences the Asia FX outlook . As the U.S. Dollar begins to retreat, Asian currencies find a stronger footing. This phenomenon is driven by several interconnected dynamics: Yield Differentials: Historically, higher U.S. interest rates made dollar assets more attractive, drawing capital away from emerging markets, including Asia. As the Fed cuts rates, this yield differential narrows, making Asian bonds and other local currency assets more appealing to international investors. Reduced Pressure on Central Banks: A weaker dollar eases the pressure on Asian central banks to defend their own currencies. During periods of dollar strength, many Asian central banks intervene in currency markets, often by selling dollar reserves, to prevent excessive depreciation of their local currencies, which can fuel imported inflation. With the dollar retreating, this pressure lessens, allowing for more independent monetary policy decisions. Improved Trade Balances: For many Asian export-oriented economies, a weaker dollar makes their goods more competitive in international markets, potentially boosting exports. Conversely, it makes dollar-denominated imports (like oil) more expensive in local currency terms, but the overall trade balance often benefits from stronger export performance. We are already observing some currencies like the Japanese Yen (JPY), South Korean Won (KRW), and Indian Rupee (INR) showing signs of firming against the dollar, albeit with regional nuances. This positive shift in the Asia FX outlook signifies a broader re-evaluation of investment destinations. The Mechanics of US Dollar Weakness : A Global Ripple Effect The current narrative of US Dollar weakness is a multifaceted one, extending beyond just Fed policy. While interest rate differentials are a primary driver, other factors contribute to the dollar’s retreat and its ripple effect across global markets: Risk-On Sentiment: When the global economic outlook improves or fears of a severe recession subside, investors tend to move away from ‘safe-haven’ assets like the U.S. Dollar and into riskier assets, including equities and emerging market currencies. This ‘risk-on’ environment naturally contributes to dollar depreciation. Current Account Deficit: The U.S. typically runs a significant current account deficit, meaning it imports more goods and services than it exports. While often offset by capital inflows, a reduction in these inflows (due to lower interest rates) can expose the underlying demand for dollars, pushing its value down. Comparison with Other Major Currencies: The dollar’s value is always relative. If other major central banks (like the European Central Bank or Bank of England) maintain higher interest rates or signal less aggressive cuts, their respective currencies could strengthen against the dollar, further contributing to perceived US Dollar weakness . This dollar retreat has significant implications for commodity markets, as many key commodities (like oil and gold) are priced in dollars. A weaker dollar makes these commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies, potentially increasing demand and supporting their prices. Navigating the Shifting Currency Markets : Opportunities and Risks For investors, businesses, and even individuals, understanding the dynamics within the currency markets is crucial. The current environment of a retreating dollar and strengthening Asian currencies presents both opportunities and challenges: Opportunities: Attractive Asian Assets: A stronger local currency can make Asian equities and bonds more appealing to foreign investors, potentially leading to capital appreciation and higher returns in dollar terms. Reduced Debt Burden: For Asian companies or governments with dollar-denominated debt, a stronger local currency reduces the cost of servicing and repaying that debt. Cheaper Imports (for some): While a weaker dollar can make dollar-denominated imports more expensive for the U.S., it makes them cheaper for countries whose currencies are strengthening against the dollar. Risks: Volatility: Currency markets are inherently volatile. While the general trend might be dollar weakness, unexpected economic data, geopolitical events, or shifts in central bank rhetoric can trigger sharp reversals. Geopolitical Tensions: Regional conflicts or trade disputes can quickly overshadow economic fundamentals, leading to capital flight from affected areas and impacting specific Asian currencies. Domestic Economic Challenges: Not all Asian economies are uniform. Some may face domestic challenges like high inflation, political instability, or structural issues that could limit the upside potential of their currencies, even amid broader dollar weakness. Navigating these complex currency markets requires careful analysis and a diversified approach. Businesses engaged in international trade need robust hedging strategies to mitigate currency risk, while investors should consider the fundamental strength of individual economies rather than relying solely on broad regional trends. What Does This Mean for Emerging Markets Forex and Beyond? The implications of a potential Fed rate cut and subsequent dollar weakness extend significantly to emerging markets forex . These economies are often more sensitive to global capital flows and the strength of the U.S. Dollar: Capital Inflows: A weaker dollar and lower U.S. yields tend to encourage capital to flow into emerging markets, seeking higher returns. This can boost local asset prices, support economic growth, and strengthen local currencies. Reduced External Debt Burden: Many emerging market countries and corporations have borrowed heavily in U.S. Dollars. A weaker dollar makes it cheaper to service and repay these debts in local currency terms, freeing up resources for domestic investment. Potential for Policy Space: With less pressure from a strong dollar, emerging market central banks may gain more flexibility to manage their own monetary policies, potentially allowing for rate cuts to support domestic growth without triggering currency depreciation. However, this is not a universal boon. Some emerging markets may face inflationary pressures from increased capital inflows or commodity price hikes. The impact on emerging markets forex is diverse, depending on each country’s economic structure, debt levels, and policy responses. Indirectly, this ‘risk-on’ environment in traditional finance can spill over into cryptocurrency markets, as investors might seek higher returns in alternative assets when traditional yields become less attractive. Compelling Summary: A New Chapter for Global Finance The financial world stands at a pivotal juncture, driven by the anticipated Fed rate cut and its cascading effects across global markets. We are witnessing a significant rebalancing, where the long-standing dominance of the U.S. Dollar is experiencing a measured retreat, offering a more positive Asia FX outlook . This shift, born from moderating inflation and evolving economic conditions, creates a dynamic environment in currency markets . While US Dollar weakness presents clear opportunities for capital flows into emerging markets forex and reduced debt burdens, it also brings inherent risks from volatility and geopolitical uncertainties. For investors and market watchers alike, understanding these interconnected forces is paramount to navigating the evolving landscape of global finance and anticipating its broader implications, even for nascent sectors like cryptocurrency.

The tweet included a chart displaying the performance of major cryptocurrencies alongside community comments reflecting on both the past and the potential future of the sector. Crypto in 2030 pic.twitter.com/VkaFR9lJiQ — borovik (@3orovik) September 14, 2025 Bitcoin’s Position in 2030 The chart posted alongside Borovik’s tweet presented Bitcoin with a reported market capitalization of $40.07 trillion at $2.01 million per BTC. This figure illustrates the magnitude of change envisioned for the market, with Bitcoin maintaining a leading position among all digital assets. The projection indicates an increase not just in value, but also in its share of the global financial system, consistent with an X user’s remark about Bitcoin potentially surpassing gold. XRP, Ethereum, and Other Assets The graphic also displayed Ethereum with a valuation of $80,929 and a market capitalization of $9.77 trillion, while XRP was shown trading at $53.76 with a market capitalization of $3.20 trillion. These figures suggest significant growth across multiple major cryptocurrencies, indicating expectations of broader adoption and institutional involvement by the end of the decade. Other leading assets in the projection included Solana at $4,230 with a $2.29 trillion market capitalization, Binance Coin at $16,170 with $2.25 trillion, Dogecoin at $4.92 with $743.82 billion, and TRON at $6.07 with $574.98 billion. The chart showed consistent upward performance, reflecting optimistic sentiment surrounding future price levels across the wider market. Reflections on the Early Days of Crypto Commenting on the post, X user Penn Nguyen recalled opening an old laptop and finding a browser tab still active on AllChains.info, a website that once listed the top cryptocurrency chains. At that time, only Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Namecoin were featured. Nguyen noted that Bitcoin was priced at approximately $13 during that period, remarking on the scale of change since those early days. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The recollection highlighted how the cryptocurrency market has developed from a small collection of assets into a multi-trillion-dollar sector. The reference to earlier projects, such as Namecoin and Litecoin, emphasizes how much the industry has shifted, with many early competitors no longer holding leading positions. Borovik’s post combined forward-looking projections with reflections on the early stages of digital assets. Zeff’s prediction that Bitcoin could surpass gold in market capitalization by 2030 presented a vision of global financial transformation, while Penn Nguyen’s memory underscored the growth that has already occurred within the space. The accompanying chart, illustrating trillion-dollar valuations for multiple leading cryptocurrencies, conveyed the scale of expectations among certain community members regarding the next chapter of digital asset adoption.

Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank's global head of digital asset research, said that Ethereum would benefit more from acquisitions by DAT companies than Bitcoin and Solana. According to Kendrick's data, DATs currently hold 4% of all Bitcoin, 3.1% of Ethereum, and 0.8% of Solana. This size means the success or failure of treasuries could have a significant impact on coin prices. Kendrick noted that the primary reason for the recent valuation squeeze for DATs is market saturation. He said the success of DATs going forward will depend on three key factors: financing cost, size, and yield. Kendrick stated that Ethereum and Solana treasuries can reach higher valuations compared to Bitcoin-focused DATs thanks to staking returns, and noted that Ethereum has an advantage over Solana in this area because ETH treasuries are more established. The report also noted that if some DATs trade below their asset value for an extended period, consolidation could arise. It argued that such mergers are more likely, particularly in Bitcoin treasuries, but that this would likely lead to a redistribution of existing assets rather than generating new demand. DAT companies have faced significant declines in their share prices in recent weeks, raising questions about their sustainable purchasing power in the markets. These companies need to trade above their market capitalization to raise new funds and continue accumulating crypto assets. Related News: Big Whales Are Quite Active: Here Are Their Altcoin Trading Activities in Recent Hours Kendrick, noting the relative resilience of Ethereum-focused DATs, explained that BitMine Immersion (BMNR), the largest ETH treasury traded on the NYSE American, has continued its purchases after receiving approval for its strategy and currently holds over 2 million ETH. This amount corresponds to approximately 5% of the total supply. Kendrick concluded his assessment with the following statements: “From a relative perspective, we expect DATs to be a stronger price-supporting factor in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin and Solana.” *This is not investment advice.

At the same time, Robinhood is seeking SEC approval for a new venture fund that would list on the NYSE and give retail investors access to early-stage companies, a space traditionally limited to institutions. Gemini and SEC Reach a Deal The long-running legal battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Gemini Trust Company seems to be approaching a close after the two parties filed a joint status update in federal court. The filing was submitted to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the SEC and Gemini informed the court that they reached a “resolution in principle” in the securities case that was first brought against Gemini and Genesis Global Capital in January of 2023. Both sides requested that litigation in the matter be indefinitely stayed, pending commission review and approval. There is also an agreement to provide another status report if no resolution is finalized by Dec. 15. (Source: SDNY) The SEC’s 2023 complaint accused Genesis and Gemini of engaging in an unregistered offer and sale of securities through the Gemini Earn Program between February 2021 and November 2022. The program allegedly raised billions of dollars in crypto assets from US retail investors, who were promised interest payments without the companies registering the product under securities law. The regulator argued that investors were deprived of critical disclosures required by law and were instead given only partial and inadequate information. The SEC further claimed that participants did not have the material facts needed to make informed investment decisions. The case already saw some major developments. In 2024, the SEC announced a $21 million settlement with Genesis, while in February of that same year, under acting chair Mark Uyeda, the agency notified Gemini that it will not recommend pursuing an enforcement action tied to a separate investigation. This latest filing suggests that Gemini is now on the verge of closing the chapter on its own securities dispute with the commission. At the same time, Gemini continued to deepen its political and financial profile despite its legal issues. The firm’s co-founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, were major backers of Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and have maintained close ties with his administration. The twins even attended the signing of the GENIUS stablecoin bill and lobbied the White House to reconsider the nomination of Brian Quintenz as chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Recently released text exchanges from July showed discussions between Quintenz and the Winklevosses over enforcement assurances tied to his stalled nomination. Meanwhile, Gemini moved ahead with its initial public offering last week, and raised roughly $425 million from the sale of 15.2 million shares. Robinhood Seeks SEC Nod for VC Fund Meanwhile, Robinhood is looking to open up the world of venture capital to everyday investors with a new fund that could give retail traders access to opportunities that are usually reserved for institutions and the wealthy. On Monday, the brokerage revealed it filed a Form N-2 with the SEC to register shares of the Robinhood Ventures Fund I (RVI), which would be managed by its newly formed subsidiary, Robinhood Ventures DE. If approved, the shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and available for trading through participating brokerage platforms. The company said the fund will target firms “at the frontiers of their respective industries,” but did not identify specific sectors. Venture capital typically focuses on high-growth fields like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and Web3, areas where Robinhood has already been expanding. In the past few years, the brokerage added cryptocurrency trading, acquired exchange Bitstamp, and purchased Canadian crypto firm WonderFi for $179 million. It also experimented with tokenization, offering tokenized stocks and developing private stock tokens, which has attracted some scrutiny from people who are concerned about potential regulatory challenges. This latest plan comes as venture capital funding is rebounding strongly. According to S&P Global , global VC investment reached $189.3 billion in the first half of 2025, up from $152.4 billion in the same period last year. Artificial intelligence startups led the surge, but crypto has also seen a sharp comeback, with $10 billion raised in the second quarter alone, the strongest performance since 2022. Tokenization, stablecoin infrastructure, and decentralized finance have been central themes in the sector’s growth. Monthly VC investments (Source: S&P Global ) For retail investors, however, access to these high-risk, high-reward early-stage deals has long been restricted by US securities laws, which generally limit participation to accredited investors. Robinhood’s proposed venture fund will offer a rare chance for retail traders to gain indirect exposure to a class of investments that has historically been closed off to them.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-16 05:30:00

Whale distributions, seasonal volatility, and persistent macro uncertainty have combined to force capital elsewhere in the market. Inflows into XRP and Solana are accelerating, signaling a fresh stage in the rotation cycle as investors search for higher growth opportunities outside of BTC. Analysts argue that such shifts are healthy, setting the stage for broader altcoin season strength and igniting speculative interest in new entrants. Among the projects positioned to benefit is MAGACOIN FINANCE , where projections of a 58× run-up have drawn thousands of wallets into its presale. Bitcoin’s Selling Pressure Mounts Whale Exits and Seasonal Risks On-chain trackers show that long-term holders have been distributing Bitcoin aggressively in early September, unloading billions in profit after a summer of strength. A single whale sale of roughly $2.6 billion last week triggered a cascading $310 million liquidation wave , reinforcing how vulnerable the market remains when liquidity thins. September has historically been one of Bitcoin’s weakest months, with negative returns recorded in six of the last eight years. ETF Flows Highlight Sentiment Divide ETF data highlights a sharp divergence. Ethereum-linked funds saw $788 million in outflows in the past week, while Bitcoin ETFs recorded $246 million in net inflows . While institutions are still allocating to BTC, the lack of corresponding price strength suggests retail selling and whale profit-taking are outweighing inflows. For traders, this combination has created uncertainty and volatility, sparking renewed appetite for altcoins. XRP: Positioning for Regulatory and ETF Catalysts XRP has emerged as a prime beneficiary of Bitcoin’s recent weakness. With the SEC expected to deliver decisions on pending ETF applications in the coming months, traders are positioning for a possible approval that could dramatically expand XRP’s investor base. Daily trading volumes have spiked, and large whale wallets continue to accumulate. Analysts argue XRP’s unique legal clarity, having won a partial court victory in 2023, gives it an advantage compared to many other altcoins. If ETF approval materializes, XRP could secure inflows at a pace similar to Ethereum’s post-ETF era, making it a strong rotational play. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Trust and Scarcity Drive Narrative The rotation into alternative assets has created fertile ground for MAGACOIN FINANCE , a presale project riding momentum from political branding and early community traction. Thousands of wallets have already applied the PATRIOT50X bonus code , boosting allocations by 50% extra tokens . But what truly sets it apart is trust: the project is audit-approved by both HashEx and CertiK , a dual stamp of legitimacy rarely achieved by early-stage tokens. Combined with scarcity-driven presale rounds, these factors have positioned MAGACOIN FINANCE as a cultural and financial narrative in its own right. Analysts projecting a 58× upside argue that it could mirror Ethereum’s early breakout years, when narrative and legitimacy combined to fuel generational gains. For many traders, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another presale, it’s being framed as a once-in-a-cycle opportunity . Solana: Retail Activity Fuels Momentum Solana is also seeing renewed inflows, supported by strong activity across DeFi and NFT sectors. Transaction volume on Solana-based decentralized exchanges rose sharply in early September, while new wallet creation remains near all-time highs. Retail enthusiasm for Solana meme coins, combined with consistent ecosystem upgrades, has reinforced confidence in its scalability. Analysts note that Solana’s blend of speed, cost efficiency, and cultural adoption gives it a unique position in the market. With Bitcoin losing dominance, Solana is increasingly seen as the “risk-on” platform of choice for both retail and institutional players. Macro Environment: Why Rotation Matters The shift away from Bitcoin reflects broader macro dynamics. Sticky inflation, weaker U.S. jobs numbers, and uncertainty around Federal Reserve rate cuts are pressuring risk assets. While Bitcoin remains the benchmark, its volatility and seasonal weakness have prompted investors to explore alternatives. In this environment, altcoins with clear narratives, regulatory catalysts, or cultural resonance become attractive. Rotation is also technical. Bitcoin dominance has slipped toward 57%, and analysts expect further downside. Historically, once dominance dips below 55%, altcoins often rally in unison. That dynamic is already visible as liquidity migrates to XRP, Solana, and presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Capture the Rotation Dual Audit Approval : Certification from both HashEx and CertiK enhances credibility, setting it apart from speculative peers. Scarcity and Bonus Mechanics : With PATRIOT50X codes boosting allocations by 50%, urgency is baked into participation. Cultural Branding : Politically charged identity helps MAGACOIN FINANCE attract both grassroots and whale support. Rotation Tailwind : As Bitcoin’s dominance wanes, speculative capital seeks fresh stories, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as the breakout presale. Conclusion Bitcoin’s latest sell-off has accelerated the long-anticipated rotation toward altcoins. With whales distributing and seasonal weakness weighing on BTC, investors are redirecting flows into projects with stronger catalysts. XRP offers regulatory clarity and ETF potential, Solana benefits from retail adoption and ecosystem growth, while MAGACOIN FINANCE combines scarcity, cultural branding, and dual audit approval to create a rare early-stage opportunity . As projections of a 58× run-up circulate, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a focal point for traders seeking not only profits but participation in one of 2025’s defining narratives. In a market where legitimacy and story matter as much as technology, it is uniquely positioned to thrive in the next phase of the cycle.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-20-per-xrp-is-closer-than-you-think-heres-why/,"Market Strategist Levi has predicted that XRP, the third-largest crypto by market cap, could realistically reach $20. In a recent tweet accompanied by a video, Levi stated, “$20 Per XRP Is CLOSER Than You Think!” He supported this prediction by referencing both historical price movements and present-day market factors. Levi began by highlighting the supply shock XRP experienced in 2017. At that time, the asset rose from around $0.20 to more than $3.38. According to him, that rally was driven by retail participation, fear of missing out, and early institutional interest, particularly from banks experimenting with Ripple’s cross-border payment technology . He suggested that conditions in today’s market show similarities that could potentially set the stage for another such cycle. $20 Per XRP Is CLOSER Than You Think! pic.twitter.com/t7iUOgAd8A — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 14, 2025 Indicators of Supply Contraction In the video, Levi focused on exchange reserve data, noting a 5.66% drop in XRP reserves held on trading platforms. He explained that as coins move off exchanges, the available liquidity in the market contracts, which may create upward pressure on price if demand holds steady or increases. Levi also pointed out that this trend could accelerate if more institutional vehicles, such as exchange-traded funds, begin accumulating positions. He further noted that ETFs have a strong probability of participation in the market, which he estimated at 95 percent. Alongside this, Levi mentioned the role of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, which he said had already processed around $1.3 trillion in volume. This level of adoption, in his view, adds structural demand that was not present to the same extent during earlier cycles. Short-Term and Midterm Projections Levi acknowledged that some market observers see XRP moving toward $6 in the short term. However, he emphasizes the midterm outlook. He argued that the combination of shrinking exchange reserves, potential ETF activity, and macroeconomic shifts such as interest rate cuts could support a scenario where XRP rallies significantly beyond those near-term targets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He expressed confidence in a higher trajectory, stating that a $20 XRP bull run is a likely possibility if multiple rate cuts materialize. Levi tied this directly to how looser monetary policy could benefit risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by improving liquidity conditions and increasing investor appetite for higher-yield opportunities. Levi’s analysis ties together historical precedent, current supply dynamics, institutional demand factors, and macroeconomic trends. He sees the present conditions as supportive of an outcome where XRP moves above its current price levels, potentially reaching $20. His perspective builds on the past example of the 2017 rally but integrates new elements such as exchange-traded fund participation and large-scale ODL usage. By combining these factors, Levi positions his outlook as a data-driven case for significant upside potential in XRP.

XRP’s $3.10 Battle Could Decide It,https://coinpaper.com/11036/fakeout-or-foreshadowing-xrp-s-3-10-battle-could-decide-it,"XRP Battles Key Resistance at $3.10: Fakeout or Fuel for a Bigger Breakout? XRP’s price action has once again placed the cryptocurrency in the spotlight, as it briefly pierced above the critical $3.10 resistance before slipping back below it. The move has sparked fears among traders of a classic fakeout, a failed breakout that traps buyers and opens the door to short-term downside. Yet, according to market analyst Shaminem, beneath the drama lies a setup that still favors the bulls, provided certain conditions are met. The $3.10 Resistance: Why It Matters The $3.10 level has become a key battleground for XRP. Breaking above this price would not only signal strength but also pave the way for a potential push toward the next upside target around $3.40 or higher. However, for the breakout to be considered legitimate, XRP needs to reclaim $3.10 with conviction. That means strong trading volume and, importantly, a daily close above the level. Without these, momentum may falter, leaving the door open for sellers to reassert control. Shaminem pointed out , “XRP is at a decision point. A strong close above $3.10 could fire up momentum for another leg higher. If bulls deliver volume and on-chain engagement now, the path toward $3.40+ is open.” Recent analysis also shows that the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency is also eyeing a $3.60 breakout if buying interest persists. Signs of Cooling Momentum Adding to concerns is the recent decline in on-chain activity. Data shows XRP transactions have dropped sharply from a recent peak of 11.7 million, a sign that user activity and network demand may be cooling off. On-chain health often acts as a leading indicator for price momentum, and the dip in activity raises questions about whether XRP has the fuel to sustain a move higher. For the bullish case to remain intact, Shaminem stresses that transaction growth will need to reverse and show renewed strength. The Safety Net: Support Levels to Watch Despite the pullback, XRP’s technical foundation still looks relatively stable. Key support zones are positioned at approximately $2.81, aligned with the exponential moving average (EMA), and near $2.50, where the 200-day moving average (MA) provides a longer-term safety net. As long as XRP holds these levels, downside risk is considered manageable. A clean defense of these supports would suggest that the broader uptrend remains intact, even if short-term volatility persists. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at the psychological price of $3, according to CoinGecko data . The Bullish Path Forward For bulls, the roadmap is clear: reclaim $3.10 with volume, secure a decisive daily close above it, and reignite on-chain activity. If these factors align, XRP could quickly gather momentum for a rally toward $3.40 or beyond. Such a move would not only invalidate the fakeout fears but also strengthen confidence that XRP is entering a new phase of market expansion. Conclusion XRP’s pullback below $3.10 has sparked uncertainty, but strong support suggests the battle isn’t over. All eyes are on $3.10, if bulls reclaim it with conviction, renewed momentum could drive the next leg higher.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-16 05:41:23

At the same time, it’s been sinking against every other major currency, setting off alarms from India to Mexico. But oh this isn’t some weird fluke, it’s exactly how Beijing wants it right now, and it’s already pissing off China’s biggest trading partners. While the offshore yuan has gained 3% against the dollar this year, it’s dropped more than 10% against the euro, 5% against the pound, and 3% against the yen. That divergence has made Chinese exports dirt cheap outside the U.S., just as shipments to America keep shrinking. China’s own customs data show the U.S. took less than 10% of Chinese exports in August, down from 15% last year. At the same time, exports to Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia are climbing fast. Beijing holds the line on rate cuts while Fed gets ready to slash The People’s Bank of China has refused to follow the Federal Reserve’s expected rate cut this week, which traders are pricing at a 94.2% chance, based on CME Group’s FedWatch tool. The Fed is widely expected to lower its key rate by 25 basis points. That would narrow the yield gap between U.S. and Chinese debt, boosting demand for Chinese assets just as global investors rotate into emerging markets. But Beijing is stuck. The CSI 300 Index has already surged 43% since September 2024, driven by state-led buying and retail investors ditching low-yield deposits. Any more easing could blow that bubble wide open. Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said the central bank is trapped between “fanning the flames” of a stock bubble and “worsening the growth slowdown.” Ting thinks they may go for a tiny 10-basis-point cut in the coming weeks, but only if the market cools down. Instead of pumping in fresh stimulus, the PBOC is steering the yuan higher by setting the daily fix stronger. On Monday, they pinned the midpoint at 7.1056, the strongest since last November. Tommy Xie, head of Asia macro research at OCBC Bank, said the yuan is “transitioning from prolonged stability to a carefully steered grind higher.” He expects the offshore yuan to land at 7.08 per dollar by year-end. That completely flips what most economists expected earlier this year, when they thought China would devalue the yuan to fight off U.S. tariffs. Even Goldman Sachs admitted the stronger fix could be a “goodwill gesture” to the Trump White House as trade talks grind on. The bank sees the onshore yuan hitting 7.0 by year-end. Currency drop triggers trade backlash from India and Mexico While the yuan-dollar rate looks clean, the freefall against other currencies is now drawing fire from trading partners. Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence, said: “The divergence of yuan’s appreciation against the dollar and depreciation against others is largely due to a weak dollar that’s unseen for many years.” Tianchen said the drop will help Chinese exporters as they move away from the U.S. and sell more to non-dollar markets. But not everyone’s happy. Larry Hu, chief economist at Macquarie, said the yuan’s real effective exchange rate, a measure that adjusts for inflation, is now the weakest since December 2011. That means Chinese goods are cheaper everywhere outside the U.S., and that’s blowing up China’s trade surplus with other countries. India is already pissed. The country logged a $77.7 billion trade deficit with China in just the first eight months of this year, 16% higher than last year. Now New Delhi wants the BRICS bloc to do something about it. Over in Mexico, the government is pushing to raise import tariffs on Asian vehicles to 50%, up from 20%, in a move clearly aimed at China. Stephen Jen, who runs Eurizon SLJ Capital, called it “opportunistic devaluation.” He said Beijing used the dollar’s collapse to quietly engineer a yuan devaluation against everyone else. “A more reasonably priced renminbi and a less predatory exchange rate policy would earn China some goodwill from the rest of the world,” Stephen said. That’s a polite way of saying the global backlash is already building, and Beijing knows it. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

If so, understanding the dynamics of BTC perpetual futures is absolutely essential. The long/short ratio for these futures provides a fascinating glimpse into collective trader sentiment, hinting at whether the market anticipates an upward or downward price movement for Bitcoin. What Does the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Reveal? The long/short ratio is a powerful indicator, showing the proportion of long positions (bets on price increase) versus short positions (bets on price decrease) among traders. When we look at the BTC perpetual futures data from the past 24 hours on the world’s top three cryptocurrency futures exchanges, ranked by open interest, a clear picture emerges. Overall, the sentiment leans slightly bearish: Overall: Long 48.92% / Short 51.08% Binance: Long 48.33% / Short 51.67% Bybit: Long 48.55% / Short 51.45% Gate.io: Long 50.55% / Short 49.45% This snapshot indicates that, across these major platforms, more traders are currently positioned for a price decline in Bitcoin than for a rise. Gate.io stands out as the only one with a slight bullish bias among the top three. Why is the BTC Perpetual Futures Market Leaning Short? You might be wondering why the sentiment for BTC perpetual futures is currently skewed towards short positions. Several factors can influence this. Recent price consolidation, macroeconomic uncertainties, or even specific technical resistance levels could lead traders to anticipate a pullback. It’s important to remember that these ratios reflect current market expectations. They are not predictions but rather a real-time aggregation of how a large segment of traders is positioning themselves. A prevailing short bias suggests a cautious or even bearish outlook among many participants in the BTC perpetual futures market. How Can Traders Utilize BTC Perpetual Futures Data? For savvy traders, the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio offers valuable insights. However, it’s crucial to use it as part of a broader analytical toolkit. Here are a few ways this data can be applied: Contrarian Indicator: Sometimes, an extreme imbalance in the ratio (either overwhelmingly long or short) can act as a contrarian signal. If too many traders are on one side, a reversal might be more likely as positions get squeezed. Confirmation Tool: If your own analysis points to a bearish outlook, a market-wide short bias in BTC perpetual futures could help confirm your conviction. Risk Management: Understanding the general sentiment can help you gauge the potential volatility and risk associated with your own positions. A heavily skewed market can be more prone to sharp moves. Always combine this data with other technical and fundamental analysis to make informed decisions for your BTC perpetual futures trading strategy. The Significance of Top Exchanges in BTC Perpetual Futures The data presented comes from Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io. These exchanges are not arbitrary choices; they represent the pinnacle of the cryptocurrency futures market due to their massive open interest and trading volumes. Their aggregated data provides a robust indicator of overall market sentiment for BTC perpetual futures . While the overall trend shows a slight short bias, the subtle differences between exchanges like Gate.io’s slight long lean highlight the nuances within the market. These variations can sometimes point to localized sentiment shifts or differing trader demographics on specific platforms. In conclusion, the current BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio suggests a cautious or slightly bearish sentiment among traders on leading exchanges. This metric is a powerful tool for understanding market psychology, but it should always be interpreted alongside other indicators. By paying attention to these shifts, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin’s potential price movements and refine your trading approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a BTC perpetual future? A BTC perpetual future is a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual futures don’t expire, making them popular for continuous trading. How is the long/short ratio calculated? The long/short ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total number or volume of open long positions by the total number or volume of open short positions on an exchange or across multiple exchanges. Does a high short ratio always mean Bitcoin’s price will fall? Not necessarily. While a high short ratio indicates more traders expect a price drop, it’s a sentiment indicator, not a guarantee. Extreme ratios can sometimes precede a ‘short squeeze,’ where price moves up sharply, forcing short sellers to cover their positions. Why are Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io important for this data? These exchanges are among the largest by open interest and trading volume for cryptocurrency futures. Their aggregated data offers a broad and significant representation of overall market sentiment for BTC perpetual futures . How often does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio change? The long/short ratio is constantly changing in real-time as traders open and close positions. The data presented here is a snapshot over a 24-hour period, but live data can fluctuate minute by minute. Did you find this analysis helpful?

European-listed firm Capital B has made a decisive move, securing substantial funding specifically for a Capital B Bitcoin investment . This bold step underscores a growing trend where established companies are increasingly recognizing the strategic value of digital assets. What’s Behind Capital B’s Massive Bitcoin Investment? Capital B recently announced a successful share offering, raising an impressive €58.1 million, equivalent to approximately $68.43 million. The primary purpose of these newly acquired funds is straightforward: to purchase Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t just a minor allocation; it’s a significant commitment from a publicly traded entity, signaling strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. The decision to raise capital explicitly for a Capital B Bitcoin investment reflects a strategic shift. Companies are now openly integrating digital assets into their treasury strategies or investment portfolios. This move by Capital B is a clear indicator that Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class, attracting serious institutional players. Why Are Companies Like Capital B Investing in BTC Now? Several factors are driving this institutional interest in Bitcoin. Firstly, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation, especially given the current global economic climate. Its decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive store of value. Inflation Hedge: Many see Bitcoin as “digital gold,” offering protection against currency debasement. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can diversify assets away from traditional fiat currencies and bonds. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth, appealing to companies seeking high-return opportunities. Technological Innovation: Investing in BTC also aligns companies with the cutting edge of financial technology and innovation. The transparency and efficiency of the Bitcoin network also play a role. For Capital B, this Capital B Bitcoin investment could be a strategic play to position itself at the forefront of the evolving digital economy. The Impact of Institutional Capital B Bitcoin Investment on the Market When a listed company like Capital B makes such a substantial move, it sends ripples through the entire cryptocurrency market. It lends credibility and legitimacy to Bitcoin, potentially encouraging other corporations to follow suit. This influx of institutional capital can have several positive effects: Increased Liquidity: More large-scale buyers contribute to a deeper and more stable market. Price Stability: While not eliminating volatility, institutional adoption can help stabilize prices over the long term by adding a steady demand source. Mainstream Acceptance: Each new corporate investment pushes Bitcoin further into the mainstream, reducing skepticism and increasing general acceptance. This development is not just about Capital B; it’s about the broader narrative of Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance. The Capital B Bitcoin investment serves as a powerful example for other European and global companies considering similar strategies. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? The trend of corporate Bitcoin holdings is accelerating. Companies like MicroStrategy pioneered this path, and now others, including Capital B, are joining in. This suggests a future where holding digital assets might become a standard practice for treasury management, rather than an outlier strategy. However, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. The price of Bitcoin can be volatile, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving. Companies undertaking a Capital B Bitcoin investment must have a robust strategy to manage these risks. This includes understanding market dynamics and having a clear long-term vision. For investors and enthusiasts, Capital B’s announcement is a testament to Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its increasing role in global finance. It reinforces the idea that digital assets are here to stay and are attracting serious capital from serious players. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from Capital B’s Move? Capital B’s decision offers valuable lessons for both individuals and businesses: Research is Key: Before any investment, thorough research into the asset and its potential risks is crucial. Long-Term Vision: Institutional investors often have a long-term perspective, which is vital in volatile markets. Diversification Matters: Even within a crypto portfolio, diversification across different assets can mitigate risk. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency space evolves rapidly. Keeping up with news and trends is essential. The Capital B Bitcoin investment isn’t just a headline; it’s a case study in how traditional finance is adapting to the digital age. A Glimpse into Bitcoin’s Institutional Future Capital B’s successful fundraising and explicit plan to acquire Bitcoin marks another significant milestone in the journey of cryptocurrency. This move not only validates Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset but also highlights the increasing confidence of European listed companies in its future. As more corporations follow this path, we can anticipate a more robust, stable, and widely accepted digital asset ecosystem.

Coinbase’s Base Network Takes Steps Toward Token Launch Armstrong articulated that the potential introduction of a network token could serve as a “powerful tool” to accelerate decentralization and foster growth among creators and developers within the ecosystem. Following the firm’s BaseCamp 2025 event in Vermont, the executive emphasized the importance of building in the open, stating that the exploration of this token aligns with their commitment to transparency and community engagement. Accompanying Armstrong’s announcement, the Base network published a blog post confirming its intention to explore a network token. The post highlighted that this exploration is in its early stages and does not come with definitive plans at this moment In addition to the token exploration, the blog post also unveiled an open-source bridge designed to enhance interoperability between Base and the Solana (SOL) blockchain as part of a broader initiative to facilitate seamless interactions across different chains. No Definitive Plans Yet When Base originally launched, its focus was clear: to establish a developer-friendly ecosystem capable of executing secure transactions at low costs. The introduction of a network token was not deemed necessary to meet these goals. However, with the successful achievement of sub-second and sub-cent transactions, as well as nearly one million active users according to Token Terminal data , the team aims to establish a more open and accessible on-chain economy. The network’s blog post noted that exploring this possibility is one avenue toward realizing their vision of a global on-chain economy, which could enhance decentralization and create more opportunities for builders and creators. While the exploration is in its nascent stages, the firm made it clear that there are no specific timelines, designs, or governance structures in place yet. In addition, the blog post reiterated three key commitments to the community: a continued dedication to the Ethereum blockchain , adherence to regulatory guidelines as a US-based company, and a focus on building transparently: If and when we move forward with a token, it will be grounded in principles, values, and in alignment with our long-term mission: to build a global economy that increases innovation, creativity, and freedom. In conclusion, Armstrong specified that this is not a definitive plan but rather an update to their philosophy as they consider the future of the network. When writing, Coinbase’s stock, which trades on the Nasdaq, has reached a valuation of $324. It is still in consolidation mode after dropping from its record high of $444 in July of this year.

Market analyst Ash Crypto recently highlighted several key factors, including demand and supply dynamics, a surge in US equities, and increasing inflows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs), suggesting that the current market conditions could favor Bitcoin’s resurgence. Market Makers Accused Of Manipulating Bitcoin Prices In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Ash pointed out that while US stocks are reaching new all-time highs, Bitcoin has struggled to break above the $117,000 mark, currently consolidating between $110,000 and $115,000. He argues that this situation is not indicative of weak demand, but rather the result of an alleged situation that is gaining strength among analysts: manipulation by market makers and exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Plunge Sparks Outrage: Binance Targeted For Alleged Market Manipulation The analyst further highlights that historical data show Bitcoin’s price movements were primarily driven by spot market activities. Buyers would purchase coins, absorbing supply and driving prices higher. However, today’s landscape is markedly different. Ash Crypto suggests that the introduction of futures and derivatives has transformed how Bitcoin is traded. He alleges that exchanges discovered that creating synthetic Bitcoin contracts is often more profitable than dealing in actual spot Bitcoin. The analyst notes that this shift allows undisclosed cryptocurrency exchanges to manipulate market movements using leverage and bypass the need for tangible Bitcoin. What Historical Patterns Suggest Ash pointed out that a situation indicative of this alleged manipulation was when Bitcoin recently touched $124,000, market makers and larger investors quickly shorted the asset through futures and exchange-traded funds. This triggered a wave of liquidations for bullish investors that predicted a new leg up, causing the price of Bitcoin to plummet to the $107,000 mark only two weeks ago. The analyst noted that although US equities are experiencing significant growth and liquidity is flooding into risk assets, Bitcoin is still caught in a cycle of manipulation that obscures its true value. Related Reading: The Big PEPE Price Breakout: Falling Wedge Pattern Points To 64% Rally In short, spot demand for Bitcoin continues to build, ETFs are steadily absorbing more coins, cryptocurrency exchange reserves are dwindling, and long-term holders are refraining from selling. However, Ash Crypto notes that the presence of futures and derivatives for the cryptocurrency creates an “illusion of weakness,” reportedly designed to shake out retail investors from current market levels. Despite the current challenges, he notes that the current bullish cycle remains intact. Historical patterns from 2017 and 2021 show that Bitcoin often experiences periods of suppression and sideways movement before exploding higher, suggesting a potential new price discovery phase ahead for BTC. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at around $114,969. It is still recording gains of nearly 3% and 6% in the seven- and fourteen-day time frames, respectively.

South Korean crypto exchange Upbit has issued an important notice regarding a temporary Upbit OM suspension for Mantra (OM) deposits and withdrawals. This crucial step is set to begin on September 17th at 3:00 a.m. UTC. The reason behind this action? A necessary network upgrade for the OM token. For many in the crypto community, understanding such announcements is key to managing their digital assets effectively and avoiding any unexpected disruptions. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader Mantra ecosystem. What Does the Upbit OM Suspension Entail for Users? Upbit’s official announcement clearly states that the suspension will affect both deposits and withdrawals of Mantra (OM). This means that from the specified time, users will not be able to: Deposit OM: Send OM tokens from an external wallet or another exchange to your Upbit account. Withdraw OM: Transfer OM tokens from your Upbit account to an external wallet or another exchange. It is important to remember that this is a temporary measure. Upbit is taking this step to ensure the smooth and secure transition of the Mantra network to its upgraded version. Planning any OM transactions before the deadline is a smart move to avoid inconvenience. Why Are Network Upgrades Crucial for Cryptocurrency Assets? You might be wondering why an exchange needs to suspend services for a network upgrade. Think of a network upgrade as a vital software update for your smartphone or computer. These updates are essential for improving performance, fixing bugs, and introducing new features. Similarly, blockchain network upgrades are fundamental to the long-term health and security of a cryptocurrency. They can bring about: Enhanced Security: Strengthening the network against potential threats. Improved Scalability: Allowing the network to handle more transactions efficiently. New Functionality: Introducing innovative features or smart contract capabilities. Better Performance: Making transactions faster and more reliable. Exchanges like Upbit play a critical role by supporting these upgrades, ensuring their platform is compatible with the new network, and protecting user assets during the transition. This commitment helps maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of the crypto space. Navigating the Upbit OM Suspension: Actionable Steps for OM Holders While the Upbit OM suspension might seem inconvenient, it is a necessary step for the Mantra network’s advancement. Here’s what OM holders should consider: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw OM, ensure you complete these transactions well before 3:00 a.m. UTC on September 17th. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Upbit’s official announcements for updates regarding the upgrade’s progress and when services will resume. Official channels are always the most reliable source of information. Avoid Attempts: Do not attempt to deposit or withdraw OM during the suspension period, as these transactions will likely fail and could potentially lead to loss of funds if not handled correctly. It’s worth noting that while deposits and withdrawals are suspended, trading of OM on Upbit may continue as usual, depending on the exchange’s specific policies during such events. Always verify the latest information directly from Upbit. The Broader Impact of This Upbit OM Suspension on the Mantra Ecosystem Every time a major exchange like Upbit supports a network upgrade with a temporary suspension, it sends a clear signal about the maturity and commitment of the token project.

Just a week after launch, the token has exploded across major exchanges. With listings on Binance, Upbit, and Bithumb, $AVNT surged to a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $1.5 , while trading volume ripped past $633M, according to CoinMarketCap. The Base-native token is already trading like a heavyweight. The speed of growth has stunned both traders and analysts. What is Avantis ($AVNT)? Avantis is being pitched as the on-chain perpetuals exchange built on Base. Think of Hyperliquid, but redesigned to be far more accessible. On Avantis, users can trade crypto, gold, FX, oil, equities, and even sports markets, all from one platform. No brokers. No middlemen. No settlement delays. It’s full decentralization applied to global trading. The vision: a single, borderless exchange where almost everything can be traded seamlessly. The Airdrop That Started It All $AVNT made headlines with its 12.5% airdrop last week. Thousands of users cashed in, with some walking away with six-figure sums. But the event wasn’t without controversy. Data from Bubblemaps revealed a suspicious pattern. One entity allegedly claimed $4M worth of $AVNT through a coordinated sybil attack. BREAKING: One entity claimed $4M from the $AVNT airdrop This sybil attack was coordinated, and spread across 300+ addresses pic.twitter.com/aWKuz52J4p — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) September 15, 2025 The attack was spread across 300+ wallets, all funded and managed in eerily similar ways. How the Attack Played Out Investigators flagged a repeating cycle: Wallets funded directly from Coinbase USDC moved in from a small group of connected addresses Tokens swapped on Avantis Airdrop claimed simultaneously Tokens consolidated into a few addresses Funds pushed onto Bybit and Gate at the same time The flow was too precise to be random. In fact, these wallets had been completely dormant until $AVNT went live. The activity mirrored patterns seen in previous sybil exploits, such as with $MYX. $AVNT hits a new ATH after triple listings on Binance, Upbit, and Bithumb. Launched just last week, AVNT is now live on nearly every major exchange, with volume surging past $633M. Full report by @KayyGilani https://t.co/QSJHRPmR7y pic.twitter.com/mu13VI9OSz — BeInCrypto (@beincrypto) September 15, 2025 The sybil attack doesn’t appear to have slowed momentum. If anything, the attention may have amplified Avantis’ debut. Traders seem more focused on the triple exchange listings and massive liquidity surge than on the controversy. Still, the incident highlights a recurring issue: airdrops remain a prime target for coordinated exploits. Despite advanced tracking tools and anti-sybil filters, whales continue to find ways around them. AVNT Market Snapshot Price (ATH): $1.19 ($1.5) 24h Volume: $633M Exchanges: Binance, Upbit, Bithumb (plus Bybit, Gate) Launch: Last week on Base Category: On-chain perpetuals (cross-asset trading) Why Avantis Surge Matters Avantis isn’t just another Base-native protocol. It’s trying to build a universal marketplace, something that goes beyond crypto. With decentralized access to commodities, stocks, and even sports markets, it blurs the line between DeFi and TradFi. The triple listing gave $AVNT the kind of visibility most projects never achieve in their first year. And with volume already over half a billion dollars, traders are treating Avantis as more than just a speculative play. But the airdrop drama shows how fragile early token launches can be. If Avantis wants to sustain momentum, it will need to prove it can secure its platform against sybil-style exploits while scaling access to its ambitious trading suite. Avantis has arrived fast, maybe too fast. In just a week, it went from a stealth Base project to trading at scale across global exchanges. The token now backed by explosive trading volume and aggressive listings. Yet, the airdrop controversy lingers. The $4M sybil grab casts a shadow over what should have been a flawless debut. For traders, the signal is clear: $AVNT is now on the map, and its rise is reshaping expectations of what Base-native protocols can achieve. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The report identified two cohorts that defined the threshold of illiquid supply. These were entities with Bitcoin that last moved seven or more years ago, and public companies holding at least 1,000 BTC. “We estimate that this combined group will hold over six million Bitcoin by the end of 2025 — or over 28% of the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist.” Illiquid Supply Growing Public companies currently hold more than 830,000 BTC, or 4% of the circulating supply, with 97% concentrated among companies holding more than 1,000 units. That number could be even higher, as BitcoinTreasuries reports that over 1.3 million BTC is held by public and private companies. When combining the supply of long-term holders with public company holdings, one can see an accelerating trend of holding Bitcoin versus trading or transacting, the researcher noted. He added that the rise in BTC adoption among public company treasuries has driven an uptick in illiquid supply since Q3 2024. New research piece from analyst Zack Wainwright where he digs deeper on bitcoin’s increasingly illiquid supply. One interesting aspect is the analysis of what public company accumulation could do to supply in the future. Check it out here for free: https://t.co/8eFwAYo0Yg — Chris Kuiper, CFA (@ChrisJKuiper) September 15, 2025 The report predicted that nearly 42% of the current circulating supply, or over 8.3 million BTC, will be considered illiquid by 2032. The researcher concluded that over time, the scarcity of Bitcoin may become the focal point as more entities buy and hold the asset long term. “If nation-state adoption increases and the regulatory environment surrounding Bitcoin continues to evolve, the growth of the illiquid supply could be even more dramatic.” Although the report did not mention it, the same is likely to be happening with Ethereum , as digital asset treasuries have scooped up more than 4% of the entire supply in just a few months. Since Ether ETFs launched last year, they have hoovered up more than 5.5% of the total supply. BTC Price Outlook Bitcoin has been in the red over the past day, falling back from a Monday high of $116,700 to just over $115,000 during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. The asset has been consolidating for almost a week and remains 7.2% down from its all-time high, so there has yet to be a major correction that was largely expected this month.

The stance made sense. Coinbase is a publicly traded company on NASDAQ under ticker $COIN , accountable to regulators and shareholders. But things are changing fast. At BaseCamp, Jesse Pollak, head of the Base ecosystem, revealed the team is exploring a network token. That admission, made publicly for the first time, could signal a historic shift. The timing isn’t random. Since Donald Trump took office, his administration has hinted at loosening restrictions around crypto. For Base, that could be the opening needed to step into territory previously seen as off-limits. Building the Bridge: Base Meets Solana Pollak laid out the vision clearly. “The goal of this bridge is to make it so you can build seamlessly across both Base and Solana with SOL, ERC-20s and SPL tokens.” The bridge unlocks three core features: Deposit and use SOL in any Base app Import any Solana token into Base apps Export Base tokens directly to Solana That’s a two-way highway connecting two of the fastest-growing ecosystems. It means developers aren’t siloed anymore. They can tap liquidity, users, and apps across both chains. Not Just Another Layer-2 Plenty of L2s compete for attention: Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync. But Base isn’t built the same. Coinbase owns it. That makes it the first major L2 with direct ties to Wall Street investors. That’s where the tension lies. How does a U.S.-listed company justify launching a token? What does that mean for compliance? For the Securities and Exchange Commission? And for the countless projects building on Base right now? This could become the biggest legitimization of tokens in U.S. history. Or it could turn into the wildest regulatory test case ever. The Numbers Behind Base Despite the uncertainty, Base has exploded in growth. The network now holds $4.8 billion in assets and manages over 200 million addresses, according to internal metrics. Pollak used BaseCamp to outline expansion plans, framing the potential token as a milestone in the network’s roadmap. A Base token, if approved, would cement its status not just as another scaling solution, but as a core pillar of Coinbase’s long-term strategy. Coinbase’s Stake in the Game Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has often stressed that the company wants to “bring a billion people on-chain.” Base is the vehicle for that vision. By owning the infrastructure, Coinbase isn’t just a centralized exchange anymore. It’s becoming the backbone for apps, wallets, and on-chain economies. A token launch would supercharge that mission. But it also raises the stakes. Shareholders may question the risks. Regulators could scrutinize every step. The industry will be watching. Binance Wallet Goes Live with Base Adding fuel to the momentum, Binance Wallet announced today that Base is live on its web wallet. That means millions of Binance users can now explore and trade Base tokens directly. Base is now live on #Binance Wallet (Web)! Explore and trade the latest Base tokens now Visit https://t.co/LFeLcYEnXK and select Base to get started. — Binance Wallet (@BinanceWallet) September 15, 2025 The integration gives Base instant global liquidity and visibility. For developers building tokens on Base, that’s massive. A listing pipeline from Base apps → Binance Wallet could bring new projects to market at speed. Voices Around the Ecosystem Pollak’s statement immediately set off a wave of reactions across X. Jesse Pollak himself posted about Base’s direction: welcome to BaseCamp https://t.co/62R2Wr2H54 — jesse.base.eth (@jessepollak) September 15, 2025 Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong echoed the message: We’re exploring a Base network token. It could be a great tool for accelerating decentralization and expanding creator and developer growth in the ecosystem. To be clear, there are no definitive plans. We’re just updating our philosophy. As of now, we’re exploring it. https://t.co/BK3asbMpar — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 15, 2025 Community members weighed in, with excitement and caution. One popular thread summed it up: BREAKING: Jesse Pollak announces that Base is launching a new bridge between Base and Solana “The goal of this bridge is to make it so you can build seamlessly across both Base and Solana with SOL, ERC-20s and SPL tokens” It lets you do 3 things – Deposit and use SOL in any… pic.twitter.com/oAIOj3ko7q — Jack (@Jack55750) September 15, 2025 The conversation reflects the moment. Is this the legitimization everyone has been waiting for, or a step into uncharted regulatory waters? If Base does launch a token, it won’t just be another asset on CoinMarketCap. It could mark a turning point in how U.S. companies approach on-chain networks. Coinbase’s involvement guarantees mainstream attention—and regulatory heat. For developers, the Solana bridge makes Base a more attractive hub. For users, Binance Wallet integration makes Base tokens easier to access. And for policymakers, this could become the case study they use to redefine token rules in America. One thing is clear: Base isn’t backing down. The question now is whether regulators, shareholders, and users are ready for what comes next. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

A recent forecast from Fidelity Digital Assets has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, highlighting a significant shift in the landscape of Bitcoin supply . This groundbreaking report projects that a substantial portion of Bitcoin will become effectively illiquid by the end of 2025, signaling profound implications for its future. Understanding the Illiquid Bitcoin Supply Phenomenon Fidelity Digital Assets, a reputable name in institutional crypto investment, recently published a comprehensive report shedding light on Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Their analysis indicates that approximately 28% of the total Bitcoin supply will be out of active circulation by the close of 2025. This isn’t just a fleeting statistic; it represents a growing trend with long-term consequences for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What exactly contributes to this increasing illiquidity? The report identifies two primary drivers: Long-Term Dormant Addresses: These are Bitcoin addresses that have shown no activity for over seven years. They represent early adopters or long-term holders who have not moved their coins, indicating a strong conviction or potentially lost access. Publicly Traded Companies: A rising number of public companies are adding significant amounts of Bitcoin to their balance sheets, holding at least 1,000 BTC. These corporate holdings are typically strategic, long-term investments, further removing coins from immediate trading. By combining the holdings from these two categories, Fidelity estimates that over 6 million BTC will be held in these illiquid states by year-end. This figure is particularly impactful when considering Bitcoin’s finite total supply of 21 million coins. What Does a Shrinking Bitcoin Supply Mean for Investors? The concept of a shrinking liquid Bitcoin supply is a critical factor for both current and prospective investors. In economics, scarcity often drives value. When fewer units of an asset are available for purchase, and demand remains constant or increases, the price typically responds positively. This principle is at the heart of Bitcoin’s design, with its fixed supply cap and halving events. For investors, this trend suggests several potential benefits: Increased Scarcity: As more Bitcoin is held off-market, the available supply for trading diminishes, potentially creating upward pressure on its price. Long-Term Confidence: The accumulation by long-term holders and public companies signals growing institutional confidence and a belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): While Bitcoin is known for its volatility, a larger base of long-term holders could, in theory, lead to more stable price action over time as fewer coins are subject to short-term trading whims. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges. A significantly illiquid market could lead to wider bid-ask spreads and potentially less efficient price discovery in the short term. Yet, the overwhelming sentiment leans towards the positive implications of increased scarcity. Projecting Future Bitcoin Supply Dynamics Beyond 2025 Fidelity’s analysis doesn’t stop at 2025. Their projections extend further into the future, offering a glimpse of what the Bitcoin supply landscape might look like in the coming years. The report forecasts that these combined illiquid holdings could surge to an astounding 8.3 million BTC by 2032. This long-term outlook underscores a fundamental shift in how Bitcoin is being perceived and utilized globally. This steady increase in illiquid Bitcoin suggests a maturation of the asset class. It moves beyond speculative trading and into a realm where it is viewed as a strategic reserve asset, similar to gold. The growing conviction among both individual “HODLers” and major corporations points to a future where a significant portion of Bitcoin will be held for decades, not days. Actionable Insight: For those considering an investment, this trend in Bitcoin supply reinforces the narrative of long-term holding. Understanding that a substantial portion of the asset is being locked away can inform investment strategies, emphasizing patience and a belief in its enduring value proposition. The Enduring Power of Bitcoin’s Scarcity The latest report from Fidelity Digital Assets provides a compelling narrative about the future of Bitcoin supply . The projected increase in illiquid holdings by year-end 2025 and beyond is not merely a statistic; it’s a testament to Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial system. As more Bitcoin is taken out of circulation by long-term holders and institutions, its inherent scarcity becomes even more pronounced. This trend could be a powerful catalyst for its continued growth and stability, solidifying its position as a digital store of value. Investors and enthusiasts alike should pay close attention to these dynamics, as they paint a vivid picture of Bitcoin’s promising future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “illiquid Bitcoin supply” mean? A1: Illiquid Bitcoin supply refers to the portion of Bitcoin that is not actively traded or available for immediate sale on exchanges. It’s held by long-term investors or entities with no immediate intention to sell. Q2: Who are the main contributors to this illiquid supply? A2: According to Fidelity’s report, the primary contributors are Bitcoin addresses dormant for over seven years (representing long-term holders) and publicly traded companies holding significant amounts of BTC (at least 1,000 BTC). Q3: How might this increasing illiquid Bitcoin supply impact its price? A3: A shrinking liquid supply, coupled with consistent or growing demand, typically leads to increased scarcity. This economic principle suggests potential upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price over the long term. Q4: Is the increase in illiquid Bitcoin supply a positive or negative trend? A4: Generally, it is viewed as a positive trend. It indicates growing conviction among holders, institutional adoption, and a maturation of Bitcoin as a strategic asset, reinforcing its value proposition as a store of value. Q5: What is Fidelity’s long-term projection for illiquid Bitcoin holdings? A5: Fidelity Digital Assets projects that combined illiquid holdings could increase to 8.3 million BTC by 2032, further solidifying Bitcoin’s status as a long-term asset. Share Your Insights!

As of September 14, 2025 , at 6:00 p.m. ET , BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) , a leading Bitcoin and Ethereum network company, announced its total crypto and cash holdings had reached approximately $10.771 billion . This significant figure solidifies BitMine’s position in the digital asset market, with a strategic focus on accumulating Ethereum (ETH) for long-term investment. The company’s holdings are a clear signal of its aggressive treasury strategy, positioning it as a major player in the institutional crypto space. The firm’s chairman, Thomas “Tom” Lee of Fundstrat , has publicly stated the company’s objective to acquire 5% of the total ETH supply , a goal referred to as the “alchemy of 5%.” This ambitious target underscores their conviction that Ethereum will be a foundational element for the next generation of financial systems and a major beneficiary of the ongoing convergence between Wall Street and AI on the blockchain. Breakdown of BitMine Immersion’s Crypto and Cash Holdings The total reported value of $10.771 billion is composed of several key assets, reflecting a diversified yet targeted approach to digital asset management. This detailed breakdown provides a clear picture for investors and market analysts. Ethereum (ETH) Holdings : The core of the company’s treasury is its 2,151,676 ETH tokens , valued at $4,632 per ETH as of the reporting date. This makes BitMine the #1 Ethereum treasury in the world . Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings : In addition to its primary ETH focus, BitMine holds 192 Bitcoin . Strategic Equity Investments (“Moonshots”) : The company’s portfolio includes a $214 million stake in Eightco (NASDAQ:ORBS) , a strategic investment aligned with their long-term growth and treasury strategy. Unencumbered Cash : The treasury is supported by $569 million in unencumbered cash, providing liquidity and financial flexibility for future operations and acquisitions. This asset composition places BitMine as the #2 global crypto treasury overall, trailing only Strategy Inc. (MSTR) , which holds over 638,460 BTC valued at $74 billion . BitMine’s (BMNR) Market Performance and Institutional Backing Beyond its asset treasury, BitMine Immersion (BMNR) has established itself as a highly liquid and widely traded stock, attracting a premier group of institutional investors who believe in its long-term strategy. Trading Volume : According to Fundstrat data, BMNR has an average daily trading dollar volume of $2.0 billion (5-day average as of September 12, 2025 ). US Stock Ranking : This trading volume ranks BMNR as the 28th most traded stock in the U.S. among 5,704 listed stocks, placing it ahead of major companies like Arista Networks and just behind Eli Lilly . Institutional Investors : BitMine’s strategy is supported by a notable list of institutional and personal investors, including ARK’s Cathie Wood , MOZAYYX , Founders Fund , Bill Miller III , Pantera , Kraken , DCG , Galaxy Digital , and personal investor Thomas “Tom” Lee . These strategic partnerships and high trading liquidity underscore the market’s growing confidence in BitMine’s Ethereum-centric business model. Frequently Asked Questions Why is BitMine Immersion (BMNR) focusing on Ethereum over Bitcoin for its corporate treasury? BitMine Immersion has made a strategic decision to focus on Ethereum (ETH) because its chairman, Thomas “Tom” Lee , and the company’s leadership believe that the convergence of Wall Street and AI on the blockchain is creating a “supercycle” for Ethereum . They see ETH as the primary beneficiary of this trend, given its role as the leading platform for smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and tokenized assets, which they project will drive the financial system’s transformation over the next 10-15 years . What is the “alchemy of 5%” and why is it a key goal for BitMine? The “alchemy of 5%” is the term BitMine uses to describe its long-term goal of acquiring 5% of the total circulating supply of Ethereum . This objective is central to their treasury strategy, as they believe that becoming a large holder of ETH will create a “power law benefit” and provide reflexive value. By accumulating a significant share of the supply, BitMine aims to reinforce Ethereum’s economic security, which could attract more institutional capital and further solidify its position as a dominant digital asset. How does BitMine’s business model differ from other crypto companies like MicroStrategy (MSTR)? While MicroStrategy (MSTR) has a core strategy of accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) as its primary treasury asset, BitMine Immersion’s (BMNR) model is specifically focused on accumulating Ethereum (ETH) . This strategic distinction reflects a fundamental difference in their market thesis. BitMine views Ethereum not just as a store of value but as the core platform for a future token economy driven by AI and institutional adoption, making its business model centered on the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem itself. Conclusion The latest announcement from BitMine Immersion Technologies signals a new milestone in the institutional adoption of digital assets. With total holdings approaching $11 billion and a definitive position as the world’s largest Ethereum treasury, the company is executing a bold, forward-thinking strategy. The convergence of traditional finance and AI on the blockchain is creating a unique market environment, and BitMine’s focused accumulation of ETH demonstrates a clear bet on Ethereum as a transformative macro trade for the coming decade. Investors and market participants should closely follow BMNR’s progress, as its ability to acquire and hold a significant portion of the ETH supply could be a bellwether for the future of institutional crypto investment.

The company made the initiative through an oversubscribed private investment in public equity (PIPE) offering of common stock at $6.88 per share. It also included stapled warrants exercisable at $10.134 for three years. Helius Medical Technologies agreed to raise $500 million in equity and up to $750 million in warrants, assuming full exercise. The firm revealed that the funds will be used to establish a crypto treasury strategy with the Solana token as its main reserve asset. Helius seeks to leverage yield-generating properties of Solana The initiative is led by venture capital firms Pantera Capital and Summer Capital, and participation is also from other companies like Avenir, Big Brian Holdings, FalconX, Arrington Capital, Animoca Brands, and HashKey Capital, among others. The neurotech company revealed that the offering will close on or around Thursday. Helius said it chose Solana for its historically fast growth, which leads the industry in transaction revenue and processes more than 3,500 transactions per second. The digital asset has also been widely adopted, with around 3.7 million daily active wallets and over 23 billion transactions year to date. The neurotech firm added that Solana offers a ~7% native staking yield compared to non-yield-bearing assets like BTC. Helius revealed that it wants to leverage Solana’s native yield-generating properties to capture opportunities in DeFi. “We believe that Solana is a category-defining blockchain and the foundation on which a new financial system will be built.” – Dan Morehead , Founder and Managing Partner of Pantera Capital. Morehead hopes that the initiative will help Helius substantially increase institutional and retail access to the Solana ecosystem and help fuel its adoption worldwide. The company also appointed Joseph Chee as director and executive chairman, Cosmo Jiang as board observer, and Dan Morehead as strategic advisor. Cosmo Jiang, general partner at Pantera Capital, believes that there’s an opportunity to create shareholder value, which Michael Saylor pioneered with Strategy by accelerating Solana adoption. He revealed that he has experience in participating in the strategy at Twenty One Capital with Tether, Softbank, Cantor, Bitmine (BNMR) with Tom Lee, and EightCo with Dan Ives and Sam Altman. Joseph Chee, founder and chairman of Summer Capital, believes that all capital market transactions, from tokenization to payments, are moving onto the blockchain. He said Helius aims to bridge public markets with the Solana network, where the company expects most activity to occur. Helius plans to scale its SOL treasury position Helius plans to build an initial SOL position and expand its holdings over the next 12-24 months. The scaling initiative will include a capital markets program incorporating ATM sales and other proven strategies. The company is also evaluating staking, lending, and other opportunities in the ecosystem to generate revenue from the SOL Treasury. Helius will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker HSDT following the closing of the offering. Its updated treasury strategy will also take effect at that time. The company hopes to maintain transparency in its holdings and strong engagement with the SOL ecosystem and community. Helius will also reveal updates on the offering, SOL acquisitions, treasury growth, relevant stockholder approvals, and governance measures in the coming weeks. Helius’ stock price has surged by more than 141.67% at the time of publication to $18.27. Solana has plummeted by 3.52% in the last 24 hours and is exchanging hands at around $235.

As of September 16, 2025 , the investment outlook for XRP (XRP) is a subject of significant debate among financial analysts and crypto investors, especially with a highly anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon. The price of XRP is currently trading around ₹263.02 , but its future trajectory hinges on a mix of macroeconomic factors, market sentiment, and its unique utility in the global financial system. XRP CHART – COINSTATS How Does a Fed Rate Cut Impact Cryptocurrencies like XRP? A Federal Reserve interest rate cut is a major macroeconomic event that influences asset classes across the board, including cryptocurrencies. Historically, lower interest rates tend to weaken the U.S. dollar and increase market liquidity, which often drives capital into more speculative, high-growth assets. Increased Liquidity: A rate cut makes borrowing cheaper, leading to more money flowing into the economy. A portion of this liquidity frequently finds its way into assets with higher risk-reward profiles, such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including XRP . Weakening Dollar: As the Fed lowers rates, the U.S. dollar can lose value relative to other global currencies. This can make cryptocurrencies, which are often viewed as alternative stores of value, more attractive to both institutional and retail investors seeking to hedge against currency depreciation. Market Consensus: There is a near-unanimous expectation among analysts for a Federal Reserve rate cut at the September 16-17, 2025 , meeting, with a 99% probability of at least a 25-basis-point reduction. This anticipation is a key driver for current market sentiment and could lead to a short-term boost for crypto assets. Is Now a Good Time to Buy XRP? Analyst and Market Sentiment Insights The question of whether to invest in XRP now divides experts. While some see the current price as a compelling entry point, others advise caution due to potential short-term volatility. Bullish Arguments: Proponents of buying XRP believe the token is poised for appreciation due to its growing utility and renewed institutional interest following the resolution of its legal battles. They view the current price as a strong opportunity, especially if the broader crypto market rallies on the news of a Fed rate cut. Bearish/Neutral Arguments: Skeptics highlight that much of the rate cut’s impact may already be “priced in” by the market. If the Fed only delivers the expected cut without signaling further easing, markets could see a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” reaction, leading to profit-taking and a price dip. Market Sentiment: According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , market sentiment is currently Neutral with a score of 53 . This indicates a balanced market that is neither overly greedy nor fearful. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP also remains in the 30-70 neutral zone, suggesting that the price is not overbought or oversold and is trending sideways. How is the XRP Ledger and Ripple’s Technology Driving Real-World Use Cases? XRP is not merely a speculative asset; its core investment thesis is built on its utility within the Ripple ecosystem. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is designed for fast, low-cost international transactions, and its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service is being adopted by a growing number of financial institutions. Real-Time Payments: Ripple’s ODL service leverages XRP as a bridge currency, allowing financial firms to conduct cross-border payments in seconds, as opposed to the days it can take with traditional systems like SWIFT . Institutional Adoption: Post-legal clarity, Ripple has expanded its partnerships, leading to increased institutional use of XRP . Large-scale buying by institutional players is a key driver for the token’s long-term value. Future Catalysts: A major catalyst for XRP’s price in late 2025 is the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF in the U.S. . This would open the floodgates for new institutional and retail capital, providing a significant boost to its market capitalization. What is the long-term potential for an investment in XRP? The long-term potential for XRP is heavily tied to its continued adoption for cross-border payments and the broader maturation of the crypto market. While short-term volatility is expected, the token’s utility, coupled with the potential for ETF approval and a favorable macroeconomic environment, positions it as a key asset to watch. As Ripple continues to onboard new partners, the demand for XRP as a reliable bridge currency could strengthen its price floor and unlock significant long-term value. Frequently Asked Questions What factors could cause the price of XRP to drop? The price of XRP could experience a drop if the Federal Reserve disappoints the market by not cutting interest rates, or if its forward guidance is less dovish than expected. Additionally, a slowdown in institutional adoption of Ripple’s ODL service or a broader downturn in the crypto market could lead to a price correction. The Neutral sentiment from the Fear & Greed Index suggests the market is currently in a state of equilibrium, which could be disrupted by negative news. How does the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP affect its price prediction? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP is a technical indicator used by traders to gauge momentum and identify overbought or oversold conditions. When the RSI is in the neutral zone, typically between 30 and 70 , it suggests that the price is neither poised for a sharp reversal nor is it in a strong trend. This neutral reading for XRP indicates that the market is in a phase of consolidation, awaiting a new catalyst—like a Fed rate cut—to determine its next major price move. Why is XRP considered different from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum? XRP is fundamentally different from Bitcoin and Ethereum because it was created by Ripple to serve a specific, institutional use case: facilitating real-time cross-border payments. Unlike Bitcoin , which is a decentralized store of value, or Ethereum , which serves as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), XRP is a bridge currency designed for high-speed, low-cost settlements between financial institutions. Its efficiency and lower transaction fees make it a compelling solution for global finance.

It Reveals Bearish and Bullish Scenarios!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/banking-giant-citigroup-issues-price-prediction-that-will-disappoint-ethereum-eth-investors-it-reveals-bearish-and-bullish-scenarios/,"Ethereum (ETH) reached a new ATH of over $4,900 in recent weeks after a prolonged period of weakness. However, this record high was short-lived, and ETH fell to $4,200 due to a general market correction. Ethereum subsequently recovered and rose to $4,500. As the fluctuations in the ETH price continue, there is a huge expectation in the market that ETH will experience a major rise by the end of 2025. However, Citigroup said it expects ETH to fall to as low as $4,300 (compared to the current $4,515) by the end of the year. According to Coindesk, Citibank said in a recent report that network activity remains the primary driver of Ethereum's value, but most of the recent growth has occurred in Ethereum's layer-2s. At this point, Citi analysts said that only 30% have migrated to Ethereum’s base layer, and the ETH price remains above their estimates. The recent growth of layer-2 networks has increased activity in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, it is unclear how much of a positive impact this will have on Ethereum layer-1. The current price of Ethereum reflects capital inflows and expectations for tokenization and stablecoins. In this context, Ethereum seems a bit overvalued.” Citibank predicted that Etheruem’s price could reach $4,300 by the end of 2025, which is the base case scenario, and that if the bull market continues, it could rise to $6,400, while in the worst-case scenario, it could fall to $2,200. *This is not investment advice.

While Pepe Coin (PEPE) had its viral stint as a memecoin phenomenon, most experts think its explosive upside is already in the rearview mirror. That clears the way for newer coins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi coin focused on real-world borrowing and lending use case. The project has raised over $15.80 million from over 16,320 backers on presale. As opposed to hype-based memecoins, Mutuum Finance matches new market entry with practical use cases in the real world, rendering it a token with far more long-term pump prospects than PEPE. Pepe Coin Holds Steady as Meme Market Matures Pepe (PEPE) currently trades at $0.000012, which is in keeping with its position as a meme-driven asset that has already seen robust viral pumps in the earlier stages of its life cycle. While trading volumes suggest the token remains the object of active speculation, a consensus among most market pundits is that its most extreme gains may be behind it, with future price action ever-more tied to retail-driven cycles rather than underlying growth. As attention starts to turn across the broader market, comparisons are being made more and more between PEPE’s longer-term trajectory and momentum gathering behind newer project Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Gain Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to be on fire in presale phase six, building huge momentum with volumes of investors still skyrocketing. The project is already past 16,320 registered owners and has eclipsed $15.80 million in locked-up capital, with recent developments suggesting that the momentum will continue to build. This type of monumental jump is a clear indication of growing investors’ confidence as the platform continues to move ever closer towards going live. Strategic Value for Early Birds Not only are investors buying at the presale price positioning themselves for tokens at significantly lower cost, but they’re also setting themselves up for astronomical short-term returns of up to 300 percent on launch day one, and even greater long-term potential as the ecosystem continues to expand. Early adopters are rallying behind a project founded on a strongly future-facing dual lending model, longevity-long-term-conceived stablecoin, fully audited and open-source codebase, and tokenomics to generate scarcity and appreciation. Put all of them together, and Mutuum Finance is a strongly capable contender to revolutionize the next level of DeFi innovation. Bug Bounty Program Securing Security In a further move towards ensuring security in its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch an official bug bounty program with a $50,000 USDT bounty pool. Reward is offered at four severities, namely critical, major, minor, and low, to ensure vulnerability of all types can be identified and eliminated. By opening itself up to external developer and researcher review of its platform, Mutuum opens itself up to the newest security controls, incorporating security and confidence in its investor base. Risk Controls Embedded and Market Provisions Mutuum Tiered Loan-to-Value ratios and liquidation levels are determined by the volatility of the underlying collateral. Less volatile assets allow for more borrowing, while riskier tokens have less available borrowing. The second stability comes from reserve multipliers, which range from around 10 percent for low-volatility instruments to as much as 35 percent for riskier instruments. The system is impressively well-balanced between access and safety, and further market participation is enabled while containing systemic risk. Pepe Coin (PEPE) made its impression on the meme coin boom, but like Shiba Inu (SHIB), its biggest pump in its history may be in its rearview mirror.

51809147,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=178141,1758007830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/51809147.jpeg,Bitcoin vs Gold: The Chart Signal No Investor Can Ignore,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-vs-gold-the-chart-signal-no-investor-can-ignore/,"Gold has been a store of value for centuries, offering stability in times of war, inflation, or currency debasement. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is less than two decades old but has already captured the imagination of investors who see it as “digital gold.” As 2025 enters a critical stretch, the charts of these two rival safe-haven assets are flashing signals no investor can afford to ignore. Gold’s rally to record highs suggests fear and uncertainty dominate the macro environment. Yet Bitcoin, bolstered by institutional ETF inflows, is quietly consolidating near historic levels, hinting that its next breakout could once again leave gold in the dust. In the middle of this battle between the old guard and the digital challenger, a third option is emerging. Insiders whisper that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 15,000% returns , calling it the second chance investors prayed for after missing DOGE and PEPE. Its momentum is undeniable, and analysts warn it won’t stay under the radar much longer. Gold: Rallying to Record Highs Gold has surged above $3,600 per ounce , propelled by weak U.S. jobs data and a wave of bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates sooner than expected. Rate cuts lower the opportunity cost of holding gold, while also stoking concerns about inflationary flare-ups. Analysts now see gold advancing toward $3,700–$3,730 in the near term, and some forecasts suggest $5,000 per ounce is possible if the Fed’s independence weakens and policy credibility erodes. The appeal is clear: central banks continue to hoard gold as a hedge against financial instability. Emerging economies, wary of dollar dependence, are leading the charge. For ordinary investors, ETFs backed by gold bullion remain a convenient hedge against volatility in equities and bonds. But the chart reveals limits. Gold’s RSI is in overbought territory, and multiple analysts highlight consolidation near the $3,600–$3,650 band. Without another wave of geopolitical shocks or economic stress, gold may struggle to sustain its pace. It is a fortress asset, yes, but it may not deliver the exponential returns that risk-seeking capital craves. Unlike gold or Bitcoin, which have years of trading history, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in its presale phase, but the hype already rivals household names. Thousands of wallets have joined, many leveraging the PATRIOT50X bonus code to receive 50% more tokens on early allocations. Insiders whisper about 15,000% return potential , numbers that evoke memories of DOGE’s viral rise or PEPE’s improbable surge. The difference? MAGACOIN FINANCE is audit-approved by both HashEx and CertiK , an extremely rare double endorsement in presales. This signals to investors that the project is more than just another meme coin; it’s a calculated attempt to blend narrative firepower with real credibility. Whale participation has added to the momentum. Large wallets are securing allocations early, ensuring liquidity and reinforcing the idea that this isn’t a retail-only phenomenon. For investors who missed Bitcoin under $1,000, DOGE at fractions of a cent, or PEPE before it exploded, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being branded as the elusive second chance. Bitcoin: Volatile, Yet Backed by Flows Bitcoin has once again reminded investors that volatility cuts both ways. After dropping sharply in early September on whale profit-taking, BTC found support above $110,000 and is holding firm in a consolidation band between $110K and $115K. Technical analysts note that Bitcoin is still comfortably above its 200-day moving average, which historically acts as a springboard for major rallies. The institutional flows are especially telling. In just two trading sessions, Bitcoin ETFs captured $633 million in inflows , led by BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. At the same time, Ethereum-linked ETFs have continued to bleed assets, underscoring Bitcoin’s growing appeal as the safer institutional bet. This divergence shows a maturing market: retail traders panic-sold on volatility, while institutions quietly accumulated at scale. Charts show a wedge pattern forming, with support at $110K and resistance at $115K. If Bitcoin breaks through resistance, analysts believe it could retest $125K within weeks. The question is whether investors trust Bitcoin’s volatility enough to embrace the upside, or prefer gold’s slower, steadier climb. Bitcoin vs Gold: A Tale of Two Stores of Value Comparing the charts of gold and Bitcoin underscores their differences. Gold offers consistency but is capped by macro headwinds like a strong dollar and higher real yields. Bitcoin, while riskier, shows the technical hallmarks of cyclical rebounds that historically precede massive rallies. The performance gap is undeniable: over the last five years, Bitcoin has outpaced gold by more than 800%, even after brutal corrections. This is why risk-on capital continues to view Bitcoin as the better asymmetric play, while risk-off capital favors gold’s reliability. Investors must decide not just where value lies today—but where exponential growth could materialize tomorrow. And it’s here that the spotlight shifts to new narratives. Every cycle brings a fresh wave of projects that capture the cultural and speculative imagination. This time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the candidate that bridges legitimacy, scarcity, and meme-driven momentum. Macro Context: Why Presales Are Thriving Markets thrive on rotation. When Bitcoin consolidates and gold trades sideways, speculative capital doesn’t disappear, it seeks out new opportunities. Presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide exactly that: low-cost entry, scarcity mechanics, and narratives strong enough to attract global attention. This cycle is uniquely primed for presales. Institutional adoption of tokenization and ETFs has legitimized crypto as an asset class, encouraging retail investors to take bigger risks on new launches. Every bull market has crowned a new cultural phenomenon, SHIB in 2021, PEPE in 2023. Analysts argue 2025–2026 will be no different, and MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the project that defines this era. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Defining Outlier Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Rewrite the Narrative Audit Trust : Certification by HashEx and CertiK adds rare legitimacy. Scarcity and Bonus Mechanics : PATRIOT50X code and limited rounds drive urgency. Whale Participation : Early backing by large wallets ensures credibility and liquidity. Cultural Branding : Politically charged identity aligns it with larger narratives beyond crypto hype. Conclusion The Bitcoin versus gold debate will not end soon. Gold continues to prove its worth as a hedge, rallying to record highs on macro fears and central bank demand. Bitcoin, though volatile, is attracting institutional inflows that could fuel its next explosive breakout. Both assets deserve attention, but neither offers the sheer asymmetry of early-stage presales. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with whispers of 15,000% returns , dual audits, and surging momentum, is rapidly becoming the name on every trader’s lips. In a market where charts matter but narratives rule, it may emerge as the defining breakout of the next cycle. For investors, the choice is clear: ignore the signal, or seize the second chance.

As of September 16, 2025 , the Pi Coin (PI) is trading at approximately $0.36 USD , reflecting a modest +1.58% increase over the last 24 hours. The 24-hour trading volume is $48.34M USD , with a circulating supply of 8.09B PI . This data is crucial for anyone assessing the current market dynamics of the Pi Network. Pi Network Price The journey of Pi Network has been highly anticipated. The project officially launched its open mainnet on February 20, 2025 , which enabled Pi Coins to be traded on several exchanges, including OKX , Bitget , and CoinDCX . This transition from a mobile-mining-only phase to an open market has been a pivotal moment, shifting the project’s focus to building a robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and completing user Know Your Customer ( KYC ) verification. What Factors Are Currently Influencing the Pi Coin (PI) Price in 2025? The price of Pi Coin is shaped by a unique combination of internal project developments and external market forces. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these factors is key to navigating its potential volatility. Mainnet Launch & Ecosystem Development : The successful transition to a fully open mainnet and the development of real-world use cases are the most critical drivers of long-term value. The more dApps and businesses that accept PI , the stronger its utility becomes. Exchange Listings : Gaining listings on major, top-tier cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance or Coinbase is a significant factor for increasing liquidity, market visibility, and price discovery. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Sentiment : Like other altcoins, the price of Pi Coin is heavily influenced by the performance of the overall crypto market, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) . Bullish trends in BTC often create a supportive environment for altcoins like PI . Token Unlocks : Scheduled token unlocks can increase the circulating supply, potentially creating downward pressure on the price if not met with sufficient demand. Community Adoption and Utility : The millions of users, or “Pioneers,” who have mined Pi on their mobile devices are the foundation of the network. The project’s success hinges on converting this massive user base into an active community that uses PI for real transactions. Should I Invest in Pi Coin (PI)? Key Investment Considerations and Risks While Pi Coin presents a unique and compelling opportunity, its investment potential remains highly uncertain. It is essential for potential investors to consider both the potential upsides and significant risks. Potential for Growth : Some analysts and community members believe that if Pi Network achieves widespread adoption and secures major exchange listings, its price could experience significant growth. The sheer size of its user base offers a powerful network effect that is rare in the crypto space. Uncertainty and Volatility : The transition to a fully open market is ongoing. The price remains subject to extreme volatility due to thin liquidity and a lack of established, real-world utility compared to mature cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Uncertainty : The future of cryptocurrencies is intertwined with global regulatory frameworks. Shifts in regulation could impact Pi Network ‘s operations and its ability to achieve widespread adoption. It is critical to conduct thorough research, assess your individual risk tolerance, and consider all technical and fundamental factors before making a decision to buy or sell PI . As of September 16, 2025 , Pi Network is still in the process of proving its long-term viability. What is the most significant risk for Pi Coin investors in late 2025? The most significant risk for Pi Coin investors in late 2025 is the potential for a sell-off from early mobile miners once the network achieves greater liquidity. As more users complete their KYC verification and migrate their mined Pi to the mainnet, a large influx of tokens could hit the market, overwhelming demand and driving the price down. This risk is amplified by the project’s massive circulating supply of 8.09B PI . How does the Pi Network’s unique mobile mining approach affect its long-term value? Pi Network’s mobile mining approach has created an enormous user base of over 60 million registered accounts, a powerful foundation for a decentralized economy. This method, which requires no energy-intensive hardware, democratizes access to cryptocurrency. However, the true long-term value depends on converting this passive user base into an active community that utilizes Pi for real-world transactions and applications, moving beyond a simple speculative asset. Why do experts believe major exchange listings are crucial for Pi Coin’s price? Experts believe major exchange listings are crucial for Pi Coin’s price because they provide much-needed liquidity and market exposure. A listing on a platform like Binance or Coinbase would allow millions of new users to easily buy and sell PI , leading to more stable price discovery and a more robust market. This increased accessibility is essential for the token to evolve from a niche community asset into a widely tradable cryptocurrency. Conclusion: A Strategic Outlook for Pi Network in a Shifting Financial Landscape The journey of Pi Network to a fully open mainnet is a significant and strategic move in the cryptocurrency space. The project is attempting to leverage its massive, globally distributed user base to create a unique, mobile-first ecosystem. The success of this endeavor in late 2025 and beyond will hinge on two primary factors: the rapid development of a utility-driven ecosystem and the achievement of true, widespread adoption for daily use. While the current price and market data provide a snapshot of its progress, the long-term value of Pi will ultimately be determined by its ability to transition from a speculative asset to a functional, essential part of a new digital economy. For investors, this moment represents a critical period to monitor, as timely action and a deep understanding of these core principles will be paramount.

But if ETH’s slow rise makes investors feel better, analysts are pointing to new initiatives that promise faster growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting a lot of attention because of its $3 aim, which gives investors a new reason to spread their money around. In a world where crypto predictions change every day, MUTM stands out because it has useful features, a good presale, and technology that can grow. ETH’s growth vs new ROI frontiers Ethereum (ETH) is still one of the most well-known names in the world of digital assets. ETH is a key part of crypto charts and long-term potential for investors because it is the most popular smart contract and decentralized application. The consistent rise in crypto prices today demonstrates that ETH is strong, but it’s also evident that its maturity means it won’t grow as quickly as new initiatives. For a lot of investors, ETH is still a safe place to put their money, but the days of getting huge profits in the early stages are over. People who are serious about investing in crypto are now looking for projects that have good fundamentals and a lot of room for growth. This is why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting more attention. It is a project with characteristics that appeal to both institutional investors and ordinary investors. MUTM rising toward the $3 target Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Presale Phase 6, where it has raised $15.8 million and reached 40% of its goal for $0.035. MUTM is not like other projects that rely on hype cycles. Instead, it is making a clear plan based on DeFi lending, Layer-2 scalability, and significant token usefulness. This combination is what analysts say makes it the greatest cryptocurrency to invest in for future growth. People who invested early are already in a strong position to make a significant amount of money. One person from Phase 1 who bought 30,000 MUTM for $0.01 currently owns $1,050, and when the token reaches $3, they will have $90,000. Another investor from Phase 4 who bought 5,000 MUTM for $0.025 is now holding $175, which will grow to $15,000 at the same target. These data show why expectations about MUTM in the crypto world are getting more and more positive. The Beta launch will show off the platform’s main capabilities by letting users lend and borrow money in both peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract formats. The system will be built on Layer-2 integration, which will cut costs and speed up transactions. This will give MUTM a structural edge over networks that are slower and more expensive. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is known for its buy-and-distribute system. The protocol will use the money it makes to buy back tokens on the open market, which will then be given to mtToken stakers. This keeps demand high, which means that token growth is directly linked to activities in the ecosystem rather than speculation. The platform is also adding a number of demand drivers that make it stronger in DeFi. Liquidation fines will go into the treasury, which will encourage people to stay involved for a long time. A reserve factor will act as a safety net, helping to keep funds and increase demand for tokens. At the same time, stable-rate borrowing will offer predictable interest rates, which will appeal to a wider range of borrowers who want to know what to expect. Each of these mechanisms is meant to make sure that growth is long-lasting. This makes people even more sure that crypto charts will show a definite upward trend when the presale ends. With future listings on Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, MEXC, and Kraken, MUTM is projected to get a lot more attention. These exchanges will make it easier for people all over the world to trade, which will help the price go up faster and reach the $3 aim. Conclusion ETH is still going up steadily, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going up much faster. Phase 6 is now 40% sold out, and the next presale stage will boost the price by 15%. This makes it more important to act quickly. The project has a strong growth story that blends usefulness, new ideas, and presale momentum. This makes its $3 goal a viable possibility. The message is clear: ETH will stay a behemoth in DeFi, but for those looking for better profits, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best crypto asset to acquire right now.

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $8.56 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times.

JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.774, resulting in a correction to $1.599. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained minor selling pressure around local highs, resulting in a downward correction. This created a drop below $1.85. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

AD , head of the HTX Pay business unit, views crypto payments not merely as a career but as a mission of paramount importance, grounded in trust and responsibility. He sees each transaction as a reflection of a user’s faith and expectations, and every technical update as the result of the team’s tireless effort and commitment. Transitioning from the internet industry, AD entered the crypto space with a dual mindset: maintaining a “student-like” eagerness to learn while confidently applying a “seasoned” approach to business management and operations. When HTX relaunched its crypto payments business in late 2022, he chose to work directly on the front lines. He engaged closely with users, merchants, and industry veterans to apply his previous experience to this new landscape. He was clear from the start: they wouldn’t simply copy what others were doing. Instead, they set clear quarterly goals and iterated based on to their specific phase. “We must forge a distinctive path based on our own context and phase,” he stated. Guided by this principle, HTX Pay completely overhauled its organizational structure, product roadmap, and risk control systems, and has since demonstrated steady, reliable growth. Hearing the “Gunfire” on the Front Lines AD’s leadership is defined by a highly pragmatic approach. He believes strategy is born not in boardrooms but on the front lines, amid the “gunfire” of real-world challenges . For him, a strategic plan is not a theoretical vision on PPT slides but a judgment built on extensive market insights, direct user feedback, and granular operational details. As the saying goes, firsthand experience leads to genuine wisdom. “If anyone on our team, myself included, can’t hear the ‘gunfire’ from the front lines or can’t make sense of it, we are not doing our jobs right,” he said. This statement isn’t a warning; it’s a standard for their daily work. Under his leadership, the HTX Pay team has fostered a hands-on culture where they remain deeply engaged. This involves frequent cross-department meetings, conducting regular in-depth user interviews, and the inclusion of engineers and risk control staff in operational reviews. Everyone is expected to step up and work directly on the front lines. This close market connection also informs AD’s “non-copycat” business strategy. He rejects the idea of simply following established industry models, confident in the necessity of “forging our own unique path based on our specific phase.” From the very beginning of HTX Pay’s relaunch, it has chosen to set its own product development cadence, aligning its resources and long-term vision rather than blindly following industry norms. As he puts it, “We aren’t in a race; we are building a truly sustainable and effective service system.” This simple declaration reflects a profound understanding of the long-term fundamentals of the crypto payment industry. Building Trust from the Inside Out AD’s philosophy is simple: the truest measure of a product’s maturity isn’t its market data but the willingness of its own employees to use it. He candidly shares that HTX Pay initially saw minimal adoption from staff upon its launch. “The product was still in its early stages, and the workflow had some rough edges,” he explains. Rather than pushing it on colleagues, he led the team to adopt a user-centric mindset, carefully refining every detail—from basic workflows and transaction speeds to the overall user experience. Today, HTX Pay is used daily by most HTX staff, including those who have since left the company. To AD, this shift is a far more powerful indicator of success than any external metric. “It’s like running a restaurant—you have to be willing to eat the food you serve.” He uses this powerful analogy to emphasize the importance of internal trust. It reflects his belief that a strong product must first earn the confidence of its “closest users.” This serves both as a test of the user experience and as a reflection of the company’s culture. This focus on internal users laid the foundation for external success. The product’s value is now being demonstrated in the wider market, with strong consumer retention and steadily improving support efficiency for business clients. AD’s philosophy is clear: you can’t succeed in the broader market until you’ve first satisfied “your own people.” Prioritizing Risk Control, Putting Security Above All AD sees crypto payments as a financial service, not a game of numbers. This makes risk control non-negotiable. His position is firm: “ Risk management is always the first priority .” The HTX Pay business unit that AD manages oversees the most sensitive and high-stakes parts of the trading system, including deposits and withdrawals, trading, conversions, and fiat transactions. It handles the highest volume of fund flows and faces the strictest risk control requirements. AD is well aware that a fragile system cannot support long-term growth, no matter how fast it expands initially. “The real game in finance isn’t a race; it’s about who can last the longest and go the furthest.” Led by AD, HTX Pay has developed an advanced risk management system. This includes an automated risk control engine, a quick intervention system, and flexible human checks to ensure the platform stays secure, even in the most challenging scenarios. This is more than a crisis-response mechanism; it’s a fundamental part of the company’s culture. The belief that “risk control comes first” is shared across the entire HTX Pay team—from product, operations, technology, and customer service. AD insists that every new initiative must be carefully vetted for risk. “We won’t go live with anything that doesn’t guarantee our users’ assets are completely safe.” Building a Solid Base, Winning the Long Game Even as the crypto industry has evolved at a breakneck pace over the past few years, HTX Pay has maintained a steady and clear rhythm. AD admits his team once faced questions about moving too slowly, but he remained committed to a disciplined pace for system development and business expansion. He describes HTX Pay’s growth over the last three years as a “standard 40-degree curve” —a steady, upward climb without large spikes or reliance on external events. This approach is rooted in AD’s strong emphasis on “ infrastructure .” He believes that crypto payments cannot be rushed. Success in this field requires significant early investment of time and resources to build a solid foundation across systems, risk control, compliance, and user experience. Only with this groundwork can a business handle the major market demands when the real opportunity arrives. HTX Pay hit a critical growth point in 2024. “We were right on schedule,” AD says. The company’s overall reputation improved, the external environment stabilized, and the payment business completed key system upgrades. “This is the inevitable result of a deliberate, long-term strategy, not a lucky coincidence,” AD stated. For him, the ability to last is more important than being first in the short term. Building Trustworthy Payment Infrastructure for a Global Audience AD consistently defines HTX Pay as a human-centered payment infrastructure. It is not a flashy, high-traffic gateway, but a system designed for maximum stability and absolute trust. According to AD, the key difference between HTX Pay and other platforms lies in three core values: sincerity, simplicity, and practicality . These principles reflect his deep understanding of user needs and guide his product design. “Users don’t need a showy product,” he explains. “They just want a payment tool they can use, feel confident in using, and trust completely.” AD is fully committed to HTX’s vision: “to build a financial free port for the metaverse and achieve financial freedom for 8 billion people on Earth.” He believes the payment business is not just about facilitating today’s transactions, but about creating a foundation for the future. He acknowledges that this is a long-term goal—one that will take more than a single team or generation to achieve—but he is confident that building infrastructure is a marathon, not a sprint. In a fast-changing industry, AD and his team have chosen a challenging but wise path: a commitment to stability, security, user-centricity, and a systems-first mindset. He concludes, “As long as everything we do honors the trust our users place in us, HTX Pay will endure.” To learn more about HTX, please visit https://www.htx.com/ or HTX Square , and follow HTX on X , Telegram , and Discord .

Three chains are becoming hosts for new liquidity pools of real-world assets—Solana, Base, and Arbitrum. RWA tokenization is expanding and testing the best chains for utility. Based on recent data, 2025 was a strong year for three chains that drove RWA adoption—Solana, Base, and Arbitrum. Those chains expanded their assets by over 800% in the year to date, based on Token Terminal data. Solana, Base and Arbitrum emerged as leaders both in terms of absolute asset value under management, and for the past few months of rapid growth . Solana reported a total of 81 projects, while Arbitrum expanded to 101 tokenized asset types, based on RWA XYZ data . BlackRock, Securitize, and Wormhole are the leading issuers as of September 2025. 🚨🆙 The AUM of tokenized investment funds is at an all-time high of $7.7 billion. Asset managers are increasingly interested in tokenizing their fund products and bringing them onchain. The biggest tokenized fund by AUM: @BlackRock BUIDL, powered by @Securitize & @wormhole . pic.twitter.com/jkJQt6N1nc — Token Terminal 📊 (@tokenterminal) September 15, 2025 Solana is also carrying more diverse RWAs, including Pokemon cards with a physical and digital component, as well as a market for Steam items. Solana’s tokenization has benefitted from the experience of NFTs to evolve into new markets, as Cryptopolitan reported . The tokenized assets are a mix of stablecoins and funds, and for now stablecoins are the lead driver of growth. However, there are also successful experiments for tokenized shares and other assets, especially on Solana. At the moment, there is no standard for on-chain tokenization, but the growth of new RWA projects show the space is promising. Is Ethereum the only chain for tokenization? Alternative chains for RWA trading also include the BNB Chain, TON, Aptos, and others. Those chains offer good integration with Web3 projects, and can offer smaller experimental mints for more diverse assets. Currently, many chains are claiming to be the central venue for RWAs. Ethereum is still seen as indispensable, potentially becoming the chain for Wall Street tokenization. While other chains offer cheaper access and good integration with wallets, Ethereum still claims leadership. A recent report warned Ethereum was still ideal for institutional tokenization, as the chain has not faced outages in block production, unlike Solana and some L2s. The setback for Ethereum is the risk of hacker attacks and flawed smart contracts, though this may affect other chains. For now, RWAs are still not fully used in DeFi projects, especially the tokens issued by leading Wall Street firms. RWAs expand across asset classes Based on recent data, on-chain tokenized assets broke above $30B in value. A total of 211 issuers have offered various types of tokens, with some sectors showing significant success. Private credit makes the bulk of tokenization at barely $17B. US Treasury bills make up over $7.8B in assets, and are one of the main sources of security and income for stablecoin issuers . Stocks are still lagging, with a little over $500M. Commodities are among the success stories of tokenization, with over $2B in assets under management. The RWAs narrative remains independent, mostly based on infrastructure tokens. Ondo still competes to become the main institutional network for tokenization, while retaining its token growth. Overall, RWA infrastructure tokens are valued at over $66B, led by ONDO and Chainlink (LINK). Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

With top coins on the move, attention shifts to fresh targets set for the end of the year. Rising tokens like Solana and the newcomer XYZVerse are capturing new interest, adding to the buzz. The latest rally raises fresh questions about what happens next. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Bitcoin’s Bold Journey: From Idea to Today’s Digital Gold Rush Bitcoin appeared in 2009 after a person called Satoshi Nakamoto shared a plan for money without banks. It runs on a public list called a blockchain that sits on many computers at once. People send coins to each other directly, and helpers named miners check each move by solving tricky puzzles. New coins drop into their accounts as a prize, but only until 21 million exist. Every four years the prize shrinks, a moment fans call the halving. This shrinking supply has often sparked fresh price waves, as fewer new coins meet growing demand. While newer tokens chase quick fame with flashy apps, Bitcoin stays the main yardstick of the whole market. Big firms now hold it as a store of value, styling it as digital gold. If rising rates cool risky bets, Bitcoin can still draw eyes thanks to its long record and tight limit. As the next halving nears, some traders see a fresh climb, though swings stay wild compared with regular cash. Ethereum: The Beating Heart of Web3 Gears Up for a New Price Run Ethereum, born from Vitalik Buterin’s idea in 2013, went live in 2015. It moved from mining to a lighter Proof-of-Stake system after the 2022 Merge. This cut energy use and lets users earn ETH by staking. The chain hosts smart contracts, the code behind many apps for lending, games, art, and more. It also set the ERC-20 rule, so any team can launch a token that still pays fees in ETH. Layer-2 tools like Arbitrum and Polygon help send those tokens faster and cheaper. Sharding, the next step, should push costs even lower. Past cycles hint at big moves when Bitcoin halves its supply. Analysts expect ETH to swing between $2,700 and $6,580 in 2025, with a slow climb toward the decade’s end. That range puts it ahead of many altcoins that still rely on hype. Demand comes from gas fees, staking rewards, and its use as loan collateral. New spot ETFs and rising interest in DeFi add fuel. While rivals like Solana boast speed, they trade off age and size. Ethereum keeps the lead in users, tools, and trust, making it a strong pick for the current upswing. Solana’s Fast Lane: Can SOL Overtake the Crypto Pack? Solana was built for speed. While chains like Ethereum and Cardano juggle heavy traffic with add-ons, Solana keeps one straight road and pushes more cars through. Its design lets apps run in many coding languages, so builders can launch games, markets, and art hubs without learning a new toolkit. The network clocks thousands of transactions in a blink, and each move is paid for with SOL, the coin that keeps the engine warm. In this market cycle, users crave quick and cheap moves after feeling the sting of high fees elsewhere. DeFi and NFT creators are flocking to Solana, betting that a smooth ride will lure the next wave of fans. SOL gains value every time someone trades, stakes, or launches a fresh project, so growing activity could pump new life into the coin. Prices still sit well below past peaks, offering room if momentum returns. If the rush to fast, high-capacity chains continues, SOL may steer closer to the front of the crypto race. Conclusion Bull run 2025 boosts BTC, ETH, SOL. XYZ, the first all-sport memecoin, fuses football to esports passion with meme hype, targeting 20,000% upside via community-led roadmap.

The passively managed fund aims to mirror Avalanche’s value minus operational expenses, with Coinbase Custody serving as the digital asset custodian. The filing details a Delaware statutory trust structure offering cost-effective exposure to Avalanche through traditional securities markets. The trust will hold only AVAX tokens and use the CME CF Avalanche-Dollar Reference Rate as its pricing benchmark, calculated daily at 4:00 PM ET from multiple constituent platforms. Avalanche Foundation is simultaneously raising $1 billion through two crypto treasury vehicles led by Hivemind Capital and Dragonfly Capital. Just in: Bitwise files Form S-1 for $AVAX ETF pic.twitter.com/DtvveAJqRH — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) September 15, 2025 ETF Arms Race Intensifies as Multiple Firms Target AVAX Approval The Bitwise registration follows VanEck’s March filing and Grayscale’s Form 19b-4 submission through Nasdaq for Avalanche ETF conversion. Bloomberg Intelligence assigns high approval odds for altcoin ETFs this year, with institutional demand driving applications beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Bitwise previously experienced regulatory turbulence when the SEC granted accelerated approval for its 10 Crypto Index ETF in July before reversing the decision hours later through a stay order. The multi-asset fund would have included Avalanche alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, with 85% allocation to previously approved components. VanEck launched the Purpose-built Fund specifically for Avalanche-based businesses, utilizing native real-world asset products and tokenized money market funds. The fund targets capital appreciation through investments in digital assets with a market capitalization of over $100 million across the finance, payments, gaming, and AI sectors. Grayscale’s pending conversion of its Digital Large Cap Fund to ETF status includes Avalanche alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP. The fund maintains a 79.9% Bitcoin allocation and an 11.3% Ethereum allocation, with the remaining assets distributed among approved altcoins. The competitive landscape intensified as major institutions began to engage with Avalanche’s blockchain for portfolio management and digital asset projects. BlackRock expanded access to its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund to include Avalanche in November 2024, following initial Ethereum availability. Regulatory Approval Timeline Faces Uncertainty Amid Treasury Vehicle Launch The SEC’s cautious approach to altcoin ETFs creates uncertainty despite technical compliance with existing regulations. Chairman Paul Atkins established a crypto task force to develop clear rules, following years of “regulation by enforcement” under the previous leadership. March decisions on multiple altcoin ETFs were delayed until October, with the Commission citing the need for “longer periods” to consider proposed rule changes. The SEC has delayed decisions on multiple altcoin spot ETFs, including XRP, Solana, and Litecoin, citing the need for more review. Analysts say it’s standard procedure and remain optimistic about approval. #CryptoETFs #SEC https://t.co/Q8aODggS0f — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 12, 2025 The approval process involves 21-day public comment periods, allowing industry stakeholders to provide input before final decisions are made. Avalanche’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and subnet architecture differentiate it from Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining. The network’s three-blockchain structure supports token creation, validator management, and smart contracts, while enabling custom permissioned blockchains that rely on the main network’s security and integrity. The simultaneous treasury vehicle launches aim to garner serious institutional conviction through SPAC structures and private placements. Hivemind Capital’s $500 million vehicle aims for September completion, while Dragonfly Capital’s equivalent SPAC targets October finalization. At the time of writing, AVAX is trading at $29.91, representing technical momentum testing $30 resistance. Technical Analysis Points to Breakout Momentum Following ETF Filing AVAX exhibits classic descending wedge characteristics on hourly charts, trading at $29.90 near the pattern’s apex with upper trendline resistance and dynamic support convergence. Source: X/@Jeremyybtc The coiling effect from multiple tests of wedge boundaries creates optimal conditions for explosive directional moves, particularly with ETF-filing catalysts supporting bullish sentiment. Long-term weekly charts reveal AVAX breaking above significant descending trendlines containing price action since the 2021 peaks near $147. $AVAX path back to ATHs looks pretty clear from here. Anywhere under $50 is free. pic.twitter.com/ppxaajNBde — K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) September 15, 2025 The macro perspective shows AVAX’s 240% recovery from cycle lows around $8.50, positioning the token in the critical $30-35 resistance zone. Sustained trading above current breakout levels could open pathways toward $50 with minimal intermediate resistance. ETF approval precedents from Bitcoin and Ethereum suggest initial announcements generate 50-100% advances within weeks of confirmation. The technical setup positions AVAX optimally to capture such moves through descending wedge momentum combined with institutional validation. AVAX’s immediate trajectory targets the $35-40 region following successful wedge breakouts, with long-term potential extending toward $50 levels based on minimal resistance structures.

Despite laying off 10% of its workforce earlier this year due to rising costs, MoonPay reported profitability in 2024 and says 2025 is shaping up to be its strongest year yet in terms of earnings and cash flow. The company is also said to be in discussions for a new funding round that could raise its valuation beyond the $3.4 billion mark set during its 2021 Series A. Payments Companies Push into Crypto In May, crypto payments platform Mesh unveiled its Apple Pay integration , which allows merchants partnered with Mesh to accept crypto payments via Apple Pay. Mesh’s partnership with Apple Pay came as payments companies continue to expand into digital assets. In April, global payments giant Stripe said it is developing a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin aimed at companies operating outside the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe. The announcement came after Stripe’s regulatory approval to acquire Bridge, a stablecoin payments network designed to rival traditional banking systems and SWIFT-based transfers. Earlier this year, Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO and outspoken Bitcoin advocate, publicly urged Signal Messenger to integrate Bitcoin for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. Dorsey’s call was echoed by David Marcus, former president of PayPal and current CEO of Lightspark, who stated that “all non-transactional apps should connect to Bitcoin.” The comments reflect a growing sentiment among Bitcoin advocates to reposition BTC not just as a store of value, but as a practical payment tool. More recently, Singapore-based payments company Triple-A announced plans to integrate PayPal’s stablecoin into its list of supported tokens for customer payments. Even companies like PayPal have entered the space , launching their own stablecoins and offering yield incentives to holders.

Founder Dan Morehead recently unveiled that the firm’s Pantera Capital SOL holding now stands at an astonishing $1.1 billion. This news marks a pivotal shift for a firm that once held an entirely Bitcoin-centric portfolio, signaling a strong belief in Solana’s future and its potential to reshape the digital asset landscape. Why is Pantera Capital’s SOL Holding So Significant? In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Dan Morehead openly shared that Solana (SOL) has officially become Pantera Capital’s largest holding. This is a dramatic change from their early days, when Bitcoin (BTC) dominated their entire portfolio. Morehead specifically emphasized that SOL has consistently outperformed BTC over the past four years, showcasing its robust growth potential and innovative capabilities. This strategic pivot by such a prominent investment firm is not merely an internal decision; it sends a powerful message to the broader market. It indicates a maturing perspective on digital assets, moving beyond solely “digital gold” narratives to embrace high-performance blockchain ecosystems. A Strategic Pivot: Pantera Capital’s decision to make SOL its top asset highlights a strategic diversification away from a singular focus on Bitcoin. Institutional Confidence: This significant move demonstrates deep institutional confidence in Solana’s underlying technology, its vibrant developer community, and its expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications. Solana’s Remarkable Ascent: Outperforming Bitcoin Solana’s journey has been nothing short of impressive, distinguishing itself with several key advantages. Its rapid transaction speeds, significantly lower fees compared to older blockchains, and a thriving decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem have attracted substantial developer interest and user adoption. These technical strengths have directly contributed to its strong market performance and ability to challenge established cryptocurrencies. Morehead’s comments underscore a growing trend among savvy institutional investors who are actively looking beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. They are diligently identifying promising altcoins with strong fundamentals, scalable solutions, and real-world utility. The substantial Pantera Capital SOL holding reflects this evolving investment landscape, where innovation, efficiency, and scalability are increasingly recognized as critical factors for long-term success. However, it is also important to acknowledge that Solana has faced its share of challenges, including network outages. Despite these hurdles, its resilience and continuous development have maintained investor interest, demonstrating a strong commitment to improving its infrastructure. Dan Morehead’s Bold Long-Term Crypto Vision Looking ahead, Morehead holds a clear and somewhat concentrated vision for the future of cryptocurrencies. He believes that only a select few projects will truly succeed and dominate in the long run. He specifically named Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) as the likely long-term winners. This perspective suggests an impending consolidation in the crypto market, where only projects with strong utility, robust security, and an active community will endure the test of time. Furthermore, Morehead made a striking prediction for Bitcoin, stating that he anticipates BTC could reach an astounding $750,000 within the next five years. This bold forecast provides a compelling glimpse into the potential upside he sees across the top-tier digital assets. Such predictions from seasoned investors reinforce the long-term bullish outlook for the entire sector, especially for significant institutional investments like the Pantera Capital SOL holding . What Does This Pantera Capital SOL Holding Mean for Investors? The substantial Pantera Capital SOL holding offers valuable insights for both institutional and individual retail investors alike. It strongly suggests that diversifying a crypto portfolio beyond just the top two assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, can be a prudent and potentially rewarding strategy. However, it also unequivocally emphasizes the critical importance of thorough research and a deep understanding of the underlying technology and use cases of any chosen digital asset. For those considering an investment in Solana, this prominent institutional endorsement could certainly be interpreted as a strong positive signal. Nevertheless, it is crucial to remember that all cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks due to their well-known market volatility. Therefore, it is always wise to approach such opportunities with caution and a well-defined strategy. Consider these actionable insights: Conduct Your Own Research: Do not solely rely on institutional endorsements. Thoroughly understand Solana’s technology, its specific use cases, and its development roadmap. Evaluate its competitive landscape. Assess Risk Tolerance: Only invest capital that you can comfortably afford to lose. Cryptocurrency markets can experience rapid and significant price fluctuations. Stay Informed: Continuously keep up with the latest market news, technological advancements, and project developments within the Solana ecosystem and the broader crypto space. Consider Portfolio Diversification: While a significant Pantera Capital SOL holding indicates confidence, a balanced portfolio usually includes a mix of assets to mitigate risk. A Glimpse into the Future of Crypto Investment Pantera Capital’s significant investment in Solana marks a new, exciting chapter in institutional crypto adoption. It unequivocally highlights a growing confidence in altcoins that possess strong fundamentals, innovative technology, and a clear path to scalability. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature and evolve, we can realistically expect more traditional investment firms to explore and strategically integrate a broader range of digital assets into their sophisticated portfolios. The remarkable shift in Pantera Capital’s strategy, moving from an exclusive BTC-only approach to a substantial Pantera Capital SOL holding , vividly underscores a dynamic and ever-evolving investment landscape, paving the way for new opportunities and fresh challenges in the digital economy.

Enthusiasm is growing as SOL tests new highs and market watchers weigh its next move. Could Solana surprise everyone and reach a higher target soon? The current momentum and shifting trends keep traders guessing what comes next. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Solana (SOL) Source: TradingView Over the last 7 days SOL jumped 16.77% and now trades between 213.97 and 257.98. The 1-month gain reaches 29.73%, while the 6-month move sits at a huge 92.28%. Short term buyers are active, yet price still sits below this week’s peak, hinting at a pause after the rally. The 10-day average is 241.90 and the 100-day average is 238.56, so the fast line is only 3.34 higher than the slow one. Momentum gauges read 43.97 and 27.10, both under neutral, and the signal line is slightly negative. This mix suggests the market is cooling but not broken. Bulls will point to the wide six-month rise, bears will note the soft momentum. If SOL can close above 257.98 the path toward the nearest ceiling at 275.85 opens, adding about 18% from the mid-band. A push past 275.85 could target 319.86, a further 36% leap. Failure to hold 213.97 would drag price toward the floor at 187.83, a slide near 20%. A deeper dip to 143.82 would mean roughly 39% off current levels. Traders now watch whether momentum flips higher or breaks the first support. Conclusion Breaking $250 would confirm SOL strength. Yet the standout play remains XYZVerse (XYZ), the first sports memecoin fusing meme hype and fandom, targeting 20,000% gains through community-led, GameFi-backed growth.

On Monday, Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500, set a record high for the fourth consecutive trading day, reaching 6,519 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index also hit lifetime highs, and the Dow Jones traded near the peak recorded on Thursday. Equities rose, disregarding the bearish September manufacturing survey, as bond yields fell in anticipation of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut on Wednesday. According to the Fed funds futures, traders expect rates to drop to 3% from the present 4.25% within the next 12 months. Still, bitcoin (BTC) lacked clear direction, as it traded back and forth between $114,000 and $117,000, forming an indecisive Doji candle. As of writing, it changed hands at $115,860, continuing a lacklustre trading pattern below record highs of above $124,000 hit in August. The dour price action is likely due to long-term holders continuing to take profits and countering the bullish pressure from spot ETF inflows. Other major tokens such as ether (ETH), XRP (XRP) and dogecoin (DOGE) have lost upward momentum too. Ethereum's ether token has pulled back from nearly $4,800 to $4,500 in three days, having put in lifetime highs above $5,000 last month. The weakness is perplexing, as ether, popularly known as the internet bond due to its staking yield mechanism, stands to become an attractive investment with the impending Fed rate cuts. The payments-focused XRP has pulled back to $3.00, marking a weak follow-through to the bullish breakout from the descending triangle confirmed last week. Meanwhile, dogecoin, the leading meme token by market value, has dropped sharply to 26.7 cents from 30.7 cents amid reports of whale selling . Analysts said that a 25-basis-point rate cut could resume the slow grind higher in BTC. Meanwhile, a surprise 50 bps move could see stocks, crypto and gold go berserk. Keep an eye on VIX and BTC vol indices Monday's rise in U.S. stocks was characterized by an uptick in the VIX index, which represents the options-based implied or expected volatility in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days. The VIX rose over 6% to 15.68 points. While it still largely hovers at multi-month lows, the Tuesday spike warrants attention for two reasons: First, historically, the two have moved in opposite directions, as evident from the correlation of nearly -90 over a 90-day period. Secondly, a breakdown in the negative correlation often precedes corrections, as noted by the quant-driven market intelligence platform Menthor Q on X . ""SPX rose with the VIX today. This often signals stretched upside positioning, traders grabbing calls or hedging downside [with puts], leaving markets vulnerable,"" Menthor Q said. The VIX is influenced by demand for options, and Tuesday's rise in the index could have been led by traders seeking S&P 500 puts or downside protection. Perhaps, market participants anticipate a correction following the expected 25-basis-point Fed rate cut on Wednesday. BTC implied volatility rises Volmex's bitcoin implied volatility index, which represents the expected price turbulence over 30 days, also rose by 3% Monday, maintaining its positive correlation with VIX. Note that BTC's historic positive correlation with implied volatility indices has flipped negative since the spot ETFs went live in January last year and more so since President Trump's electoral win in November last year.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|market analysis|VIX|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|DOGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-16 07:56:55

Galaxy, Multicoin, & Jump Back Forward’s Solana Treasury According to a press release , Forward Industries has completed its initial liquid Solana purchases totaling 6,822,000 SOL for its treasury strategy. The tokens cost the company $232 each or a total of $1.58 billion. CoinGecko’s tracker shows the largest SOL treasury before today held $474 million, making Forward’s bet the largest yet. Forward Industries is a publicly-traded company that has historically focused on design and manufacturing. The dip into the digital asset sector with the Solana treasury program represents a new shift. Kyle Samani, Chairman of the Board of Directors at Forward Industries, said: Today’s purchase marks a significant milestone as Forward Industries begins executing its differentiated Solana treasury strategy, built to benefit from one of the fastest growing and most profitable blockchain networks. On September 11th, the firm closed a private investment in public equity (PIPE) raising $1.65 billion. The main players behind the financing were Galaxy Digital , Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto, each of which are firms that have had a notable presence in the digital assets sector. The latest purchase is the initial deployment of this raised capital. Forward doesn’t plan to just passively hold SOL. Instead, the company has said it will take a more dynamic approach, deploying assets within the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem to generate more value. So far, it has put all its holdings into staking. Samani noted: We are building the world’s largest Solana treasury company, a strategy that will both advance the Solana ecosystem and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. We are pleased to make some of our SOL purchases on-chain, which is the first of many activities we expect the Company to do natively on-chain. Forward’s treasury isn’t the only SOL news for today. Neurotech company Helius Medical Technologies has also revealed a plan for a Solana treasury strategy, as per a press release . The company intends to raise $500 million through PIPE financing and a further $750 million via stapled warrants. Backers include Pantera Capital and Summer Capital, among other names. Speaking of digital asset treasury companies, the OG firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has also added to its Bitcoin holdings today, as announced by co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor in an X post . The acquisition has involved a total of 525 BTC, with a cost basis of $114,562 per token. In total, the buy has cost the company about $60.2 million, which is relatively modest when compared to some of the earlier purchases.

An early Ethereum holder , who has diligently held their digital assets since 2017, recently made a substantial move. Just moments ago, this individual deposited a staggering 2,200 ETH, equivalent to $9.92 million, onto the Bybit exchange. This crucial transfer, first highlighted by on-chain analyst ai9684xtpa, has immediately captured the attention of market observers and fellow Ethereum holders alike, sparking discussions about its potential implications for the broader market. Unveiling the Mysterious Ethereum Holder’s Actions This isn’t the first time this particular Ethereum holder has made headlines this year. On-chain data reveals a pattern of considerable activity. So far in 2024, this same address has deposited a cumulative total of 8,310 ETH, valued at an impressive $41.4 million, across various cryptocurrency exchanges. Such large-scale transfers from long-term holding wallets to active trading platforms are often interpreted as a strong signal, hinting at potential selling pressure. Understanding these movements is vital for anyone tracking the Ethereum market. When a long-term holder, especially one who acquired ETH at much lower prices, moves such a substantial sum, it naturally raises questions. Are they looking to secure profits? Are they rebalancing their portfolio? Or is there another strategy at play? Why Do Ethereum Holders Move Such Large Sums to Exchanges? For many in the crypto space, a large deposit to an exchange by a long-term Ethereum holder typically precedes a sale. This is because exchanges are the primary venues for converting cryptocurrencies into fiat money or other digital assets. Therefore, such actions are closely monitored as potential indicators of upcoming supply increases in the market, which could, in turn, influence price dynamics. Profit-Taking: After holding since 2017, this individual has seen immense gains. Moving ETH to an exchange could simply be a strategic decision to realize some of those profits. Portfolio Rebalancing: The holder might be diversifying their assets, selling ETH to invest in other cryptocurrencies or traditional assets. Market Anticipation: Some holders might believe the market is nearing a local top and choose to sell to buy back at a lower price, a strategy known as “timing the market.” However, it is also important to remember that a deposit does not always guarantee an immediate sale. Funds could be moved for various reasons, including staking on the exchange, using them as collateral for loans, or even for participating in specific trading pairs not available elsewhere. Crucial Market Implications for Ethereum Holders The immediate reaction to such a significant deposit often leans towards a bearish sentiment. The prospect of an additional $9.9 million worth of ETH entering the market for sale can create downward pressure on its price. Historically, large movements from dormant wallets have occasionally coincided with periods of increased volatility or price corrections. However, the Ethereum market is complex and influenced by numerous factors beyond a single large transaction. While this specific Ethereum holder’s move is noteworthy, it’s just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Institutional adoption, network upgrades, overall market sentiment, and macroeconomic factors all play critical roles in determining ETH’s trajectory. What should current Ethereum holders consider? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain analytics and market news. Understand Context: Differentiate between speculation and confirmed selling. Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance. Navigating the Volatility: Insights for Every Ethereum Holder The actions of early investors, often dubbed “whales,” can undeniably send ripples through the crypto market. For every Ethereum holder , understanding these dynamics is key to informed decision-making. While the recent Bybit deposit by a long-term holder might signal caution, it also underscores the vibrant and often unpredictable nature of the digital asset space. As the market continues to evolve, the ability to interpret on-chain data and gauge sentiment becomes an invaluable skill. This event serves as a powerful reminder that vigilance and a well-thought-out strategy are essential for navigating the exciting, yet challenging, world of cryptocurrency investments. Conclusion: A Watchful Eye on Ethereum Holders The recent deposit of $9.9 million in ETH to Bybit by an early Ethereum holder is a significant event that demands attention. While such transfers often precede selling, the ultimate impact on the market remains to be seen. It highlights the importance of on-chain analysis in understanding potential market shifts. For investors, this serves as a timely reminder to remain informed, exercise caution, and always conduct thorough research. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does it mean when an early Ethereum holder deposits ETH to an exchange? When a long-term Ethereum holder moves a large amount of ETH to an exchange, it is often interpreted as a precursor to selling. Exchanges are the primary platforms for converting crypto into fiat or other assets, so such a move can signal an intent to take profits or rebalance a portfolio. 2. Is this the first time this specific holder has moved funds this year? No, on-chain data indicates that this same Ethereum holder has deposited a cumulative total of 8,310 ETH, valued at $41.4 million, to various exchanges so far this year, making this recent Bybit deposit part of a larger pattern. 3. Will this ETH deposit necessarily lead to a price drop? While large deposits can create downward pressure due to increased potential supply, a deposit does not guarantee an immediate sale. The funds could be moved for other reasons, such as staking or using them as collateral. The overall market sentiment and other factors also play a significant role. 4. How can I track similar large crypto transactions? You can track large crypto transactions through on-chain analytics platforms and services that monitor whale movements and significant wallet activities. Analysts like ai9684xtpa specialize in providing such insights. 5. What are the risks associated with such large deposits? One primary risk is increased market volatility. If the holder decides to sell a substantial portion of their deposited ETH, it could lead to a temporary price drop. Investors should monitor such movements as part of their overall risk assessment.

51813686,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=809850,1758014776,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51813686.jpeg,Tim Cook says Apple investors back his $600 billion American push,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tim-cook-apple-investors-600-billion-america/,"Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Jim Cramer that the company will pump $600 billion into the United States economy over the next four years through a massive manufacturing expansion, and said no shareholders are objecting. Tim said the money will go into new and existing factories, workforce development, and local partnerships that will affect nearly 80 sites across the U.S. “We can’t be everywhere,” Tim said. “I wish we could, but we are putting $600 billion to work in the next four years. And so it is an extraordinary commitment. And there’s 79 factories across the U.S. that will benefit from this.” Tim said some communities that aren’t yet aware of Apple’s plans will be surprised to find out they’ll be receiving new facilities. He also said he hopes this scale of investment triggers a domino effect, pushing other companies to follow Apple’s lead and open more U.S.-based factories in the same areas. Tim confirms Corning gets $2.5 billion for iPhone glass During the interview , Tim also highlighted Apple’s recent $2.5 billion commitment to Corning, the Kentucky-based firm that supplies the glass used in iPhones and Apple Watches. The money will go toward expanding Corning’s glass production facility. “It’s a great start, and a very important one, because the glass is something you interface with all the time,” Tim said. This makes the Kentucky plant a key piece of Apple’s domestic hardware pipeline. He added that Apple plans to grow its partnerships with several semiconductor manufacturers based in the U.S., including Taiwan Semiconductor, Texas Instruments, and Applied Materials. The company had previously said it would work with all three to help scale chip production locally, and this latest announcement puts those partnerships into sharper focus. Aside from money and machines, Tim said Apple is also involved in training the workers that will eventually run these new and upgraded facilities. He confirmed that Apple has launched a “Manufacturing Academy” in Detroit as part of its workforce development strategy. According to Tim, the company wants to help small and mid-sized businesses while also sharing its training programs with community colleges to create a wider talent pool. Investors silent on $600 billion, as Tim says “not one complaint” When Jim Cramer asked if any Apple investors had voiced concern over the size of the domestic spend, Tim said flat-out that they hadn’t. “I think most of our shareholders believe that we’re in the best position to make these type of decisions,” Tim said. “I haven’t gotten a single complaint about the $600 billion.” He added that he believes shareholders are happy the company is investing in America rather than sending money elsewhere. The timing of this announcement overlaps with a major foreign policy event that will massively impact the tech industry: Donald Trump’s second state visit to the UK as sitting President. The visit, scheduled for this Wednesday, will include ceremonial events like a carriage tour, a state banquet, a military flypast, and a gun salute, all coordinated by the British government. As part of this trip, the U.S. and UK are expected to finalize technology and civil nuclear energy agreements, with trade still hanging over the visit. The British side is still hoping to resolve outstanding issues around U.S. steel tariffs as part of a broader economic deal. Before Trump’s arrival, UK officials announced $1.69 billion in U.S. investment from several American firms including PayPal and Bank of America. Two of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, Nvidia and OpenAI, are also expected to confirm new investments in the UK during the visit. U.S. private equity firm Blackstone plans to commit 100 billion pounds into UK assets over the next 10 years, as part of a $500 billion Europe-wide package. Another U.S. company, CoreWeave, which provides cloud computing infrastructure, also confirmed it would announce new UK-based investments this week. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office said a delegation of UK officials will be in Washington on Monday to finalize the visit details and trade commitments tied to Trump’s state trip.

While Cardano (ADA) may still deliver good returns, potentially in the 5–10x range, the real star of the cycle is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is building actual value with its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, positioning itself as a token that has the fundamentals in place to deliver explosive growth. As analysts seek out high-growth altcoins that can pump as much as 50x during the next cycle, MUTM stands out as a project that delivers utility, scalability, and first-mover advantage in a vertical poised for massive adoption. Cardano Nears $1 as Resistance Builds Cardano (ADA) is presently trading at approximately $0.92, with recent price action characterized by resistance forming in the $0.96–$1.00 zone and support at $0.83–$0.90. Trading volumes have been decent, and ADA has gained modestly in the past week, bouncing from lows of almost $0.82. While some technicals suggest a break over $1.00 will open up additional upside, ADA’s maturity and size most likely mean its returns will be less dramatic, perhaps in the 5-10× range during the period of a complete bull cycle. On the other hand, newer DeFi project Mutuum Finance is being viewed by some as having more upside in this cycle, with lower price and rapidly growing ecosystems. Mutuum Finance: Risk Mechanisms and Protocol Security Mutuum Finance has strong protection protocols for any collateralized asset to ensure the security of the protocol and the users. They include target collateral rates, deposit ceilings, and lending ceilings. In order to maintain systemic stability, liquidators are encouraged to off Close undercollateralized positions, invoke penalties and enforce liquidation guarantee remediation in a timely fashion. Collateral efficiency is optimized in correlated assets, i.e., lending capacity increases proportionately with Loan-to-Value (LTV) levels in well-secured lending. Reserve factors are provided as insurance against extraordinary market conditions, and supplementary reserves can be levied on volatile assets to cover against volatility. Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has already garnered more than 16,320 investors and $15.80 million amidst overwhelming demand. As part of its drive for better security and transparency, the project is launching a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. By the program, developers and researchers are invited to report vulnerabilities, the reward being placed on four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low. Dynamic Interest Rate Adjustments Mutuum Finance rides on a floating interest rate mechanism that changes with liquidity level. Borrowing is cheap when liquidity is high and allows for greater utilization. Borrowing is expensive when there is low liquidity, allowing for repayment of the loan together with greater deposits. This helps in balance in the system along with avoiding over-borrowing. Bringing Market Volatility Under Control and Liquidity Conservation Mutuum Finance is very sensitive to having the correct on-chain liquidity to prevent liquidating low-slippage, low-quality positions. The liquidation levels and LTV ratios are very sensitive to the volatility of the underlying token. Less volatile and more stable tokens can potentially have larger borrowing amounts and lower liquidation levels, with more risky and more volatile tokens having more conservative parameters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is this bull run’s real 50x contender. The project is still in the early presale phase at $0.035, with 16,320+ investors and $15.80M raised with tremendous upside potential. Its dual lending models, dynamic interest rate adjustment, and strict risk control mechanisms backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty give it real utility over hype. With strong adoption signals and low market cap foundation, MUTM can deliver 50x returns in the next cycle. Secure your presale tokens now before Stage 7 takes the price higher.

Banks' claims that they do are are myths crafted to defend their revenues, he wrote in a Tueday blog post . ""The central claim — that stablecoins will cause a mass outflow of bank deposits — simply doesn’t hold up,"" Shirzad wrote. ""Recent analysis shows no meaningful link between stablecoin adoption and deposit flight for community banks and there’s no reason to believe big banks would fare any worse."" Larger lenders still hold trillions of dollars at the Federal Reserve and if deposits were really at risk, he argued, they would be competing harder for customer funds by offering higher interest rates rather than parking cash at the central bank According to Shirzad, the real reason for banks' opposition is the payments business. Stablecoins , digital tokens whose value is pegged to a real-life asset such as the dollar, offer faster and cheaper ways to move money, threatening an estimated $187 billion in annual swipe-fee revenue for traditional card networks and banks. He compared the current pushback to earlier battles against ATMs and online banking, when incumbents warned of systemic dangers but, he said, were ultimately trying to protect entrenched profits. Shirzad also dismissed reports predicting trillions in potential outflows from deposits into stablecoins, whose total market cap is around $290 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. He stressed that stablecoins are primarily used as payment tools — for trading digital assets or sending funds abroad — not as long-term savings products. Someone purchasing stablecoins to settle with an overseas supplier, he argued, is opting for a more efficient transaction method the going through their bank, not pulling money from a savings account. He urged banks to embrace the technology instead of resisting it, saying stablecoin rails could cut settlement times, lower correspondent banking costs and provide round-the-clock payments. Those institutions willing to adapt, he wrote, stand to benefit from the shift. The U.K., too, faces concerns about the effect of stablecoins on the financial industry. The Financial Times reported Monday that the Bank of England is considering setting limits on how many ""systemic"" stablecoins people and companies can hold — setting thresholds as low as 10,000 pounds ($13,600) for individuals and about 10 million pounds for businesses. Officials define systemic stablecoins as those already widely used for U.K. payments or expected to become so, and say the caps are needed to prevent sudden deposit outflows that could weaken lending and financial stability.",Policy|Coinbase|crypto regulatioin|Stablecoins|banks|US|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|EXCHANGE|MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-16 09:30:22

Bitcoin’s seasonal weakness and ongoing whale profit-taking are prompting investors to look elsewhere for stronger returns. As sentiment shifts, XRP, Solana, and Cardano are emerging as frontrunners in what analysts say could be the next big altcoin frenzy. Rising inflows, technical setups, and ecosystem activity all suggest these projects are preparing for breakout moves. But beyond established large caps, speculative capital is also hunting for early-stage opportunities. Analysts warn allocations are moving fast as MAGACOIN FINANCE is tipped for huge gains. XRP: Legal Clarity and ETF Buzz XRP has long been a lightning rod for both retail excitement and regulatory scrutiny. With its partial legal victory over the SEC in 2023, XRP enjoys a level of clarity unmatched by many peers. This sets the stage for pending ETF applications that, if approved, could unleash significant institutional inflows. On-chain data shows whale wallets holding more than 10 million XRP have been steadily accumulating in September, reinforcing confidence ahead of potential catalysts. Trading volumes remain elevated, and analysts argue XRP’s use case in global payments could finally align with investor enthusiasm if ETFs materialize. In a crowded market, this clarity gives XRP an edge. Solana: Speed Meets Cultural Adoption Solana continues to capture both institutional and retail attention. Its scalability—capable of processing thousands of transactions per second at low fees—makes it a favorite for DeFi, gaming, and NFT developers. Recent data shows Solana-based DEX volumes hitting new monthly highs, even as overall crypto volumes softened. What drives Solana’s momentum is cultural resonance. Meme coins built on Solana have fueled retail excitement, while institutional adoption of Solana’s infrastructure has expanded. The dual momentum makes Solana a unique player in the Layer-1 race. Analysts see Solana as a core beneficiary of altcoin season, with both fundamentals and hype on its side. As capital rotates away from overcrowded large-cap names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the imagination of both retail traders and whales. Analysts now project up to 11,500% ROI , a figure that has fueled rapid presale sellouts and surging participation. The PATRIOT50X bonus code , which grants 50% more tokens to early buyers, has added urgency to allocations. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from other meme-driven projects is its foundation. With dual audits from HashEx and CertiK , the project has achieved a legitimacy rarely seen in presales. Combined with scarcity-driven rounds and whale interest, it is building the kind of early conviction usually reserved for institutional favorites. Momentum is undeniable. Telegram and X communities are expanding daily, social buzz is accelerating, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is now consistently appearing on analyst shortlists of altcoins to watch in 2025. Traders argue its dual appeal, meme culture hype fused with credible fundamentals, could rewrite the narrative of which meme-driven tokens dominate the next bull cycle. Cardano: Governance and Long-Term Vision Cardano often trades quietly compared to flashier peers, but its long-term approach to scalability and governance is starting to pay off. The launch of its Voltaire era, finalizing on-chain governance, marks a significant milestone. With this framework, Cardano is positioning itself as one of the few Layer-1 networks offering a decentralized and transparent decision-making model. Institutional attention has grown as Cardano’s ecosystem expands into DeFi and tokenized assets. Technical charts suggest ADA is building a base near $0.50, setting the stage for a possible breakout if market sentiment continues to improve. While not the fastest mover, Cardano appeals to investors seeking sustainable growth with governance-driven credibility. Macro Environment: Why Frenzy is Returning The global macro backdrop is amplifying crypto’s appeal. With recession fears rising and central banks expected to pivot toward easing, liquidity injections could ignite risk-on assets once more. Historically, such conditions have fueled outsized rallies in altcoins. Bitcoin’s dominance slipping toward 57% signals capital rotation is already underway. Analysts note that altcoins with strong narratives or clear catalysts, like XRP’s ETF prospects, Solana’s scalability, Cardano’s governance, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity-backed presale, are primed to lead the frenzy. This combination of fundamentals and speculative momentum has not been seen since the 2021 cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Lead the Frenzy 11,500% ROI Projections : Analysts say upside could outpace established altcoins. Audit-Backed Legitimacy : Dual certification by HashEx and CertiK boosts trust. Scarcity Mechanics : Rounds are selling out fast, reinforced by the PATRIOT50X bonus. Whale Participation : Large allocations confirm conviction and liquidity. Dual Appeal : Meme culture plus utility makes it a rare dual-threat token. Conclusion Altcoin season appears closer than ever. XRP is gaining momentum with ETF buzz and regulatory clarity, Solana continues to thrive on scalability and cultural adoption, and Cardano builds strength through governance and sustainability. But the frenzy will not be limited to established names. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its whispers of 11,500% ROI , audit approvals, and whale participation, is cementing itself as the presale that could reshape the meme-driven sector. As capital rotates away from overcrowded large caps, its scarcity mechanics and narrative firepower position it as the next major breakout. For investors, the message is clear: the frenzy is just beginning, and MAGACOIN FINANCE could be its defining story.

51813615,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=822328,1758015043,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51813615.jpeg,"Payments Giants Set To Join Stellar, Says CPO—Will XLM Price Follow?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/stellar-xlm/payments-giants-join-stellar-will-xlm-price-follow/,"Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) leadership is signaling a decisive push into mainstream finance for the remainder of 2025, hinting that “some of the biggest names in payments and asset management” are set to go live on the network in the coming weeks and months. Speaking alongside SDF CEO Denelle Dixon, José Fernández da Ponte—who joined SDF in mid-July and now serves as President & Chief Growth Officer—framed the acceleration as the culmination of a year spent laying technical and go-to-market groundwork. Biggest Names In Payments Coming To Stellar “We are the blockchain for financial services at scale,” Fernández da Ponte said, adding: “Over the next months, you will see some of the biggest names in payments and asset management that will continue to go live on the network.” He underscored the claim with growth figures from the on-chain economy: “If you look at TVL and DeFi for the last year, TVL in aggregate grew 2x. TVL on Stellar grew 9x… I have not seen a blockchain that has been growing there as fast.” The executive credited community-originated wallets and protocols, and the team’s continued work on “plumbing” for an open-source, permissionless stack, as catalysts for that momentum. Dixon, for her part, positioned the first half of 2025 as “laying the foundation,” and said the back half must deliver “big acceleration” on the tech side, singling out Protocol 23 as the upgrade set to make Stellar “stronger, faster, and developers’ lives easier.” Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Turns Bullish, Can the $0.386 Wall Finally Break? She also flagged the on-network expansion of the stablecoin universe—“PYUSD on Stellar was announced, new assets are coming, and others continue to scale”—plus tangible usage wins from wallet programs that have converted one-off sign-ups into weekly activity. Those remarks track with SDF’s public roadmap and adoption goals for 2025, which emphasize real-world payments, DeFi depth, and pushing toward top-tier TVL rankings. The payments-stablecoin pillar is central to that strategy. In June, PayPal disclosed plans to make its dollar stablecoin, PYUSD, available on the Stellar network, pending regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services. The move would add another high-profile issuer to Stellar’s rails and broaden PYUSD’s distribution beyond its current venues. Neither PayPal nor SDF has provided a firm mainnet date, but the companies have reiterated the intent publicly throughout the summer. On the protocol side, Stellar’s “Whisk” release—Protocol 23—anchors the second-half execution plan. SDF documentation describes a package of eight Core Advancement Proposals that include parallelized processing, unified events, fee and throughput improvements, and developer-facing refinements around Soroban smart contracts. Related Reading: Stellar About To Moon? XLM Price Prediction Calls For 400% Explosion SDF scheduled testnet and governance milestones across the summer, setting up a mainnet vote around early September. The intent is straightforward: raise performance and ergonomics to meet the institutional-grade expectations of payments processors and asset managers now circling the network. The organization will attempt to convert that pipeline into concrete announcements this week at Meridian—SDF’s flagship annual conference—held September 17–18 in Rio de Janeiro. With builders, policy voices, and would-be enterprise adopters on site, the event’s timing aligns neatly with leadership’s “coming weeks” guidance, though neither Dixon nor Fernández da Ponte named specific partners. Will XLM Price Respond? For investors asking whether XLM will respond, the market has so far treated the integration drumbeat as a “show-me” story. As of September 16, XLM trades near $0.379. XLM remains capped by mid-summer high at $0.52 that bulls will argue require either marquee partner go-lives, visible PYUSD settlement flows, or a broader macro driven rally for the entire crypto market. Crypto analyst Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) shared via X on September 15: “Demand zone tested – XLM bulls ready to charge. Why this setup? Price retracing into a bullish Orderflow Zone → demand area in play. Strong rejection expected near current support. Previous week’s high at 0.4143 serving as liquidity magnet. 4H Market Structure remains bullish, supporting upside continuation.” At press time, XLM traded at $0.378.

The company announced that support for Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and its stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD) will be added soon, making it easier to move digital assets across a growing number of wallets. The feature has a special appeal for crypto users because personal transfers like gifts, reimbursements, or splitting expenses won’t trigger tax forms when sent between known parties on PayPal or Venmo. This helps keep small transfers personal and tax-exempt, addressing long-standing concerns from crypto advocates about the tax burden on everyday crypto transactions. PayPal Links expands on the company’s existing ""PayPal Me"" system by letting users set the amount, add notes, or even emojis before sending the link. Once a request is accepted, the sender reportedly gets immediate access to their funds . Links that go unused will expire after 10 days, with the option to send reminders. The rollout starts in the U.S. and will expand to the UK and other markets later this month. This comes as PayPal reports 10% year-over-year growth in P2P payments and Venmo records its strongest payment volume in three years. PayPal has been deeply involved in crypto since 2020, launching trading services and later partnering with Paxos to issue PYUSD , which now holds a market cap of about $1.3 billion. The stablecoin also powers PayPal’s ""Pay with Crypto"" feature, enabling small businesses to accept multiple digital currencies.",,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|PYUSD|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-09-16 09:31:00

Bitcoin dropped to the $114k region on Monday but has now bounced back and is trading close to the $116k resistance level. XRP, Ripple’s native coin, tested the $2.95 support on Monday but is now back and trading at $3 per coin. However, the $3 resistance remains a tricky one for XRP as Ripple faces declining network activity. Ripple’s network activity continues to dwindle There is an increase in demand for XRP, as indicated by the rising funding rate and Open Interest (OI). However, this growing demand has not been reflected in on-chain activity. Data obtained from CryptoQuant show that active addresses on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) are down 55% to approximately 22,500 from roughly 50,000 in mid-July. This decline indicates reduced network engagement, which ultimately results in low transaction volume and a decline in the demand for the token. If the decline in the Active Addresses metric persists, XRP’s price could stagnate around the $3 mark or experience selling pressure in the near term. However, the market is still looking ahead to the FOMC meeting tomorrow as the Fed will reveal its interest rate decision. Cutting the interest rate could be a bullish signal for BTC, XRP, and the broader cryptocurrency market. XRP eyes the $3.1 resistance level despite declining network activity The XRP/USD 4-hour chart remains bearish as XRP has underperformed over the last few days. The coin is trading at $3.04, up from the $2.95 resistance level it tested on Monday. The XRP chart shows a descending trend line support around the $2.95 level, suggesting that the coin could break out in the near term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 50 after hitting 61 on Saturday, suggesting that XRP is facing selling pressure at the moment. If the RSI dips below the neutral 50, it would indicate a fading bullish momentum, and this could see XRP retest the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support at $2.95. The MACD lines are also around the neutral region, with a crossover into negative territory suggesting a bearish trend. Failure to hold the $2.95 support could see the 100-day EMA at $2.81 and the 200-day EMA at $2.56 become strong support zones. On the flip side, if the RSI goes into the positive region, with the blue MACD line remaining above the red signal line, XRP could surge towards the $3.18 resistance level in the near term. An extended bullish run would see XRP target the next major resistance level at $3.4. Traders are mainly focused on tomorrow’s event, as it would determine the price action for the remainder of the week.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant activity, and recent on-chain data reveals some truly compelling movements. In a fascinating turn of events, over $15 million in ENA tokens have been moved in the last 24 hours, signaling potential shifts in market dynamics. These substantial ENA transactions have caught the eye of analysts and investors alike, prompting questions about what these large-scale movements could mean for the future of ENA. Unpacking Recent ENA Transactions: Who’s Moving What? On-chain analyst The Data Nerd recently highlighted several notable ENA transactions that demand our attention. These aren’t just small transfers; they involve millions of dollars and key players in the crypto space. Understanding who is behind these movements can offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future price action for ENA. ParaFi Capital’s Deposit: The venture capital firm deposited a significant 4.08 million ENA, valued at approximately $2.88 million, to Binance. Such moves by institutional entities often indicate strategic portfolio adjustments or preparations for trading. Flowdesk’s Large Transfer: Another major player, Flowdesk, moved an even larger sum of 5.03 million ENA, worth about $3.51 million, also to Binance. Market makers like Flowdesk frequently adjust their holdings on exchanges to manage liquidity or execute trading strategies. New Wallet Acquisition: A newly identified wallet made a substantial purchase of 6.015 million ENA, amounting to roughly $4.3 million. The emergence of a new, large holder can sometimes precede significant market events or reflect growing confidence in the asset. Anonymous Whale’s Buy: An anonymous whale, a term used for individuals holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, acquired 6.72 million ENA, valued at an impressive $4.75 million. Whale activity is often closely watched due to its potential to influence market prices. Why Do These ENA Transactions Matter to You? These large-scale ENA transactions are more than just numbers; they represent significant capital flows that can impact ENA’s price and overall market sentiment. When institutional players or whales move such substantial amounts, it can signal a variety of intentions, from taking profits to accumulating for future gains. For the average investor, observing these movements can provide context for market volatility and potential trends. The movement of tokens to exchanges, particularly Binance, often suggests an intent to sell or increase liquidity for trading. Conversely, large purchases by new wallets or whales can imply an expectation of price appreciation. Staying informed about these on-chain activities helps investors make more educated decisions, even if direct correlation to immediate price action is not always guaranteed. Understanding the Implications of Whale and Institutional Movements The crypto market is highly sensitive to the actions of large holders. When ParaFi Capital and Flowdesk deposit millions of ENA to an exchange, it could be a precursor to increased selling pressure, potentially leading to a price dip. However, it could also be part of a broader strategy to rebalance portfolios or provide liquidity for market making activities, which are essential for healthy trading environments. On the other hand, the substantial purchases by a new wallet and an anonymous whale demonstrate strong buying interest. These buyers are betting on ENA’s future, injecting significant capital into the ecosystem. This duality of large deposits and large purchases creates an intriguing dynamic, suggesting both potential for increased supply and robust demand within the ENA market. What Actionable Insights Can We Gather from ENA Transactions? For those interested in ENA, these recent movements offer a few key takeaways. First, heightened whale and institutional activity often precedes periods of increased volatility. Second, monitoring on-chain data, as highlighted by The Data Nerd, can provide an early warning system for potential market shifts. While not financial advice, here are some points to consider: Stay Informed: Continue to follow reputable on-chain analysts for real-time updates on ENA and other assets. Observe Market Reaction: Pay attention to how ENA’s price reacts to these large transactions. Does it dip after deposits, or does strong buying absorb the supply? Consider Risk: Large movements can lead to sudden price swings. Always manage your risk exposure carefully. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term trading strategies influenced by these movements and ENA’s long-term fundamental value. The crypto market is a complex ecosystem, and large ENA transactions are just one piece of the puzzle. However, they are a significant indicator that warrants close observation, helping investors navigate the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets. Conclusion: The Ongoing Saga of ENA Transactions The past 24 hours have been particularly active for ENA, with over $15 million in tokens changing hands through various significant transactions. From institutional deposits to anonymous whale acquisitions, these movements underscore the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. As these large players continue to position themselves, the ENA community will be watching closely to see how these pivotal transactions shape its immediate future. Understanding these capital flows is crucial for anyone looking to comprehend the forces at play in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is ENA? ENA is the native token of Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. It provides a crypto-native, scalable solution for money that is censorship-resistant and stable, independent of traditional banking infrastructure. Why are large ENA transactions significant? Large transactions, especially those involving whales or institutional entities, can signal potential market shifts. They can indicate an intent to buy or sell substantial amounts, influencing price volatility and overall market sentiment. Who is The Data Nerd? The Data Nerd is an on-chain analyst who specializes in tracking and reporting significant cryptocurrency transactions and market movements across various blockchain networks. What does it mean when tokens are deposited to Binance? Depositing tokens to an exchange like Binance often suggests that the holder intends to sell them, use them for trading, or provide liquidity for market-making activities. It increases the available supply on the exchange. How can I track ENA transactions myself? You can track ENA transactions using various blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics platforms that monitor wallet addresses and transaction flows on the Ethereum network.

The firm which is backed by UAE sovereign wealth fund ADQ, with shares also owned by Phoenix Group, has changed its business plan and will now focus on serving high-net-worth individuals (HNWI), family offices, institutional investors and corporate treasuries, offering them digital asset investment solutions. Globally there has been a rising demand for institutional investment in digital assets. An EY survey reported that nearly 60% of institutional investors plan to allocate over 5% of their portfolios to digital assets. M2 believes this appetite is even stronger in the UAE. Sovereign wealth funds like Mubadala have already invested in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF fund. M2 will offer customized investment strategies and institutional-grade infrastructure. In addition, the exchange is focused on client service, and best-in-class security. M2 has partnerships with Sui, Ethena, Polygon, Haruko, FireBlocks, NiceHash, and FearsOff. The exchange’s advanced cybersecurity and enhanced operating model enables the provision of regulated custody, yield products, liquidity solutions, and treasury optimization. James Greenwood, CEO of M2 explained that the company’s strategic direction is to be a trusted bridge between the agility of digital asset markets and the standards of traditional wealth management. He states, “With this in mind, we have redefined our proposition around the evolving priorities of our clients: enhanced custody, deeper engagement, and institutional-grade opportunities within the digital asset economy. M2 stands at the intersection of private capital and precision, where digital wealth is managed with the same discipline, discretion, and depth as any other asset class.” M2 is one of only few firms worldwide offering Bitcoin-backed mining loans because of its affiliation with UAE Phoenix Group. The firm can also equip institutional clients with robust APIs for seamless portfolio diversification, aligning with the standards of traditional financial providers and bridging the gap between conventional finance and the digital asset economy. Kim Wong, Managing Director and Head of Treasury at M2, added, “This strategic realignment reflects a long-considered move toward where the industry is headed, and where we are well positioned to serve those navigating it.” It is noteworthy that M2 Custody Limited is licensed and regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), while M2 Global Wealth Limited (M2GW) is licensed and regulated by the Securities Commission of The Bahamas (SCB). The UAE has become a competitive environment for crypto exchange and brokerage offerings. This competitiveness is growing as UAE banks enter the scene. As a result, more crypto exchanges may adjust their business models. Other VASPs are also expected to make changes in the near future.

These moves include Trump signing an executive order on the US strategic Bitcoin reserve and Senator Cynthia Lummis' Bitcoin reserve bill. While expectations for the BTC reserve continue, an important meeting will be held in Washington today in the USA. According to The Block, the meeting will be hosted by Cynthia Lummis, the senator behind the BITCOIN Act, and will be attended by prominent figures such as Strategy founder Michael Saylor and Bitmine president Tom Lee. Accordingly, the meeting will discuss the adoption and support of a bill aiming to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States. “Our focus will be on ensuring the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve advances in a budget-neutral manner and building the coalition needed to advance the BITCOIN Act.” Participants are expected to include crypto industry executives such as Strategy founder Michael Saylor, Ethereum startup BitMine chairman and Fundstrat CEO Tom Lee, MARA Holdings CEO Fred Thiel, and CleanSpark CEO Matt Schultz. Lummis previously introduced a bill that would require the US government to purchase 200,000 BTC annually for five years, accumulating a total of one million BTC. The BITCOIN Act, introduced back in March by Senator Cynthia Lummis, could be the next major focus of lawmakers on crypto legislation, following efforts to pass the GENIUS Act in July. The bill proposes that the US acquire 1 million Bitcoins, worth over $115 billion at current prices, as strategic reserves within five years through a budget-independent strategy, that these purchases be spread over five years (200,000 BTC per year), and that the purchases be made with resources that will not burden taxpayers, that is, the public. *This is not investment advice.

Most larger-cap alts experienced even more substantial declines yesterday, but have turned green on a daily scale. BTC Eyes $116K Again The primary cryptocurrency plunged hard at the beginning of the previous business week, dropping below $111,000. However, the asset reacted well and defended that level. Moreover, it initiated a notable leg up in the following week that saw it jump past $116,000 by Friday. Bitcoin tried to break out even further to the north during the weekend and on Monday morning. Nevertheless, the bears returned when BTC was close to $117,000 at the beginning of the current business week and pushed it south almost immediately. As a result, the cryptocurrency dropped by nearly two-and-a-half grand to $114,400 (on Bitstamp). It bounced off to challenge $116,000 once again earlier today, but couldn’t break past that level. As of now, the asset trades at around $115,500 with more volatility expected in the following days due to the highly anticipated FOMC meeting. Bitcoin’s market cap has calmed at $2.3 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts stands at 56%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView AVAX Flies Ethereum is among the few altcoins that continue to be slightly in the red on a daily scale. The asset slipped below $4,500 earlier today but has managed to bounce just above that level. Ripple’s XRP has defended the $3 support, while BNB, DOGE, LINK, SOL, TRX, and SUI are slightly in the green. Avalanche’s native token has taken the main stage with a 7% surge that has pushed it to well over $30. XLM, XMR, and MNT are also with notable gains. IMX has returned to the top 100 alts following a 15% surge that has driven its price to just over $0.73. Data from CoinGecko shows that the total crypto market cap has added over $40 billion since yesterday’s low and is up to $4.110 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Such good news for Bitcoin is perhaps tempered by nervousness that when the potential cut is announced, it will be treated by the market as a ‘sell the news’ event. Rate cut almost certain, but potential price manipulation will keep market guessing Only one day away, and the market is probably as certain as it can be that a rate cut will be announced by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday at the FOMC meeting. The CME Group Fedwatch tool is currently showing a 96.1% chance of a 25 basis points cut in interest rates, while there is a faint 3.9% chance of a 50 basis points reduction. This is certainly good news for risk assets such as Bitcoin, and the US stock market is also likely to benefit. That said, at times like this where a big price-changing event is announced, the market will often choose to go in the opposite direction. In this instance, an initial dip could result from the rate cut news release. In addition, market makers could be tempted to use the increased price volatility around the announcement to spike the price up and down in order to liquidate both the long and short positions. $BTC breaks out of small descending channel/bull flag Source: TradingView The current correctional movement for the $BTC price has so far been very shallow. Instead of a downward thrust, the price has generally moved sideways and only slightly downward, which could be taken as a fairly bullish period of price action. It can be observed that a channel within a channel has formed, and that the price has just broken out of this latest small-scale descending channel. The price is currently coming back and is likely to test the top of the channel and also confirm the $115,700 horizontal level as support again before potentially going higher. It might be argued that this channel could in fact be a bull flag. If it is, the measured move for the pole and flag would take the price up to around $120,000 - the last bit of resistance before the all-time high. Big challenge for $BTC ahead Source: TradingView The daily chart puts the resistance levels into perspective. It can be seen that the $BTC price still has a challenge in front of it to pierce through this band of horizontal resistance. The 50-day SMA (blue line) is now acting as support, and depending on the price action over the next couple of days, it could start to angle upwards again. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators either have a long way to go back to the bottom, or they will start to bounce along the top, perhaps like they did previously through the last part of June and until mid-July. Inverse head and shoulders pattern to take $BTC to $120,000? Source: TradingView Zooming more into the same daily chart a real bonus pattern becomes clearer. This comes in the form of an inverse head and shoulders, which is a bullish formation. The right shoulder broke through the neckline after completing the pattern, and the next daily candle confirmed it. A measured move for the pattern takes the price to … $120,000. $117,500 is key resistance level Source: TradingView Finally, the weekly chart view reveals how important it is that the $117,500 resistance is overcome, if the bull market is to continue. One major signal in favour of the bulls is the cross-up of the indicators in the Stochastic RSI. If this week closes in a bullish manner, these indicators will likely be signalling large upside price momentum that can take the $BTC price into the next stage of its bull run.

The group, headquartered in Abu Dhabi, consolidates four entities from both traditional finance and digital assets: Mount TFI, a private debt specialist and licensed fund manager in Poland, Monterra Capital, a multi-strategy digital hedge fund in Malta, blockchain engineering studio Nextrope and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Soil compliant with MiCA, the EU's crypto framework. Already licensed in Poland and Malta, the group is seeking approval from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market to expand services in the Middle East, a region it sees as a hub for regulated digital asset growth. ""It's an opportunity to become a global on-chain asset manager,"" ORQO CEO Nicholas Motz said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""We have all the pieces: the off-chain asset management, and on-chain, too."" ORQO's effort is part of a larger trend that's been reshaping crypto markets: moving traditional financial instruments like private credit, U.S. Treasuries, or trade finance deals onto blockchain networks. The process is also known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). Data from rwa.xyz shows that the RWA market has grown into a nearly $30 billion sector, though it remains tiny compared to traditional finance markets such as the $2 trillion private credit sector . Still, the growth potential is immense: the tokenized RWA market could reach $18.9 trillion by 2033, a joint report by Ripple and BCG projected. Yield platform Soil is a key piece in ORQO's gameplan, connecting the firm's RWA access with crypto capital capital. It aims to provide returns on stablecoins deposits from tokenized private credit, real estate and hedge fund strategies. As part of the next stage, the firm plans to open several credit pools targeting holders of Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin in the near future, allowing investors such as institutional treasuries or protocol reserves to earn a yield on their holdings.

They have described this moment as an American “golden age of innovation.” Their optimism is encouraging investors who are scanning the crypto market for opportunities. At the same time, a new token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is drawing attention as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Investors are accumulating during its presale, seeing both short-term gains and long-term potential. Gemini Co-Founders Back Innovation The Gemini co-founders are praising policies that have supported cryptocurrency adoption. They are highlighting how the White House has consistently promoted growth across crypto coins. Furthermore, they are pointing to Bitcoin as one of the most important assets of the past decade. This support, combined with growing institutional interest, is bolstering optimism across crypto predictions. In addition, Gemini’s launch of a Mastercard-backed Bitcoin credit card is reinforcing crypto investing as a mainstream habit. Each swipe channels spending into crypto investment, which encourages accumulation and rewards user loyalty. Consequently, their comments about innovation are giving fresh momentum to investors searching for the top crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance Presale Growing Fast Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. This marks a 250% increase from the first phase price of $0.01. Since the presale began, $15,800,000 has been raised, with 16,300 holders now onboard. Phase 6 is selling quickly, and once sold out, phase 7 will lift the price to $0.04, a 14.3% jump. The token is scheduled to launch at $0.06. Buyers in the current stage are positioning for returns between 300% and 500% once trading begins. Consequently, those asking what crypto to invest in are considering MUTM before the next price lift. Moreover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized its Certik audit, securing a strong 90.00 rating. No security issues have been reported in the past 90 days. To reinforce confidence further, the project has opened a Bug Bounty Program with $50,000 USDT allocated for rewards. Critical, major, minor, and low-tier findings are all eligible for compensation. This structured approach underlines a clear focus on safety and transparency. Lending Models And Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is introducing a dual lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract for stablecoins and Peer-to-Peer for speculative assets. This design is offering flexible borrowing and lending choices, appealing to diverse crypto investment strategies. Moreover, the site has interest rate mechanisms that stabilize the liquidity by modifying the cost of borrowing funds when the pools become tight and/or loose. This helps stabilize the activity in times of volatility, and prevents imbalances. Over-collateralization protects loans and liquidation mechanisms protect liquidity providers from elaborate price movements. Another security is the deposit and borrow limits which prevent exposure to volatile assets. Together, these measures create a reliable framework for users concerned about what is going on with crypto today. As crypto charts shift daily, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a steady option among altcoins. Strong Community Incentives Community engagement is continuing to expand around Mutuum Finance. A new dashboard with a leaderboard is rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, encouraging strong accumulation. In parallel, the team has announced its biggest giveaway yet, distributing $100,000 in MUTM across 10 winners. Each winner is receiving $10,000 in tokens. Eligibility requires a minimum $50 investment in the presale, ensuring active participation. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is enhancing visibility by offering holders a direct role in governance and platform growth. This community-first approach aligns with broader trends in crypto investing, where participation matters as much as price. For those evaluating whether crypto is a good investment, such initiatives provide reassurance. Investors Acting On Optimism The momentum seen in Gemini’s call for a golden age is now resonating with investors eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The presale is offering one of the best crypto prices today before the next increase. Those entering at $0.035 are setting themselves up for significant gains at launch. Consequently, investors are not only aligning with market optimism but also securing tokens with clear safeguards, proven audits, and strong utility.

51814810,581720,1758016834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51814810.jpeg,Dogecoin Open Interest Hits New ATH – Here’s What Happened The Last Time,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-open-interest-ath/,"Dogecoin has hit a new milestone after rallying more than 20% last week. The meme coin saw its open interest balloon over the weekend as investors poured in to take advantage of the price increase. This pushed its open interest quickly, and now, it has reached a new all-time high for the second time this year. Dogecoin Open Interest Crossed $6 Billion According to data from the on-chain aggregation website Coinglass, the Dogecoin open interest has now crossed $6 billion. This increase happened over the weekend following the Dogecoin price hitting $0.3 for the first time in over six months. Coincidentally, the open interest will hit its highest level in over six months as well. On Sunday, the total open interest came in at $6.01 billion, marking a new peak to beat its January 2025 record. Back in January, when the crypto market was still reeling from the surge that began back in November 2024, the Dogecoin open interest had risen to $5.51 billion and remained that way, despite the May 2025 run-up. The rise to a new all-time high in open interest is a direct representation of the interest that the meme coin is now seeing from crypto investors. This is because open interest takes into account all of the long and short contracts in the market. This means that crypto traders are placing more bets on the Dogecoin price, depending on the position they believe that it is headed in next. The Long/Short ratio on the website shows that crypto traders are favoring the Dogecoin price to decline during this time. The ratio comes in 0.9161, with 47.81% of traders betting on a price increase and 52.19% of traders expecting the price to keep falling. What Happened After The Last Open Interest Peak? Looking at the Dogecoin open interest chart, it paints a clear picture of what happens each time it hits a new all-time high. After the January peak, the open interest had begun to decline, and the Dogecoin price had followed suit. This led to a multi-month accumulation trend that ended toward the end of the 3rd quarter of the year. If this trend holds, then it is likely that the current Dogecoin correction is only the start. It is possible that another accumulation trend could follow and would end during another market uptrend. The last time saw an over 60% decline in open interest before a bottom was found, and Dogecoin was able to regain its bullish strength again.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|DOGE open interest|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|Dogecoin open interest|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|open interest,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-16 10:00:34

Five-wave count suggests the asset could now enter Wave 3 or Wave 5 of a macro trend. ABC and WXY patterns together support the idea that XRP’s throwback phase is now complete. XRP May Have Completed Its Correction XRP is showing early signs that its recent price correction may be ending. Crypto market analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has shared an Elliott Wave-based review suggesting the asset could be preparing for its next move. The analysis shows what looks like a flat correction. In this setup, three waves are visible: A, B, and C. EGRAG noted that “Wave B didn’t quite reach Wave A,” but added that this can happen in some market conditions. The main focus is whether this pattern marks the end of the broader correction. #XRP – The Throwback Phase Is Finished If… (Update): Let me Zoom In to illustrate to illustrate the Elliot Wave Flat Corrective Structure. Zooming In: (1/5) I want to take you through a step-by-step breakdown of how I’m constructing this corrective wave. It could be… https://t.co/msT6UEOOHW pic.twitter.com/HWWA5Rq03z — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 16, 2025 This wave pattern might be the second or fourth wave in a larger market cycle. While the exact placement isn’t confirmed, the structure suggests that XRP may now be past the throwback phase. Chart Patterns Support a Shift in Trend A simplified chart shared by EGRAG shows an ABC pattern, which is commonly seen during market pullbacks. Alongside this, a WXY pattern is also present. This type of structure is often used to describe more complex market behavior when prices pause before resuming a trend. The combination of ABC and WXY patterns points to a possible conclusion of the correction . EGRAG also stated that when the B wave in an ABC structure shows strong upward movement, it can mean the market is getting ready to move higher again. A separate wave count was also shared, showing five smaller waves forming after the correction. In Elliott Wave Theory, this is a sign that the market may be starting a new upward phase. The five-wave count is being viewed as a sign that XRP is either starting Wave 3 or Wave 5 in a longer cycle. “The strength of the 5-wave pattern… reinforces the notion that the corrective phase has ended,” EGRAG posted. The placement depends on whether the last correction was Wave 2 or Wave 4. If it were Wave 2, XRP could now be entering Wave 3, which tends to show stronger price action . XRP Price and ETF Update XRP was trading at $3.03 at the time of writing, with a 24-hour volume of $5.1 billion. The price is up 2% in the past 24 hours and has slight gains over the past week. Meanwhile, the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (ticker: XRPR) is expected to launch this week after earlier delays.

Bittensor (TAO) is gaining traction through price insight that highlights its potential path, while Dogecoin (DOGE) has regained attention as trading activity builds on ETF speculation. Both remain closely monitored as discussions continue about the best crypto to buy. BlockDAG (BDAG), however, is setting itself apart by combining large-scale adoption with strong security. Its $0.0013 entry tied to the upcoming Deployment Event has already helped push the presale to over $405 million with over 26.2 billion coins sold. With more than 3 million X1 app miners, 312,000 holders, 19,800+ hardware units sold, single whale entries of $4.3M and $4.4M, and independent audits from CertiK and Halborn, BlockDAG (BDAG) has achieved both credibility and scale. Bittensor Price Signals Room for Growth Bittensor (TAO) has become one of the more notable projects under review, with analysts studying recent movements to gauge longer-term strength. Current Bittensor price insight suggests the coin could extend its upward momentum if trading volumes stay elevated and sentiment holds positive. This price view also reflects Bittensor’s position as a blockchain project integrated with artificial intelligence. That design has attracted interest from traders who see it as part of the rising AI-focused trend in crypto. Still, experts note that TAO’s volatility keeps it in speculative territory, with growth dependent on market enthusiasm and the ability to expand its ecosystem. For those looking at the best crypto to buy, Bittensor carries upside potential but with risk, as sustainability depends on whether demand can remain strong over time. Dogecoin Buzz Builds with Trading Activity Dogecoin (DOGE) has stepped back into the spotlight as trading activity increases. Growing talk about ETF approval odds has fueled speculation about its ability to test higher levels. This Dogecoin trading buzz highlights its lasting visibility as a retail-driven coin. The trading surge has also raised expectations, with some market watchers pointing to a possible rise toward $0.50 if ETF momentum grows. However, critics argue that Dogecoin still lacks the functional use cases seen in competitors, leaving its future shaped largely by headlines and sentiment rather than measurable adoption. For those considering the best crypto to buy, DOGE remains a widely followed asset, but one where risk is elevated due to its reliance on speculative moves. Its trading buzz is strong, but whether that converts to sustained growth is still uncertain. BlockDAG Builds Market Trust Through Strong Security BlockDAG is distinguishing itself by pairing rapid adoption with strict security practices. Access to its presale has been locked at $0.0013 ahead of the BDAG Deployment Event in Singapore. So far, the presale has raised over $405 million, with more than 26.2 billion coins sold. Holders from Batch 1 have already seen 2,900% returns, while those entering at $0.0013 are positioned for possible gains of 38x once BDAG hits its confirmed $0.05 launch price. Adoption data reflects consistent traction: over 3 million mobile app users, 312,000 coin holders growing by about 1,000 each day, and a 325,000-strong community. Hardware expansion has also scaled, with 19,800+ miners sold across 130+ countries and shipments continuing at 2,000 units per week. Large-scale confidence has been shown through whale entries of $4.3M and $4.4M, underscoring strong belief in BlockDAG’s direction. What sets BlockDAG apart is its focus on network safety. Independent audits by CertiK and Halborn confirm that its smart contracts and system infrastructure meet the highest standards. Supporting features like the BlockDAG Explorer and Demo Dashboard V4 give real-time tracking of wallets, referrals, and transactions, ensuring visibility. Together with live use of the X1 app and X10 Series Miners producing 200 BDAG daily, BlockDAG demonstrates that its framework is secure, transparent, and already functional before its official listing. Assessment of Broader Market Position Bittensor’s price outlook highlights the opportunity in AI-driven crypto, while Dogecoin’s trading buzz shows how speculation can influence short-term value. Both play an active role in the market, though their volatility raises questions about sustained growth. BlockDAG presents a stronger case. Its $0.0013 entry stage, over $405 million raised in crypto presale , 26.2 billion coins sold, and millions of users signal genuine adoption. With 19,800+ miners sold, 312,000 holders, whale entries above $4 million, and developer activity expanding, its foundation is solid. Most importantly, the CertiK and Halborn audits confirm its reliability. For those considering the best crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG offers assurance built on participation and verified safety.

Key Takeaways: Pump.fun surpassed Hyperliquid in daily protocol revenue, hitting over $1 billion in trading volume and ranking third among DeFi platforms. The memecoin market cap surged to a 30-day high of $83 billion, reflecting strong retail interest and token launches. Pump.fun is expanding into livestreaming, paying $4 million to creators as it aims to rival platforms like Rumble and Kick. The milestone comes as memecoin trading continues to rally in September, fueled by a sharp spike in market activity and token launches. On Monday, Pump.fun recorded over $1.02 billion in daily trading volume, up from $942 million the day before, as shown by decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter . Memecoin Market Cap Hits $83B High Amid Ongoing Sector Rally The surge coincided with a broader memecoin sector rally, where the total market cap hit a 30-day high of $83 billion on Sunday, holding above $80 billion through Monday. While the sector has slightly cooled to $76 billion at press time, the interest in meme tokens remains elevated. Pump.fun’s total value locked (TVL) also hit a record high of $334 million on Sunday, underscoring growing capital inflow into the platform’s smart contracts. The protocol ranked third in daily DeFi revenue, behind only Tether and Circle, while beating out Hyperliquid for two consecutive days. This marks a notable shift in protocol rankings as retail interest floods into memecoins again. Beyond trading volume, Pump.fun is pushing aggressively into livestreaming. On Monday, the platform announced it had distributed $4 million in rewards to content creators, the majority of whom were first-time streamers. yesterday, pump fun paid out over $4m in Creator Rewards, most of which went to first-time creators that are now able to realize the potential of their dreams a cambrian explosion of ideas is well underway, powered by tokenization Ascend. — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) September 15, 2025 Pump.fun co-founder Alon claimed the platform’s livestreaming tool surpassed Rumble in average concurrent streams, edging toward 1% of Twitch’s share and 10% of Kick’s. However, these claims remain unverified by third-party analytics platforms. The memecoin sector’s latest momentum also lifted major tokens like Dogecoin, which gained 11% over the past week despite the delay of a proposed US-listed Dogecoin ETF. Other lesser-known meme tokens, including Memecore (M), Moo Deng (MOODENG), and DORA, posted double-digit gains as well. already flipped Rumble in terms of average number of concurrent live streams currently inching at ~1% of Twitch's market share and ~10% of Kick's market share we're nibbling on their lunch and COMING FOR MORE — alon (@a1lon9) September 13, 2025 Pump.fun’s breakout underscores how fast-growing meme culture continues to disrupt both DeFi economics and Web3 entertainment platforms, as it evolves beyond speculation into creator-driven ecosystems. Pump.fun Acquires Kolscan In July, Pump.fun announced its acquisition of the wallet tracking tool Kolscan, aiming to revolutionize on-chain trading. The integration will merge Kolscan’s analytics with Pump.fun’s social trading features, enhancing transparency, wallet tracking, and copy-trading capabilities. Co-founder Alon Cohen emphasized that trading is a “social sport,” highlighting the importance of community and shared insights in driving success within the ecosystem. As part of the deal, all Kolscan services will be made free to users. Pump.fun has already attracted tens of thousands of users and intends to build a scalable crypto social media platform, leveraging Kolscan’s tools to grow its community and influence.

On-chain efficiency and integration with wider markets have long been focal points for the project, and new functionality may soon further expand these capabilities. A recent revelation suggests that Ripple could be preparing to integrate an Oracle network directly into the XRPL framework. Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) recently published screenshots to prove the existence of Oracle functionality on the XRPL. The images show an options interface labeled “XRPL price oracle,” as well as a “Receive Payments” window where exchange rates are applied through the oracle system. The screenshots suggest that users could select a target currency such as USD, EUR, JPY, or others, with payments processed based on conversion rates sourced from the XRPL Price Oracle. This development indicates that Ripple is testing a native price oracle that can provide real-time exchange data across multiple fiat currencies. Proof of XRPL Price Oracle Functionality Revealed https://t.co/Mwym0pV6mg pic.twitter.com/oxAWKyotzi — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 15, 2025 The Importance of the XRPL Oracle This is not the first time SMQKE has drawn attention to the topic. On August 25, he revealed that Ripple was building an Oracle network that could displace Chainlink, with documents to back his claim. Oracles are critical components of blockchain ecosystems because they allow decentralized applications to access external data, including price feeds that determine fair settlement values. If Ripple deploys a fully functioning oracle system within XRPL, it could remove reliance on external services and create a more self-sufficient infrastructure. Why Is This Important for XRP? Another expert recently described this process as XRP’s path to becoming Wall Street’s data highway . While the scope and timeline of deployment remain unknown, the presence of an interface highlights that Ripple is moving forward with tangible testing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Oracle networks play an essential role in bridging blockchains with real-world data. In decentralized finance, accurate and secure price feeds ensure that transactions, smart contracts, and settlements occur with reliability. Chainlink has long dominated this sector, providing feeds to numerous blockchains and protocols. While XRP and Chainlink have been compared in other aspects , Ripple’s attempt to build an internal price oracle could position XRPL as a direct competitor. For XRP, this advancement could enhance its appeal to institutional and retail users by providing a stronger infrastructure for payments and settlement. With reliable oracle functionality, exchanges and payment applications on XRPL can manage conversions across global currencies more efficiently.

What It Is: The BuyBack Vault is an unprecedented opportunity for the R0AR community: A minimum of 1% above market value is being offered for 1R0R tokens, with potential for higher rates depending on conditions. Wallets transferring assets to the R0AR Chain may become eligible for upcoming airdrops, platform rewards, and gated benefits. Participants who did not engage in the 1R0R pre-sale, Executive R0AR Society NFT mint, DeFi programs, or early Node offerings may still qualify as early adopters ahead of the R0AR Chain reaching its initial 10,000-user milestone. Why It Matters The BuyBack Vault is more than a buyback—it’s a signal of intent: By incentivizing total value locked (TVL) and broader participation, the initiative aims to reinforce the structural and transactional strength of the R0AR Chain. Rather than conducting token repurchases on external networks, the focus remains on building value directly within the R0AR infrastructure. The BuyBack Vault is one of several forthcoming developments, with future updates expected to introduce new token burn mechanisms and expanded ecosystem integrations designed to support long-term functionality and visibility. What It Means for the Ecosystem The BuyBack Vault directly fuels the growth engine of R0AR: Depletes the supply of 1R0R on the open market. Grows TVL on R0AR Chain—one of the ecosystem’s key metrics. Drives visibility and community hype , setting the stage for exponential growth. This initiative is the first of five strategic announcements rolling out over the next five weeks, each designed to throw gas on the fire of community energy, ecosystem participation, and chain adoption. A Word from R0AR “The BuyBack Vault is about more than buying tokens—it’s about rewarding loyalty, strengthening our foundation, and proving to the world that the R0AR Chain is here to dominate. Participation is the key to growth, and we’re rewarding it at every level.” Dustin Hedrick, chief technology officer About R0AR R0AR is a next-generation blockchain ecosystem uniting DeFi, NFTs, and community-driven innovation. Anchored by the $1R0R token and the Executive R0AR Society NFT collection, R0AR is building the infrastructure, tools, and rewards system to power the next wave of decentralized adoption.

TLDR: The crypto market capitalization is down 0.5% on Tuesday morning (UTC); 88 of the top 100 coins are red, as are all top 10 coins; BTC and ETH are down to $115,864 and $4,508, respectively; The US FOMC decision “could spark sharp volatility”; BTC could climb toward $150,000–$200,000 by year-end; ETH could climb to the $5,800–$8,000 range on the back of ETF rotations and network expansion; Tom Lee argued that BTC and ETH could see ‘a monster move’ in the next three months; US BTC and ETH spot ETFs both recorded inflows of $260.02 million and $359.73 million, respectively; Next Technology Holding could soon hold more than $8,000 BTC; Caution remains among investors, as they wait for economic and geopolitical signals. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, nine of the top 10 coins per market capitalization have decreased over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 0.5% at the time of writing, currently trading at $115,864. This is among the smallest drops in this category. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 1y Ethereum (ETH) is down 2.6%, now changing hands at $4,508. It’s the second-highest drop in the category. The highest decrease is 3% by Dogecoin (DOGE) , currently standing at $0.2669. One coin, however, is green, but its change is so low that it’s practically unchanged. Binance Coin (BNB) is up 0.2% to $931. When it comes to the top 100 coins, of the 12 green coins, Pump.fun (PUMP) appreciated the most: 6.6% to $0.00834. Provenance Blockchain (HASH) follows with an increase of 5.8% to the price of $0.03772. On the other side, Ethena (ENA) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) decreased the most among the top 100. They’re down 7.2% and 5.8% to $0.6998 and $0.03299.

Tom Lee said on @CNBCClosingBell today that if the Fed cuts, the biggest beneficiaries will be: 1. NASDAQ 100 (Mag 7 + AI) 2. Bitcoin & Ethereum — “could make a monster move in the next 3 months” 3. Small caps & financials pic.twitter.com/HoEW6VgdDt — Tom Lee Tracker (Not actually Tom) (@TomLeeTracker) September 15, 2025 ‘All Eyes on the US Fed Meeting’ Bitunix analysts commented that markets widely expect the US Federal Reserve to announce its first rate cut since last year this Wednesday. With internal policy divisions and political pressure intertwining, they write, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision “could spark sharp volatility.” Traders should reduce leverage exposure and “closely watch the battle between BTC 117,000 resistance and 114,000 support.” From a technical perspective, the analysts continue, “BTC liquidation heatmaps show price rallying toward 116,800, with heavy liquidation clusters between 117,000–118,000 forming a major near-term resistance band. Support lies at 114,000 and 111,000, with a potential drop toward the 108,500 liquidity zone if these levels break.” Moreover, Bitget’s Chief Analyst Ryan Lee adds that a rate cut would reduce borrowing costs and boost liquidity, providing a tailwind for risk assets. “Under this scenario, Bitcoin could climb toward $150,000–$200,000 by year-end, while Ethereum may advance to the $5,800–$8,000 range on the back of ETF rotations and network expansion. Together, these trends reflect a maturing market where Bitcoin and Ethereum drive industry growth in tandem, provided inflation stays contained and no major geopolitical shocks disrupt sentiment.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Tuesday morning, BTC trades at $115,864.

What It Is: The BuyBack Vault is an unprecedented opportunity for the R0AR community: A minimum of 1% above market value is being offered for 1R0R tokens, with potential for higher rates depending on conditions. Wallets transferring assets to the R0AR Chain may become eligible for upcoming airdrops, platform rewards, and gated benefits.

Rather than conducting token repurchases on external networks, the focus remains on building value directly within the R0AR infrastructure.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis After some brief consolidation in the last couple of days, Bitcoin is back in the green today. It’s now comfortably above the $115K mark. Despite speculation of a slightly deeper correction after yesterday’s action, Bitcoin was quick to jump back above short-term moving averages, like the 10 and 20 EMAs, on the 4-hour chart. While technically it’s still entirely possible that $BTC could trade a bit lower in the next couple of days, the upcoming FOMC meeting is expected to be very bullish for crypto, including Bitcoin. Combined with a rate cut, Bitcoin’s strong technical setup provides the perfect platform for the token to reclaim its current all-time highs and set some new ones.

An address widely believed to be linked to the prominent crypto venture capital firm Maven 11 has executed a significant move, pulling 21.156 million ENA tokens – valued at an astounding $15.1 million – directly from Binance. This substantial transfer, reported by on-chain analyst EmberCN, has naturally sparked considerable discussion and speculation within the crypto community. What does such a massive ENA withdrawal truly signify, and what insights can we glean from the strategic maneuvers of institutional players like Maven 11? What Does This Strategic ENA Withdrawal Signify? Maven 11 is recognized as a key player in the crypto venture capital landscape, known for its strategic investments in promising blockchain projects. When a firm of this caliber makes such a substantial move, it rarely happens without careful consideration. This particular ENA withdrawal could indicate several strategic intentions: Long-Term Staking: Maven 11 might be moving the ENA tokens to a dedicated staking wallet to participate in the Ethena protocol’s governance or to earn staking rewards, signaling a long-term bullish conviction. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large institutional transfers sometimes precede an OTC sale, where tokens are sold directly to another party without impacting exchange liquidity. However, this is less common for withdrawals to a known VC address without immediate subsequent transfers. Enhanced Security Measures: Moving assets from an exchange to a cold storage solution or a multi-signature wallet enhances security, reflecting a commitment to safeguarding significant holdings. Participation in Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The tokens could be earmarked for deployment in various DeFi protocols, such as providing liquidity or collateral, to generate further yield. The ENA token, native to the Ethena protocol, is central to a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. Its value and utility are tied to the protocol’s performance and adoption, making Maven 11’s interest a noteworthy endorsement. How Do We Track Such Significant Crypto Movements? The ability to track such an extensive ENA withdrawal is thanks to the transparency of public blockchains and the work of dedicated on-chain analysts like EmberCN. These analysts utilize sophisticated tools to monitor transactions, identify wallet addresses, and connect them to known entities or patterns. This provides invaluable insights into market dynamics and institutional behavior. Blockchain Explorers: These tools allow anyone to view transaction details, including sender and receiver addresses, amounts, and timestamps. Wallet Tagging: Over time, specific wallet addresses become associated with exchanges, venture capital firms, or prominent individuals, enabling analysts to identify the parties involved in transactions. Pattern Recognition: Analysts look for unusual large transfers, frequent movements, or specific interactions with smart contracts to infer potential strategies. Binance, as one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, serves as a primary gateway for many large-scale transactions. While the exact internal reasons for Maven 11’s decision to initiate this ENA withdrawal remain speculative, the on-chain data offers a clear trail of the assets’ movement post-exchange. What Could Be the Broader Market Implications of This ENA Withdrawal? A significant ENA withdrawal by a major VC firm like Maven 11 can send ripples through the market, even if it doesn’t immediately cause price volatility. Such actions are often interpreted by the wider investor community as a signal of confidence or a strategic repositioning. While it’s crucial to avoid direct correlation without further data, here are some potential implications: Increased Investor Confidence: A large withdrawal for potential staking or long-term holding can be seen as a bullish signal, suggesting the VC firm believes in ENA’s future growth. Supply Dynamics: If the tokens are moved off-exchange for staking, it reduces the immediate circulating supply available for trading, which could, in theory, contribute to price stability or upward pressure over time. Enhanced Visibility for Ethena: Maven 11’s involvement brings more attention to the Ethena protocol, potentially attracting other institutional or retail investors. Learning from Institutional Strategies: For retail investors, observing these large-scale movements can provide valuable lessons in long-term asset management and strategic accumulation, rather than short-term trading. It’s important for investors to conduct their own research and not solely rely on the actions of others. However, understanding the context behind a significant ENA withdrawal like this can certainly enrich one’s market perspective. In conclusion, the substantial ENA withdrawal by a Maven 11-linked address from Binance is more than just a large transaction; it’s a window into the strategic thinking of institutional crypto investors. Whether for staking, enhanced security, or future DeFi deployments, such a move underscores a deliberate long-term perspective on the Ethena protocol and its native token. As the crypto market continues to mature, tracking these sophisticated movements becomes increasingly vital for understanding underlying trends and potential future developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ENA? A1: ENA is the native governance and utility token of the Ethena protocol, which aims to provide a decentralized, censorship-resistant synthetic dollar (USDe) built on Ethereum. Q2: Who is Maven 11? A2: Maven 11 is a prominent crypto venture capital firm that invests in and supports various blockchain projects and decentralized technologies, often taking significant positions in promising digital assets. Q3: Why would a firm withdraw such a large amount of ENA from an exchange? A3: There are several reasons, including moving tokens for long-term staking, deploying them in DeFi protocols, enhancing security by transferring to cold storage, or preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction. Q4: Does this ENA withdrawal guarantee a price increase for ENA? A4: No, a large withdrawal does not guarantee a price increase. While it can be interpreted as a bullish signal due to reduced exchange supply or long-term holding intentions, market prices are influenced by many factors, and speculation should be avoided. Q5: How can I track similar institutional movements? A5: You can track institutional movements using blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens) and following reputable on-chain analysts on social media or dedicated crypto analytics platforms. Q6: Is Ethena a safe investment? A6: All cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks. While Ethena aims for stability with its synthetic dollar, it is subject to market volatility, smart contract risks, and regulatory changes. Always conduct thorough due diligence before investing.
