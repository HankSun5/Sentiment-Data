This action confirms the authenticity of its filing on September 30, following widespread speculation regarding the development. XRP ETF Applications Gain Momentum Despite this initial step, the road to approval is fraught with challenges. No XRP ETF is guaranteed to meet the SEC’s regulatory standards. Related Reading: Cardano Completes First Green September Close In 6 Years, What’s The Significance? Recent reports indicate that applications for ETFs linked to Solana, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, were recently rescinded due to the SEC’s concerns about Solana’s legal standing. Nonetheless, Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise, expressed confidence in XRP’s potential as an investment opportunity. “XRP is one of the most enduring, well-known assets in the space and is also recognized among mainstream investors,” Horsley stated in an interview with Fox Business. He emphasized that Bitwise aims to help investors access opportunities in the cryptocurrency market, and the filing for a Bitwise XRP ETF aligns with that mission. In addition to Bitwise’s efforts, Fox Business has learned that another XRP ETF filing has emerged from Canary Capital, a newly formed crypto-focused investment firm founded by Steven McClurg, co-founder and former chief investment officer of Valkyrie Funds. Canary’s XRP ETF was filed on September 24. Implications Of SEC’s Ripple Lawsuit The regulatory status of XRP has been a contentious issue over the past years, particularly following the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple in 2020, claiming that XRP sales constituted what the agency calls “unregistered securities offerings.” A recent ruling provided Ripple a partial victory, determining that only certain sales—specifically to institutional investors—were classified as securities. This ruling has significant implications for XRP’s future, particularly as the SEC approaches its October 7 deadline to appeal. As reported by Bitcoinist earlier this week, Pro-XRP attorney Fred Rispoli has indicated that the likelihood of an SEC appeal is higher than the chance of the agency allowing the case to conclude without further action. Rispoli highlighted the stakes involved, noting that if the SEC chooses not to appeal, it could set a precedent that distinguishes Ripple’s case from future cryptocurrency sales. This could have wider implications, not only for Bitwise’s XRP ETF application but also for other institutions making similar moves to offer the same investment vehicles for the token. This could be similar to the newly launched Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETF markets, which were approved and launched in January and July this year, respectively, with the world’s largest asset managers offering these index funds to their clients, further supporting the adoption and investment in these cryptocurrencies. XRP Price Despite this notable development for the XRP market, its price has failed to follow the excitement generated among investors, as the token has followed the broader market’s decline with a 7% drop in the 24-hour time frame, resulting in a current trading price of $0.578. Related Reading: Will Israel-Iran Conflict Push Bitcoin Further Down? Analysts Discuss Despite this, the cryptocurrency is still managing to hold on to some of its gains from last month, up 5% over the period. However, XRP has only managed to gain 10% every year, highlighting the lack of catalysts and bullish momentum for further recovery. This is particularly evident in the gap between the current trading price and the all-time high of $3,040 reached in January 2018, leaving a difference of 82% from the record peak. However, a full victory for Ripple and other institutions to follow Bitwise’s initiative for an XRP ETF could have a noticeable impact on the price and perhaps renew investor confidence in the token, strengthening the bullish outlook for the rest of the year.

The flagship crypto saw a 7% decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors. However, most analysts remain optimistic about BTC’s performance in the next three months. Related Reading: Bonk ‘In Prime Position For Turbo Green Week’ As Price Recovers Key Level Is This The ‘Shakeout Before Breakout’? The market began the month of October, popularly known as “Uptober” by the crypto community, with the first shakeout of the quarter, losing 6.5% of its market capitalization. Most cryptocurrencies in the top 100 saw a considerable price drop, registering green numbers in the daily and weekly timeframes. The bleeding was led by Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, as its price nosedived below the $61,000 support zone, a range not seen in nearly two weeks. Geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East seemingly fueled the downturn, as the drop followed the news of an Iranian missile strike on Israel. The news spiked an investors’ selloff, which ended the BTC spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) 8-day inflow streak and triggered the liquidation of over $526 million in leveraged positions in the last 24 hours. Nonetheless, many industry watchers remain unfazed by the market shakeout, noting that the month has just started. In a series of X posts, crypto analyst Jelle pointed out that Bitcoin started its second leg higher during October in the past bull years. He explained that BTC’s price historically breaks out in the second or third week of the month, so the first week retrace could be the “final shakeout before new highs.” Moreover, he highlighted that the flagship crypto recently made the first higher high in 6 months and reclaimed the key resistance level above $60,000. Jelle also noted that BTC made a higher low on October 1, holding the $60,000 support zone and retesting its strength above the $61,000 mark. The analyst considers that “It’s time for this descending broadening wedge to start playing out,” reasserting his previous target of $90,000. Analyst Warns About Bitcoin ‘Fifth-Day Plunge’ Other analysts also shared their views on the market shakeout. Altcoin Sherpa highlighted that “the last time we saw this much compression with 1d EMAs was September 2023, right before the market skyrocketed.” Meanwhile, DonAlt expressed a more cautious approach, stating that Bitcoin could look “much worse” considering the circumstances, but suggested waiting for the weekly close would be best to conclude. Nonetheless, trader Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that Bitcoin has “bottomed/topped at basically the same time” since June. Per the post, on the fifth day of each month, BTC’s price has registered a massive correction, except for September, when it occurred on the sixth day. Related Reading: SUI Sees 15% Weekly Surge Ahead Of Token Unlock, Can It Hit New ATH In October? During the Q3 retraces, BTC registered daily red candles ahead of the fifth-day plunge. The price recorded a 16.3%, 25%, and 11% decline in July, August, and September from the beginning of each month until the end of the first-week shakeout. If the pattern repeated this month, investors could see BTC’s price dropping below the recently reclaimed $60,000 support level and test the strengths of lower key support zones. However, it would also mean that the flagship cryptocurrency would potentially recover by the start of the second week. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $61,466, a 2% drop in the last 24 hours.

Even with Dogecoin sitting more than 85% below its May 2021 all-time high of $0.73, expectations for the meme coin’s performance are still very high. Given its historical performance, the DOGE price usually gets a window of opportunity for a surge, and it seems like another window is finally opening up. The Bullish Thesis For Dogecoin Crypto trader and analyst Dima James Potts took to the X platform to share a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price. The analyst’s forecast takes into account a number of factors, ranging from historical performance to adoption. Nevertheless, the end result remains the same and that is the fact that the DOGE price could be set to surge. Related Reading: Still Holding Your Hamster Kombat Tokens? You Might Be In For A Nice Surprise Soon Potts compared the current movement of the Dogecoin price to that of 2017 and 2020 to reveal a bullish trend. As the analyst explains, each time, before the Dogecoin price rallied, it broke above the white line and then closed the week above it, as shown in the image below: Each time this happened, the DOGE price went on a parabolic run, and now, once again, the Dogecoin price has broken above the white line. This is bullish for the price, according to the analyst, serving as confirmation. However, the second part of this trend is yet to be completed and that is closing the week above the white line. Since the breakout occurred on Sunday, the DOGE price still has the rest of the week to complete this move. The breakout is, however, not the only reason that Potts is bullish on the Dogecoin price. He also points to the increased adoption and low price as reasons why the price could rise to new highs. Also, with more technological updates that provide for faster transactions and higher levels of security, the analyst believes that this “could further bolster Dogecoin’s utility and appeal.” A Possible 11,000% Surge? Taking into account the previous Dogecoin rallies and how they have played out, the analyst pointed out that each rally is more significant than the last. For example, there was a 9,300% surge in 2017 and a 29,000% surge in 2020/2021. Going by this, the analyst believes that the DOGE price could also see a significant rally this time around. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In The ‘Final Test’, Here’s Where The BTC Price Is Headed Next The bottom of the rally is place at around 11,167%, which would put the price above $10. Meanwhile, the top of the Dogecoin rally in the best case scenario is placed at 40,137%, putting the DOGE price as high as $40.
