This action confirms the authenticity of its filing on September 30, following widespread speculation regarding the development. XRP ETF Applications Gain Momentum Despite this initial step, the road to approval is fraught with challenges. No XRP ETF is guaranteed to meet the SEC’s regulatory standards. Related Reading: Cardano Completes First Green September Close In 6 Years, What’s The Significance? Recent reports indicate that applications for ETFs linked to Solana, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, were recently rescinded due to the SEC’s concerns about Solana’s legal standing. Nonetheless, Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise, expressed confidence in XRP’s potential as an investment opportunity. “XRP is one of the most enduring, well-known assets in the space and is also recognized among mainstream investors,” Horsley stated in an interview with Fox Business. He emphasized that Bitwise aims to help investors access opportunities in the cryptocurrency market, and the filing for a Bitwise XRP ETF aligns with that mission. In addition to Bitwise’s efforts, Fox Business has learned that another XRP ETF filing has emerged from Canary Capital, a newly formed crypto-focused investment firm founded by Steven McClurg, co-founder and former chief investment officer of Valkyrie Funds. Canary’s XRP ETF was filed on September 24. Implications Of SEC’s Ripple Lawsuit The regulatory status of XRP has been a contentious issue over the past years, particularly following the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple in 2020, claiming that XRP sales constituted what the agency calls “unregistered securities offerings.” A recent ruling provided Ripple a partial victory, determining that only certain sales—specifically to institutional investors—were classified as securities. This ruling has significant implications for XRP’s future, particularly as the SEC approaches its October 7 deadline to appeal. As reported by Bitcoinist earlier this week, Pro-XRP attorney Fred Rispoli has indicated that the likelihood of an SEC appeal is higher than the chance of the agency allowing the case to conclude without further action. Rispoli highlighted the stakes involved, noting that if the SEC chooses not to appeal, it could set a precedent that distinguishes Ripple’s case from future cryptocurrency sales. This could have wider implications, not only for Bitwise’s XRP ETF application but also for other institutions making similar moves to offer the same investment vehicles for the token. This could be similar to the newly launched Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETF markets, which were approved and launched in January and July this year, respectively, with the world’s largest asset managers offering these index funds to their clients, further supporting the adoption and investment in these cryptocurrencies. XRP Price Despite this notable development for the XRP market, its price has failed to follow the excitement generated among investors, as the token has followed the broader market’s decline with a 7% drop in the 24-hour time frame, resulting in a current trading price of $0.578. Related Reading: Will Israel-Iran Conflict Push Bitcoin Further Down? Analysts Discuss Despite this, the cryptocurrency is still managing to hold on to some of its gains from last month, up 5% over the period. However, XRP has only managed to gain 10% every year, highlighting the lack of catalysts and bullish momentum for further recovery. This is particularly evident in the gap between the current trading price and the all-time high of $3,040 reached in January 2018, leaving a difference of 82% from the record peak. However, a full victory for Ripple and other institutions to follow Bitwise’s initiative for an XRP ETF could have a noticeable impact on the price and perhaps renew investor confidence in the token, strengthening the bullish outlook for the rest of the year.

The flagship crypto saw a 7% decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors. However, most analysts remain optimistic about BTC’s performance in the next three months. Related Reading: Bonk ‘In Prime Position For Turbo Green Week’ As Price Recovers Key Level Is This The ‘Shakeout Before Breakout’? The market began the month of October, popularly known as “Uptober” by the crypto community, with the first shakeout of the quarter, losing 6.5% of its market capitalization. Most cryptocurrencies in the top 100 saw a considerable price drop, registering green numbers in the daily and weekly timeframes. The bleeding was led by Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, as its price nosedived below the $61,000 support zone, a range not seen in nearly two weeks. Geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East seemingly fueled the downturn, as the drop followed the news of an Iranian missile strike on Israel. The news spiked an investors’ selloff, which ended the BTC spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) 8-day inflow streak and triggered the liquidation of over $526 million in leveraged positions in the last 24 hours. Nonetheless, many industry watchers remain unfazed by the market shakeout, noting that the month has just started. In a series of X posts, crypto analyst Jelle pointed out that Bitcoin started its second leg higher during October in the past bull years. He explained that BTC’s price historically breaks out in the second or third week of the month, so the first week retrace could be the “final shakeout before new highs.” Moreover, he highlighted that the flagship crypto recently made the first higher high in 6 months and reclaimed the key resistance level above $60,000. Jelle also noted that BTC made a higher low on October 1, holding the $60,000 support zone and retesting its strength above the $61,000 mark. The analyst considers that “It’s time for this descending broadening wedge to start playing out,” reasserting his previous target of $90,000. Analyst Warns About Bitcoin ‘Fifth-Day Plunge’ Other analysts also shared their views on the market shakeout. Altcoin Sherpa highlighted that “the last time we saw this much compression with 1d EMAs was September 2023, right before the market skyrocketed.” Meanwhile, DonAlt expressed a more cautious approach, stating that Bitcoin could look “much worse” considering the circumstances, but suggested waiting for the weekly close would be best to conclude. Nonetheless, trader Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that Bitcoin has “bottomed/topped at basically the same time” since June. Per the post, on the fifth day of each month, BTC’s price has registered a massive correction, except for September, when it occurred on the sixth day. Related Reading: SUI Sees 15% Weekly Surge Ahead Of Token Unlock, Can It Hit New ATH In October? During the Q3 retraces, BTC registered daily red candles ahead of the fifth-day plunge. The price recorded a 16.3%, 25%, and 11% decline in July, August, and September from the beginning of each month until the end of the first-week shakeout. If the pattern repeated this month, investors could see BTC’s price dropping below the recently reclaimed $60,000 support level and test the strengths of lower key support zones. However, it would also mean that the flagship cryptocurrency would potentially recover by the start of the second week. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $61,466, a 2% drop in the last 24 hours.

Even with Dogecoin sitting more than 85% below its May 2021 all-time high of $0.73, expectations for the meme coin’s performance are still very high. Given its historical performance, the DOGE price usually gets a window of opportunity for a surge, and it seems like another window is finally opening up. The Bullish Thesis For Dogecoin Crypto trader and analyst Dima James Potts took to the X platform to share a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price. The analyst’s forecast takes into account a number of factors, ranging from historical performance to adoption. Nevertheless, the end result remains the same and that is the fact that the DOGE price could be set to surge. Related Reading: Still Holding Your Hamster Kombat Tokens? You Might Be In For A Nice Surprise Soon Potts compared the current movement of the Dogecoin price to that of 2017 and 2020 to reveal a bullish trend. As the analyst explains, each time, before the Dogecoin price rallied, it broke above the white line and then closed the week above it, as shown in the image below: Each time this happened, the DOGE price went on a parabolic run, and now, once again, the Dogecoin price has broken above the white line. This is bullish for the price, according to the analyst, serving as confirmation. However, the second part of this trend is yet to be completed and that is closing the week above the white line. Since the breakout occurred on Sunday, the DOGE price still has the rest of the week to complete this move. The breakout is, however, not the only reason that Potts is bullish on the Dogecoin price. He also points to the increased adoption and low price as reasons why the price could rise to new highs. Also, with more technological updates that provide for faster transactions and higher levels of security, the analyst believes that this “could further bolster Dogecoin’s utility and appeal.” A Possible 11,000% Surge? Taking into account the previous Dogecoin rallies and how they have played out, the analyst pointed out that each rally is more significant than the last. For example, there was a 9,300% surge in 2017 and a 29,000% surge in 2020/2021. Going by this, the analyst believes that the DOGE price could also see a significant rally this time around. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In The ‘Final Test’, Here’s Where The BTC Price Is Headed Next The bottom of the rally is place at around 11,167%, which would put the price above $10. Meanwhile, the top of the Dogecoin rally in the best case scenario is placed at 40,137%, putting the DOGE price as high as $40.

Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/whats-holding-bitcoin-back-analyst-says-71000-is-the-magic-number/,"Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes that the recent rally of Bitcoin still isn’t enough to flip the long-term bearish trend. While BTC did have a brief surge, he insists it hasn’t reached the levels needed to confirm a bullish reversal. Bitcoin needs to break $71,000 first and then confirm that, says Brandt. And while he claims this, other market analysts such as Jesse Colombo and Roman warn that geopolitical tensions and market patterns might bring BTC down even further. Related Reading: Breakout Looms: XRP To Hit $7.5 After ‘Wake-Up Line,’ According To Analyst QCP Capital highlights cautious optimism, noting that the recent sell-off appears shallow, suggesting potential for recovery. As more major traders take time to think about it, Michal van de Poppe thinks this pullback is short-term and would look forward to a retest of $60,000 support before Bitcoin makes a strong rebound. For more than seven months now, Bitcoin has traded in a downtrend with consecutive lower highs and lower lows reinforcing bearish sentiment. Even though the short-lived optimism had some toe-hold moments, according to Brandt’s chart work, the larger pattern isn’t altered. BTC must break through the higher levels of resistance at hand before a shift to the bullish side can be seen. Resistance Levels Holding Bitcoin Back According to Brandt, Bitcoin is caught between two very important levels of resistance. The first is at $70,600, while the second and the all-time high of Bitcoin is at $73,800. Both marks have capped the upward movement repeatedly, and thus, they are a must for Bitcoin’s next major move. Since Bitcoin is unlikely to convincingly break above $71,000, the asset is likely going to stay in its current consolidation scenario, Brandt believes. The recent rally in Bitcoin did NOT disturb the 7-month sequence of lower highs and lower lows. $BTC Only a close above 71,000 confirmed by a new ATH will indicate that the trend from the Nov 2022 low remains in force pic.twitter.com/lFO9A20VPD — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 2, 2024 Roman is also one of the very popular crypto traders with a similar opinion. He noticed that any increases in volume along with price drops usually prove to confirm a strong downtrend. Roman believes that Bitcoin will test the $55,000-$57,000 range before any hope of reversal, which again puts emphasis on struggling to break through at those resistance levels. Moving Averages And Market Uncertainty Bitcoin’s 8-week simple moving average (SMA) has been residing at a level of around $60,526 and has served as resistance recently on the price charts. The price of BTC has hung off that line for a while, which indicates the fact that market participants haven’t really decided if they are buying or selling. It hasn’t traded too low below it to find good strength in order to move up either. For volatility, the Average True Range of Bitcoin is at 5,756. That’s a relatively small level of volatility within the market. That only means the market can generate large moves, but hasn’t built an extreme level of volatility just yet. Dealers are watching closely for these indicators because they could signal where Bitcoin will break next. Geopolitics Tensions And Market Sentiment The Middle East tension is yet another strain in the cryptocurrency market. Of course, Bitcoin has started to surge in volatility alongside growing concerns of global instability. The price of Bitcoin over the last 24 hours has gone down by 3% to reach $61,380. Actually, that fall was part of the general sell-off among cryptocurrencies within which the entire market capitalization went down by 7.6% over two days. Bitcoin and crypto always tank when there are geopolitical fears, unlike precious metals. That confirms my long-held belief that crypto is not a safe-haven. It’s yet another risk asset just like high-flying tech stocks. $BTC $GLD pic.twitter.com/SBLgLgdpKB — Jesse Colombo (@TheBubbleBubble) October 1, 2024 According to Jesse Colombo, a well-known market analyst, Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, usually worsen during periods of geopolitical instability. As he points out: “Bitcoin and crypto always tank when there are geopolitical fears, unlike precious metals.” The history was mainly the same with Bitcoin when global tensions reached their peak. It would appear the current market is no different from this historical precedent. Related Reading: Could XRP See A 360% Surge By Christmas? Experts Think So QCP Capital remains optimistic, despite the bearish sentiment that pours out from some corners. This is a token of positivity: sell-offs from a few days ago appear shallow, and one might expect investors to remain interested in risker assets, such as Bitcoin. Similarly, Michal van de Poppe predicts a retest of the $60,000 support level, suggesting the market could reverse course if that level holds.

Loosening of monetary policy could help Bitcoin miners adapt faster to the post-halving landscape, which may stabilize the hash rate and profitability. Lower interest rates can also reduce miners' operating expenses, encouraging them to hold rather than sell Bitcoin, thus supporting higher asset prices. BITO offers a unique high-yield strategy through Bitcoin futures with a high dividend yield, despite share price volatility and income not increasing smoothly like for dividend growth ETFs. Capital appreciation is lower than for spot ETFs due to the income strategy, but dividends paid have tripled from 2023 to 2024, while there has been no capital erosion during this period. Since I last covered the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) on July 24, it has lost about 13%. At that time, I had a hold position based on the consolidation of the mining industry following the halving event. Still, I also mentioned that the Federal Reserve cutting rates would benefit the share price. This is indeed what happened since the beginning of September as charted below, as a result of the market beginning to price in a more dovish U.S. Central Bank, eventually culminating in a 50 basis point rate cut last week. Some impetus was also received by stimulus measures emanating from China. Data by YCharts This thesis aims to build a bullish case based firstly on how lower rates will benefit miners, as key stakeholders in the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ecosystem, namely to HODL more coins instead of selling them and pressurizing asset prices downwards. Second, there is the income rationale for an ETF that leverages the dynamics around Bitcoin futures contracts to generate juicy dividend yields. First, five months after halving, I provide an update on how the mining industry stands. The Post-Halving Landscape Shows Adjustment Continues Since the April 19 halving event, miners have faced challenges given the block reward was reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, putting pressure on profitability. In response, some have introduced new ASIC models or specialized hardware customized for cryptocurrency mining as part of a longer-term strategy of continually upgrading their hardware to become more energy efficient. Others have optimized existing computing machines through firmware (software) updates to produce more while using less KW of power. Looking further, some have migrated their operations to locations within the U.S. or in other parts of the world to benefit from lower energy costs, which helps them stay competitive in the face of lower rewards.​ To obtain an idea of how the industry has fared, it makes sense to study the evolution of the hash rate, which represents the total computational power in the Bitcoin network at any one time. As shown in the chart below, this metric has not maintained its progression after April, showing some miners have cut production because of higher operating expenses while others with weaker balance sheets have ceased production altogether or ended up being acquired as I explained in a previous article as part of the ongoing consolidation whereby smaller troubled players are being acquired by larger ones. Subsequently, July and August saw a slight reacceleration of the hash rate which at times exceeded the 720 million mark, but overall mining activity again decelerated from September. Data by YCharts This can be mainly attributed to two factors, the first being seasonal variations whereby in the summer months (July and August) mining farms can benefit from low-cost renewable energy, namely hydroelectricity due to higher rainfall. Logically, there was a drop in hash rate in September, accentuated by newer ASIC models coming online as more miners have been decommissioning older and less profitable equipment. Second, there is also Bitcoin's mining difficulty (above chart) to contend with, which is adjusted every two weeks (after every 2016 block) to prevent blocks from being mined too fast. The problem is the difficulty staying above the 85 mark despite the hash rate declining in June, which is abnormal and explained by the adjustment lag. This may be temporary but is enough to reduce miner profitability, with the situation made worse by Bitcoin's price not rising sustainably in the meantime. This resulted in some miners reducing participation (by stopping activity), bringing down the hash rate, which hints that the post-having adaptation is still ongoing. Lower Interest Rates Can Help Support Asset Prices Thus, in the current landscape, mining has become more difficult and the activity is less rewarding (profitable). Now, this can change, but not necessarily through higher asset prices or lowering the mining difficulty. Another option is to lower the operating expenses​, enabled by lower rates. Looking deeper, this can take the form of lower interest payments on loans offsetting some of the effects of higher electricity costs, which constitute a significant portion of mining costs given Bitcoin production accounts for about 0.5% of global energy consumption. Additionally, with lower borrowing costs, there are more refinancing options that can provide miners with financial relief, crucial to navigating the current high-competition environment where they have to compete harder to validate a block while earning less in the process. Thus, lower rates should contribute to mining operations remaining viable without having to offload (sell) the Bitcoins produced. Subsequently, by HODLing more Bitcoins (than selling on the open market), supply gets reduced, in turn, supporting the value of the cryptocurrency. Two other factors that can help are inflation having been brought down below 2.5%, which helps businesses in general to reduce costs, and massive stimulus by the Chinese government. Therefore, more favorable monetary policy on both sides of the Pacific Ocean could trigger a rally in crypto prices as broader risk-on sentiment emerges. In this case, learning from 2020 when the U.S. federal funds effective rate was drastically lowered, BTC climbed by around 80% ($5K to $9K) as per the chart below. Data by YCharts However, at that time, monetary conditions were less tight as the Fed fund rates were lowered from 1.58% in February to 0.60% in April, while today, they remain at 5% despite the cuts. Also, according to Mr. Powell, there is no preset course for future cuts, meaning rates will remain on the higher side for the foreseeable future. In the same vein, the above chart shows no sustained upside in BTC in the immediate aftermath of the Fed cutting rates, meaning that volatility is likely to persist as miners continue to adjust operations. Thus, considering the above risks, I have a modest target of $71.4K for BTC or its highest resistance level post-halving. This would mean a return of 18.2% from the $60.4K at the time of writing. Now, considering that as a Bitcoin-linked ETF, BITO's value depends on BTC as shown below, it could reproduce this return resulting in the ETF rising to $20.6 (17.4 x 1.182) based on its current share price of $17.4. ProShares To justify this bullish posture, there is BITO's income rationale. Annual Income Has Surged By More Than Three Times Amid Volatility For this purpose, based on the dividend history on Seeking Alpha, and except for Jan 2024 as shown in the table below, the fund managers at ProShares have been paying dividends regularly since February 2023. Still, this does not qualify for consistency because the amount paid has not increased gradually as for dividend growth funds. Along the same lines, BITO does not guarantee fixed returns on capital since yields can fluctuate widely based on the performance of Bitcoin futures, the fund's underlying asset, and the way ProShares calculates dividends. For clarification purposes, BITO is futures-based, signifying it does not hold actual Bitcoins but trades in futures contracts which indirectly provides price exposure to Bitcoin. In short, there are risks of not getting paid and one should not expect stable income. Table built using data from Seeking Alpha Shifting to a positive tone, its strategy to capitalize on Bitcoin futures has delivered on the income front, as it offers a forward dividend yield of 66% , but this can change rapidly depending on the share price. Still, in practice, this has translated into payouts of $3.1 in 2023 and $9.84 until September this year as shown above, which totals nearly $13. Therefore, for income seekers who are ready to embrace this rather unique way of capitalizing on crypto while facing volatility, BITO's high-yield strategy is appropriate. As an example, someone who had bought the shares in January 2023 at $10.59 each would already have enjoyed capital gains of $8 in September this year as illustrated below while netting dividend gains of $13. This means total gains of nearly $21 or nearly two times the amount invested within 21 months. Table built using data from Seeking Alpha However, on the cautious side, its share price has fluctuated widely, and the income provided isn't necessarily guaranteed for the future. For this purpose, BITO did not start paying dividends right after it was incepted in November 2021, but only as of February 2023. Therefore, someone who had invested in November 2021 would have suffered from a capital loss of $23.24 as shown above, which is significant and is only partially offset by the income of around $13. Fewer Capital Gains Compared To A Spot ETF But Has Still Appreciated While Generating Income Consequently, for those holding BITO's shares, one solution is to adopt an averaging down strategy and buy at current prices. The reason is BITO's unique approach consisting of managing (buying and selling) futures to derive monthly distributions from the profits earned has resulted in dividends rising sharply from 2023 to September 2024 (on an annual basis). Moreover, it does not offer the same level of capital appreciation when compared to the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) as shown below because of the roll costs associated with making profits by continuously purchasing longer-term contracts and selling short-term ones. Also, it charges fees of 0.95%, compared to 0.12% for IBIT. Data by YCharts Still, despite paying three times more dividends from January to September 2024 than in 2023, BITO's current share price of $17.14 remains well above (or around 64%) its January 2023 share price of $10.59. Therefore, its strategy of regularly paying dividends has not resulted in its price decaying over time, like for some options trading strategies. On the contrary, during the past 20 months (February 2023 to September 2024), BITO's income strategy has delivered significant value while also offering price appreciation, all amid Bitcoin volatility. Finally, while there are volatility risks associated with investing in anything related to crypto as miners continue to adjust to the post-halving landscape, a more dovish monetary policy should prove helpful to support the mining ecosystem and reduce the likelihood of miner capitulation or selling their Bitcoin reserves to cover their costs resulting in asset prices becoming under pressure.",BTC-USD|IBIT|BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MINING|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-03 11:45:00

Expert Points To Key Indicator,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-last-big-drop-expert-key-indicator/,"In his latest video analysis titled “BITCOIN’S One Indicator Signaling LAST Major Dip,” Dan Gambardello, a noted crypto analyst with 370,000 subscribers on YouTube, delves into the latest price action of Bitcoin to forecast what could potentially be the final major dip. After dropping as low as $60,000 on Wednesday, the fear of another deeper price crash has grabbed the Bitcoin market. Why This Could Be The Final Leg Down For Bitcoin Gambardello emphasizes the significance of the daily and six-hour charts. On the daily chart, Bitcoin is currently testing the 50-day moving average, a level that often serves as a litmus test for short-term market sentiment. However, the analyst’s main focus is on the six-hour chart’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator used to measure the speed and change of price movements, which has hit oversold levels. According to Gambardello, the RSI reaching oversold territory is traditionally viewed as a bullish signal, potentially indicating an approaching end to the current price dip. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Skyrocket To $118,000 By Year-End: Here’s Why “The bottom is actually, I think, close. There could be some type of capitulation in the very short term, but I think there could be a very strong bounce after that happens,” Gambardello noted, suggesting that despite the immediate market turmoil following the Israel-Iran conflict news, the fundamentals point towards an eventual robust recovery. Via X, Gambardello added, “Nothing like a 6 hour oversold RSI at the beginning of bull season. Also great during bull season.” This assertion is grounded in his analysis of past market behaviors during similar conditions, reinforcing the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Drawing parallels to historical data, Gambardello highlights the behavioral trends of Bitcoin in previous Octobers, noting a pattern of initial declines followed by strong recoveries by the end of the month. “October will close green. It’s always [like this] with the dip. People are just freaking out. I guess that’s it, but this gives us a little time. We’re getting all these red candles going into October, give us another week, maybe even two and we could get a pump, a breakout to the upside to end October,” Gambardello claims. Related Reading: Will Israel-Iran Conflict Push Bitcoin Further Down? Analysts Discuss Further deepening the analysis, Gambardello discusses the potential scenarios around Bitcoin’s lower trend line, a recurrent support level over the past six months. He speculates that if Bitcoin approaches this trend line again, it could effectively serve as a robust support level, potentially marking the last significant downturn before a sustained upward trend. Notably, one final touch of the trendline could bring down the BTC price as low as $50,000. However, Gambardello thinks that this is a less likely scenario as the 6-hour RSI has already hit oversold territory while BTC is currently bouncing off the 50-day moving average. Moreover, Gambardello refers to Bitcoin’s performance in past halving years, which are typically followed by bull markets, as seen in 2016 and 2020. Gambardello suggests that the current year could follow a similar trajectory. “This is a Halving year. We’ve seen what’s happened in Halving years in 2020 and 2016 in October. Is it going to repeat?” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $60,899.

CleanSpark's capacity expansion and substantial Bitcoin holdings enhance its competitive positioning and potential correlation with Bitcoin's price. The stock's valuation against Bitcoin has contracted without fundamental reasons, suggesting a potential upside as this contraction unwinds. I reiterate a Strong Buy rating for CleanSpark, anticipating significant returns if Bitcoin breaks out of its bullish consolidation pattern. The ongoing consolidation in Bitcoin has lasted longer than I would have expected pre-halving, but we have to trade the market we have, not the market we want. That is quite the case with Bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK), which I last covered six months ago. The stock was in the mid-teens at the time, testing key support around $15. I liked CleanSpark then, and while it bounced around some, it ultimately failed that support level a few months later. CleanSpark shares have very clearly broken down and look bearish, but I believe the valuation supports the bulls that are brave enough to take the plunge. Keep in mind that short interest is very high on CleanSpark at about 18%, so it's a volatile stock, to say the least. However, if you are interested in owning CleanSpark, now may just be the time to consider building that position. Let's dig in. A bearish breakdown, but nearing support again There's no denying that the stock broke down in a massive way in August. The absolutely critical support level of $14/$15 gave way and the stock never looked back. StockCharts Shorts have pressed the stock down to under $9 again, a level that was previously not seen since the early stages of this year. The stock is below the moving averages, the PPO is well into negative territory, and the RSI hasn't seen 60+ since July. In short, there's nothing bullish here. What's really interesting is that while CleanSpark's chart looks awful , that of Bitcoin itself actually looks pretty good. StockCharts This is a three-year weekly chart, and we can see some very bullish developments. I see a bull flag that has formed, which is comprised of the ""pole"" from summer of 2023 to the peak in spring of 2024, as well as the ""flag"" that has formed in the channel I've drawn above. A bull flag is a continuation pattern, so as long as the flag doesn't break to the downside, we should plan on seeing higher prices in the months to come. On the bullish side of the ledger, the weekly PPO has been reset and is stabilizing near the centerline. That has coincided with two tests of the 50-week moving average (in blue above), and I fully expect we will not break the 50-week moving average. On the charting front, CleanSpark looks awful while Bitcoin looks like it is nearing the end of a bullish consolidation. What to do then? Let's take a look at the fundamental picture on CleanSpark first. Building capacity (and profitability) CleanSpark has spent years building its capacity to mine Bitcoin, and very much continues to do so. Investor presentation The company is the second-largest Bitcoin miner as measured by realized hash rate, which now stands at over 26 EH/s. While that alone is not a reason to own the stock, Bitcoin mining is all about scale and efficiency, and being a huge player is a big head start towards efficiency. Investor presentation The company expects 32 EH/s by the end of the year as it continues to bring capacity online via acquisitions and organic growth. That growth will continue to come in handy because the difficulty in mining Bitcoin is growing all the time. CoinWarz This is a one-year chart, and we can see that - on the bright side for miners - difficulty has been stable since the halving in April. It climbed significantly into that event, however, so year-on-year, mining is still much more difficult than it was. That is the long-term trend, of course, so adding capacity simply helps to offset this rising difficulty. However, CleanSpark is adding capacity quickly enough it can both overcome this rising difficulty, and mine more Bitcoin over time. Its competitive positioning from a scale perspective against the other miners makes it attractive, in my view. The other wrinkle here is that CleanSpark is not just a miner; it now has a pretty sizable hoard of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Investor presentation The company owns almost 8,000 coins, which are worth roughly half a billion dollars today. Given this, as the company continues to mine Bitcoin and hold them on the balance sheet, its share price should become ever more correlated to the price of Bitcoin itself. And with the balance sheet we see below, CleanSpark has the ability to hold (rather than sell) most of the Bitcoin it mines. Investor presentation This slide is a bit of an eye chart, but the important bits are the stockholders' equity (~$1.4 billion) and basically non-existent long-term liabilities. CleanSpark's balance sheet really couldn't look much better, so it has little to no financing risk. With some miners/owners of Bitcoin using significant leverage, CleanSpark stands apart in this way. What about the valuation? This is where things get pretty interesting from my perspective. CleanSpark's price chart is terrible, and there's no point in arguing about that. However, with CleanSpark being a massive player in mining, having ~$1.4 billion in book value on its balance sheet, and owning a large number of coins, the below chart is slightly confusing. StockCharts Since the middle of July, CleanSpark's price against that of Bitcoin has fallen 54% . The share price has fallen about 56% from that point, meaning the entirety of the decline in the share price has been due to a valuation contraction against Bitcoin. I don't see any fundamental reason for this decline to have occurred based on the above discussion, although we do know that these valuation boom/bust cycles do occur from time to time. I cannot help but think this contraction is going to unwind at some point and that it will drive an upside in the stock. Finally, on the valuation front, this is the same chart of CleanSpark's share price against that of Bitcoin, but for five years to give us a long-term perspective. StockCharts I've put a line where the ratio stands today, and we can see that for nearly all of the last five years, CleanSpark's valuation against Bitcoin has been much higher than it is today. Does that guarantee we will get a higher share price? Obviously not. However, does it put the odds in the favor of the bulls? I believe it does. The stock is still a long candidate If we wrap all of this up, I see a stock with an extremely attractive valuation, but also very high short interest. The ~$15 level on the price chart will be tough to get through if/when the stock gets there, but at under $9 today, there's a lot of room between here and there. On the downside, we have support near $7 and $8, so we'll see if that holds. The company's scale in an industry where scale is absolutely critical is a plus point for the bulls. I also believe the valuation as measured by the share price against Bitcoin is a big plus for those that are bullish. We'll see what happens, but if I'm right about Bitcoin breaking out of its bull flag, and that CleanSpark's valuation has much more upside potential than downside from here, we could see CleanSpark produce some pretty spectacular returns from this point. I'm reiterating a Strong Buy, but keep in mind this one is very volatile and not suitable for all risk tolerances.",CLSK,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-03 12:56:41
