MAGACOINFINANCE.COM Could Be the Answer!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-750-turn-into-1-2-million-magacoinfinance-com-could-be-the-answer/,"In a market known for once-in-a-generation wins, timing is everything. Catching the right project at the right moment is how legends are made. And now, early investors are wondering whether MAGACOINFINANCE.COM could be that next major play—the kind of early entry that shifts portfolios entirely. There’s no question this token is attracting serious attention. From organic growth to mounting analyst discussions, this isn’t another project trying to go viral overnight. It’s one that’s quietly gaining power—and smart investors are noticing. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Steam While Others Stall Not every token launch is worth watching—but this one is. MAGACOINFINANCE has been steadily building momentum with real traction: growing wallet counts, strong retention rates, and increasing visibility in investor forums. It’s not relying on influencers or hype cycles. Instead, it’s executing with purpose—developing a community-first ecosystem that’s attracting early believers and long-term thinkers alike. There’s a seriousness to its rollout that sets it apart from the typical short-burst memecoins. More importantly, it’s doing this at a moment when the market is hungry for new momentum. With attention shifting toward early-stage entries that could define the next run, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing right in the spotlight. Other Solid Projects—But With Limited Early Entry: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin Uniswap remains a key player in the decentralized exchange space. Its model for token swaps and liquidity pools has changed how people trade—but it’s now a well-known giant, with much of its explosive upside already realized. Polkadot is doing valuable work around interoperability and multi-chain scaling. It’s vital to Web3 innovation—but as a large-cap asset, its growth arc is longer and more gradual. Bitcoin Cash continues to serve those focused on simple, peer-to-peer digital payments. It has strong utility and global adoption—but few would describe it as an “undiscovered” asset. Litecoin is one of the oldest altcoins still standing. It remains relevant, especially for fast, low-cost transactions—but it’s also fully matured in its current form. These projects are dependable—but they’re no longer in their early days. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just beginning its ascent. Final Thought Can $750 really become $1.2 million? It depends on the project. It depends on timing. And it depends on execution. Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is hitting all three. The structure is there. The interest is growing. And the window is still wide open—for now. If history has taught us anything, it’s that those who move early often move the farthest.

Lesser-known yet promising, these coins are drawing attention from savvy investors looking for substantial returns. This article will delve into what makes them standout picks for the future. FET Weekly Surge Amid Long-Term Bearish Drift FET gained roughly 21% over the past month, with an impressive weekly boost of 38% highlighting rapid recoveries. A six-month decline of 44% signals a deeper bearish sentiment over time. Price swings have been notable, with brief rallies countering extended downturns. The movement suggests a volatile market that has seen both recovery and substantial pullback. Current trading sees prices mostly between $0.32 and $0.68, facing resistance at $0.91 and a second peak around $1.26. Support remains anchored at $0.19. Bulls show strength in the recent surge, yet the broader downtrend calls for caution. Trades near the $0.91 resistance or dips toward $0.19 could offer tactical entry points. Hedera HBAR: Strong Rally Over Six Months, Minor Monthly Setback Over the last month, Hedera declined by about 5.31%, while over a six-month span, it surged nearly 288.19%. Price movement showed periods of short-term weakness offset by strong long-term recovery, marking a volatile yet promising trend. Technical measures indicated mixed sentiment during this period, highlighting the coin's ability to rebound despite recent dips. Current price action sees Hedera trading between approximately $0.1166 and $0.2485. Key support is around $0.0705, while resistance levels are near $0.3343 and $0.4662. Despite some bearish signals in oscillators, the moderate RSI and moving average recommendations suggest controlled buyer strength. Traders may find opportunities within these levels, depending on which side gains momentum. Ethena's Mixed Recovery Amid Volatility Last month ENA recorded a decline of 16.55%, while the week surged by 28.57%. The six-month change remained nearly flat with a 0.87% drop. Price adjustments have been evident, with a brief rebound contrasting against the overall downward monthly trend. Performance reflects intermittent recoveries against a generally sluggish backdrop over the longer term. Current price hovers near a support level at $0.24 and resistance at $0.53, with additional levels at $0.09 and $0.68. Bulls have shown strength in the recent week, but the trend lacks clarity. Trading within these levels may offer short-term opportunities, focusing on support for potential purchases while being cautious about breaches near the upper resistance levels. Conclusion FET , HBAR , and ENA show significant promise for long-term growth by 2025. These coins have unique attributes that could drive their value higher. FET focuses on AI and autonomous agents, which are gaining traction. HBAR offers impressive transaction speeds and security. ENA aims to revolutionize the gaming industry with its blockchain technology. Each of these coins targets a specific niche, increasing their potential for success. Investors may find these options intriguing as they search for promising opportunities. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

43806473,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=738362,1745622002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43806473.jpeg,"Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Is Mirroring 2017 Cycle, “$27 Then $120”",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-mirroring-2017-cycle/,"XRP is gearing up for a surge to $120, according to popular crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO. Taking to social media platform X, the analyst shared a fresh chart detailing a bullish outlook for XRP, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is retracing a path similar to its explosive 2017 rally. This time, however, the trajectory could be even more dramatic, as the chart accompanying his post outlines a long-term Elliott Wave formation that points first to $27 and eventually to a staggering $120 price tag. Echoes of 2017: XRP Retracing Cycle That Took Price To All-Time High The 2017 bull cycle is one of the most iconic periods in XRP’s history. It was during this phase that the price of XRP rallied from under $0.01 to an all-time high of $3.84, driven by a broader crypto market bubble, exchange listings, and speculation surrounding Ripple’s adoption among financial institutions. Related Reading: XRP Outflows Cross $300 Million In April, Why The Price Could Crash Further The rally followed a classic Elliott Wave impulse structure, with five distinct waves characterized by short consolidations before each major leg upward. By early 2018, the bubble had popped, and XRP, like the rest of the crypto market, entered into a prolonged bear phase. EGRAG CRYPTO’s post implies that XRP is now following a similar pattern to the one in 2017. Particularly, the analyst noted that XRP is currently in the process of forming its second wave, which is a retracement of the bullish impulse Wave 1. This impulse Wave 1 is characterized by XRP’s surge to $3.4 between Q4 2024 and January 2025. Wave 2, on the other hand, is characterized by the price correction since January, which has sent the XRP price back to trading around $2. Now, the next step is for wave 3 to begin formation. Based on traditional Elliott Wave ratios, this wave tends to extend aggressively, often measuring 161.8% of Wave 1. According to EGRAG, XRP’s price is expected to end Wave 3 above double digits sometime in summer 2025. It is at this point that the analyst predicted a top out around $27, nearly ten times its current trading price. Following that, his outlook anticipates a lengthy Wave 4 correction lasting several years, setting the stage for a final Wave 5 extension that could see XRP break into triple digits. The $120 Long-Term Target In his projection, the $27 level will mark the completion of Wave 3, followed by a Wave 4 correction that could potentially span three years. This correction would be brutal and cause the XRP price to reach a bottom around $5.50. Related Reading: XRP Price In April: The Lows, The Highs, And Final Blast-Off After this consolidation phase, the ensuing Wave 5 formation will catapult XRP to new highs again and go on the same measured move as Wave 1 or 61.8% of Wave 1 + Wave 3. If this plays out as EGRAG expects, XRP would break into triple-digit territory and ultimately peak around $120. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.19, up by 2% in the past 24 hours. Reaching the $27 and $120 price targets would translate to 1,132% and 5,380% increases, respectively, from the current price.

43806548,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152918,1745622176,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Canadian Dollar Surge: UBS Becomes Bullish on CAD Forecast as Tariff Risks Diminish,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/canadian-dollar-ubs-forecast/,"For those tracking the global financial landscape, especially the interplay between traditional markets and digital assets, shifts in major currency forecasts are significant. A notable development recently came from UBS, a major global financial institution, which has expressed a more bullish stance on the Canadian Dollar . This change in perspective is primarily attributed to an easing of previously looming tariff impact threats, suggesting a potentially brighter CAD forecast ahead. Understanding the forces that shape currency values is key, whether you’re trading forex or simply observing the broader economic environment that influences all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. UBS’s updated view on the Loonie (as the Canadian Dollar is often called) provides valuable insight into how macro factors like trade policy can directly influence currency strength. What’s Driving the Positive UBS Forecast for the Canadian Dollar? UBS’s revised outlook isn’t arbitrary. It stems from a careful analysis of evolving trade dynamics, particularly concerning the relationship between Canada and its major trading partners, most notably the United States. Here’s a breakdown of the core reasons behind their more optimistic UBS forecast : Easing Tariff Tensions: The primary driver is the perceived reduction in the risk of new, significant tariffs being imposed on Canadian goods, particularly by the U.S. Past threats related to various sectors created uncertainty and weighed on the CAD. A de-escalation of these tensions removes a key overhang. Improved Economic Stability: Reduced trade friction typically supports economic stability and growth prospects for export-reliant economies like Canada. This improved outlook makes the Canadian Dollar a more attractive currency. Commodity Price Support: As a major commodity exporter, the CAD is often influenced by global commodity prices, especially oil. While not the sole factor, a stable or improving global economic picture, partly enabled by reduced trade wars, can indirectly support commodity demand and prices, offering a tailwind for the CAD. Monetary Policy Expectations: While not the focus of this specific UBS update regarding tariffs, evolving expectations around the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy also play a role in the overall CAD forecast . However, the tariff narrative is currently a significant external factor influencing the outlook. These factors collectively paint a picture of reduced external risk for the Canadian economy, leading UBS to upgrade its assessment of the Canadian Dollar ‘s potential performance. How Does Easing Tariff Impact Influence the CAD Forecast? Tariffs act like taxes on imported goods. When countries impose tariffs on each other, it can disrupt supply chains, increase costs for businesses and consumers, and reduce overall trade volume. For an export-oriented economy like Canada, access to key markets without punitive tariffs is crucial for economic health. The threat of tariffs creates uncertainty, which can deter investment and negatively impact a country’s currency value as investors become wary of potential economic headwinds. Conversely, when these threats subside, it removes a layer of risk premium that was previously priced into the currency. Consider the direct effects of a reduced tariff impact : Increased Export Certainty: Canadian exporters face fewer potential barriers and costs when selling to key markets, supporting export volumes and revenues. Improved Business Confidence: Businesses are more likely to invest and expand when the trade environment is stable and predictable. Attracting Foreign Investment: A stable economic and trade environment makes Canada a more appealing destination for foreign capital, increasing demand for the Canadian Dollar . This positive feedback loop contributes to a stronger economic outlook, which in turn supports the currency’s value. This is a core reason behind the more positive UBS forecast . What Does This Mean for the Forex Outlook and Beyond? For participants in the forex market, a bullish CAD forecast from a major institution like UBS is a significant signal. It suggests potential for CAD appreciation against other currencies, particularly those less exposed to or benefiting from similar de-escalations, or those facing their own economic challenges. While this specific update focuses on the Canadian Dollar and the tariff impact , it highlights a broader principle: global macro events profoundly influence currency markets. Traders often use such institutional forecasts as one piece of their analysis puzzle when formulating their trading strategies. For those whose primary interest is in cryptocurrencies, understanding the traditional forex outlook is still valuable. Major currency movements can impact global liquidity, investor sentiment, and the flow of capital across different asset classes. For example, a stronger CAD might reflect global risk appetite or specific regional economic health, factors that can indirectly ripple into the crypto market. Here are some potential implications: CAD Cross Pairs: Traders might look at CAD pairs like CAD/JPY, CAD/CHF, or even USD/CAD (where CAD strength would mean a falling pair) for trading opportunities based on the improved UBS forecast . Economic Barometer: The CAD is often seen as a proxy for global growth sentiment due to Canada’s commodity exports. Its strength, partly driven by reduced trade risks, could signal broader optimism. Portfolio Context: Investors with diversified portfolios holding both traditional assets and cryptocurrencies should be aware of how currency fluctuations can affect the overall value of their holdings, especially if they hold assets denominated in different currencies. The improved CAD forecast is a specific example of how macroeconomic factors translate into currency market expectations. It underscores the need for market participants to stay informed about global economic and political developments. Are There Still Risks to the CAD Forecast? While the immediate outlook from UBS is more positive due to easing tariff concerns, no currency forecast is without risk. Several factors could still impact the Canadian Dollar : Re-emergence of Trade Tensions: Geopolitical shifts or changes in trade policy direction could potentially reignite tariff threats. Global Economic Slowdown: A significant downturn in the global economy would likely reduce demand for commodities, negatively impacting the CAD regardless of tariff issues. Domestic Factors: Inflation trends, Bank of Canada policy decisions, housing market dynamics, and political stability within Canada all play a role in the currency’s performance. Commodity Price Volatility: Sharp declines in key commodity prices, like oil, could weaken the CAD. Therefore, while the UBS forecast is currently bullish, it’s essential to consider the full spectrum of potential influences on the Canadian Dollar and the broader forex outlook . Conclusion: A Brighter Horizon for the Canadian Dollar? UBS’s shift to a more bullish stance on the Canadian Dollar , driven by the easing of tariff impact fears, marks a significant positive signal for the currency. This development highlights the critical link between international trade policy and currency valuation. A reduced risk of trade barriers improves Canada’s economic stability outlook, making the CAD more attractive to investors and supporting a positive CAD forecast . For those interested in the broader financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding these traditional market movements provides essential context. While the UBS forecast focuses on the CAD, it serves as a reminder that macroeconomic factors and geopolitical events are powerful forces shaping asset values globally. Keeping an eye on the evolving forex outlook , especially for major currencies like the Canadian Dollar , remains a valuable part of navigating the complex financial landscape.

Institutional investor demand is back, suggesting that the bearish trend could be over. Select altcoins could break above their respective overhead resistance levels if Bitcoin remains strong Bitcoin ( BTC ) bulls are trying to sustain the price above $95,000, but they are likely to face significant resistance from the bears. Will buyers succeed in pushing the price toward the psychologically important level of $100,000, or is a pullback around the corner? That is the big question on the traders’ minds. A positive sign is that inflows for US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have increased since April 21, per Farside Investors data. Coinbase Institutional head of strategy John D’Agostino said in a recent interview with CNBC that several institutions purchased Bitcoin in April to hedge against currency inflation and macro uncertainty as Bitcoin mirrors “the characteristics of gold.

One of the red flags is that the sentiment , as measured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, slipped from a score of 72 out of 100 on April 23 to 60 on April 25, though Bitcoin is trading close to $95,000. Select analysts expect Bitcoin to pullback toward $87,000 . Could Bitcoin sustain above $95,000, triggering buying in altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin has been trading near the $95,000 level, suggesting that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate a move higher. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day exponential moving average ($87,437) is sloping up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the overbought zone, signaling that the bulls are in command. A close above $95,000 could drive the BTC/USDT pair to $100,000. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $100,000, but if the bulls do not allow the price to dip below $95,000, the prospects of a break above the overhead resistance increase. The pair may then climb to $107,000. The bears will have to yank the price below the moving averages to regain control. Ether price prediction Ether’s ( ETH ) relief rally is facing resistance at the 50-day SMA ($1,812), but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($1,696). ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA is flattish, but the RSI has jumped into the positive zone, signaling a slight advantage to the bulls. If the 50-day SMA is scaled, the ETH/USDT pair could reach the breakdown level of $2,111. The bears may pose a strong challenge at $2,111, but if the bulls overcome it, the pair could skyrocket to $2,550. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If they can pull it off, the pair could tumble toward $1,537. XRP price prediction XRP ( XRP ) has been trading near the 50-day SMA ($2.18) for the past two days, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView A minor positive for the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to skid below the 20-day EMA ($2.13). The bulls will again try to propel the XRP/USDT pair to the resistance line, which is a critical level to watch out for. The pair could rally to $3 if buyers pierce the resistance line. On the downside, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the bears remain in charge. The downside momentum could pick up on a break below $2. The pair may then plummet to $1.60. BNB price prediction BNB ( BNB ) turned down from $620 but is taking support at the moving averages. This suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Buyers will try to push the price above $620. If they manage to do that, the BNB/USDT pair may rally to $644. Sellers will try to stall the up move at the $644 level, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could soar to $680. This bullish view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. That could sink the pair to $566, indicating that the markets have rejected the breakout above the downtrend line. Solana price prediction Solana ( SOL ) is struggling to stay above the $153 level, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA ($136) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate that the bulls are in control. If buyers push and maintain the price above $153, the SOL/USDT pair could jump to $180. The moving averages are the crucial support on the downside. A break and close below the 50-day SMA ($129) suggests that the pair could consolidate between $153 and $110 for a few days. Dogecoin price prediction Dogecoin ( DOGE ) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($0.16) on April 24, indicating that the bulls are buying on dips. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The DOGE/USDT pair could reach $0.21, which is a crucial resistance to watch out for. If buyers pierce the $0.21 level, the pair will complete a double-bottom pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective of $0.28. Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, the pair may remain range-bound between $0.21 and $0.14 for a while. The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears on a break below the $0.14 support.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA ($0.65) has started to turn up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the upside. The ADA/USDT pair could rally to $0.83, where the bears may step in. Any pullback is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it signals a bullish sentiment. Sellers will have to drag the price below the 20-day EMA to sink the pair to $0.58.

A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA increases the likelihood of a break above $16. The LINK/USDT pair may then climb to the resistance line of the descending channel pattern. A break above the channel signals a potential trend change. Sellers will have to tug the price below the moving averages to regain control.

Alternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, the pair could remain stuck inside the $23.50 to $15.27 range for a few days.

43806759,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152920,1745622636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial: China Denies US Tariff Talks Amidst Trade Relations Uncertainty,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/china-denies-us-tariffs/,"Geopolitical tensions and trade dynamics between major global powers like China and the United States often send ripples across financial markets, including the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Understanding these interactions is crucial for navigating market sentiment. Recent statements from Beijing regarding China US tariffs have added another layer to the complex relationship between the two nations, prompting market observers to assess the potential implications. What’s the Latest on China US Tariffs? According to a report based on information from Solid Intel on X, the Chinese Embassy recently stated that China and the U.S. are currently not engaged in any tariff discussions . This statement directly addresses speculation or potential confusion surrounding ongoing trade dialogue between the two economic giants. Furthermore, the embassy urged the United States to cease creating confusion regarding the status of these talks. This highlights a desire from the Chinese side for clear communication and a definitive stance on trade policy matters. The denial comes amidst persistent underlying tensions that have characterized China US trade relations for several years. While official high-level meetings do occur, the specific issue of tariffs, imposed during previous trade disputes, remains a significant point of contention and negotiation. A Look Back: The Context of US China Trade Talks To fully grasp the significance of China’s recent statement, it’s helpful to revisit the history of US China trade talks . The late 2010s saw a significant escalation in trade tensions, leading to tit-for-tat tariff impositions by both countries on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods. These actions disrupted supply chains, impacted various industries, and created considerable global trade uncertainty . While a “Phase One” trade deal was signed in early 2020, it left many of the original tariffs in place and addressed only some structural issues. Since then, discussions have been sporadic, and a comprehensive resolution to the tariff situation has remained elusive. The tariffs continue to affect businesses and consumers in both countries, making any news about potential talks or lack thereof highly relevant to market expectations. Key aspects of the historical trade tensions include: Tariff Impositions: Broad tariffs placed on goods ranging from electronics and machinery to agricultural products. Focus Areas: Disputes over intellectual property rights, forced technology transfer, trade imbalances, and state subsidies for industries. Market Volatility: Periods of intense trade negotiations or escalations often correlated with increased volatility in global stock markets and commodity prices. Why Does This Matter for Global Markets and Crypto? The state of China US trade relations is a major factor influencing global economic outlook and market sentiment. When the two largest economies are at odds over trade, it creates uncertainty that can dampen investment, disrupt international commerce, and slow economic growth. This uncertainty doesn’t stay confined to traditional markets; it often spills over into the cryptocurrency space. Here’s how developments in US-China trade can impact crypto: Risk Sentiment: Increased trade tensions or lack of clarity can heighten risk aversion among investors. In such environments, some investors may move away from perceived riskier assets, which can include cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to price drops. Conversely, de-escalation could boost overall market confidence, benefiting crypto. Macroeconomic Impact: Trade disputes can affect inflation, economic growth rates, and central bank policies. These macroeconomic factors have a significant influence on the crypto market’s performance. Currency Dynamics: Trade policies can impact currency exchange rates, which in turn can influence international flows of capital relevant to crypto markets. Supply Chain Effects: For cryptocurrencies tied to specific industries or supply chains (though less common for major ones like Bitcoin or Ethereum), direct impacts from tariff changes are possible. The denial of ongoing tariff discussions , while seemingly straightforward, could be interpreted in different ways by the market. It could mean that significant progress is not being made, potentially prolonging the period of uncertainty regarding China US tariffs . Or, it could simply be a clarification against specific rumors, without ruling out future talks. The call for the U.S. to stop creating confusion suggests there may have been conflicting signals or reports circulating, which only adds to the existing global trade uncertainty . Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders Given the ongoing potential for market shifts influenced by geopolitical factors like US China trade talks , what steps can those in the crypto market consider? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of major geopolitical and economic news, particularly concerning China US trade relations . Understand that these events can have ripple effects on market sentiment. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Recognize that external factors contribute to crypto market volatility. Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your comfort level regarding potential price swings driven by macro events. Diversification: Consider diversifying your portfolio not just within crypto assets but also potentially across different asset classes, depending on your overall financial strategy. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term holders, short-term volatility driven by geopolitical news might be less concerning than fundamental developments in the crypto space. Maintain focus on your long-term goals. Avoid Panic Reactions: News headlines can trigger emotional responses. Make investment decisions based on careful analysis rather than immediate reactions to breaking news about things like tariff discussions or denials thereof. The current situation underscores that despite the decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies, the market is not immune to the forces shaping the traditional global economy. The interplay between major economic powers and the resulting global trade uncertainty remains a key factor for investors to monitor. Conclusion: Clarity Sought Amidst Ongoing Trade Tensions The statement from the Chinese Embassy, denying current tariff discussions with the U.S. and urging an end to confusion, serves as a fresh data point in the ongoing narrative of China US trade relations . It highlights the lack of active, high-level talks specifically focused on resolving the tariff issue at this moment and points to potential miscommunication or differing interpretations of the situation between the two countries. For market participants, this means the cloud of global trade uncertainty related to these tariffs persists. While not a direct crypto news item, the state of US China trade talks is a critical component of the broader macroeconomic landscape that influences investor sentiment and capital flows, ultimately impacting the crypto market’s dynamics. Staying informed about these significant geopolitical developments is essential for anyone navigating the complexities of today’s interconnected financial world.

SOL price has hinted at a potential parabolic rally in the coming months bolstered by institutional tailwind. DeFi Development Corp. (NASDAQ: DEFI), a Florida-based blockchain and DeFi-focused company, filed a Form S-3 registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 25, to offer up to $1 billion in securities. According to the SEC filing, DeFi Development Corp intends to register up to 1,244,471 shares of common stock for potential resale by existing stockholders. “We may sell any combination of these securities in one or more offerings, at prices and on terms to be determined prior to the time of the offering, with an aggregate offering price of up to $1,000,000,000,” the filing noted . The company noted that the proceeds from the intended offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Solana (SOL). Market Impact of DeFi Development Corp’s Move The strategic move by DeFi Development Corp to raise $1 billion, under the Donald Trump administration, will have a far-reaching influence on the wider crypto market. Furthermore, the validation of the crypto market by institutional investors has helped increase liquidity and enabled ongoing mainstream adoption of digital assets and web3 technology. The Solana network stands to benefit most from the DeFi Development Corp’s deal. As Coinpedia reported , SOL Strategies intends to raise up to $500 million to purchase more Solana coins in the near term. Consequently, SOL price will likely continue with bullish sentiment in the coming months, especially if the highly anticipated altseason kickstarts.

Because sometimes, the right moves speak louder than the hype. The digital realm just got a major upgrade—and it’s not from the usual suspects. Gala is expanding fast, Immutable X is rewriting the gaming rulebook, and Qubetics? It’s quietly building the kind of utility others only dream of. The blockchain crowd isn’t just watching—they’re taking notes. Immutable X, in partnership with Ubisoft, is gearing up to transform digital gaming as we know it. Their upcoming Ethereum-based card game set in the universe promises true digital ownership through NFTs, seamless trading, and speed that doesn’t compromise decentralization. And while this makes headlines, something bigger is brewing on the sidelines that’s already reshaping expectations. Enter Qubetics ($TICS). Beyond just another token, it’s a toolkit. Designed to address the real bottlenecks in digital finance, it’s built for the now and prepped for the next wave. As Gala fine-tunes entertainment and Immutable doubles down on user-centric gaming, Qubetics is laser-focused on solving the real-life, real-world inefficiencies that legacy blockchain products left unresolved. Let’s explore the best crypto ICOs to invest. Qubetics: Tackling Real-World Blockchain Utility with Unshakable Precision Qubetics, built with purpose and precision, isn’t chasing headlines—it’s building infrastructure. With over $16.4 million already raised and more than 25,200 participants in the crypto pre sale , the traction speaks volumes. $TICS is being built to solve actual pain points that community members face in their digital lives. It’s a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, for example, that changes how people access and control their funds across networks, without surrendering ownership. Picture a business managing treasury across Solana, Ethereum, and BNB Chain—all from one sleek dashboard without touching centralized services. Professionals moving assets without delay or fees, up margins. Every day, users are finally managing their digital identities without feeling like they’re trapped in a tech maze. That’s Qubetics in action—unifying simplicity, control, and security. The wallet enables real-time cross-chain access with native integration, eliminating third-party dependence and vulnerabilities. It supports over 30 networks, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions, digital asset storage, and DeFi access with unmatched speed and control. That’s not just utility—it’s empowerment. Over 509 million tokens sold. Current price at $0.1902. And early buyers? They’re staring down a potential 5,155% ROI if $TICS hits $10 after mainnet launch. Numbers don’t lie, one of the best crypto ICOs to invest. Gala: Scaling the Future of Decentralized Entertainment While many projects chase gaming partnerships, Gala is busy building an ecosystem. Its latest developments show continued focus on enabling creators to monetize content while giving participants more influence over what gets made. The network’s upgraded SDKs and developer toolkits now allow seamless deployment of blockchain mechanics into traditional games, without the bloat or complexity. Recently, Gala’s push toward enhancing in-game economies caught attention, particularly as it sharpens its creator payout systems. Game developers are now experimenting with direct reward mechanisms tied to network activity. In practical terms, that means less reliance on centralized marketplaces and more fluid asset circulation within games. Participants engaging early with Gala’s protocols have witnessed not just product evolution but a strategic shift: from game launches to economy-first rollouts. That vision taps into the emotional core of entertainment—ownership and access without middlemen. For those searching the best crypto ICOs to invest, Gala stands out not as a promise, but as proof. Immutable X: Driving Gaming into Web3 with Zero Compromise Immutable X is no stranger to breaking conventions, but its partnership with Ubisoft marks a sharp new direction. Their upcoming digital card game, rooted in the globally-loved Might & Magic universe, uses Immutable X’s L2 Ethereum scaling to provide what gamers actually care about: speed, ownership, and frictionless play. By removing gas fees and integrating NFT utility directly into gameplay, Immutable X isn’t just adding blockchain to gaming—it’s dissolving the line between them. Every move in the partnership signals authority: from Ubisoft’s VP backing the initiative, to Immutable’s infrastructure becoming the backbone of new AAA-level releases. The integration of NFTs as player-owned assets means those cards can live outside the game, traded or held indefinitely. With Immutable X currently priced at $0.5986, the project reflects a long-term view—one that aligns with how digital economies should work. Community members looking for the best crypto ICOs to invest should see this as a shift from passive speculation to immersive interaction. Why Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet Is Important? Decentralization wasn’t meant to be complicated. Yet, that’s how it often feels—fragmented networks, endless swaps, multiple wallets, all managed through shaky platforms. A Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet like Qubetics delivers the antidote. It puts control back into the hands of the user, with no third-party bottlenecks or risk-laden intermediaries. This wallet acts as a bridge—no more juggling between networks or needing centralized exchanges for simple swaps. For businesses managing payroll in crypto or cross-border settlements, time saved is money earned. For professionals diversifying portfolios or staking across chains, it’s peace of mind. And for everyone else—freedom and flexibility at fingertips. Security is paramount, but so is speed. The Qubetics wallet offers both. By building a trustless yet intuitive interface, it doesn’t just cater to today’s user—it anticipates tomorrow’s needs. That’s why the presale momentum isn’t just a trend—it’s a signal. Conclusion: Where Real Momentum Meets Real Utility With Qubetics refining decentralized finance tools, Gala expanding interactive entertainment, and Immutable X fusing traditional gaming with Web3 power, these aren’t just projects—they’re movements. Each speaks to a different urge: control, creativity, and immersion. But only one—Qubetics—is translating those urges into tangible, scalable utility. The best crypto ICOs to invest today are those that don’t just chase attention but provide real value and long-term vision. Qubetics stands out by solving what others overlooked. Gala is capturing emotion and entertainment. Immutable X is making ownership second nature in gaming. Now’s the time to move smart, not just fast. Don’t wait for the headlines to catch up—get ahead. The future of blockchain isn’t a dream—it’s already in motion.

Immutable X enables fast, gas-free trading and real ownership through NFT integration, making blockchain seamless in AAA games like the new Ubisoft title. Why is Gala still relevant in 2025?

This was announced during an unexpected “Ask Me Anything” session with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, who shared details about adding XRP support to the Lace Wallet. What’s New for Cardano Users? Notably, Cardano is working to improve its tools for users by allowing them to use multiple blockchains easily. According to Hoskinson, the Input Output Global (IOG) team also intends to integrate XRP features into Lace Wallet. This will let XRP holders store their assets safely on Lace and make transactions without relying on other apps. Lace, introduced by IOG as a lightweight Web3 wallet, has become popular because it is easy to use and supports Cardano-native assets and staking. The upcoming XRP addition is a significant development, showing that Cardano is open to including assets from other major blockchain networks. Although no specific timeline was given for the XRP rollout support, the Cardano community anticipates with enthusiasm. Meanwhile, experts believe supporting XRP could lead to new partnerships. Lace: A New Era for ADA Wallets Speaking on December 24, 2024, Hoskinson praised Lace’s growing popularity. He noted that its smooth transition from Nami, one of Cardano’s most-used wallets , has fueled its adoption. Nami, with over 200,000 users, has been central to Cardano’s network. Backed by Cardano’s primary developers, Input Output, Lace aims to transform how users engage with the blockchain. When Inout Output acquired Nami in 2023, it laid the groundwork for innovation. More than just a wallet, Lace serves as a gateway to Cardano . Designed for simplicity, it aims to attract millions of users. Currently, Lace exists as a browser extension for platforms like Chrome and Brave, but a mobile app is on the horizon. This future accessibility could be the key to Cardano’s broader adoption. New Digital Identity Platform Emerges Some weeks ago, the Cardano Foundation created Veridian , which enables people and businesses to control their online identities. Instead of centralized systems that store personal data, Veridian uses blockchain technology to keep identities safe and private. Veridian also adds an extra layer of security to Cardano’s blockchain, helping to make Cardano a top choice for secure digital securities. Alongside the platform, the foundation also launched the Veridian Wallet, which helps users manage their credentials, private keys, and digital identifiers. This move strengthens Cardano’s position in the growing world of decentralized identity solutions.

This latest acquisition reinforces their explicit commitment to a robust corporate Bitcoin strategy , positioning Bitcoin as a primary asset for their Bitcoin treasury management . Semler Scientific Bitcoin: Expanding the Digital Reserve Semler Scientific, primarily known for its products used to assess arterial blood flow, has been making waves in the financial world since announcing its foray into Bitcoin in May 2024. The company’s chairman, Eric Semler, recently confirmed via a post on X that Semler Scientific acquired an additional 111 Bitcoins. This latest purchase cost approximately $10 million, further solidifying their position among publicly traded companies holding significant amounts of the leading cryptocurrency. This new acquisition brings Semler Scientific’s total Semler Scientific Bitcoin holdings to 3,303 BTC. The company has been steadily increasing its stash since its initial purchase, demonstrating a clear and consistent approach to accumulating the digital asset. Understanding Semler’s Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Unlike many companies that might hold a small amount of cryptocurrency as an experiment or for specific operational purposes, Semler Scientific has been explicit about its rationale. In their initial announcement regarding their first Bitcoin purchase, the company stated their belief that Bitcoin is a prudent treasury alternative to holding cash and that it has the potential to generate significant value over time. This isn’t just about holding Bitcoin; it’s about a defined corporate Bitcoin strategy where Bitcoin serves as a core component of their balance sheet and Bitcoin treasury management . Key aspects of this strategy likely include: Inflation Hedge: Using Bitcoin’s fixed supply to potentially preserve purchasing power against currency devaluation. Store of Value: Treating Bitcoin as digital gold, a long-term asset expected to retain or increase value. Potential for Appreciation: Acknowledging Bitcoin’s historical performance and future growth potential as a driver of overall treasury value. Diversification: Moving away from traditional, low-yield treasury assets like cash and short-term bonds. The company noted a 23.5% BTC yield year-to-date (YTD) at the time of the announcement, highlighting the potential short-term gains, although their stated strategy appears focused on the long term. Why Are Companies Pursuing Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? Semler Scientific’s move is part of a larger, accelerating trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption . While MicroStrategy remains the most prominent example, a growing number of corporations, financial institutions, and even sovereign nations are exploring or implementing strategies to hold Bitcoin. Several factors are driving this trend: Macroeconomic Environment: Persistent inflation concerns and low yields on traditional safe-haven assets make alternatives more attractive. Maturing Infrastructure: Improved custody solutions, regulatory clarity (in some regions), and the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have made it easier and safer for institutions to access Bitcoin. Increased Awareness and Acceptance: Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a legitimate asset class rather than a fringe technology. Shareholder Demand: Some investors are actively seeking exposure to Bitcoin, and companies holding BTC can become attractive proxies. Semler’s commitment, especially from a company outside the traditional finance or tech sectors, signals how mainstream Bitcoin treasury management is becoming for diverse businesses. What Does Semler’s Strategy Mean for SMLR Stock? For investors, Semler Scientific’s significant Semler Scientific Bitcoin holdings transform the company into something of a hybrid investment. While its core business remains medical technology, the value of SMLR stock is now also significantly tied to the performance of Bitcoin. This can have several implications: Increased Volatility: The stock price may become more correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements, potentially leading to higher volatility than traditional medical technology stocks. Attracting New Investors: Bitcoin-focused investors looking for corporate exposure might view SMLR as an attractive option. Shareholder Sentiment: The success or failure of their corporate Bitcoin strategy could heavily influence investor confidence in management. Following their initial Bitcoin announcement in May, SMLR stock saw a significant price surge, indicating a positive initial reaction from the market to their pivot towards Bitcoin treasury management . Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Strategy While the potential benefits of institutional Bitcoin adoption are significant, companies adopting a corporate Bitcoin strategy must also navigate challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the balance sheet value and potentially leading to impairment charges under current accounting rules (though this is an evolving area). Security and Custody: Safely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and secure custody solutions. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, presenting potential uncertainties. Public Perception: While growing, acceptance of Bitcoin as a corporate asset is not universal, and some stakeholders may be skeptical. Semler Scientific’s continued accumulation suggests they are comfortable with these risks and see the long-term potential outweighing the short-term challenges. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bitcoin Treasury Management Semler Scientific’s repeated Bitcoin purchases are a strong indicator of their conviction in Bitcoin as a long-term treasury asset. Their actions contribute to the broader narrative of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption and validate the concept of a dedicated corporate Bitcoin strategy . As more companies evaluate their treasury holdings in the face of macroeconomic shifts, Semler Scientific’s approach may serve as a case study. The success of their Semler Scientific Bitcoin strategy could encourage others to explore similar avenues for their own Bitcoin treasury management . Summary: Semler Scientific’s latest acquisition of 111 BTC, bringing their total to 3,303 BTC, highlights their firm commitment to a corporate Bitcoin strategy . This move is a significant data point in the accelerating trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption , demonstrating how companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a core asset for Bitcoin treasury management . The performance of their Semler Scientific Bitcoin holdings will be closely watched, impacting perceptions of SMLR stock and potentially influencing other corporations considering similar strategies.

Its strength or weakness can significantly influence global liquidity flows and investor sentiment towards risk assets. Recently, the dollar has faced headwinds, leading many to question its future trajectory. However, a notable perspective comes from Capital Economics, suggesting that the most challenging period for the US Dollar outlook might now be behind us. This view warrants close examination for anyone trying to understand broader financial market movements. Why Does Capital Economics See a Dollar Forecast Turnaround? Capital Economics, a respected independent economic research consultancy, bases its perspective on a combination of macro-economic factors. Their analysis points towards a potential shift in the forces that have weighed on the dollar. For some time, expectations around the Federal Reserve’s interest rate path and differing global growth prospects have pressured the USD. The core of their argument for a potential turnaround in the dollar forecast rests on the idea that some of these dynamics are either stabilizing or beginning to reverse. Several key elements contribute to this outlook: Interest Rate Expectations: While other central banks have been catching up to the Fed’s rate hikes, the pace might be slowing. Capital Economics suggests that the relative difference in interest rate expectations between the US and other major economies may become less unfavorable for the dollar, or even turn slightly positive. Inflation Trends: A continued moderation in US inflation could allow the Fed to potentially ease policy sooner or more aggressively than some other central banks facing stickier price pressures. Conversely, if US inflation proves more persistent than expected elsewhere, it could support the dollar through higher-for-longer rate expectations. Global Growth Divergence: The narrative of strong growth elsewhere outpacing the US may be losing steam. Signs of slowing economic momentum in various regions could make the relative performance of the US economy look more favorable, drawing capital towards dollar-denominated assets. Risk Sentiment: In periods of increased global uncertainty or risk aversion, the dollar often benefits from its safe-haven status. While not the primary driver of their long-term forecast, potential shifts in global risk sentiment could provide intermittent support. Understanding these underlying drivers is crucial for grasping the basis of the Capital Economics forecast for the dollar. What Factors Influence This Capital Economics Dollar View? The specific factors that Capital Economics highlights as influential in their Capital Economics dollar view are deeply rooted in macroeconomic theory and current economic data. They analyze how changes in these variables historically impact currency valuations and project how they might evolve. Consider the role of interest rates. Currencies are significantly influenced by interest rate differentials between countries. Higher interest rates tend to attract foreign investment seeking better returns on fixed-income assets, increasing demand for that country’s currency. The aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve initially boosted the dollar, but as other central banks tightened policy, this advantage diminished. Capital Economics is likely looking at forward guidance from central banks, market pricing of future rate cuts or hikes, and inflation expectations to project how these differentials might shift. Another critical factor is economic growth. Strong economic performance generally supports a currency. It attracts foreign direct investment and portfolio investment into a country’s businesses and markets. If Capital Economics believes the US economy is poised for relatively stronger performance compared to its peers, or that previous expectations of weakness were overdone, this would underpin their positive dollar outlook. They would be analyzing indicators like GDP growth rates, employment figures, consumer spending, and industrial production. Furthermore, current account balances and government debt levels can play a role, although their impact is often more long-term. A persistent current account deficit can be a drag on a currency, while manageable debt levels and fiscal stability are generally supportive. Capital Economics would integrate these structural factors into their broader model. Geopolitical events and policy decisions also influence currency markets. Trade policies, sanctions, political stability, and international relations can all affect capital flows and investor confidence in a currency. While perhaps harder to predict, these elements are often considered in the context of potential risks or tailwinds for a forecast. In essence, the Capital Economics dollar view is a synthesis of these diverse economic indicators and policy expectations, aiming to project the relative attractiveness of holding dollar-denominated assets compared to those in other currencies. How Could This Impact Forex Market Analysis and Other Assets? A potential turning point for the dollar, as suggested by Capital Economics, has significant implications for Forex market analysis and a wide range of other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. In the Forex market itself, a shift towards dollar strength or even just stability after a period of weakness would mean altered trading strategies. Currency pairs involving the USD (like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY) would see their dynamics change. Traders who profited from shorting the dollar might need to reconsider their positions. Volatility could either decrease if the dollar stabilizes or increase if the shift is sharp and unexpected. For commodity markets, a stronger dollar typically makes dollar-denominated commodities like oil and gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially dampening demand. Conversely, a weaker dollar tends to support commodity prices. Therefore, a stable or strengthening dollar could exert downward pressure on commodity valuations. Equity markets also react to dollar movements. A strong dollar can make exports more expensive for US companies, potentially hurting their international earnings. However, it can also signal confidence in the US economy, which might support domestic stocks. The impact is complex and varies by sector. Crucially, for the cryptocurrency market, the dollar’s trajectory is a key macro factor. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often seen as risk assets. When the dollar is strong and rising, it can draw liquidity out of riskier investments as investors prefer the safety and potential returns of dollar assets. A weaker dollar, conversely, can make alternative assets like crypto more appealing, providing a tailwind. If the dollar stabilizes or strengthens as Capital Economics suggests, it could remove a previous source of support for crypto prices or even become a headwind, depending on the degree of dollar recovery. Therefore, incorporating insights from Forex market analysis , particularly views like that from Capital Economics on the dollar’s future, is essential for anyone navigating global financial markets, including the crypto landscape. Navigating Dollar Strength Factors: Challenges and Opportunities Understanding the potential for a shift in Dollar strength factors presents both challenges and opportunities for investors and market participants. The main challenge lies in confirming whether the predicted turnaround materializes and how sustainable it proves to be. Economic forecasts are subject to numerous variables and unexpected events. Challenges include: Uncertainty in Data: Economic data releases can be volatile and subject to revision, making it difficult to confirm underlying trends in inflation, growth, or employment. Central Bank Actions: Future decisions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks regarding interest rates and quantitative easing/tightening are not guaranteed and can change based on incoming data. Geopolitical Risks: Global events, political instability, or new conflicts can rapidly alter market sentiment and capital flows, potentially overriding economic fundamentals. Market Sentiment Shifts: Sometimes, market narratives and sentiment can drive currency movements independently of immediate economic data, creating volatility. Despite these challenges, the potential for a shift also creates opportunities: Positioning in Forex: Traders can look for opportunities in currency pairs based on the expected dollar movement, potentially going long on USD against currencies where economic outlooks are less favorable. Asset Allocation: Investors can adjust their exposure to assets that are typically inversely correlated with the dollar (like certain commodities or potentially cryptocurrencies) or those that benefit from dollar strength (like US-based assets for foreign investors). Hedging: Businesses or investors with significant exposure to foreign currencies can consider hedging strategies if they anticipate a period of dollar appreciation. Identifying Relative Value: A changing dollar dynamic can reveal relative value opportunities across different markets and geographies. Successfully navigating these Dollar strength factors requires continuous monitoring of economic data, central bank communications, and global events, rather than relying solely on a single forecast. Understanding Current Currency Market Trends: Beyond the Dollar While the focus of the Capital Economics view is on the US Dollar, it’s important to understand this within the broader context of Currency market trends globally. Currency movements are always relative. The performance of the dollar is judged against a basket of other major currencies (the Dollar Index – DXY) or specific pairs. Other major currencies are also influenced by their own domestic economic conditions, central bank policies, and political situations. For example: The Euro is affected by the Eurozone’s growth, inflation data, and the European Central Bank’s policy decisions. The Japanese Yen is sensitive to Bank of Japan policy, which has remained exceptionally loose compared to others, and Japan’s economic performance. The British Pound reacts to UK inflation, growth, and Bank of England policy, as well as Brexit-related developments. Capital Economics’ dollar forecast implicitly considers the expected performance of these other economies and their currencies. Their view that the worst is over for the dollar suggests they anticipate that the relative economic and policy environment will become more favorable for the US compared to the Eurozone, Japan, the UK, and other major economies. Analyzing Currency market trends involves looking at these cross-currency dynamics. A period where the dollar stabilizes or strengthens doesn’t necessarily mean all other currencies will weaken equally. Some might hold up better due to their own domestic strengths or unique factors. Understanding these relative movements provides a more complete picture of the global financial landscape. Conclusion: What Does This Mean for Markets? Capital Economics presents a compelling case that the period of significant headwinds for the US Dollar may be concluding. Their forecast is based on an analysis of evolving interest rate expectations, inflation dynamics, and relative global growth prospects. While this is just one perspective among many, a potential shift towards dollar stability or strength, if it materializes, carries important implications across financial markets, from Forex trading to commodity prices and, notably, the cryptocurrency space. For those interested in crypto, a stronger dollar could signal a more challenging macro environment for risk assets compared to the recent past. Conversely, if the dollar’s stabilization prevents a sharp decline, it could remove a source of volatility. Market participants should monitor incoming economic data and central bank actions closely to assess whether the conditions supporting this US Dollar outlook prediction are indeed playing out. The coming months will be crucial in determining whether the worst is truly over for the world’s primary reserve currency.

43807542,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152932,1745624425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,NEAR ETF: Bitwise Achieves Major Milestone with Delaware Registration,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/near-etf-bitwise-registration/,"In a development signaling potential new avenues for investors seeking exposure to the digital asset space, Bitwise Asset Management has taken a notable step regarding the NEAR Protocol. Bitwise, a prominent cryptocurrency asset management company, has officially completed the registration of a NEAR exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the state of Delaware. This move, initially brought to light by Unfolded on X, marks a significant administrative milestone in the lengthy process of bringing a crypto-linked investment product to market. What is the Significance of the Bitwise NEAR ETF Registration? For many in the cryptocurrency community and traditional finance alike, the registration of a Bitwise NEAR ETF in Delaware is more than just paperwork; it’s a signal of intent. Delaware is a common jurisdiction for business and fund registrations in the United States, often serving as an initial legal step for entities planning future operations or product launches. While this registration itself does not mean the ETF is approved for trading or that it holds any assets yet, it demonstrates that Bitwise is actively exploring and laying the groundwork for a potential investment product centered around the NEAR Protocol. This action follows a broader trend of asset management firms seeking to offer regulated investment vehicles for various cryptocurrencies, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional financial markets and the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Bitwise has been at the forefront of this movement, having previously launched other crypto-focused funds and securing approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Understanding the NEAR Protocol and Its Potential To appreciate the significance of a potential NEAR ETF , it’s crucial to understand the underlying technology. The NEAR Protocol is a layer-one blockchain designed to be highly scalable and user-friendly. It utilizes a sharding mechanism called ‘Nightshade’ to process transactions in parallel, aiming to achieve high throughput and low transaction costs. Unlike some earlier blockchains, NEAR was built with developers and mainstream adoption in mind, featuring human-readable account names and a focus on usability. Key features of the NEAR Protocol include: Scalability: Designed to handle millions of users and transactions through sharding. Usability: Features like human-readable addresses make it more accessible than traditional crypto wallets. Developer-Friendly: Supports multiple programming languages, making it easier for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). Ecosystem Growth: A growing ecosystem of dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFTs is being built on NEAR. A Bitwise NEAR ETF , if launched, would offer investors a way to gain exposure to the performance of the NEAR token without the complexities of managing private keys, choosing a wallet, or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges directly. This could potentially open the NEAR ecosystem to a wider pool of traditional investors. How Do Crypto ETFs Work and Why Are They Important? A Crypto ETF functions much like any other exchange-traded fund. It is an investment fund that tracks the price of an underlying asset or basket of assets – in this case, likely the NEAR token or derivatives related to its price. Shares of the ETF are then traded on traditional stock exchanges. The importance of Crypto ETF s lies primarily in accessibility and familiarity for traditional investors. Many individuals and institutions are comfortable with the structure of ETFs, which are regulated investment products easily bought and sold through standard brokerage accounts. They offer several potential advantages: Accessibility: Simplifies investment in crypto assets for those new to the space or preferring traditional investment platforms. Regulatory Clarity: ETFs operate within existing financial regulations, potentially offering a layer of investor protection not always perceived with direct crypto investments. Diversification (in some cases): While a single-asset ETF like a potential NEAR ETF tracks one asset, the availability of various crypto ETFs can allow for diversified exposure within a traditional portfolio. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major exchanges, often providing significant liquidity. However, it’s important to note that ETF approval processes, particularly for those holding the underlying cryptocurrency (spot ETFs), have historically faced significant regulatory hurdles in jurisdictions like the United States, primarily from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While spot Bitcoin ETFs were recently approved, the path for other altcoin ETFs, including one tracking the NEAR Protocol , remains subject to stringent regulatory review. The Role of Digital Asset Management in the ETF Process Companies specializing in Digital Asset Management , like Bitwise, play a crucial role in the development and potential launch of crypto-focused investment products such as ETFs. Their expertise spans several critical areas: Product Development: Designing the structure of the ETF, including how it will track the underlying asset and its operational mechanics. Regulatory Navigation: Working with financial regulators (like the SEC in the US) to file necessary documents, address concerns, and secure approval for listing and trading. Market Infrastructure: Establishing relationships with custodians, trading partners, and authorized participants necessary for the ETF to function effectively. Investor Education: Helping traditional investors understand the unique aspects and risks of investing in digital assets through a regulated fund structure. Bitwise’s decision to register a NEAR ETF underscores their view of NEAR Protocol as a significant player in the digital asset space worthy of consideration for institutional and retail investment products. This step is part of the broader trend where Digital Asset Management firms are working to bring more mainstream, regulated options to market for a variety of cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Could This Mean for NEAR Protocol’s Future? The registration of a potential Bitwise NEAR ETF could have several positive implications for the NEAR Protocol ecosystem, should it eventually gain full regulatory approval and launch: Increased Visibility: Listing on traditional exchanges exposes NEAR to a much larger pool of potential investors who may not currently participate in crypto markets. Enhanced Legitimacy: A regulated ETF can lend an air of legitimacy and maturity to the NEAR ecosystem in the eyes of traditional finance. Potential for Increased Demand: If the ETF is popular, the managing firm may need to purchase NEAR tokens on the open market to back the ETF shares, potentially increasing demand. Improved Liquidity: Increased trading activity related to the ETF could indirectly benefit the liquidity of the underlying NEAR token market. However, it’s vital to temper expectations. The registration is just one step. The path to a fully approved and launched NEAR ETF involves significant further regulatory hurdles, particularly obtaining approval from the SEC for listing and trading on a national securities exchange. The timeline for such approval is uncertain and depends heavily on the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching this development, here are a few key takeaways: Monitor Regulatory Progress: Keep an eye on filings with the SEC and public statements from Bitwise regarding the potential NEAR ETF. Understand the Asset: Before considering investment in a potential ETF, thoroughly research the NEAR Protocol itself, its technology, use cases, and risks. Evaluate the ETF Structure: If launched, understand how the ETF tracks NEAR’s price (e.g., spot or futures-based) and its associated fees and risks. Diversify and Manage Risk: As with any investment, particularly in the volatile crypto space, ensure any potential allocation to a NEAR ETF fits within your overall portfolio strategy and risk tolerance. This registration is a positive indicator of growing interest from Digital Asset Management firms in the NEAR Protocol, but it is just the beginning of a potentially long journey towards a live ETF product. Conclusion Bitwise’s completion of the NEAR ETF registration in Delaware is a notable step for both the asset manager and the NEAR Protocol ecosystem. It signals serious intent to potentially bring a regulated investment product tracking NEAR to traditional markets. While significant regulatory hurdles remain, this move highlights the increasing maturity of the digital asset space and the ongoing efforts by firms like Bitwise to make crypto exposure more accessible through familiar investment vehicles like ETFs. It’s a development worth watching closely as the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized technology continues to evolve.

43807772,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152933,1745625022,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Circle Issues Crucial Clarification on U.S. Bank Charter Pursuit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/circle-denies-bank-charter/,"Recent reports circulating in the financial press suggested that major crypto firms, including Circle, were actively pursuing a U.S. federal bank charter. This news sparked considerable discussion regarding the integration of the crypto industry with traditional finance. However, Circle, a leading global financial technology firm and the issuer of the widely used stablecoin, Circle USDC, has stepped forward to address these claims directly. What Did the Reports Claim About Circle and a U.S. Bank Charter ? A Wall Street Journal report indicated that several crypto companies were exploring options for obtaining U.S. banking licenses. The rationale presented was that securing such licenses would help these firms build stronger, more direct connections with the traditional banking system, potentially easing issues related to access to payment systems and institutional trust. Circle was mentioned as one of the firms reportedly looking into this path, alongside others like BitGo. The pursuit of a full federal bank charter is a significant undertaking, requiring rigorous application processes, substantial capital reserves, and adherence to strict regulatory oversight from bodies like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). For a crypto firm, obtaining such a charter would represent a deep level of integration into the established financial framework. Circle ‘s Official Stance: Clarifying Their Regulatory Path In response to these reports, an executive at Circle provided a crucial clarification. According to Cointelegraph, Circle’s Chief Strategy Officer, Dante Disparte, explicitly refuted the claim that the company is seeking a U.S. federal bank charter or looking to acquire an insured depository institution. This statement directly contradicts the premise that Circle’s immediate goal is to become a fully chartered federal bank in the traditional sense. Disparte clarified Circle’s actual strategic focus regarding U.S. regulatory licenses. He stated that the company may instead seek a federal or state trust charter or another form of non-bank license. This distinction is vital and highlights Circle’s specific needs and goals within the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets. Key Takeaways from Circle’s Clarification: Denial of Bank Charter: Circle is not currently pursuing a full U.S. federal bank charter. Denial of Acquiring an Insured Depository Institution: They are not looking to buy an existing bank. Focus on Trust/Non-Bank Licenses: Circle is exploring state or federal trust charters or other non-bank licenses. Purpose: These efforts are aimed at complying with forthcoming stablecoin regulations. This clarification provides a clearer picture of Circle’s strategy, positioning them as seeking specialized licenses relevant to their core business of issuing stablecoins, rather than attempting to become a traditional bank. Why is Stablecoin Regulation Driving Circle’s Strategy? Stablecoins like Circle USDC have become a critical bridge between the traditional financial system and the crypto economy. Their stability, typically pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, makes them essential for trading, payments, and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, their growing importance has attracted significant attention from regulators globally, particularly in the United States. Policymakers are increasingly focused on establishing clear rules for stablecoin issuers to ensure financial stability, protect consumers, and prevent illicit activities. Proposed legislation and regulatory guidance emphasize requirements around reserves, redemption rights, and overall risk management. For a major issuer like Circle, operating under a clear and appropriate regulatory framework is paramount for legitimacy, trust, and continued growth. Seeking a trust charter or a non-bank license is a strategic move directly tied to navigating this evolving regulatory environment. These types of licenses can provide the necessary legal and supervisory structure specifically tailored to the activities of a digital asset firm that manages reserves and facilitates transactions, without imposing the full spectrum of requirements placed on deposit-taking commercial banks. Understanding Different Regulatory Licenses for Crypto Regulation The world of financial regulation offers various types of licenses, each with different scopes and requirements. For crypto firms, understanding these distinctions is key to choosing the right path for compliance and business operations. Let’s briefly compare the types of licenses being discussed: U.S. Federal Bank Charter: Regulator: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Scope: Allows for a wide range of banking activities, including taking deposits (often FDIC-insured), making loans, and providing payment services. Requirements: Extremely high capital requirements, strict compliance, consumer protection laws, ongoing supervision. Relevance to Crypto: Provides deep integration with traditional finance but is arguably overkill for a non-lending, non-deposit-taking stablecoin issuer focused solely on reserve management and transfers. State or Federal Trust Charter: Regulator: State banking departments or the OCC (for federal trust charters). Scope: Allows for acting as a trustee, managing assets (like stablecoin reserves), and sometimes providing payment services, but typically does NOT involve taking insured deposits or making commercial loans. Requirements: Significant capital, robust compliance, fiduciary duties, regular audits. Requirements are often less stringent than a full bank charter but still substantial. Relevance to Crypto: Highly relevant for stablecoin issuers as it aligns with managing reserves and ensuring assets are held appropriately for the benefit of token holders. Non-Bank Licenses (e.g., Money Transmitter Licenses – MTLs): Regulator: State-level regulators (e.g., FinCEN for federal oversight, state banking departments for licensing). Scope: Allows for transferring money on behalf of others. Essential for operating exchanges, wallets, and payment services involving fiat or crypto. Requirements: Vary significantly by state but involve capital requirements, surety bonds, compliance programs (AML/KYC). Relevance to Crypto: Fundamental for operations involving the movement of value. Many crypto firms already hold these. Circle’s focus on trust or non-bank licenses indicates a preference for regulatory frameworks that specifically address their activities (issuing and managing stablecoins and their reserves) rather than the broader scope of traditional banking. This approach is often seen as more pragmatic and directly aligned with the needs of a digital asset company under incoming stablecoin regulation. Implications for Circle USDC and the Broader Market Circle’s decision to clarify its regulatory intentions has several implications: Clarity for Investors and Users: It provides transparency regarding Circle’s strategic direction and regulatory compliance efforts. For users and holders of Circle USDC, this clarification reinforces that the company is actively working to operate within established legal boundaries, which can build trust. Focus on Core Business: By not pursuing a full bank charter, Circle signals its intention to remain focused on its core business of stablecoins and related payment/financial infrastructure, rather than diversifying into traditional banking services. Stablecoin Regulation Preparedness: Seeking trust or non-bank licenses demonstrates Circle’s proactive approach to preparing for anticipated stablecoin-specific regulations in the U.S. This could position them favorably as the regulatory landscape solidifies. Industry Precedent: Circle’s chosen regulatory path might serve as a model or influence how other stablecoin issuers and crypto firms approach U.S. licensing under new regulations. It highlights that a full bank charter isn’t the only, or necessarily the best, route for all crypto businesses seeking regulatory clarity. Relationship with Traditional Finance: While not pursuing a full bank charter, obtaining trust or other specialized licenses can still significantly strengthen Circle’s relationship with traditional finance by providing a clear, regulated status that banks and financial institutions can work with confidently. The market’s reaction to the initial WSJ report and Circle’s subsequent denial underscores the importance placed on regulatory clarity for the crypto industry’s maturation and integration into the global financial system. Circle’s chosen path suggests a preference for specialized regulatory frameworks over attempting to fit into the existing broad structure designed for traditional banks. What’s Next for Circle’s Regulatory Journey? Circle’s pursuit of state or federal trust charters or other non-bank licenses will be a key area to watch. The specific type of license obtained, the jurisdiction (state vs. federal), and the requirements imposed will shed further light on the future operating environment for major stablecoin issuers in the U.S. This process is likely to be complex and time-consuming, involving extensive dialogue with regulators. Success in securing appropriate licenses will be crucial for Circle’s ability to scale its operations, partner with traditional financial institutions, and maintain its position as a leader in the stablecoin market under the impending wave of crypto regulation. The distinction between seeking a full bank charter and pursuing trust or non-bank licenses is more than just semantics; it reflects a strategic choice about the nature of the business Circle intends to conduct and the regulatory burden it is prepared to undertake to ensure the stability and compliance of Circle USDC and its other offerings. Summary: Circle Sets the Record Straight on U.S. Licensing In conclusion, while recent reports suggested Circle was aiming for a full U.S. federal bank charter, the company has clarified that this is not the case. Circle’s focus is on obtaining state or federal trust charters or other non-bank licenses. This strategy is primarily driven by the need to comply with forthcoming stablecoin regulation and secure an appropriate regulatory framework for managing reserves and operating its core business, including the issuance of Circle USDC. This move signifies a targeted approach to regulation, seeking licenses specifically suited to digital asset operations rather than the broad scope of traditional banking, and provides valuable insight into how major crypto firms are navigating the complex path towards regulatory clarity in the United States.

The exchange’s customers may soon be able to trade ZORA, the native asset of the Zora Network, a layer-2 protocol built on top of Ethereum ( ETH ). Explains the project’s website, “Zora’s mission is to make the internet valuable and free – that’s why we’re building a social network that makes tokenizing and trading posts easy, fun, and rewarding. Our Rewards enable creators and developers on Zora to earn from trading activity through two distinct reward systems: Trade Rewards and Market Rewards.” ZORA launched on Wednesday and is trading at $0.022 at time of writing. The 606th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down around 20% since its launch but is up more than 3% in the past 24 hours. Being added to Coinbase’s listing roadmap means that the top US crypto exchange is considering rolling trading support for the asset in the near future. The roadmap was established in 2022 to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of investors frontrunning new trading support announcements.

The Real Vision chief executive shares a chart comparing the SUI/USD price to the SOL/USD price, with SUI/USD looking like it’s on the cusp of breaking out of resistance. Source: Rekt Capital/X SUI is trading at $2.97 at time of writing. The 13th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 21% in the past day and nearly 41% in the past week. SOL is trading at $149.47 at time of writing. The sixth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 3.5% in the past 24 hours and more than 13% in the past week. Pal isn’t the only analyst bullish on the Solana rival: Last week, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe told his 783,900 followers on the social media platform X that Sui is gaining adoption as a decentralized finance (DeFi) network, including for Bitcoin ( BTC ) staking and lending, referred to as Bitcoin DeFi (BTCfi). “Once the markets are turning back into an uptrend, the money will flow back into the ones that have shown strength. SUI is one of them. It’s a great spot to investigate SUI: BTCFi is quickly growing fast as 10% of TVL (Total Value Locked) going through SUI. DeFi on SUI is in the top six of all chains.

The latest news highlights a major move in the artificial intelligence sector, specifically concerning a key round of AI Funding for a promising company. Significant AI Funding Boosts Manus AI According to reports, Chinese AI startup Manus AI has successfully closed a substantial funding round. The company, which focuses on building advanced tools for AI Agents , reportedly secured $75 million. This significant injection of capital was led by prominent venture capital firm Benchmark, placing a valuation of approximately $500 million on Manus AI. This development underscores the continued strong investor interest in the AI sector, particularly in companies developing sophisticated autonomous systems. Who is Manus AI and What are AI Agents ? Manus AI is a technology company based in China, dedicated to the development of software and tools that power AI agents. But what exactly are AI Agents ? Think of AI Agents as intelligent computer programs designed to perform tasks autonomously on behalf of a user or another program. Unlike simpler AI that might perform a single function, agents are often intended to: Understand goals and complex instructions. Break down tasks into smaller steps. Interact with various software applications or systems. Learn and adapt over time. Complete tasks with minimal human intervention. Manus AI’s work in this area aims to make these autonomous capabilities more accessible and powerful for a variety of applications. The Impact of the Benchmark Investment The involvement of Benchmark, a highly respected Silicon Valley venture capital firm known for early investments in companies like Twitter, Uber, and Instagram, is a major vote of confidence for Manus AI. This specific Benchmark Investment is particularly noteworthy because it reportedly quintuples Manus AI’s valuation from its previous funding stage. Previously, Manus AI had raised over $10 million from investors including Tencent and HSG (formerly Sequoia China). The leap from a valuation likely below $100 million to $500 million demonstrates the rapid growth and perceived potential investors see in the company’s work on AI Agents . Global Expansion Plans Fueled by AI Funding A key reason for securing this substantial AI Funding is Manus AI’s ambition to expand its reach beyond China. Reports indicate the company plans to use the fresh capital to enter new, significant markets. These target regions include: The United States Japan The Middle East This global push signals Manus AI’s intent to compete on an international stage in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Putting AI Agents to Work: Product Context Manus AI gained notable attention when it launched a public demo of a general AI agent in March. The idea was to showcase an agent capable of handling diverse tasks across different platforms. Following the demo, the company introduced paid subscription tiers, ranging from $39 to $199 per month, indicating a move towards commercializing its technology. While initial testing of the demo reportedly showed areas for improvement, the rapid move to paid plans suggests confidence in their ongoing development and product roadmap. What This Means for the Chinese AI Startup Scene and Beyond The success of Manus AI in attracting significant foreign investment from a firm like Benchmark highlights the growing maturity and global competitiveness of the Chinese AI Startup ecosystem. Despite geopolitical tensions, top-tier venture capital is clearly still interested in funding promising technology companies originating from China. Furthermore, the focus on AI Agents reflects a broader trend in the AI industry towards creating more autonomous and capable systems. This area is attracting significant talent and capital globally, making it a key space to watch for future technological advancements. Summary In conclusion, Manus AI, a Chinese AI Startup specializing in AI Agents , has secured a major $75 million round of AI Funding led by Benchmark. This significant Benchmark Investment values the company at $500 million and is intended to fuel its expansion into markets like the U.S., Japan, and the Middle East. The funding round follows the company’s recent demo and launch of paid plans for its general AI agent technology, positioning Manus AI as a notable player in the global AI landscape.

According to the Bridgewater, Massachusetts-headquartered bank, personal and confidential information belonging to its customers was inadvertently sent to an unintended recipient on February 28th of this year. “The personal information that may have been accessed includes the data we have on file for you, such as your name, address, social security number, and account number(s).” Bluestone Bank says it has taken various steps to minimize the risk of potential harm to customers. “The individual who received the information has signed a Certificate of Destruction, confirming that all information was promptly and securely destroyed and no information was retained… We have further addressed this incident by reinforcing proper data handling procedures and mandating retraining on the appropriate management of customer data. In addition, we have evaluated and enhanced our existing protocols and controls to ensure this will not happen again.” To prevent possible misuse of personal information following the incident, Bluestone Bank is offering its customers a complimentary membership to an identity-monitoring service for one and a half years. Customers also have the choice of closing and reopening their bank accounts as a safety precaution. Bluestone Bank had $1.5 billion in total assets as of November of 2024.

43808866,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=715869,1745626773,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43808866.jpeg,America’s seniors lost billions in crypto scams; here’s how we can stem the tide,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/americas-seniors-lost-billions-in-scams/,"We’ve spent decades creating regulations to protect older adults from predatory lenders and abusive caregivers. But are we ignoring the digital threats they now face while transacting online? This grim reality is evident when analyzing the FBI’s latest Internet Crime Report (IC3). According to the IC3 study , Americans aged 60 and above lost $4.8 billion to cybercrime in 2024, a 43% jump YOY. The findings also revealed another unsettling reality. The findings also revealed another unsettling reality: they filed 147,127 complaints, of which 7,500 lost $100,000 or more each. That’s more than any other age group. Source: FBI IC3 2024 Report This isn’t just a financial crisis. It paints a picture of a systemic failure to protect a generation that built this country’s wealth but remains dangerously unprepared for its digital threats. What does it say about us if we allow our parents and grandparents to be hunted online? If we shrug when the most trusting generation is turned into the most exploited? Beyond the cybersecurity issues, it’s a test of national character. And right now, we’re failing it. Why are seniors more susceptible to cybercrime? Cybercriminals target seniors for different reasons. First, retirees often control lifelong savings, are outright homeowners, and trust institutions like banks or government agencies—the brands scammers impersonate. Moreover, gaps in digital literacy have left many navigating online financial platforms without the required safeguards. That’s compounded by the advancement in today’s scams that are nothing like the clunky, typo-ridden emails of yesteryear. Instead, they’re subtle, personalized, and engineered by suave global crime syndicates, as the screenshot below shows. Source: FBI IC3 2024 Report Another factor heightening our seniors’ vulnerability to online financial crimes is their isolation. Nearly 1 in 3 adults over 65 live alone, and loneliness makes them ready targets of romance and impersonation scams. We must rethink our systems Overall, the IC3 report is a telling indictment of the inability of our institutions to keep pace with evolving crime trends. Financial services providers, for instance, lack real-time scam detection tools. True, our banks flag unusual cash withdrawals. But they can miss wire transfers to offshore crypto exchanges , even when retirees liquidate IRAs overnight. Compare this to Europe, where France’s commercial banks block suspicious transactions in real-time, and Germany’s “Digital Compass” program trains seniors to spot online fraud. The U.S. lags because it places the burden of elder fraud prevention mostly on the individual rather than treating it as a systemic risk. Again, we’ve invested billions into cybersecurity infrastructure. But have done comparatively little to empower internet users who are least equipped to navigate its risks. Today, few states mandate fraud education as part of aging services, leaving many seniors behind in the shift to digital finance. Finally, the government’s response to this scourge remains fragmented and underfunded. While the SEC aggressively polices Wall Street, elder cybercrime straddles the FBI, FTC, and local agencies with no centralized accountability. This creates gaps, leading to inconsistencies in protection and enforcement across jurisdictions. America’s seniors are losing more money to crypto scams than any other scheme Another harrowing stat from the FBI’s report is this: Americans over 60 lost $2.8 billion to cryptocurrency-related scams last year. That makes them the single most affected age group. Most of these losses stemmed from investment scams ($1,8 billion), including “pig butchering .” This grotesquely accurate nickname refers to long-con schemes that lure victims into fake online relationships with promises of crypto riches. After winning their trust, the perpetrator then bleeds their victim dry. But crypto isn’t the only threat. Call center scams—especially those masquerading as tech support or government agencies—have become wildly profitable. In 2024 alone, American seniors reported losing $982 million in tech support fraud. That’s more than some Fortune 500 companies make in annual revenue. Amidst the gloom and doom, one of the agency’s initiatives —Operation Level Up—offers a rare bright spot. Through the program, the bureau and its secret service counterpart identified 4,323 potential crypto fraud victims and intervened, saving them roughly $286 million in combined losses. Though commendable, such reactive measures are mere band-aids on a hemorrhage: We need stronger, long-term interventions to nip the vice in its bud. So, how can we bridge the divide? Here’s what we must do to defend our seniors and ourselves from falling prey to cyber-related crimes. First, we must invest in targeted education for our older population. That’s possible through developing awareness campaigns tailored to their needs and delivering them through accessible channels like community centers, libraries, and health care providers. Besides, America must expand the available victim support services such as psychological and financial counseling. That should go in tandem with educating the public on the need to destigmatize victimhood. This way, we can encourage targets of web-based fraud to open up about their ordeals, potentially outing their scammers for action. The financial and tech industry must also redouble its efforts to implement senior-friendly security measures and fraud detection protocols. Besides, they must ramp up their reporting of abnormal wire transfers, particularly those involving cryptocurrency or overseas accounts. Thus, they’ll help law enforcement track trends and assist potential online fraud targets. Families and communities must take the lead role in educating and protecting older relatives and neighbors. They should have open conversations about scams and teach seniors how to verify requests via offline channels, not a link in an email. Protecting seniors is more than a moral obligation The IC3 data reveals a troubling pattern of fraudsters innovating faster than institutions adapt. That makes protecting seniors not only moral but also economically pragmatic. Americans aged 60+ are a crucial demographic, so safeguarding their wealth is critical to sustaining consumer spending, healthcare systems, and intergenerational trust. The alternative? A future where retirement isn’t a reward for decades of work but a golden ticket for faceless predators. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

43808660,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152938,1745626840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking US Consumer Sentiment Fall: What It Means for Crypto,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-consumer-sentiment-fall/,"Economic indicators can often feel like abstract numbers, but they paint a crucial picture of the financial landscape that influences everything, including the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. The latest data on US Consumer Sentiment has just been released, and it’s certainly caught the market’s attention. For anyone tracking the pulse of the economy and its potential ripple effects on digital assets, understanding these figures is key. What Does Falling US Consumer Sentiment Really Tell Us? The headline figure comes from the University of Michigan’s closely watched survey. This survey is designed to gauge how optimistic or pessimistic consumers feel about their financial situation and the state of the economy overall. Why does this matter? Because consumer spending is a massive driver of economic activity in the United States. When people feel confident about their jobs and future finances, they’re more likely to spend money, which fuels growth. Conversely, when confidence drops, spending often tightens. The final reading for the University of Michigan Index in April registered at 52.2. While this was slightly above the preliminary estimate of 50.5, it still represents a significant decline and indicates a somber mood among consumers. A lower index number suggests that consumers are feeling less secure about the economy’s direction and their own financial prospects. This can lead to reduced spending on discretionary items, potentially impacting various sectors of the economy. Decoding the Mixed Signals on Inflation Expectations Beyond overall sentiment, the report also provides critical insights into consumer expectations about inflation. This is particularly relevant in the current economic climate, where rising prices have been a major concern. The April data presented a somewhat mixed picture: One-Year Inflation Expectations: These were revised slightly downwards to 6.5% from the preliminary reading of 6.7%. While a small decrease, it suggests consumers might be bracing for slightly less intense price hikes in the very near term compared to initial fears. Five- to Ten-Year Inflation Expectations: These remained stable at 4.4%. The fact that longer-term expectations didn’t budge is noteworthy. It suggests that despite some potential easing in the short term, consumers still anticipate elevated inflation persisting over a longer horizon. Why is this mixed signal important? Central banks, like the Federal Reserve, pay close attention to inflation expectations. If consumers and businesses widely expect high inflation to continue, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, influencing wage demands and pricing decisions. Stable long-term expectations at a relatively high level (4.4% is well above the Fed’s 2% target) could indicate that the Fed still has work to do to anchor these expectations lower. Why Does This Economic Data US Matter for Crypto? Now, let’s connect the dots to the crypto market. While not directly tied, macroeconomic indicators like consumer sentiment and inflation expectations have a significant indirect influence on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Here’s how: Risk Appetite: When consumer sentiment is low and economic uncertainty is high, investors often become more risk-averse. This can lead to a rotation out of perceived riskier assets, like many cryptocurrencies, into safer havens. Central Bank Policy: Data on inflation expectations directly impacts the Federal Reserve’s decisions regarding interest rates and monetary policy. If inflation expectations remain elevated, it increases the likelihood of the Fed maintaining a hawkish stance (higher rates, tighter liquidity). Tighter monetary policy generally creates a less favorable environment for risk assets like crypto. Disposable Income: Falling consumer sentiment can precede a reduction in discretionary spending. While institutional adoption is growing, a significant portion of crypto investment still comes from retail investors. If consumers feel less confident and have less disposable income due to inflation and economic worries, their capacity or willingness to invest in volatile assets like crypto might decrease. Essentially, this Economic Data US provides another piece of the puzzle that the market uses to forecast future economic conditions and, consequently, potential shifts in monetary policy and investor behavior. Potential Crypto Market Impact : What Could Happen Next? Interpreting the direct impact on the crypto market is complex, as many factors are at play. However, based on this data, here are some potential considerations: Increased Volatility: Markets often react to economic data releases, especially those that might influence Fed policy. The mixed signals on inflation and the drop in sentiment could contribute to continued volatility in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins as traders digest the implications. Pressure from Tighter Policy Fears: If the stable long-term inflation expectations reinforce the view that the Fed will keep rates higher for longer, this could put downward pressure on crypto prices, which have often thrived in environments of easy money. Focus on Inflation Hedge Narrative: Conversely, the persistent, albeit stable, longer-term inflation expectations might strengthen the narrative for assets like Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, although this correlation has been debated in recent market cycles. It’s important to remember that correlation is not causation, and the crypto market is influenced by its own unique dynamics, including technological developments, regulatory news, and market-specific events. However, ignoring the broader macroeconomic context, informed by data like the University of Michigan Index and Inflation Expectations , would be unwise for any serious crypto participant. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what should you take away from this report? Stay Informed: Continue monitoring key Economic Data US releases. Understanding the macro environment helps you contextualize market movements. Understand the Link: Recognize how consumer confidence and inflation data can influence central bank actions and overall market risk sentiment. Prepare for Volatility: Economic uncertainty often translates to market swings. Ensure your investment strategy accounts for potential volatility. Evaluate Your Thesis: If your crypto investment thesis relies heavily on specific macroeconomic conditions (e.g., high inflation requiring a hedge), assess whether the latest data supports or challenges that view. This data serves as a reminder that the crypto market doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It is increasingly intertwined with the traditional financial system and influenced by the same economic forces that shape global markets. Conclusion The April US Consumer Sentiment report, showing a notable decline to 52.2 alongside mixed Inflation Expectations (short-term easing slightly, long-term stable), underscores ongoing economic uncertainty. While the reading from the University of Michigan Index was slightly better than the dire preliminary estimate, it still points to cautious consumers. This Economic Data US is a critical piece of the puzzle for understanding potential shifts in monetary policy and overall investor sentiment, which can have a tangible Crypto Market Impact . As the economic picture continues to evolve, staying informed about these key indicators will be vital for navigating the complexities of the digital asset space.

Recently, news broke about a significant move involving the TRUMP Token , a popular political meme coin. Following the announcement of a Trump dinner, a major holder made a dramatic withdrawal, sparking widespread discussion about market sentiment and whale behavior. Unpacking the Massive Binance Withdrawal The focal point of this event is a substantial Binance Withdrawal executed by a crypto address known as “MeCo.” According to on-chain data tracked by EmberCN on X (formerly Twitter), this address pulled a staggering 1.195 million TRUMP tokens from the Binance exchange. At the time of the withdrawal, this amount was valued at approximately $15.76 million. Why is this particular withdrawal grabbing headlines? Here are a few key reasons: Scale: $15.7 million is a significant amount in the context of many altcoins, especially meme coins. Location: Withdrawing from a major exchange like Binance often suggests the holder intends to keep the assets for the long term, move them to cold storage for security, or potentially engage in over-the-counter (OTC) trades, rather than preparing to sell on the open market immediately. Timing: The withdrawal reportedly occurred shortly after the announcement of a Trump-related dinner event, leading to speculation about a potential connection. Understanding Crypto Whale Activity In the cryptocurrency world, individuals or entities holding large amounts of a particular digital asset are often referred to as “whales.” Their movements, especially large deposits to or withdrawals from exchanges, are closely watched because they have the potential to influence market prices due to the sheer volume they control. This recent move by “MeCo” is a prime example of notable Crypto Whale Activity . Monitoring whale wallets can sometimes offer insights into potential future market movements, although it’s crucial to remember that whale actions don’t guarantee specific outcomes and can sometimes be misleading or strategic. What Exactly is the TRUMP Token (MAGA Coin)? The TRUMP Token , often referred to as the MAGA Coin , is a cryptocurrency that emerged within the political meme coin niche. These tokens are typically created around political figures, movements, or events and gain value primarily through speculation, community hype, and their connection to current political narratives rather than underlying technology or utility. The TRUMP token specifically leverages the popularity and political brand of Donald Trump. Like other meme coins, its price can be extremely volatile and is heavily influenced by social media trends, news cycles, and the overall sentiment surrounding the figure it represents. The Trump Dinner Connection: Coincidence or Strategy? The timing of the $15.7 million withdrawal by the “MeCo” address, reportedly following the announcement of a Trump dinner, has fueled speculation. Was this timing a mere coincidence, or was it a strategic move by the whale? Possible interpretations include: Anticipation of Positive News: The whale might anticipate positive news or increased attention for the TRUMP token following the dinner, deciding to secure their holdings off-exchange. Long-Term Conviction: The dinner announcement might have reinforced the whale’s long-term belief in the token’s potential, prompting them to move assets to safer, non-exchange storage. Preparing for OTC: The withdrawal could be in preparation for a large over-the-counter (OTC) trade, which would have less direct impact on exchange spot prices compared to selling on Binance. Unrelated Timing: The withdrawal could be entirely unrelated to the dinner announcement, simply a coincidence based on the whale’s pre-planned asset management strategy. Without direct confirmation from the wallet owner, the exact motivation remains speculative, but the timing is undeniably intriguing in the context of Political Meme Coin dynamics. Meet the Other Giant: The “Sun” Address While “MeCo” made the headlines with its withdrawal, it’s worth noting the presence of another significant holder. According to the same report, the second-largest registrant of the TRUMP token is an address named “Sun.” This address is reportedly linked to the cold wallet of the HTX exchange and holds an even larger position, valued at approximately $15.52 million in TRUMP tokens. Here’s a quick comparison: Holder Name Approximate Holding Value (USD) Location/Association Recent Activity MeCo $15.76 million Private Wallet (withdrawn from Binance) Large withdrawal from Binance Sun $15.52 million HTX Exchange Cold Wallet Holding in exchange cold storage The fact that HTX holds a substantial amount in cold storage indicates exchange liquidity or potentially large client holdings managed by the exchange. However, the active withdrawal by “MeCo” from Binance represents a direct, conscious action by a single large holder. What This Means for the TRUMP Token Market Large movements by whales can impact market psychology and potentially liquidity. A significant withdrawal like this could be interpreted positively by some, suggesting a whale is bullish and intends to hold, thus reducing potential selling pressure on the exchange. However, it also highlights the concentration of wealth in the TRUMP Token market. A large portion of the token’s supply is held by a few entities, making the price potentially susceptible to their future decisions (whether to sell, transfer, or hold). For regular investors, this event serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility and speculative nature of tokens like the MAGA Coin . Prices can swing dramatically based on news, social sentiment, and the actions of large holders. Navigating the Political Meme Coin Space: Risks and Insights Investing in Political Meme Coin s like TRUMP comes with unique risks: Extreme Volatility: Prices are often driven by hype and news, not fundamentals. Political Sensitivity: Their value is tied to political events and the popularity of the associated figure. Whale Influence: Large holders can significantly impact market dynamics. Lack of Utility: Often, these tokens have no real-world use case beyond speculation. If you are considering investing or are already involved, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand exactly what you are investing in and its inherent risks. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Meme coins are highly speculative. Watch Whale Movements (with Caution): Be aware of large transfers, but don’t blindly follow whale actions without understanding the potential context. Stay Informed: Keep up with both crypto news and relevant political developments. Compelling Summary The cryptocurrency world witnessed a notable event as a significant Crypto Whale Activity unfolded involving the TRUMP Token . An address known as “MeCo” executed a substantial Binance Withdrawal of over $15.7 million worth of TRUMP tokens, reportedly following news of a Trump dinner. This move by a major MAGA Coin holder highlights the influence of whales and the speculative nature of Political Meme Coin s. While the exact reasons for the withdrawal remain open to interpretation, it underscores the importance of monitoring large holder movements and understanding the unique risks associated with this niche corner of the crypto market.

With sentiment shifting and bullish calls returning, many investors are once again eyeing a move toward six figures. However, not everything is as it seems beneath the surface. Despite the impressive price surge, risks remain, particularly as global tensions between the United States and China escalate. The ongoing trade war and geopolitical friction are injecting volatility into markets, creating a fragile backdrop for risk assets like Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms ‘A Huge Inverse Head & Shoulders’ – $20K Target In Sight? Top analyst Maartunn shared a stark view of the current state of the Bitcoin network, revealing on-chain metrics that paint a different picture. According to his analysis, the latest move higher is primarily driven by leverage and derivatives rather than strong organic demand. He noted that the Bitcoin network is, in his words, “a ghost town,” with very little new activity or visible inflows from real users. This disconnect between price and on-chain fundamentals suggests that the current rally may lack sustainability. As such, investors should approach the next phase of Bitcoin’s price action with caution, especially if macroeconomic conditions worsen or derivative positions begin to unwind. Bitcoin Faces Resistance: On-Chain Activity Lags Behind Bitcoin is now facing critical resistance as bulls attempt to reclaim the $95,000 level, a zone that could define short-term momentum. The recent breakout above the $88,600 resistance marked a key shift in market sentiment, with bulls taking control and pushing price action into a new range. However, to maintain this momentum, sustained demand will be essential. Analysts warn that a healthy retracement may occur before the next leg up, especially considering current market conditions. Volatility and uncertainty continue to dominate the landscape, with fear still lingering despite the recent rally. Much of this caution stems from ongoing global tensions and the unstable macro environment that has unfolded since US President Donald Trump’s re-election in November 2024. With tariffs rising and trade negotiations with China growing increasingly tense, investors remain hesitant to commit fully to risk assets. Top analyst Maartunn shared a sobering on-chain analysis on X, highlighting a disconnect between Bitcoin’s price action and network activity. According to his findings, the recent surge is largely driven by ETF flows and rising open interest in the derivatives market—factors that often precede a reversal rather than a sustainable rally. Maartunn describes the current state of the Bitcoin network as a “ghost-town,” noting a lack of new visible on-chain demand. This divergence between price and network fundamentals raises questions about the sustainability of the current move. For Bitcoin to push convincingly past $95K and set up a run toward $100K, stronger spot demand and an uptick in real user activity will likely be necessary. Until then, traders should remain cautious and watch key support levels closely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims Key Levels – New ATHs May Be Closer Than Expected Price Action Details: $95K In Sight Bitcoin is trading at $93,600 after several days of bullish price action that saw it reclaim key resistance levels. The price has now entered a consolidation phase around the $93K level, as bulls prepare for a potential breakout toward $95K. A sustained move above that mark would open the door for a push toward the highly anticipated $100K milestone, signaling renewed strength across the crypto market. However, the path forward remains uncertain. While short-term sentiment appears optimistic, Bitcoin must hold above the $90K support level to maintain bullish structure. A failure to do so could trigger a drop back toward the 200-day moving average near $88K—a level that has served as a key pivot for market structure over the past months. Related Reading: HBAR Breaks Above Massive Falling Wedge – Expert Sets $0.38 Target This zone is being closely watched by both traders and long-term holders, as a breakdown below $90K would likely undermine the current recovery momentum. As consolidation continues, the next few sessions will be critical in determining whether BTC has enough strength to break higher or if a short-term correction is in store. For now, all eyes are on $95K as the next hurdle in Bitcoin’s push to reclaim market dominance.

These operators are crucial for processing transactions and maintaining the network’s integrity. Recently, the Solana Foundation announced a pivotal change to its delegation program, a move set to reshape the landscape for many Solana validators and significantly impact Solana decentralization efforts. Understanding the Solana Foundation’s Delegation Program For a long time, the Solana Foundation has played a vital role in bootstrapping the network’s validator set by delegating SOL tokens to operators. This delegation helps validators meet the minimum staking requirements needed to participate in consensus and earn rewards. While effective in the early stages, this approach can lead to a concentration of stake originating from a single entity, potentially raising concerns about true decentralization. The delegation program aimed to: Help new validators get started. Support validators contributing to the network in various ways (geographic diversity, client diversity, etc.). Increase the overall staked amount on the network. However, a key challenge has been fostering organic, community-driven Solana staking rather than reliance on foundation-backed stake. What Exactly is Changing for Solana Validators? The core of the new policy is a deliberate reduction in the Foundation’s direct influence on stake distribution. Here’s the breakdown: Targeted Removal: The Foundation will begin removing delegations from existing validators. Ratio Rule: For every new validator added to the delegation program, three long-standing validators will have their Foundation stake removed. This 3-for-1 ratio accelerates the shift away from older, potentially less community-supported nodes. Eligibility Criteria: The primary target for removal appears to be validators holding less than 1,000 SOL in external, non-Foundation stake. This threshold is designed to identify validators who haven’t yet built significant community support. This strategic move is designed to encourage validators to attract stake from individual holders and institutions, fostering a more robust and decentralized network validated by the community itself. Who Will Be Impacted by This Shift? This change isn’t just a theoretical adjustment; it has real-world implications for many operators running crypto validators on the Solana network. Blockworks Research estimates that approximately 150 validators could be affected by this new policy. These are likely the validators who have relied heavily on Foundation delegation and have not yet managed to attract substantial stake from the broader Solana community. For these impacted validators, the loss of Foundation stake could significantly reduce their total staked amount, potentially impacting their ability to earn rewards and remain competitive. It’s a clear signal that the era of relying solely on Foundation support is ending. Why is Solana Decentralization So Important? Decentralization is a cornerstone principle of blockchain technology. For Solana, increasing decentralization through community-backed Solana staking offers several critical benefits: Enhanced Security: A more distributed stake across a wider variety of independent operators reduces the risk of collusion or single points of failure. If stake is too concentrated, it can make the network more vulnerable to attacks. Increased Resilience: With stake spread across numerous independent entities globally, the network becomes more resistant to outages, censorship, and geopolitical risks. No single government or entity can easily shut down a widely decentralized network. Community Ownership: When the community holds and delegates stake, they have a direct vested interest in the network’s health and success. This fosters a stronger, more engaged ecosystem. Reduced Protocol Risk: Over-reliance on Foundation stake can create a perception of centralized control, which some users and developers might view as a risk. Shifting towards community stake mitigates this. This move by the Solana Foundation is a deliberate step towards achieving a more mature and truly decentralized state for the network, aligning with the broader goals of blockchain technology. Challenges and Opportunities for Affected Validators While the long-term goal is positive for Solana decentralization , the transition presents challenges for the affected Solana validators : Challenge: Attracting Community Stake: Validators losing Foundation stake must now actively compete for delegations from individual SOL holders, staking pools, and institutions. This requires strong operational performance, community engagement, and potentially lower commission rates. Opportunity: Building a Brand: This change forces validators to differentiate themselves. Those who successfully attract community stake will build a reputation for reliability and trustworthiness, positioning them for long-term success in the ecosystem. Challenge: Potential Exit: Some smaller operators who cannot attract sufficient external stake may find it difficult to remain profitable and might choose to exit the validator set. Opportunity: Innovation: The increased competition could spur innovation among validators, leading to better tools, services, and community interaction to attract stakers. Validators impacted by this policy shift need to view it not just as a challenge, but as a catalyst to strengthen their operations and community ties. Focusing on performance, transparency, and active participation in the Solana ecosystem will be key. Looking Ahead: The Future of Solana Staking The Solana Foundation’s decision marks a significant milestone in the network’s journey towards greater decentralization. By strategically reducing its own stake and encouraging community delegation, Solana is aiming for a validator set that is more resilient, secure, and reflective of its distributed user base. This policy is likely just one step in a longer process. As the network matures, the dynamics of Solana staking will continue to evolve, with community stake becoming the dominant force securing the chain. This is a positive development for the network’s health and its long-term viability in the competitive blockchain landscape. Conclusion The Solana Foundation’s plan to trim validator support, specifically targeting nodes with limited external stake, is a bold and necessary step towards enhancing Solana decentralization . While posing challenges for some existing Solana validators , the move ultimately strengthens the network by fostering a more community-reliant and resilient staking ecosystem. This strategic shift underscores Solana’s commitment to becoming a truly decentralized and robust blockchain platform, driven by the collective power of its users and stakers.

43809501,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152945,1745628630,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Astounding Google AI Search Growth Reshapes Information Discovery,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-ai-search-growth/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology and information, Google’s strategic pivot towards integrating artificial intelligence into its core search product is yielding significant results. For anyone following the intersection of tech giants and innovation, understanding the surge in Google AI Search adoption is crucial. It’s not just about new features; it’s a fundamental shift in how people access information, driven by deliberate design and powerful AI capabilities. Witnessing Remarkable AI Search Growth Google’s recent announcements highlight a remarkable acceleration in the adoption and usage of its AI-powered search features. This isn’t accidental; it’s the outcome of continuous development and strategic rollout. The numbers speak volumes about the impact these features are having: AI Overviews: Launched two years ago, this feature provides AI-summarized results directly at the top of the search page. It’s now used by over 1.5 billion users monthly across more than 100 countries. Circle to Search: This intuitive feature allows users to highlight anything on their smartphone screen and get instant search results. Available on over 250 million devices, its usage grew by close to 40% quarter-over-quarter. Google Lens: Google’s multimodal AI search technology, Lens, has seen searches increase by 5 billion since October, indicating a strong trend towards visual search. This overall AI Search Growth underscores Google’s commitment to redefining the search experience. What Are AI Overviews and Why Do They Matter? One of the most prominent examples of Google’s AI integration is AI Overviews . When you perform a search, especially for informational queries like “What is generative AI?”, AI Overviews compile information from various web sources to provide a concise, AI-generated summary at the very top of your results. This aims to give users quick answers without needing to click through multiple links. While this feature is a boon for users seeking rapid information, it has sparked debate within the publishing industry, with some reporting a decrease in traffic as users get answers directly on the search results page. However, for Google, AI Overviews represent a significant opportunity to enhance user engagement within the Search platform and potentially unlock new revenue streams, such as the ads that were introduced within AI Overviews last October. Circle to Search and Google Lens: Expanding How We Search Beyond traditional text-based queries, Google is pushing the boundaries with features like Circle to Search and Google Lens . Circle to Search, available on compatible smartphones, lets you simply circle, highlight, scribble on, or tap an image or text on your screen to trigger a search without leaving the current app. This seamless integration of search into device interaction is incredibly powerful and contributes significantly to Google’s stated goal of making information more accessible and contextual. Similarly, Google Lens transforms your smartphone camera into a search bar. By pointing your camera at objects, text, or landmarks, you can get relevant information. The substantial growth in Google Lens usage, including a more than 10% increase in shopping searches via Lens in Q1, demonstrates a clear user appetite for visual and multimodal search experiences. AI Mode: Google’s Answer to Chat-Based Search? The rise of conversational AI interfaces like ChatGPT has prompted Google to explore similar models within Search. AI Mode, currently being tested, allows users to engage with Google Search using complex questions and follow-up prompts in a more natural, chat-like flow. This move signals Google’s intention to compete directly with emerging chat-based search alternatives like Perplexity, ensuring Google Search remains the primary gateway to information, regardless of the interaction style users prefer. Navigating Regulatory Headwinds Amidst Growth The impressive AI Search Growth occurs against a backdrop of intense regulatory scrutiny. Google is currently facing significant legal challenges regarding its search practices. The U.S. Department of Justice has pursued action alleging an illegal online search monopoly, and a federal judge has ruled that Google holds an adtech monopoly, potentially leading to a breakup of parts of the company. While these legal battles focus on existing market dominance, the expansion of AI into search, and its potential impact on competition and publisher traffic, will likely remain a key area of interest for regulators moving forward. Summary: The Future of Search is AI-Powered Google’s latest earnings report paints a clear picture: AI is no longer just an experimental add-on to Search; it’s becoming its central nervous system.

A recent announcement from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) highlights one such potential catalyst: the future of existing US tariffs . According to reports from JinSe Finance, the USTR has confirmed that President Trump holds the ultimate authority to decide on alternative measures regarding the current 10% tariffs imposed on various countries. This isn’t just bureaucratic jargon; it’s a signal that significant changes to trade policy could be on the horizon, with potentially far-reaching consequences for the global economy and, by extension, financial markets, including digital assets. What Does the USTR Announcement Really Mean? The core of the USTR’s statement is clarity on the decision-making power. While trade bodies and advisors provide input, the final say on whether to maintain, modify, or eliminate the 10% tariffs rests solely with President Trump. This indicates that any shift won’t come from lower-level negotiations but from a directive at the highest level of the U.S. government. Presidential Authority: The announcement underscores the President’s significant power in setting U.S. trade policy. Focus on 10% Tariffs: The specific mention of the 10% rate points to a potential review of a particular set of tariffs, often those applied broadly to certain goods or countries during previous trade disputes. “Alternative Measures”: This phrase is key. It suggests options beyond simply keeping the tariffs as they are. It could mean reducing the percentage, lifting them entirely for certain goods or countries, or implementing different trade tools. Understanding the context of these Trump tariffs is crucial. They were often implemented as leverage in trade negotiations or as a response to perceived unfair trade practices. Their potential removal or reduction signals a possible shift in strategy or a response to current economic conditions. A Look Back: The Era of Trump Tariffs During his previous term, President Trump made the use of tariffs a prominent tool in his trade policy arsenal. These weren’t limited to a single country but spanned various trading partners, most notably China, but also allies over specific disputes like steel and aluminum imports. The 10% tariff rate was applied to a wide range of goods, impacting supply chains and increasing costs for importers and consumers. The rationale was often to protect domestic industries, encourage manufacturing within the U.S., or force trading partners to the negotiating table to address trade imbalances or intellectual property concerns. The implementation of these tariffs led to retaliatory tariffs from affected countries, creating complex trade disputes that impacted global trade flows and introduced significant uncertainty into the international business environment. What Are the Potential “Alternative Measures”? The USTR’s mention of alternative measures opens up several possibilities. What could these alternatives look like? Here are a few scenarios: Alternative Measure Description Potential Implication Complete Removal Lifting the 10% tariffs on all affected goods/countries. Significant cost reduction for importers, potential boost to trade, positive market sentiment. Partial Reduction Lowering the tariff rate (e.g., from 10% to 5%). Moderate cost reduction, partial easing of trade tensions. Targeted Exemptions Removing tariffs for specific goods, industries, or companies. Benefits specific sectors, requires complex administration. Conditional Removal Lifting tariffs based on trade partners meeting certain conditions (e.g., purchasing more U.S. goods). Tied to negotiation outcomes, could be part of a larger trade deal. Shifting Focus Replacing broad tariffs with more targeted measures like quotas or specific import restrictions. Different mechanism for controlling trade flows, could still cause market disruption. Each of these measures would have a distinct economic impact , affecting different industries and potentially altering global supply chains. The choice of measure would likely depend on the specific goals President Trump aims to achieve – whether it’s stimulating the economy, gaining leverage in new negotiations, or addressing specific trade grievances. How Could Tariff Changes Impact the Economy? Changes to significant tariffs like the 10% rate can have ripple effects throughout the economy. Understanding these potential impacts is key to assessing the broader market environment. Potential Benefits of Reducing/Lifting Tariffs: Lower Costs for Businesses and Consumers: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imports. Reducing or removing them lowers the cost of imported goods, which can decrease input costs for businesses and lead to lower prices for consumers, potentially easing inflationary pressures. Boost to International Trade: Reduced trade barriers generally encourage more trade, benefiting companies involved in importing and exporting. This can lead to increased economic activity. Improved Supply Chain Efficiency: Tariffs can force companies to reroute supply chains or find alternative, potentially more expensive, suppliers. Removing tariffs can allow companies to optimize their supply chains based on efficiency rather than tariff avoidance. Positive Market Sentiment: Easing trade tensions is often viewed positively by financial markets, as it reduces uncertainty and can signal a more stable global economic environment. Potential Challenges/Risks: Domestic Industry Concerns: Industries that benefited from tariff protection might face renewed competition from imports if tariffs are removed. Negotiation Hurdles: Reaching agreements with trade partners on reciprocal actions can be complex and time-consuming. Market Volatility: The process of debating and implementing tariff changes can create uncertainty, leading to market fluctuations until a clear decision is made. Impact on Government Revenue: Tariffs generate revenue for the government. Reducing them would require finding alternative revenue sources or accepting lower income. The net economic impact will depend heavily on the scope and nature of the changes, as well as the reaction of U.S. trading partners. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? While tariffs might seem distant from Bitcoin and altcoins, they are a significant factor in the macroeconomic environment that heavily influences the crypto market. Here’s the connection: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often viewed through different lenses – as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, or a risk asset. Their performance can be tied to broader economic trends and investor sentiment. Macro Sentiment: Changes in trade policy significantly impact overall market sentiment. Positive developments (like easing tensions) can increase investor confidence and risk appetite, potentially leading to increased investment in assets like crypto. Negative developments (like new trade disputes) can increase uncertainty and lead investors to seek safer assets, potentially pressuring crypto prices. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs can contribute to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods. If removing tariffs helps reduce inflation, it could influence central bank policies (like interest rates), which in turn affect liquidity and investment flows into risk assets like crypto. U.S. Dollar Strength: Trade policy can impact the strength of the U.S. dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes correlate with weaker performance in assets like Bitcoin (the ‘digital gold’ narrative), while a weaker dollar might make dollar-denominated assets like crypto more attractive to international investors. Global Economic Growth: Tariffs and trade disputes can hinder global trade and economic growth. Policies that stimulate trade could support stronger global growth, creating a more favorable environment for risk assets. Therefore, President Trump’s decision on these US tariffs is not just a trade story; it’s an economic signal that crypto investors should monitor closely as part of their broader market analysis. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Given the potential for significant policy shifts, how should a crypto investor approach this news? Stay Informed: Follow news from the USTR, the White House, and major financial news outlets regarding trade policy discussions and announcements. Watch Market Reactions: Observe how traditional markets (stocks, commodities, forex) react to trade news. These reactions often provide clues about broader market sentiment that can spill over into crypto. Assess Macro Context: Continuously evaluate the overall macroeconomic environment – inflation data, interest rate expectations, economic growth forecasts – and consider how potential tariff changes fit into this picture. Consider Diversification: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance, acknowledging that macro events like trade policy shifts can introduce volatility. Don’t Overreact: Avoid making impulsive trading decisions based on speculation. Wait for concrete policy announcements and assess their likely real-world impact before making significant portfolio changes. The future of the Trump tariffs is a key piece of the puzzle in understanding the potential economic trajectory, and its influence on financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Conclusion: The Ball is in the President’s Court The USTR’s confirmation that President Trump will decide the fate of the 10% US tariffs underscores the significant influence executive decisions can have on trade policy and the resulting economic impact . Whether he chooses to lift, reduce, or modify these tariffs, the decision will send clear signals to domestic industries, international trading partners, and financial markets alike. For those navigating the crypto space, understanding these macro-level developments, particularly concerning global trade and the potential easing or heightening of trade tensions, is vital. It’s a reminder that the crypto market doesn’t exist in a vacuum but is intertwined with the broader forces shaping the world economy. The coming months could bring clarity on this front, potentially setting the stage for new economic trends that will undoubtedly be felt in the digital asset landscape.

Gitcoin , a well-known platform connecting developers and projects with funding through quadratic funding and grants, has announced a significant change. Its core development firm, responsible for building and maintaining key parts of the platform, is set to close its doors. The Crucial News: Grants Lab Shutdown Confirmed The core development team behind Gitcoin, known as Grants Lab , is scheduled to shut down operations on May 31st. This announcement has sent ripples through the community that relies on the platform for crypto grants and ecosystem funding. The primary reason cited for this difficult decision is the lack of a clear pathway towards profitability for Grants Lab. Building and maintaining public goods infrastructure in the Web3 space is notoriously challenging from a business perspective, and it seems Grants Lab ultimately couldn’t find a sustainable financial model. What the Grants Lab Shutdown Means for Gitcoin Grants The immediate and most direct impact of the Grants Lab shutdown is on the maintenance and development of the Grants Stack product. Grants Stack is a crucial tool used by communities and projects to run their own grant rounds on Gitcoin. With the core team disbanding, maintenance for Grants Stack will be discontinued. This doesn’t necessarily mean the product will immediately break, but it implies that bug fixes, updates, and new features from this specific team will cease. This could potentially pose challenges for those relying heavily on Grants Stack for their Web3 funding initiatives. Here’s a quick look at the immediate implications: Discontinuation of Grants Stack Maintenance: No more updates or dedicated support from the Grants Lab team. Potential Impact on Future Development: The roadmap for Grants Stack under Grants Lab is effectively halted. Shift in Responsibility: The future of Grants Stack development and maintenance will likely need to fall to the broader Gitcoin DAO and community. Navigating the Future of Crypto Grants and Web3 Funding The news highlights the inherent difficulties in sustaining infrastructure for public goods within the decentralized ecosystem. While Gitcoin Grants has been incredibly successful in distributing funding and fostering development, the business model for the entities supporting the underlying technology remains complex. This situation raises important questions about the future of crypto grants and how decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can effectively fund and manage the development of the tools they rely on. Can the community step up to maintain Grants Stack? Will new teams emerge to take over development? These are critical points the Gitcoin DAO will need to address. Despite this challenge, the Gitcoin platform itself, managed by the Gitcoin DAO, is expected to continue operating. The community and DAO have been increasingly involved in governance and operations, and this event may accelerate the decentralization process further. Actionable Insights for Users and Communities If you are a project relying on Grants Stack or a regular participant in Gitcoin Grants rounds, here are a few things to consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on announcements from the Gitcoin DAO regarding the future of Grants Stack and platform maintenance. Explore Alternatives/Contingencies: While the platform isn’t shutting down, understand the implications for Grants Stack and consider potential backup plans if its functionality becomes critical to your operations. Engage with the DAO: If you’re a GTC token holder or an active community member, participate in governance discussions about how the DAO plans to address this gap. Support Community Initiatives: Look out for and support any community-led efforts to fork or maintain Grants Stack. The Grants Lab shutdown is undoubtedly a setback for a specific part of the Gitcoin ecosystem, but it also serves as a stark reminder of the challenges and opportunities in building sustainable infrastructure for Web3 public goods. The resilience and adaptability of the decentralized community will be key in navigating this transition. Summary: A Turning Point for Gitcoin The upcoming shutdown of Grants Lab on May 31st marks a significant turning point for Gitcoin , specifically impacting the maintenance of its Grants Stack product. Driven by profitability challenges, this event underscores the complexities of funding development in the Web3 funding landscape. While the immediate future of Grants Stack maintenance is uncertain, the broader Gitcoin platform and its commitment to fostering crypto grants are expected to continue, relying more heavily on the decentralized efforts of the DAO and its community to navigate these new waters.

According to recent reports circulating on social media, specifically from Solid Intel on X, payment processing giant Stripe is diving headfirst into the digital asset space with the development of its very own Stripe stablecoin product. This isn’t just idle speculation; the reports suggest that Stripe is actively working on this new offering and is planning to kick off beta testing in the near future. If confirmed and successful, this move could have significant implications for how businesses and consumers interact with digital currencies, potentially bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto economy. Understanding the Significance of Stablecoin Development Before we delve deeper into what a Stripe stablecoin could mean, let’s quickly touch upon why stablecoins are such a crucial part of the crypto ecosystem. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, or sometimes to commodities or other cryptocurrencies. This stability makes them ideal for transactions, savings, and other financial activities where price swings are undesirable. They offer the benefits of blockchain technology – speed, lower costs, global reach – without the speculative risk associated with more volatile digital assets. The ongoing stablecoin development across the industry is a key indicator of crypto’s maturation and its potential for real-world use cases beyond speculation. Why Stripe’s Entry into Stablecoins Matters Stripe is a behemoth in the online payment processing world, serving millions of businesses globally, from small startups to large enterprises. Their infrastructure powers e-commerce, subscriptions, and various other digital transactions. When a company with Stripe’s reach and reputation considers building a stablecoin, it signals a significant shift in the mainstream adoption of digital assets. Stripe has previously shown interest in the crypto space, exploring integrations and payment options. However, developing their *own* stablecoin suggests a deeper commitment and a vision for how digital currencies can be integrated directly into their core payment rails. This could dramatically simplify how businesses handle crypto payments , removing many of the current complexities and volatilities. The Potential Benefits of Stripe’s Stablecoin Development What advantages might a Stripe stablecoin bring to the table? Here are a few potential benefits: Ease of Integration: Businesses already using Stripe could potentially integrate stablecoin payments with minimal friction, leveraging their existing infrastructure. Reduced Volatility Risk: By using a stablecoin, businesses accepting crypto payments would be shielded from the price fluctuations of assets like Bitcoin, simplifying accounting and pricing. Faster Settlements: Stablecoins operate on blockchain networks, which can offer faster settlement times compared to traditional banking systems, especially for international transactions. Lower Transaction Costs: Depending on the underlying blockchain and Stripe’s fee structure, stablecoin transactions could potentially be cheaper than traditional payment methods or even other crypto payment solutions. Global Accessibility: Stablecoins can be sent and received anywhere with internet access, potentially opening up new markets and customer bases for businesses. New Financial Products: A native Stripe stablecoin could potentially pave the way for other integrated financial services within the Stripe ecosystem, such as lending or yield-bearing accounts. The potential impact on facilitating seamless crypto payments for businesses of all sizes is immense. It could make accepting digital currency as straightforward as accepting a credit card today. Navigating the Challenges of Fintech Integration with Stablecoins While the potential is exciting, launching a stablecoin product, especially for a company like Stripe, comes with significant challenges. The landscape of fintech integration with cryptocurrencies is complex and rapidly evolving. Key hurdles include: Regulatory Compliance: Stablecoins are under increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Stripe would need to navigate a complex web of financial regulations, KYC/AML requirements, and potential licensing issues in every jurisdiction they operate in. Technical Implementation: Choosing the right blockchain network, ensuring scalability, security, and interoperability with existing systems is a major technical undertaking. Custody and Security: Handling large volumes of digital assets requires robust security infrastructure to prevent hacks and theft. User Adoption: While stablecoins offer benefits, educating businesses and consumers and driving adoption requires significant effort and trust-building. Competition: The stablecoin market already has established players like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). Stripe’s offering would need to differentiate itself and gain market share. Successful fintech integration in this space requires not just technical prowess but also a deep understanding of the regulatory environment and user needs. What Stripe Crypto Users and Businesses Can Expect For businesses already using Stripe or considering accepting Stripe crypto payments in the future, this development is definitely one to watch closely. The beta testing phase will be crucial in revealing the specifics of Stripe’s offering – which stablecoin standard it will use (e.g., ERC-20), the underlying blockchain, the fee structure, and the integration process. If the product moves beyond beta and launches widely, it could become a standard option within the Stripe dashboard, sitting alongside credit cards, digital wallets, and other payment methods. This would dramatically lower the barrier to entry for businesses wanting to accept digital currency. Beta Testing: The Next Step The report of impending beta testing is a strong indicator that Stripe’s stablecoin development is progressing beyond the conceptual stage. Beta tests typically involve a limited group of users or businesses trying out the product in a real-world environment to identify bugs, gather feedback, and refine the user experience before a wider release. Who might be included in the beta? Likely existing Stripe merchants who are open to experimenting with new payment technologies, or perhaps partners in the crypto or fintech space. The insights gained during this phase will be critical in shaping the final product. Looking Ahead: The Future of Fintech and Crypto Payments Stripe’s potential entry into the stablecoin market through dedicated stablecoin development is more than just a new product launch; it’s a powerful signal about the future direction of online commerce and finance. It suggests that major fintech players see digital assets, particularly stablecoins, as a viable and potentially superior alternative for certain types of transactions. Successful fintech integration of stablecoins by a company like Stripe could accelerate mainstream adoption of digital currencies for everyday transactions, moving them beyond the realm of pure investment or speculation. This could, in turn, spur further innovation in crypto payments and related services. Actionable Insights If you’re a business owner using Stripe or interested in accepting crypto: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Stripe regarding their stablecoin plans. Understand Stablecoins: Familiarize yourself with how stablecoins work and their potential benefits for your business. Assess Your Needs: Consider if integrating stablecoin payments aligns with your customer base and business model. For developers and entrepreneurs in the crypto space, this highlights the growing demand for robust, compliant, and user-friendly solutions that bridge crypto and traditional finance. Conclusion The news that Stripe is developing a Stripe stablecoin product and moving towards beta testing is undeniably exciting. It represents a significant potential leap forward for fintech integration and the mainstream adoption of crypto payments .

A recent report from CoinShares has revealed a significant jump in the cost to produce one Bitcoin, reaching figures that might surprise many. What Did the Latest CoinShares Bitcoin Report Uncover? According to the detailed analysis by CoinShares, a leading digital asset investment firm, the weighted average cash cost for listed Bitcoin mining companies to mine just one Bitcoin saw a dramatic increase in the final quarter of 2024. Specifically, the report indicates this cost hit an average of $82,162 in Q4 2024. This figure isn’t just a small uptick; it represents a substantial 47% increase when compared to the previous quarter (Q3 2024). This sharp rise in the average BTC mining cost highlights the evolving economic landscape for professional miners operating at scale. It’s important to note that this specific figure from the CoinShares Bitcoin report focuses on the ‘cash cost’ for publicly traded mining companies. This typically includes operational expenses like electricity, hosting fees, and direct labor, but might exclude significant capital expenditures on new hardware. What’s Driving These Soaring Bitcoin Mining Costs? Several factors likely contributed to this significant surge in Bitcoin mining costs during Q4 2024. Understanding these drivers provides crucial insight into the pressures faced by the industry: The Post-Halving Environment: The Bitcoin halving event, which occurred in April 2024, cut the block reward for miners by half. While the raw cost per hash might not change drastically overnight, the reward per unit of work is halved. This means miners need twice the efficiency (or higher Bitcoin prices) to maintain the same revenue, effectively increasing the cost *per Bitcoin mined* if other factors remain constant or increase. Increased Network Difficulty: As more powerful mining hardware comes online and more participants join the network, the computational difficulty required to mine a block increases. Miners need to deploy more hash rate (and thus consume more energy and capital) to find a block, pushing the Bitcoin production cost higher. Energy Price Volatility: Electricity is the single largest operational expense for Bitcoin miners. Fluctuations and increases in global or regional energy prices directly impact the cash cost of mining. Q4 2024 could have seen unfavorable energy price movements in key mining regions. Investment in Newer Hardware: While cash cost often excludes CapEx, the *need* to invest in newer, more efficient Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) is a constant pressure. Less efficient machines become unprofitable faster in a high-difficulty, low-reward environment, forcing miners to upgrade, which adds to the overall economic burden, even if not immediately reflected in the ‘cash cost’ metric reported. These combined pressures create a challenging environment, pushing the average crypto mining costs upwards for large-scale operations. How Does This Impact Listed Bitcoin Miners? A BTC mining cost of $82,162 per coin presents significant implications for the profitability and strategy of listed mining companies: Profitability Squeeze: If the market price of Bitcoin is below or close to this cash cost, miners face severe pressure on their profit margins. This can lead to selling treasury reserves to cover operational expenses or even shutting down less efficient machines. Focus on Efficiency: The high cost environment accelerates the need for operational efficiency. Miners must secure the lowest possible energy costs and deploy the most energy-efficient hardware to remain competitive. Potential Consolidation: Smaller or less efficient mining operations may struggle to survive at these cost levels, potentially leading to consolidation within the industry as stronger players acquire distressed assets. Balance Sheet Management: Companies with strong balance sheets and access to capital are better positioned to navigate periods of high costs by investing in infrastructure or holding mined Bitcoin during unfavorable market conditions relative to their production cost. Understanding the CoinShares Bitcoin report gives investors a clearer picture of the operational health and challenges facing these companies. Does the Cost of Mining Influence Bitcoin’s Price? This is a complex and debated topic. While the Bitcoin production cost doesn’t act as a strict price floor in the short term (miners might sell below cost if necessary), some argue that over the long term, the cost of production provides a fundamental baseline. If the price consistently stays below the cost for a significant portion of the network, it could lead to miners shutting down, difficulty adjusting downwards, and potentially reducing selling pressure, which could indirectly support the price. However, the market price is driven by supply and demand from a wide range of participants, not just miners. While miner economics are a significant factor in the supply side, they are not the sole determinant of Bitcoin’s value. Key Takeaways and Future Outlook The CoinShares report highlighting the rise in Bitcoin mining costs to $82,162 in Q4 2024 underscores the increasing operational challenges in the post-halving era. This figure, representing the weighted average cash cost for listed miners, serves as a critical benchmark for the industry. The significant 47% quarterly increase points to the combined effects of the halving, network difficulty increases, and potentially rising energy prices. For miners, this necessitates a relentless focus on securing low-cost power and deploying the most efficient hardware to maintain profitability. The landscape for crypto mining costs is constantly shifting. As we move forward, the industry will likely see continued innovation in mining technology and energy sourcing. The ability of miners to adapt to these rising costs will be crucial for their long-term viability and will continue to shape the dynamics of the Bitcoin network.

The streamlined, more transparent criteria have led many to suspect that Pi is about to be listed on the world’s largest crypto trading exchange. Binance overhauls the listing process with new structured paths for digital assets Binance recently announced they were changing their listing process when adding digital assets. The exchange has now divided its new listing procedure into three main paths – Alpha, Futures, and Spot – each type has a different set of requirements. This structured model heavily emphasizes factors such as user adoption, tokenomics, technical security, and trading profile. The goal is to ensure that only trusted, secure, scalable tokens are onboarded. Binance Alpha is an early access path for projects in development. To be considered, a project needs to show proven utility and ongoing development, have an established user base, and be capable of token distribution. Red flags are raised by tokens that insiders overwhelmingly hold. Full technical and compliance verifications are necessary as well. Binance scrutinizes project teams for regulatory red flags like sanctions or financial chicanery and carries out technical reviews to catch bugs and past security breaches. For existing assets trading elsewhere (e.g., BitMart, other exchanges), selecting assets to add onto the Futures and Spot trading platform will also need to satisfy Binance’s standards of trading volume, liquidity, market cap, and price stability before listing. These clearer standards are intended to create simpler, more predictable processes for developers and communities as they consider what listings should look like in the future. Pi Coin gains momentum with strong community support and regulatory progress Pi Coin was recently overwhelmingly voted for in a Binance community vote , with nearly 295,000 voters voting for the listing, or around 86%. While not a formal endorsement, the poll indicated how well-liked Pi is in the community. The Pi Coin, on the other hand, has also been in the news lately as Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin tweeted that Pi Coin has been back on trading on BitMart after a one-month suspension over Know Your Business (KYB) compliance risks. The return of the token signifies a step toward regulatory conformity, which is an integral part of Binance’s revised list of conditions. With a powerful community and rising visibility, Pi’s moves to meet compliance might increase the possibility of it passing Binance’s review. CoinMarketCap said Pi Coin traded at $0.6470 at press time, reflecting a 0.52% dip over the previous 24 hours. Despite ongoing market volatility and difficulty maintaining a price above $1, Pi appears to stabilize as investor interest picks up. Dr. Altcoin revealed that the Pi Network team has been buying coins from crypto exchanges to help reduce the selling pressure on the token. So far, the team has allegedly used a sub-wallet to buy over 48 million coins from these exchanges. Meanwhile, the team has also made progress in the ecosystem to help drive the token’s utility. The expert revealed that they recently approved the decentralized application FruityPi. He also mentioned that the team could approve other dApps soon. Amid these developments, analysts like Moon Jeff say that the Pi coin price could rally to as high as $5, marking a new all-time high.

The lawsuit was filed on Friday in Brooklyn, New York. Lead plaintiff, Australian investor Jagdeep Cheema, claims Nike’s move to shut down RTFKT in December 2024 abruptly wiped out the NFTs’ value. The digital assets were made and sold under the brands Nike and RTFKT. Buyers have complained that Nike pulled the plug on the project without warning. The NFTs have since cooled off. Some of the NFTs stopped correctly showing images, which compounded worries that the assets would no longer be supported. The plaintiffs say in their legal filing that they would not have purchased any of the NFTs had they been aware they were unregistered securities. They also say they wouldn’t have invested if they had known Nike might cancel the project so quickly. The group is seeking damages of at least $5 million. The lawsuit claims that Nike violated consumer protection laws in several U.S. states, including New York, California, Florida, and Oregon. Based in Beaverton, Oregon, Nike has not yet commented on the lawsuit. Lawsuit wants courts to define NFTs as securities An even more fundamental legal inquiry for those in litigation is: Are NFTs securities ? It’s a problem that United States regulators and courts are still wrestling with. It’s something that many investors are concerned about: what rights and protections are in place when they buy this asset. The group claims in the suit that Nike sold the NFTs without registering them with financial agencies. That, they say, flies in the face of laws to protect investors. The case is part of a rising wave of litigation involving NFTs and crypto assets. As digital collectibles caught on, firms rushing to cash in sometimes operate without clearly established rules or accountability. This case could set a precedent for addressing losses tied to NFTs. Phillip Kim, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, did not immediately return a request for additional comment about the case. Users report glitches in RTFKT NFTs after shutdown RTFKT, pronounced “artifact,” was once hailed as Nike’s big play in the future of fashion and gaming. The athletic giant bought the startup in December 2021, describing it as a bold move into the next generation of collectibles. However, after the service shut down in December 2024, numerous users said they had experienced technical issues with their NFTs. For instance, the photos of the popular items in the clone nodes of the Clone X series were not shown. Instead, prospective purchasers received a “holding page” from Cloudflare — a provider of web services — indicating that the content had been removed. This led to speculation that Nike had stopped paying for the servers or server platforms that hosted the NFT visuals. Some digital art has resurfaced online since then, but the episode prompted serious questions about a piece of digital art tied to a centralized service and its long-term value. In December, Nike said the innovation that RTFKT brought will live on through the many creators and projects it inspired. But that promise rings hollow for many purchasers.

43810999,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152957,1745631646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Green Card Denial for OpenAI Researcher Highlights US Immigration Challenges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-researcher-green-card/,"In the fast-evolving world of AI, talent is everything. For many in the tech and even crypto spheres, which often intersect with AI advancements, the movement of skilled individuals is a critical factor. A recent development involving an OpenAI researcher has sent ripples through the community, highlighting significant hurdles faced by international experts contributing to US innovation. What Happened with the OpenAI Researcher’s Green Card? Kai Chen, a Canadian AI researcher who has been working at OpenAI and living in the U.S. for 12 years, recently had her green card application denied. This news came to light through a post on X by Noam Brown, a prominent research scientist at OpenAI. Brown expressed deep concern, stating that Chen learned of the decision on a Friday and now faces leaving the country soon. Brown emphasized Chen’s value, calling her one of the best AI researchers he has collaborated with. He warned that losing such individuals risks America’s leadership position in AI. Another OpenAI employee, Dylan Hunn, confirmed Chen’s crucial role in the development of GPT-4.5, one of OpenAI’s key AI models. Understanding the Green Card Denial Green card applications can be denied for various reasons, which are not always publicly disclosed. Importantly, this decision does not immediately cost Chen her job at OpenAI. According to Brown’s follow-up post, Chen plans to work remotely from Vancouver, Canada, hoping the situation can be resolved. However, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the barriers foreign AI talent faces when seeking to live and work long-term in the U.S. It adds to a growing list of examples where skilled individuals have encountered difficulties navigating the complex US immigration policy landscape. Is This Part of a Broader Trend in US Immigration Policy? The denial of a green card to a researcher working on cutting-edge AI technology is not an isolated event. Recent years have seen increased scrutiny and challenges for immigrants, including those in critical scientific and technological fields. Over the past few months, more than 1,700 international students, some of whom are AI researchers with years of residency, have had their visa statuses challenged. While some challenges relate to alleged support for militant groups or ‘antisemitic’ activities, others stem from minor legal infractions like traffic violations. The processing of legal permanent residency requests for immigrants with refugee or asylum status has reportedly been suspended. Green card holders perceived as ‘national security’ threats have faced detention and deportation threats. These instances collectively paint a picture of a stricter approach to immigration, impacting even highly skilled individuals contributing significantly to the U.S. economy and innovation. How Do Immigration Policies Affect AI Labs Like OpenAI? AI research and development heavily rely on a global pool of talent. Labs like OpenAI actively recruit experts from around the world. Data indicates the extent of this reliance: An OpenAI contractor mentioned the company filed over 80 H1-B visa applications last year alone. Since 2022, OpenAI has sponsored more than 100 visas for foreign workers. The H1-B visa program is a common pathway for U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in specialized roles requiring a bachelor’s degree or equivalent. However, recent changes, such as increased requests for evidence (RFEs) including home addresses and biometrics for H-1Bs and other employment-based petitions, have raised concerns among experts about potentially higher denial rates. Have Immigrants Historically Contributed to US AI Leadership? Absolutely. Immigrants have been fundamental to the growth and leadership of the U.S. AI industry. Their contributions are undeniable and well-documented: A Georgetown study found that 66% of the top 50 U.S.-based AI startups on Forbes’ 2019 ‘AI 50’ list had at least one immigrant founder. A 2023 analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy revealed that 70% of full-time graduate students in AI-related fields in the U.S. are international students. Specific examples abound: Ashish Vaswani, who moved to the U.S. for computer science studies, is a co-creator of the transformer architecture, which is the foundation for models like ChatGPT. Wojciech Zaremba, a co-founder of OpenAI, earned his AI doctorate from NYU while on a student visa. These examples underscore the vital role immigrants play in driving innovation and maintaining the U.S.’s competitive edge in critical fields like AI. What is Sam Altman’s Stance on Immigration? OpenAI CEO Sam Altman immigration views are publicly known. In a post on X last July, Altman advocated for reforms to simplify the process for ‘high-skill’ immigrants moving to and working in the U.S. He described welcoming talented individuals from around the world as a ‘hard-won gift’ and argued that embracing them is key to preserving America’s innovative strength. He warned that this advantage would be difficult to regain if lost. What Are the Potential Consequences of Restrictive Policies? Cases like the green card denial for the OpenAI researcher can have far-reaching consequences. When talented individuals face significant hurdles or feel unwelcome, they may choose to pursue opportunities elsewhere. A Nature poll of over 1,600 scientists indicated that 75% were considering leaving the U.S. for jobs abroad. Factors cited include U.S. immigration policies, funding cutbacks, and perceived hostility towards certain scientific fields. Losing top AI talent to other countries could directly impact the pace of research and development in the U.S., potentially ceding ground to international competitors. Summary: A Critical Juncture for US AI Leadership The denial of a green card to a key OpenAI researcher is more than an individual case; it’s a symptom of broader challenges within the US immigration policy system that directly impact the nation’s ability to attract and retain top AI talent . As AI continues to shape the future of technology and society, the U.S. must critically evaluate whether its current policies support or hinder its goal of remaining a global leader in this crucial field. The perspective shared by leaders like Sam Altman immigration highlights the view from within the industry that welcoming skilled immigrants is not just beneficial, but essential.

43811507,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152972,1745632806,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,TON Coin: Crucial Shift as Legacy Toncoin Bridge Retires May 10,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/toncoin-bridge-retires-may/,"Big news from The Open Network (TON)! If you’ve been moving assets around the crypto space, especially involving the TON Network , you’ll want to pay close attention. TON has announced a significant change that impacts how users bridge their TON Coin . What’s Happening with the Legacy Toncoin Bridge? The core announcement is straightforward: TON is officially retiring its legacy Toncoin Bridge . This bridge, which has been operational since 2021, served as an important early pathway for users to move Toncoin between the TON blockchain and other major networks like Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain. The retirement date is set for May 10th . After this specific date, the functionality to initiate new transfers from the TON blockchain to Ethereum or BNB Smart Chain using this particular legacy bridge will be permanently disabled. It’s important to note that this change primarily affects bridging *out* of TON. Bridging *into* the TON Network using this legacy bridge will remain active for a while longer. A future date for the sunset of the ‘bridge-in’ functionality will be announced later. Why is the Toncoin Bridge Being Retired? Retiring a key piece of infrastructure like a crypto bridge might seem counterintuitive, but it signals a significant step in the evolution of the TON ecosystem. The primary reason for phasing out the legacy bridge is the maturation and expansion of TON’s Decentralized Finance (DeFi) landscape. When the legacy bridge was launched in 2021, it was a vital tool for connecting the nascent TON Network with established DeFi hubs on Ethereum and BNB Chain. It helped onboard early users and facilitate liquidity movement. However, the blockchain space moves quickly. Newer, more sophisticated blockchain bridge solutions have emerged and are being integrated directly into the TON ecosystem. Platforms leveraging advanced interoperability protocols, such as LayerZero and Stargate, offer more robust, efficient, and potentially more secure ways to transfer assets across chains. By retiring the older bridge, TON is streamlining its infrastructure and encouraging the adoption of these newer, integrated solutions that are better aligned with the current state and future direction of the TON Network’s DeFi growth. What Does This Mean for Users Bridging TON Coin? For users who have previously used the legacy Toncoin Bridge , there’s a critical point to remember: Past Transfers: Any Toncoin that was transferred out of TON using the legacy bridge before May 10th, but has not yet been claimed on the destination chain (Ethereum or BNB Smart Chain), will still be claimable even after the retirement date. Your assets are not lost, but you must complete the claiming process on the other side. New Transfers Out of TON: As of May 10th, you will no longer be able to initiate *new* transfers of Toncoin *from* the TON Network *to* Ethereum or BNB Smart Chain using the legacy bridge interface. Future Bridging: Users wishing to bridge Toncoin out of TON in the future will need to utilize alternative, newer bridging solutions that integrate with the TON Network. Keep an eye on official TON channels for recommended platforms. This change emphasizes the need for users to stay informed about the tools they use to interact with different blockchains. Always verify you are using the correct and currently supported bridging method. Navigating the Evolving TON Network Ecosystem The retirement of the legacy crypto bridge is more than just an infrastructure update; it’s a clear indicator of the maturity and increasing sophistication of the TON Network ecosystem. As more protocols and dApps launch on TON, the need for seamless, efficient, and secure cross-chain communication grows. Newer bridging technologies offer several potential advantages over older methods, including: Improved Efficiency: Often faster transaction times and lower fees. Enhanced Security: Leveraging more advanced cryptographic methods and network designs. Broader Interoperability: Support for a wider range of assets and blockchain networks. Deeper Integration: Better compatibility with DeFi protocols on both the source and destination chains. This transition encourages users to explore the newer bridging options available, which are becoming standard practice across the multi-chain crypto landscape. It aligns TON with industry best practices for cross-chain asset movement. What Comes Next for Blockchain Bridges and TON Coin? While the legacy bridge is being retired, the need for effective blockchain bridge solutions for TON Coin remains. The focus is now shifting entirely to the newer integrations. The fact that bridging *into* TON via the legacy bridge remains active for now suggests a phased transition. The eventual sunset of the ‘bridge-in’ function will likely coincide with robust alternative pathways for bringing assets onto the TON Network becoming widely available and adopted. For users and developers, the key takeaway is to adapt to the new infrastructure. Explore platforms that have integrated with TON via newer interoperability protocols. This ensures you are using the most current and supported methods for cross-chain interactions involving the TON Network. Summary: A Step Forward for TON The decision by The Open Network to retire its legacy Toncoin Bridge on May 10th marks a significant step in the platform’s development. It signifies the growing maturity of the TON Network and its DeFi ecosystem, moving away from early infrastructure towards more advanced, integrated crypto bridge solutions. Users should be aware that initiating new transfers of TON Coin out of TON via the legacy bridge will cease on this date, though past transfers remain claimable. The future of bridging for TON lies with newer, more efficient blockchain bridge technologies already being integrated into the ecosystem. This evolution is a positive sign for the long-term health and interoperability of TON, aligning it with the broader trends in the multi-chain crypto world.

The analyst predicts that XRP can reach double digits when this breakout happens. XRP Price Pullback Part Of Plan For Historic Breakout To $10 In an X post, XForce indicated that the recent XRP price correction is part of the plan for the historic breakout to $10. He stated that he has been calling for this exact pullback for months and remarked that the altcoin is inching closer to a historic breakout to $10. The analyst added that progress may be gradual, but it is undeniable. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals When The XRP Price Will Reach $25 – It’s Not Far Off In a video on his YouTube channel, XForce further explained why he is confident that the XRP price can still reach a new all-time high (ATH). He highlighted a WXY corrective structure, which began at the start of the year, noting that this was just part of a larger bullish structure. He remarked that this corrective structure occurred as the market looked to cool off from the rally recorded in the first phase of this bull cycle. The crypto analyst stated that the XRP price is still going to witness a Wave 3, 4, and 5 move on the macro chart. This Wave 3 impulsive move is expected to take the altcoin to the $10 target before it then pulls back on Wave 4. XForce believes that XRP could rally to as high as $40 on the Wave 5 before this bull cycle finally ends. Meanwhile, the analyst alluded to the XRP/USDT chart while indicating that the bottom is already in for the altcoin, with the WXY corrective structure in Wave 2 already done. This means that XRP is now ready for a rally to the upside, with the move to $10 likely to start anytime soon. XRP Is Closer To An “Extreme Bull Run” In an X post, crypto analyst Dark Defender stated that the XRP price is closer to an extreme bull run in a very short time than market participants can ever imagine. He told market participants to keep an eye on $2.222 and $2.40 as the major resistance levels, while $1.8815 is the major support level. Related Reading: XRP To Flip Bitcoin This Cycle? Analyst Points To Major Bounce The crypto analyst suggested that the XRP price could still drop below $2 before it records this explosive move. He stated that the altcoin is expected to have three more waves in the smaller timeframes. As such, he advised market participants to keep an eye on the $1.8815 level again. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.18, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

According to a report by Watcher Guru on X, Trump indicated that another pause on tariffs is unlikely. This assertion immediately brings into focus the potential shifts in US trade policy should he return to office, a topic of significant interest to investors across all asset classes, including the dynamic cryptocurrency market. Understanding the History of Trump Tariffs Donald Trump’s previous presidency was marked by a distinctive approach to international trade, heavily relying on the imposition of tariffs. These taxes on imported goods were primarily aimed at renegotiating trade deals, protecting domestic industries, and addressing perceived trade imbalances. Key targets included: China: A large-scale trade war involving significant tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods. European Union: Tariffs on goods like steel, aluminum, and agricultural products. Other Countries: Various duties imposed on imports from nations like Canada, Mexico, and others. The stated goal was often to bring manufacturing back to the United States and pressure trading partners into new agreements deemed more favorable to the U.S. economy. While proponents argued this approach leveled the playing field, critics pointed to increased costs for consumers and businesses, as well as retaliatory measures from affected countries. What Does an ‘Unlikely Pause’ Signify for Global Trade ? The suggestion that future tariff pauses are improbable under a potential Trump administration signals a likely return to a more protectionist trade stance. A pause implies a temporary halt or suspension of existing tariffs, often used as a de-escalation tactic during negotiations or to provide relief during economic hardship. If pauses are off the table, it suggests a commitment to maintaining or even expanding tariff measures. The implications for global trade are substantial: Potential Impact Area Description Supply Chains Businesses may face renewed pressure to diversify or restructure supply chains away from heavily tariffed countries, increasing costs and complexity. Import Costs Higher costs for imported raw materials and finished goods can be passed on to consumers or erode profit margins for businesses. Export Competitiveness Retaliatory tariffs from other nations can make U.S. exports more expensive and less competitive abroad. International Relations Increased trade friction can strain diplomatic relationships with key allies and adversaries alike. This potential shift creates uncertainty, forcing businesses and governments worldwide to prepare for a less predictable trade environment. Analyzing the Potential Economic Impact The imposition or maintenance of significant tariffs can have multifaceted effects on the economy. On one hand, they can offer temporary relief or advantage to specific domestic industries by making competing imports more expensive. This might lead to increased domestic production and job creation in those sectors. However, the broader economic impact is often debated: Inflationary Pressure: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imports, which can lead to higher prices for goods bought by consumers and businesses. Reduced Consumer Choice: Higher import costs can limit the variety and availability of goods. Harm to Export Sectors: Industries that rely on exports can suffer if other countries impose retaliatory tariffs. Business Investment Uncertainty: Companies may delay investment decisions due to unpredictable trade policies. Overall, while targeted tariffs might benefit specific niches, widespread trade barriers can act as a drag on overall economic growth and stability by disrupting established trade flows and increasing costs throughout the system. How Could This Fuel Market Volatility ? Financial markets, including stocks, bonds, commodities, and cryptocurrencies, are highly sensitive to macroeconomic factors and political developments. Uncertainty surrounding US trade policy and the potential for renewed trade tensions is a significant driver of market volatility . Here’s why this news matters for investors: 1. Increased Uncertainty: Markets dislike uncertainty. Not knowing the future trajectory of trade relations makes it harder for investors to price assets accurately, leading to wider price swings. 2. Risk-Off Sentiment: Escalating trade disputes or the prospect of higher tariffs can trigger a ‘risk-off’ sentiment. This means investors may move away from assets perceived as higher risk, like stocks and potentially cryptocurrencies, towards perceived safe havens like government bonds or gold. 3. Impact on Specific Sectors: Industries heavily reliant on international trade, whether for sourcing materials or exporting goods (e.g., technology, manufacturing, agriculture), can see their stock prices affected, which can have knock-on effects on broader market indices. 4. Currency Fluctuations: Trade policies can influence currency exchange rates, adding another layer of complexity and potential volatility for international investors. For the crypto market specifically, while often seen as a distinct asset class, it is not immune to global macroeconomic forces. Increased market volatility stemming from trade tensions can affect investor sentiment and capital flows. While some argue Bitcoin could act as a digital safe haven during economic instability, others see it as a risk asset that will fall alongside traditional markets during downturns. The potential for trade-induced economic shifts adds another variable for crypto investors to consider. Challenges and Actionable Insights for Investors The primary challenge presented by this potential shift in tariff policy is navigating the resulting uncertainty. Predicting specific tariff targets or their exact impact is difficult. However, investors can take steps to prepare: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on political developments and official statements regarding trade policy. Assess Portfolio Exposure: Understand how companies or assets in your portfolio might be directly or indirectly affected by tariffs or retaliatory measures. Consider Diversification: A diversified portfolio across different asset classes and geographies can help mitigate risks associated with specific national policies. Focus on Long-Term Strategy: While short-term volatility is possible, maintaining a long-term investment perspective based on fundamental analysis is often key. For crypto investors, this means recognizing that external macroeconomic factors, like trade policy, can influence market dynamics. Understanding the broader economic climate is crucial, even when investing in decentralized assets. Examples from the Past The US-China trade war during Trump’s previous term provides a clear example of how tariffs can impact markets. The back-and-forth imposition of duties led to periods of significant stock market volatility, particularly affecting companies with large exposure to Chinese trade. It also spurred debates about supply chain resilience and the potential for decoupling the US and Chinese economies. While the crypto market was less mainstream then, the increased global economic uncertainty undoubtedly played a role in the broader investment landscape. Conclusion: Preparing for Potential Headwinds The statement attributed to Donald Trump regarding the unlikelihood of future tariff pauses serves as a significant signal for the global economic outlook. It suggests a potential return to a more aggressive trade posture, characterized by the continued or expanded use of tariffs as a primary tool of US trade policy . The resulting uncertainty could have a notable economic impact , disrupting global trade flows and potentially fueling market volatility across traditional and digital asset classes alike. For investors, particularly those in the crypto space, staying informed about these macroeconomic shifts and understanding their potential influence on market sentiment is more crucial than ever in navigating the coming months.

Here’s What ChatGPT Picked",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/1000-in-cardano-remittix-or-solana-for-the-next-5-years-heres-what-chatgpt-picked/,"Investing $1000 in crypto for the next five years? Potential options include Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Remittix (RTX) . With the Cardano price showing potential and positive Solana news emerging, choosing the best long-term investment is key. Which offers the best return potential? After analyzing their prospects, ChatGPT’s assessment highlights one clear standout choice for a 5-year horizon. Remittix (RTX): The Ground-Floor PayFi Disruptor Remittix (RTX) enters the conversation as the newest contender, focusing squarely on disrupting the massive cross-border payments industry. Its core proposition involves bridging crypto and traditional finance, allowing users to leverage over 100 cryptocurrencies to send fiat payments directly into bank accounts globally. This innovative PayFi protocol tackles the inefficiencies of legacy systems, offering significantly faster transactions with a low 1% flat fee and zero FX charges. For a 5-year investment starting with $1000, Remittix presents a compelling ground-floor opportunity. Remittix would need to 400x just to be in reach of the market caps of cryptos like Solana and Cardano. Its presale is currently active, with RTX tokens priced at just $0.0757, giving investors the opportunity to get in on the ground floor – a stark contrast to the established prices of ADA and SOL. Key features supporting long-term value include attractive staking rewards (up to 18% APY), zero transaction taxes, a privacy-centric non-custodial wallet and robust security confirmed by a BlockSAFU audit. Cardano ( ADA ): Steady Development vs. Market Concerns Cardano (ADA) is known for its research-driven approach and steady development. Currently, ADA shows signs of strength, rebounding from key support levels. Analysts are bullish; Crypto Patel highlights a long-term channel potentially targeting $5 , while Javon Marks points to a bull flag pattern suggesting a move towards $2.91 . These optimistic Cardano price outlooks are supported by technical indicators. Fundamentals also offer potential catalysts. The integration with BitcoinOS for decentralized BTC staking could attract significant capital and speculation about a spot ADA ETF this year persists (Polymarket odds 60%). However, concerns linger.

While the long-term Cardano price could benefit from its technology and potential ETF approval, these warning signs cannot be ignored. The future Cardano price faces both opportunities and significant hurdles, making its 5-year trajectory less certain. Ultimately, the Cardano price path depends on overcoming these market concerns. Is Cardano on the way towards $2.91 or even $5? Source: CoinMarketCap Solana ( SOL ): High Speed, High Competition Solana (SOL) has carved out a niche as a high-performance blockchain, known for its speed and growing ecosystem, particularly in NFTs and meme coins. Recent Solana news highlights its resilience and potential. Respected analyst Peter Brandt suggests SOL could significantly outperform Ethereum, citing a bullish “cup and handle” pattern on the SOL/ETH chart, potentially leading to a 100%+ gain against ETH. Further positive Solana news includes ARK Invest making its first direct SOL investment, signaling growing institutional confidence. The network continues to attract developers and users, solidifying its position as a leading Layer-1. This positive stream of Solana news supports a bullish outlook. However, Solana operates in a highly competitive space, constantly vying with Ethereum and other Layer-1s for dominance. While recent Solana news is encouraging, maintaining its edge over five years against well-funded competitors remains a challenge. Solana went from $128 to over $151 in just 7 days.

Solana offers high performance but faces intense competition. Remittix stands out with its low presale entry point and clear utility targeting a massive, inefficient market. Its focus on disrupting cross-border payments offers a distinct path for potentially explosive growth. While ADA and SOL are established, Remittix’s potential to multiply a $1000 investment appears significantly higher, making RTX the compelling 5-year choice based on this analysis.

Every decision based on if it is “good for Bitcoin” “If Bitcoin wins, humanity wins. Every business decision I make starts with one question: Is this good for Bitcoin? Twenty One exists because I believe it is good for Bitcoin and, therefore, good for the world,” Mallers said. Mallers explained that Strike, a Bitcoin payments platform, and Twenty One Capital have different goals. He said Strike focuses on making “Bitcoin accessible globally,” while Twenty One aims to increase “Bitcoin ownership per share (BPS) and pioneer Bitcoin-native financial tools.” “These are separate companies, but they share the same ethos: Bitcoin wins, we win,” he said. Source: Jack Mallers It comes after Twenty One Capital announced its launch on April 23, with the backing of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald . The firm is looking to challenge Michael Saylor’s Strategy to become the “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” It revealed its plans to launch with 42,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ). Source: Michael Saylor Mallers shared key metrics for Strike publicly for the first time, revealing that in 2024, the firm posted over $6 billion in volume, recorded 600% year-on-year growth, maintained an 85% gross profit margin, and reported zero customer acquisition costs. Mallers said that despite maintaining a team of 75 employees, the company expects to “generate 8-9 figures in net profit in 2025.” Several crypto enthusiasts had taken to social media to ask how the logistics would work for Mallers, being the CEO of Strike and Twenty One Capital.

43812126,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=152976,1745634047,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BlackRock IBIT Sees Massive Inflows: How Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation is Reshaping the Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/blackrock-ibit-inflows-surge/,"The world of cryptocurrency is constantly buzzing with activity, but few developments have captured as much attention recently as the performance of the newly launched spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States. Among these, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, known by its ticker IBIT , has emerged as a dominant force, witnessing truly significant inflows of capital. If you’ve been following the crypto market, you’ve likely heard the news: BlackRock IBIT is accumulating Bitcoin at an astonishing pace. This isn’t just a trickle of funds; we’re talking about a surge that’s positioning BlackRock as one of the largest holders of Bitcoin globally, outside of perhaps Satoshi Nakamoto himself (whose holdings are unknown and presumed dormant). Understanding the BlackRock IBIT Phenomenon What exactly is BlackRock IBIT ? Simply put, it’s a spot Bitcoin ETF. This means it’s an investment vehicle that holds actual Bitcoin as its underlying asset. When investors buy shares of IBIT, they are indirectly gaining exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without having to deal with the complexities of buying, storing, or securing the cryptocurrency themselves. This accessibility is a game-changer for many traditional investors and large institutions. BlackRock, being the world’s largest asset manager, launching such a product sent a powerful signal to the market. Their entry legitimizes Bitcoin as an asset class in the eyes of many mainstream investors and financial advisors who were previously hesitant due to perceived risks or lack of regulated investment options. The Surge in Bitcoin ETF Inflows: What’s Driving It? The recent surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows , particularly into IBIT, is driven by several factors: Regulatory Clarity: The SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January 2024 removed a major regulatory hurdle, opening the doors for a flood of new capital. Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making it easy for investors to buy and sell shares through their existing brokerage accounts. Trust and Brand Recognition: BlackRock’s reputation as a trusted financial institution provides a level of confidence for investors who might be wary of crypto exchanges. Accumulation Strategy: Some investors and institutions see Bitcoin as a long-term store of value or a hedge against inflation, and the ETF provides an easy way to accumulate it. Market Momentum: Positive price action in Bitcoin itself often attracts more investment, creating a virtuous cycle of inflows and potential price increases. According to data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, the scale of these inflows into IBIT is truly impressive. The report highlighted that BlackRock has secured a significant amount of Bitcoin just recently, accumulating around $1.2 billion worth of BTC in a short period this week alone. This kind of rapid accumulation underscores the strong demand being channeled through the ETF structure. IBIT Bitcoin Holdings: A Growing Giant Thanks to these sustained and substantial inflows, the volume of IBIT Bitcoin holdings has swelled dramatically since its launch. Arkham Intelligence’s data reveals that BlackRock currently holds more than 582,000 BTC within its IBIT fund. To put that number into perspective, that’s a staggering amount of Bitcoin. Valued at approximately $56 billion (as per recent market prices), these holdings represent a significant chunk of the total Bitcoin market capitalization. BlackRock’s IBIT now holds an estimated 2.8% of the entire 21 million Bitcoin supply. This makes IBIT one of the single largest known holders of Bitcoin globally, trailing only slightly behind MicroStrategy, another publicly traded company with a substantial BTC treasury. The rapid growth of IBIT’s holdings is a clear indicator of how quickly institutional and traditional investment capital is entering the Bitcoin space through this accessible regulated product. It signifies a fundamental shift in the landscape of Bitcoin ownership. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation The phenomenon of Institutional Bitcoin accumulation through vehicles like IBIT has profound implications for the cryptocurrency market: Increased Demand: Large-scale buying by institutions creates significant demand pressure on the limited supply of Bitcoin. Supply Dynamics: As more BTC is locked up in ETFs and corporate treasuries, the available supply on exchanges for retail trading potentially shrinks, which can contribute to price volatility and upward pressure. Market Maturity: The involvement of reputable institutions like BlackRock lends credibility to Bitcoin, attracting more mainstream attention and potentially reducing its perceived risk for new investors. Price Discovery: Increased trading volume and participation from institutional players on regulated markets can improve price discovery mechanisms. This influx of institutional capital via IBIT and other ETFs represents a major step in Bitcoin’s evolution from a niche digital asset to a recognized part of the global financial system. What Do These BTC Accumulation Trends Mean for the Market? The ongoing BTC accumulation driven by ETFs like IBIT is a key trend to watch. While past performance is not indicative of future results, sustained demand from large buyers historically tends to be bullish for an asset’s price over the long term, especially when supply is fixed like Bitcoin’s. However, it’s important to remember that the crypto market remains volatile. While inflows are positive, factors like macroeconomic conditions, regulatory changes globally, and shifts in investor sentiment can still impact prices. The presence of large institutional holders also means that significant market movements could occur if these entities were to change their strategy, though given BlackRock’s stated long-term view, massive liquidations seem less likely in the short term. For individual investors, the rise of IBIT and institutional interest validates Bitcoin’s growing acceptance. It provides an alternative, regulated way to gain exposure, though understanding the differences between holding an ETF share and holding actual Bitcoin is crucial. In conclusion, the rapid surge in BlackRock IBIT inflows and the resulting accumulation of a significant portion of the total Bitcoin supply highlight the accelerating pace of institutional adoption. This trend is reshaping the market, bringing traditional finance closer to the digital asset space and potentially setting the stage for Bitcoin’s continued growth and integration into the global economy.

Recent XRP Price Action and Support Test Davis also pointed out that XRP recently retested support at the 20-day EMA (yellow line) amid profit-taking moves from traders. For context, XRP posted notable green candles on Tuesday and Wednesday. During this time, the price moved up 11.5%, from $2.06 to $2.30, before retracing to revisit lows near $2.10.

But while the XRP price basks in institutional validation, a lesser-known contender, Remittix is quietly stealing the spotlight. This low-cap altcoin has begun generating serious buzz for its speed, utility and viral potential, drawing comparisons to the explosive rise of SHIB. Traders and early adopters are eyeing Remittix as a possible underdog ready to make a high-velocity run through the market. XRP Price gets Institutional boost as Standard Chartered bets big Standard Chartered’s support has reignited investor confidence in the XRP price. With projections of a 500% surge by 2028, experts like Geoffrey Kendrick see the XRP price rising from $2.16 to $12.50, marking XRP as a strong long-term crypto contender. XRP Price Action Source: Binance The XRP price is gaining serious traction with legal clarity on the horizon and the recent launch of XRP futures on Coinbase. If the XRP price clears $2.22, analysts believe $3.00 is next. From Meme to Moonshot: The Wild Ride of SHIB in 2021 In 2021, SHIB took the crypto world by storm, skyrocketing from meme status to market phenomenon. Fueled by social media buzz, retail hype and Dogecoin comparisons, SHIB hit an all-time high of $0.00007923 , turning early adopters into overnight millionaires. Fast forward to today, SHIB trades well below its ATH at $0.000013, yet remains active, with loyal community support and growing ecosystem use. SHIB Price Action Source: Binance With ongoing burns, new utility projects and Shibarium developments, SHIB’s story might still have a few surprises left. Low-Cap Sleeper: Why Remittix (RTX) Might the new Breakout star Back in 2021, SHIB turned heads across the crypto world, soaring more than 30x in value and reaching a peak of $0.00008845. That explosive rise took it from meme coin status to a genuine force in the market. Fast forward to now and a low-cap altcoin, Remittix , is stirring similar sentiment among early investors. Despite today’s uncertain market conditions, some believe this overlooked altcoin could mirror SHIB’s trajectory. This is because it’s carving out a niche with real-world applications. Specifically, Remittix is gaining traction in the cross-border payments sector, aiming to seamlessly connect the crypto economy with traditional financial infrastructure. Unlike SHIB, which remained mostly speculative, Remittix allows users to transact in over 50 digital assets and convert them into more than 30 different fiat currencies. It also enables instant fund transfers to global bank accounts, sidestepping the typical fees tied to FX and wire services. Trading at just $0.0757, this low-cap altcoin has sparked speculation that it could touch the $2 mark by late 2025. If history is any guide, Remittix might just be the next unexpected breakout. Conclusion As the XRP price garners renewed momentum through institutional backing, a quiet but compelling narrative is unfolding around Remittix. This low-cap altcoin is gaining organic traction with its real-world use case and cross-border functionality. With a price point of $0.0757 still under the radar, yet a growing chorus of investor interest, Remittix could be poised to echo the explosive ascent once seen with SHIB. Whether it’s a calculated bet or an instinctual leap, this emerging altcoin may soon prove that underdogs often write the most surprising chapters in crypto history.

Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Heating Up’ – Address Activity Jumps Nearly 10% In 2 Days Price Prediction Sets Community Afloat The daring forecast has made waves in cryptocurrency communities, particularly because Ethereum is currently priced under $2,000. Based on figures by Coingecko, the second-largest cryptocurrency is valued at around $1,789. Sun posted his opinion on X (formerly Twitter), observing a personal connection to the launch date of Ethereum. His birthday is July 30, the same day Ethereum launched in 2015. The founder of Tron leveraged this moment to collaborate with the Ethereum Foundation in advertising the upcoming birthday celebrations. His $5,000 price target is almost a 200% hike from levels now. Ethereum shares the same birthday as me—this date is truly meaningful. I suggest a 10x increase—let’s commemorate it together at $5,000! https://t.co/o8Ci30xbhH — H.E. Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) April 24, 2025 Foundation Plans Global Birthday Events According to reports by the Ethereum Foundation, the 10-year anniversary will have global birthday parties of all sizes. Organizations and individuals can plan local events to participate in the celebration. To assist in making these events occur, the Foundation’s Ecosystem Support Program will reimburse up to $500 in costs per event. Applicants must apply by June 15, 2025. The Foundation hopes to establish a “global holiday” environment around the anniversary, with community involvement from various countries and regions. Sun’s Four-Step Plan For Ethereum Growth Sun didn’t leave it there at projections – he mapped out a concrete plan he is convinced would get Ethereum to the $5,000 level in no time: 1. The Ethereum Foundation should refrain from selling ETH for a minimum of three years to curb supply and promote holding. 2. Instead of token sales, the Foundation might employ lending and staking platforms such as AAVE to finance operations. 3. The Foundation must rationalize its team, retaining only the best developers and compensating them at better rates to enhance output quality. 4. Development should be aimed at enhancing the core Layer 1 network instead of diluting resources over so many side projects. Image: Cryptonary Ethereum Faces Challenges Despite Success Even though it hosts thousands of decentralized applications and popularized smart contracts globally, Ethereum is still struggling with various issues. It is commonly complained about by users, including exorbitant gas charges, sluggish transaction speeds, and poor scalability.

The upgrade is said to reduce transaction fees and enhance contract enforcement throughout the network. Sun’s support for Ethereum stands out because he leads Tron, often viewed as a competing blockchain. Despite this apparent rivalry, he maintains ETH holdings and regularly praises Ethereum’s progress. The market’s response to Sun’s optimistic outlook remains to be seen, as Ethereum would need significant momentum to reach the predicted $5,000 level from its current price point.

The fund, called XRPH11 , is issued by Hashdex and managed by Genial Investimentos , beginning its trading journey on April 25 at Brazil’s stock exchange, B3 . Brazil’s rapid approval and launch highlight a more crypto-friendly stance compared to the U.S., where regulatory hurdles continue to delay similar products. Notably, Brazil also made headlines last year by introducing the first Solana ETF . XRPH11: A Bold Bet on XRP XRPH11 is designed to track the Nasdaq XRP Reference Price Index and allocates at least 95% of its assets directly or indirectly to XRP . This includes a mix of spot XRP holdings, futures, and other crypto-related instruments. Although the exact trading volume hasn’t been publicly disclosed yet, XRPH11 is already active and listed on B3’s website. This marks Hashdex’s ninth crypto ETF on the exchange, joining earlier products for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Aiming at Institutional Investors According to Samir Kerbage , CIO at Hashdex , XRPH11 targets institutional and sophisticated investors seeking regulated crypto exposure in Brazil’s equity market. Kerbage emphasized that the product is built around key principles like transparency and investor protection, aligning closely with local regulations. The Race Toward an $8 Billion Opportunity Currently, XRP-focused ETFs globally hold about $950 million in assets under management (AUM). However, momentum is building. Last week, CoinShares reported $37.7 million in inflows into XRP-related funds — the highest among all crypto ETPs. JPMorgan analysts have forecasted that XRP ETFs could see up to $8 billion in net inflows over time. While Hashdex is leading the race in Brazil, it’s worth noting that Brazil represents only 0.9% of the global crypto ETP market. XRPH11 will need to attract international attention to make a real impact. Will XRPH11 Succeed? Brazil’s fast-tracking of the first spot XRP ETF gives it a head start while the U.S. continues to drag its feet. However, XRPH11’s success is not guaranteed. Brazil’s Solana ETF, launched last year, failed to spark major excitement. If XRP’s ETF underperforms, it could pressure the token’s price in the short term. On the other hand, optimism remains high that the U.S. will soon approve its own spot XRP ETF. Betting platform Polymarket currently gives it a 74% chance of approval within 2025. When will U.S. SEC approve iXRP spot ETF? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is anticipated to decide on several XRP spot ETF applications by May 22, 2025 . This date aligns with the SEC’s deadline to respond to filings from firms like Grayscale and 21Shares. Market optimism is high, with prediction platforms like Polymarket indicating an 87% chance of approval this year .​ Is Hashdex planning any other crypto ETFs after XRPH11? Yes, Hashdex is actively expanding its ETF offerings. The firm has filed to include additional altcoins—such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI)—into its Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF. How will XRPH11’s performance impact XRP’s price in the short term? The launch of XRPH11 could influence XRP’s price in the short term. Analysts suggest that increased institutional demand from the ETF may drive prices upward. However, there’s also potential for short-term volatility due to market adjustments and liquidity factors.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-26 03:05:08

The regulator formally withdrew the 2022 guidance, which required banks to provide advance notice of planned or ongoing activities involving cryptoassets. ”The Board is rescinding its 2022 guidance letter establishing an expectation that state member banks provide advance notice of planned or ongoing cryptoasset-related activities,” the announcement from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors said. Any activity related to cryptocurrencies will now be monitored through the Federal Reserve's normal supervisory process. In addition, the Fed is rescinding its 2023 supervisory letter that affected state banks' interactions with stablecoins. Why Were These Guidelines Introduced in the First Place? In the original recommendations, the regulator emphasized that cryptocurrencies may pose risks to the safety and soundness of the financial system, consumer protection, and U.S. financial stability in general. ”Certain types of cryptoassets, such as stablecoins, when widely distributed, may also pose risks to financial stability, including potentially through destabilizing bulk sales and disruptions in payment systems,” the document noted. The Fed also pointed out that cryptocurrencies are often used for money laundering and terrorist financing. Dropping Warnings About Crypto Scams Together with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Fed has withdrawn two 2023 statements regarding banks' interactions with crypto asset sector participants who may be engaged in fraud. ”Inaccurate or misleading statements and disclosures by crypto asset companies [...] can be unfair, deceptive or offensive, contributing to significant harm to retail and institutional investors,” the now withdrawn joint statement read. The New Administration’s First Step The revocations mark the Federal Reserve's first major move on crypto activity under the Trump administration, which has initiated several measures to create a more favorable environment for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. and support innovation. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also revokeda controversial rule that required banks and financial firms holding cryptocurrencies to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets. This happened on January 23 - thus removing a regulatory barrier that had been slowing the adoption of cryptocurrency banking. These changes indicate a significant shift in the way federal regulators view the crypto industry. In fact, banks are now allowed to operate more freely with cryptocurrencies without having to go through additional bureaucratic notification procedures.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-26 03:40:06

Despite filings from firms like Grayscale and Bitwise, BlackRock has yet to make any move toward launching an XRP ETF. Here’s what’s holding them back—and what it means for the XRP ETF approval timel ine. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP ETF News: Brazil World’s First Spot XRP ETF – XRPH11 is Now Live! , BlackRock XRP ETF Delay Market observers say BlackRock sees little incentive to rush into the XRP ETF market. The firm is already generating significant profits through its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Its Bitcoin ETF boasts over $30 billion in assets, while its Ethereum ETF recently crossed the $1 billion mark within just two months. Given the success of these products, BlackRock appears content to prioritize assets with higher liquidity and stronger institutional demand, leaving XRP on the backburner for now. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan notes that while interest in XRP is growing, it hasn’t yet reached the levels needed to prompt BlackRock’s involvement. Typically, BlackRock responds to clear, sustained institutional demand before entering a new market, and XRP hasn’t crossed that threshold yet. ETF expert Nate Geraci points out that BlackRock is likely adopting a wait-and-see approach. Instead of leading the charge, BlackRock is monitoring how competitors like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton navigate the XRP ETF space. The company is also carefully watching the regulatory landscape, particularly how the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reacts to early XRP ETF filings. Grayscale XRP ETF Filing While BlackRock remains cautious, Grayscale has already taken steps by filing for an XRP ETF. The Grayscale XRP ETF filing signals growing confidence among smaller asset managers that regulatory clarity for XRP is on the horizon. Though the SEC has yet to approve any XRP ETFs, Grayscale’s move puts additional pressure on regulators to provide clear guidelines, and could potentially accelerate the overall XRP ETF approval timeline. Ripple vs SEC Outcome Remains Key The SEC’s stance on XRP ETFs remains uncertain, especially with the Ripple vs. SEC legal battle still ongoing. FOX Business correspondent Charles Gasparino suggests that BlackRock is unlikely to pursue an XRP ETF until the regulatory cloud fully clears. The outcome of the Ripple lawsuit will play a critical role in determining the XRP ETF approval date and whether wider acceptance follows. Adding to the cautious approach is BlackRock’s experience with a fake XRP ETF filing in 2023, which created confusion in the market. Industry analysts note that BlackRock is now even more careful about its public image and will only move forward when legal and market conditions are fully favorable. When Will XRP ETF Be Approved By U.S SEC? The XRP ETF approval timeline is closely tied to the resolution of Ripple’s legal case with the SEC and a broader pickup in institutional demand. Industry insiders suggest that an XRP ETF approval date could still be months away, depending heavily on legal developments in 2025. Until then, XRP ETF news will likely center around filings, SEC reviews, and smaller players pushing ahead. For now, investors eager for an XRP ETF will need to wait for more regulatory clarity and stronger market demand to drive BlackRock—and possibly others—to take action. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The XRP ETF approval timeline depends on the final outcome of the Ripple vs. SEC case. Approval could happen in 2025 if regulatory clarity improves. What is XRP ETF? An XRP ETF is an exchange-traded fund that allows investors to gain exposure to XRP’s price without directly buying the cryptocurrency. Has the SEC approved Grayscale’s XRP ETF filing? No, the SEC has not yet approved Grayscale’s XRP ETF filing. Approval is likely tied to the final outcome of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit and broader regulatory clarity.

BlackRock Exec Explains,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/how-to-price-bitcoin-blackrock-exec/,"Bitcoin should be valued as “an uncorrelated asset that benefits when the world gets messier,” BlackRock’s US Head of Equity ETFs Jay Jacobs told CNBC in an interview on Thursday. “Crypto over the long run is decoupled from US tech stocks,” Jacobs said, stressing that short-term market stress can mask the difference but that “the long-term correlation between US stocks and Bitcoin is more like two or three percent.” He argued that what pushes equities higher—“higher growth, higher certainty, lower geopolitical risk”—is the mirror image of the forces that move Bitcoin. “Bitcoin thrives when you have more uncertainty and are looking for something that’s going to behave differently, so fundamentally they should behave like an uncorrelated asset.” BTC was changing hands just under $94,000 during Jacobs’ appearance, extending a rally that has added roughly 150% since spot-ETF approvals early last year. Bitcoin Rises Because Of ‘Mega-Forces” Jacobs tied price behaviour directly to flows. “We would think over the long term, if this trajectory of greater uncertainty around the world continues, things like gold and Bitcoin should continue to go up.” He noted that investors are repositioning accordingly: “We’ve seen significant inflows into gold ETFs; we’ve seen significant inflows into Bitcoin, and this is all because people are looking for those assets that will behave differently.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims Key Levels – New ATHs May Be Closer Than Expected The biggest beneficiary has been BlackRock’s own iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which on 23 April absorbed $643 million of net creations—its largest one-day haul since January—lifting the fund’s assets to roughly $54 billion. Jacobs framed the rush into hard assets as part of a longer geopolitical realignment. “If you look at central banks around the world, a continued movement towards diversification beyond just holding dollars is something that’s been happening for decades… the switch from just holding dollars to holding gold to looking at other types of assets like Bitcoin is a trend that’s been years in the making.” Central-bank gold purchases illustrate the shift: net buying topped 1,044 tonnes in 2024, the third consecutive year above the thousand-tonne mark, double the average of the previous decade. He linked those reserve moves to BlackRock’s 2023 “mega-forces” framework, which identified geopolitical fragmentation as a secular driver of returns. “That mega force is materialising in policies like reshoring in the United States and, I think, directly related to that fragmentation has been the rise of things like Bitcoin, as people see more destabilisation in geopolitics resulting in the need for more alternative assets.” Related Reading: Déjà Boom—Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin’s 2022 Rally Setup Is Back BlackRock’s influence is difficult to overstate: the firm ended the first quarter with a record $11.6 trillion under management. By pairing that scale with a public thesis that Bitcoin’s fair price rises as uncertainty deepens, the asset-manager is effectively codifying a valuation model in which scarcity and sanction-resistance—not discounted cash flows—set the marginal price. As Jacobs put it, the market is “looking for alternatives—parts of the portfolio that are going to behave separately from stocks and bonds.” With IBIT now swallowing more BTC each day than miners can produce post-halving, his remarks may offer the clearest blueprint yet for how the world’s largest asset manager thinks about pricing the world’s largest cryptocurrency. At press time, BTC traded at $94,510.

Momentum builds. Early adopters sharpen their focus. Blockchain’s next phase starts taking shape, not with hype, but with meaningful upgrades that ripple across the entire digital finance ecosystem. Avalanche just inked a major move with ZetaChain—bringing frictionless cross-chain dApps into mainstream developer workflows. At the same time, Polkadot faces regulatory limelight, as the SEC delays a decision on Grayscale’s DOT ETF, signaling how much institutional attention this project is starting to gather. But there’s one project that’s quietly outpacing both, not just with news, but with action. Qubetics ($TICS) is answering the core problems most platforms still ignore: disjointed development, lack of user-friendly tools, and isolated chains. While others are building pieces, let’s find out the next best crypto to buy. Qubetics: The Real-World Aggregator Built for the Web3 Future Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator built across blockchain systems. Unlike legacy networks that lock users into siloed environments, Qubetics enables seamless transitions across platforms with real-world applications. From tokenizing physical assets to empowering decentralized business models, it delivers frictionless access to decentralized finance, NFTs, and digital identity—all in one interface, one of the next best crypto to buy. The Blockchain OS Analogy: How Qubetics Simplifies the Complex Qubetics isn’t just launching another blockchain—it’s redefining how blockchain architecture should operate. Picture this: just as Android acts as the operating system that powers mobile apps across thousands of devices, Qubetics functions as the operating system for Web3, making decentralized apps, cross-chain transactions, and asset tokenization accessible across all compatible networks. Its flagship tool, QubeQode IDE, mirrors what Android Studio does for mobile developers. A single interface where smart contracts are not just written—but visually assembled, audited in real time, and deployed across any chain without needing multiple platforms or dev environments. A logistics protocol can deploy asset-tracking on Ethereum, while a DeFi dApp can run liquidity routing across Solana and Binance—all built and launched from QubeQode in minutes. Qubetics Is Delivering, Not Promising — $16.4M Raised and Counting Qubetics isn’t promising growth. It’s delivering it. As of April 25, the crypto pre sale has already raised over $16.4 million, with more than 509 million $TICS sold to 25,200+ token holders. Now at Stage 31, the token is priced at $0.1902 and increasing 10% weekly. At a projected post-presale price of $1, the potential ROI stands at 426%—and that’s before factoring in the mainnet launch, one of the next best crypto to buy. At this level, you’re locking in around 3,943 tokens. Even a modest move to $5 nets you $19,715. If $TICS climbs to $10, that turns into $39,430. And at $15, it’s a mind-blowing $59,145. That’s over 78X from a $750 push—bonkers upside before most even blink. Avalanche: Going Cross-Chain with ZetaChain to Fuel dApp Expansion Avalanche has kicked 2025 off with a defining move: an integration with ZetaChain that unlocks truly universal dApp development. For developers looking to build applications that work seamlessly across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and more, without bridges or workarounds, this update is a breakthrough. Imagine a single contract interacting across chains without losing speed or security. That’s what Avalanche is shaping now. This strategic alignment positions Avalanche as more than just another fast Layer 1. It becomes a foundational tool for multi-chain infrastructure. Developers can create decentralized exchanges that interact with Bitcoin liquidity or launch NFTs on one chain and trade on another. That’s serious power with fewer headaches. As a result, Avalanche’s user base is swelling, and its recent $250 million raise by the Avalanche Foundation confirms how much backing this vision is getting. While Avalanche isn’t the only network chasing cross-chain dreams, its clear focus on practical execution gives it a compelling edge among the next best crypto to buy for serious builders. Polkadot: Institutional Demand Grows Despite ETF Delay Polkadot finds itself in the regulatory spotlight—again. Grayscale’s proposed Polkadot ETF, which would allow direct DOT exposure through a regulated vehicle, is on hold following a decision delay by the U.S. SEC. On the surface, it’s a pause. But under the surface? It’s validation. Polkadot is now part of the institutional conversation, and that’s no accident. Built for parachain architecture and parallel processing, Polkadot offers scalable interoperability by design. Projects leveraging the DOT ecosystem are already tackling use cases in IoT, AI, and enterprise-level DeFi, but the potential ETF gives institutional capital a way to join the network with confidence. That kind of momentum, even with bureaucratic delays, draws attention from those watching the next best crypto to buy as institutional demand heats up. While some see the SEC’s caution as a barrier, it’s better viewed as a sign that DOT has entered the upper tier of serious protocols. As those discussions progress, Polkadot remains well-positioned to benefit from a shift toward regulated exposure to decentralized networks. Why These Three Projects Deserve Attention Now Qubetics, Avalanche, and Polkadot are not simply building tools—they’re enabling digital freedom, real-world adoption, and new frontiers in decentralized tech. Qubetics focuses on making Web3 accessible through its powerful IDE and real-world asset integration. Avalanche is targeting the interoperability issue with a concrete ZetaChain alliance, and Polkadot is aligning with institutional frameworks to scale responsibly. Each project is meeting a unique market demand. Each project is actively evolving to match what developers, communities, and institutions need. Together, they form a power trio of protocols that deserve attention from anyone searching for the next best crypto to buy . For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics a strong contender as the next best crypto to buy? Qubetics solves major blockchain pain points through interoperability, a non-custodial multi-chain wallet, and its QubeQode IDE that simplifies smart contract deployment. How does Avalanche’s integration with ZetaChain benefit blockchain developers? It allows the creation of universal dApps that operate across multiple chains without bridging complexities, making development faster and more scalable. Why is Polkadot’s delayed ETF proposal still considered a positive signal? The SEC’s involvement highlights growing institutional interest in Polkadot. Even delays validate the project’s maturity and appeal to mainstream finance.

Ruvi AI’s Supercharged Presale Ruvi AI is not just another blockchain project. It’s the seamless integration of blockchain and AI to solve real world problems in business, creativity and operations. This big vision has got everyone’s attention as seen in the presale. During the presale, Ruvi AI sold 10 million $RUVI tokens in just days, raised $100,000 at a starting price of $0.01 per token . The confirmed listing price of $0.07 means investors will see an immediate 600% return post launch. But what really sets Ruvi AI apart is the projections, analysts are forecasting a $1 or higher valuation. This makes Ruvi AI one of the most profitable and attractive investments in the crypto space. VIP Tier 3 Bonus Ruvi AI’s VIP rewards system takes it to the next level, offering big bonuses to early supporters. The VIP Tier 3 package shows just how far Ruvi AI goes to reward its investors. To qualify for Tier 3 rewards, you need to hold 100,000 tokens which is $1,000 at the presale price of $0.01 per token . On top of that, Tier 3 membership includes an additional 60% bonus , that’s 60,000 free tokens , making it 160,000 tokens .Now here’s the exciting part. At the confirmed listing price of $0.07 , the $1,000 investment grows to $11,200 . But using analysts’ projected valuation of $1 or more, the same investment becomes an $160,000 , that’s a 15,900% return. That’s unheard of when compared to the 300% Cardano is expected to gain in the next few months. What Sets Ruvi AI Apart? Ruvi AI’s revolutionary approach is practical. Unlike many projects that focus only on decentralized finance (DeFi) or cryptocurrency trading, Ruvi AI uses blockchain to automate workflows, optimize business processes and enhance creativity across industries. This big vision is what gives such huge ROI potential. Ruvi AI also ensures transparency in its rewards structure so early investors are confident in their decision. From advanced tokenomics to robust community incentives like leaderboard rewards, the ecosystem is designed to benefit small and large investors alike. Community Leaderboard Rewards To encourage community participation and engagement, Ruvi AI also has a leaderboard rewards program . Investors who top the leaderboard get massive bonuses that makes Ruvi AI a high reward investment. For example, top 10 contributors get 500,000 tokens , valued at $500,000 if the token reaches $1. Even those in the top 50 or top 1,000 get huge returns, 250,000 tokens ($250,000) and 20,000 tokens ($20,000) respectively. This creates a dynamic where the most active supporters get rewarded handsomely for their effort. Cardano vs Ruvi AI While Cardano’s 300% price surge reflects the optimism in blockchain, it still can’t compare to Ruvi AI. Cardano relies heavily on market sentiment and whale trading for its growth and while those are big factors, they’re not new. Ruvi AI disrupts the status quo by combining AI with blockchain, creating value beyond speculative trading. Its real world applications and early stage presale pricing shows a much better growth trajectory. Join Ruvi AI The crypto landscape is changing and projects like Cardano are getting attention because of their past results. But real change happens with the innovators like Ruvi AI. Its presale and VIP Tier rewards offer an opportunity to grow your wealth, not just be part of a trend but the trend itself. Join Ruvi AI’s presale now and enter a world of 15,900% ROI and innovation. While Cardano goes up, Ruvi AI is building the new.

Bitcoin's correlation with tech stocks has increased since spot ETFs were approved. That said, it remains a strong anti-fiat asset as global M2 rises. Technical indicators are positive, with Bitcoin breaking key resistance levels and moving averages, signaling a potential upward price movement. ProShares Ultra Bitcoin ETF offers a leveraged exposure to Bitcoin's rally, but it's crucial to understand the risks of 2x leveraged ETFs. In my recent coverage of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) I've held a more cautious view due to a variety of factors. Among other things, the capital flow story was deteriorating through March and the chart appeared to be going through a consolidation phase that allowed for more price discovery between the $75k and $87k per coin range. After two months, Bitcoin's chart looks far more constructive and animal spirits appear to be returning to the market. In this article, we'll look at Bitcoin's recent correlation with US equities, implications from the daily and weekly price charts, as well as why I think the ProShares Ultra Bitcoin ETF ( BITU ) can be a useful tool for leveraging a Bitcoin rally back over $100k per coin. Correlations Bitcoin's correlation with tech stocks has been trending higher since spot ETFs were approved in the United States in January 2024: BITO, QQQ 30 Day Rolling Correlation (Portfolio Visualizer ) While there have been occasional dips in that correlation throughout the last 15 months, BTC has indeed had a closer relationship with the equity market than it has with the something like Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) over the last three and half years: Correlations BITO QQQ SPY GLD ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) 1 0.44 0.43 0.11 Invesco QQQ Trust ( QQQ ) 0.44 1 0.96 0.14 SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) 0.43 0.96 1 0.16 SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) 0.11 0.14 0.16 1 Source: Portfolio Visualizer, Asset correlations for time period 10/19/2021 - 04/24/2025 based on daily returns This is perhaps to the chagrin of Bitcoiners who view the asset as the digital equivalent of Gold - the latter of which has been on a rocket ship ride since breaking above $2,000 per ounce in early 2024. However, while investors/speculators can debate Bitcoin's past, present, and future as a 'safe-haven' asset, there is very little doubt in my own mind that Bitcoin continues to be a terrific anti-fiat trade. And history shows that as global M2 rises, the fiat-denominated price of BTC increases: BTC vs Global M2 (BGeometrics) Thus, as global M2 continues to rise, it stands to reason that BTC should follow. Consider the last time global M2 growth hit the 6% level - where it again currently stands now - BTC nearly doubled from $57k per coin in September 2024 to well over $100k in early 2025. To be clear, none of this means the same has to happen again, but given the level of debt throughout the global economy and the propensity for global governments to print when the going gets tough, BTC is not an asset that I think would be wise to short. Especially given what I see to be a clear technical breakout here in late-April. Technical Viewpoint When I look at Bitcoin technical indicators, I generally like to keep daily and weekly time-frames as the primary drivers of my decisions. Looking at the daily chart first, I see several positive signs: BTC Daily Chart (TrendSpider) Bitcoin held the 50-day MA for 4 straight sessions before moving convincingly higher on April 21st The coin has rallied through both the 100 and 200 day MAs in the sessions since It has taken out horizontal resistance at $90k It broke above trend-line resistance that dates back to January And the 'Crypto Fear and Greed' index has moved convincingly out of fear and into greed Shifting to the weekly chart, I've typically looked to the 8 and 20-week moving averages as my favorite indicators for increasing or decreasing exposure in the asset and its proxies. BTC Weekly Chart (TrendSpider) As of article submission, the weekly chart setup looks terrific. After battling with the 8-week MA for 4 consecutive weeks, we have a clear breakout above the 8 week and 20 week with our current candle. Something to keep in mind is the 8 week is still below the 20. But it does appear as though the 8-week MA will generate a week-on-week increase for the first time since February. Given everything I just laid out, I think it's reasonable to expect the price to head upward. Why BITU? I have covered BITU for Seeking Alpha in the past. For more of a fund-oriented view of the product, I'd encourage readers to get a proper sense for the risks associated with 2x leveraged ETFs. These are not products that are intended for long term holding, and they will decay over long periods of time due to daily re-balancing. Comparing BITU to a similar 2x fund as well as other Bitcoin-related ETFs, BITU is on the smaller side at under $1 billion in AUM: Fund Name Inception Expense Ratio AUM ProShares Ultra Bitcoin ETF 04/01/2024 0.95% $933.71M 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ) 06/27/2023 1.90% $2.39B iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) 01/05/2024 0.25% $54.48B ProShares Bitcoin ETF 10/18/2021 0.95% $2.40B Data by YCharts Data by YCharts",BTC-USD|BITU,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-26 04:24:08

Warsh, a former Fed governor and longtime Trump ally, said the Fed had morphed into “a general-purpose agency of government” instead of staying focused as an independent central bank. He said that drift away from its mission let inflation blow way past its 2% target. Speaking directly to the crowd at the Group of 30 event in D.C., Warsh said , “Since the panic of 2008, central bank dominance has become a new feature of American governance.” He warned that the Fed’s endless expansions into every political cause had caused massive errors in managing the economy. “Forays far afield — for all seasons and all reasons — have led to systematic errors in the conduct of macroeconomic policy,” Warsh said. Warsh links Powell’s policies to reckless government spending Warsh slammed the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet, saying it made it easier for politicians to keep throwing money around without thinking about the price. Warsh said, “Fiscal policymakers — that is, elected members of Congress — found it considerably easier appropriating money knowing that government’s financing costs would be subsidised by the central bank,” referring to the massive Treasury bond-buying spree under quantitative easing. The attack landed right in the middle of a serious fight between Trump and Powell. Just last week, Trump said he couldn’t wait for Powell’s “termination” as Fed chair. But later, Trump eased up, telling reporters he didn’t actually plan to fire him — which helped settle nerves across global markets that were already shaky. Warsh, who was once on Trump’s shortlist for Treasury secretary, used the Washington stage to drop his first public comments on monetary policy in months. Warsh isn’t a new critic either. He sat at the Fed when quantitative easing first started and has kept close tabs on what he sees as failures ever since. He didn’t stop at inflation and government spending. Warsh dragged the Fed’s climate change and social inclusion campaigns into the spotlight. He pointed out how the Fed used to be part of the Network for Greening the Financial System. Warsh admitted that the Fed had finally “changed its tune” by quitting the group in January, but didn’t suggest that it made up for anything else. Powell’s days are still numbered even if Trump cools down. His term ends in May 2026. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this month that the White House will start hunting for a replacement this fall. Warsh is one of the frontrunners alongside Kevin Hassett, who currently leads the National Economic Council. The real stakes are about control. Trump’s anger at Powell for not slashing rates, plus hints from the White House that they might have the authority to fire the Fed boss, have ripped open fears about the central bank’s independence. That fear helped crush equities and slammed the dollar in trading. Even though Warsh said he fully supports the Fed’s “operational independence” when it comes to setting interest rates, he was clear that doesn’t mean central bankers get a free pass. “When the monetary outcomes are poor, the Fed should be subjected to serious questioning,” Warsh said.

The Financial Stability Report, released by the Federal Reserve, said asset prices were still “notable” even though some markets took hits earlier this month. According to the report, “even after recent declines in equity prices, prices remained high relative to analysts’ earnings forecasts, which adjust more slowly than market prices.” The report also made it clear that Treasury yields across all maturities stayed near the highest levels anyone has seen since 2008. The Federal Reserve also pointed to leverage in the market as a big issue and said funding risks still looked serious. The report, covering market conditions up to April 11, said funding markets stayed strong through the rough patches in early April, but that didn’t mean everything was fine. The central bank made sure to mention that fair value losses on fixed-rate assets were still “sizable” for some banks and that these losses were very sensitive to changes in interest rates. Federal Reserve highlights asset prices, debt, and leverage trouble The Financial Stability Report broke down how bad things looked across four big areas. Starting with asset valuations, the Federal Reserve said stocks stayed pricey compared to earnings even after April’s selloffs. Treasury yields stayed stubbornly high, and spreads between corporate bonds and Treasurys stayed moderate. Liquidity problems built up through the end of March and got worse in April, but trading still worked. On the real estate side, home prices stayed high, and the ratio of house prices to rents hovered near record peaks. Commercial real estate indexes, adjusted for inflation, showed some signs of leveling off, but the Fed warned that refinancing needs could still cause problems soon. Debt didn’t look much better. Business and household debt as a share of GDP dropped to the lowest point in twenty years. But business leverage stayed high, and private credit deals kept growing. Source: The Federal Reserve Household debt looked tame compared to recent history. Most mortgages are fixed-rate and have low-interest rates, and overall debt service ratios are a bit better than before the pandemic. Still, the Fed flagged that credit card and auto loan delinquencies are up, especially for people with non-prime credit scores and lower incomes. When it came to leverage, the Federal Reserve said banks still looked sound, with capital levels above regulatory minimums. However, losses on fixed-rate assets kept hitting some banks hard. Some banks, insurance companies, and securitization shops kept piling into commercial real estate, too. The Fed said that bank lending to nonbank financial firms kept climbing, thanks in part to better tracking methods. Hedge fund leverage sat near the highest levels of the past ten years and was mostly packed into larger funds. Some leveraged investors started dumping positions during the April volatility to cover margin calls, with hedge funds in relative value trades being some of the hardest hit. Federal Reserve flags funding risks and ongoing market fragility The Federal Reserve said funding risks slid to moderate levels over the past year but didn’t vanish. Runnable money-like liabilities stayed near historic medians, still posing a long-term threat. Banks cut down their dependence on uninsured deposits since the highs of 2022 and 2023. Prime money market funds looked better, but other cash vehicles with the same risks kept growing. Bond and loan funds, holding assets that can turn illiquid fast under pressure, saw bigger-than-usual outflows during early April’s market stress. The Financial Stability Report also said global trade risks, debt concerns, and inflation were getting worse. It added, “a number of respondents also cited persistent inflation and corrections in asset markets as salient risks,” and most of the feedback was collected before April 2. Just a day before blasting stocks and real estate, the Federal Reserve rolled back years of crypto restrictions. It dropped earlier rules that told banks to get pre-approval before doing anything in crypto. In the Thursday announcement, the Federal Reserve said, “these actions ensure the Board’s expectations remain aligned with evolving risks and further support innovation in the banking system.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

On April 25, the 11 spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs saw $380 million in inflows, bringing the total for the week to around $3.06 billion over five consecutive inflow days, according to Farside data. The last time spot Bitcoin ETFs had a full week of inflow days was the week ending March 21. Strong inflow week turns April into positive month ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in an April 24 X post that “ETFs are on a Bitcoin bender.” “What’s really notable here is just HOW FAST the flows can go from 1st gear to 5th gear,” Balchunas said, forecasting that some of those flows may be due to the “basis trade back in effect.” Source: Satoshi Stacker Amid ongoing financial and macroeconomic uncertainty, spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a volatile April, with nine out of the total 18 trading days so far being outflow days. However, a strong surge of inflows over the past week has turned the month positive, bringing total net inflows for April to approximately $2.26 billion. On the same day, Strategy founder Michael Saylor reportedly said at the Bitwise Invest Bitcoin Corporations Investor Day that BlackRock’s iShare Bitcoin ETF “will be “the biggest ETF in the world in ten years.” Related: 5 Bitcoin charts predicting BTC price rally toward $100K by May Just two days prior, on April 23, BlackRock’s iShare Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) was awarded the “Best New ETF” at the annual etf.com ETF awards.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s spot price continues to hover around the $95,000 price level, currently trading at $94,613 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. Institutions are continuing to raise their bullish price targets. Billion-dollar asset manager ARK Invest recently raised its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, driven largely by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as “digital gold.” ARK’s “bear” and “base” case scenarios for the price of Bitcoin were also bumped up to $500,000 and $1.2 million.

One such metric – Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand – has shown a strong rebound, signalling renewed interest and sustained accumulation in the market. Bitcoin Sees Sharp Rebound In Apparent Demand According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, contributor IT Tech pointed to a significant rise in BTC’s Apparent Demand. Most notably, this key indicator has returned to positive territory after spending several consecutive weeks in the red. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters New Phase: Analyst Predicts Positive Movement In 2025 For the uninitiated, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand (30-day sum) measures the cumulative net demand for BTC over the past 30 days by tracking wallet accumulation and exchange outflows. A sharp increase in this metric suggests strong, sustained buying pressure, which can indicate bullish sentiment and potential for a price rally. The following chart illustrates this rebound in BTC’s Apparent Demand, which essentially reflects net changes in one-year inactive supply adjusted by daily block rewards – a metric designed to better represent organic demand growth. Previously, this metric had fallen deeply into negative territory – dipping below -200,000 (highlighted in red) – suggesting waning demand. However, its recent reversal into positive territory signals that long-dormant capital is flowing back into the market. As noted in the post: The demand pivot is closely aligned with the recent price rebound above $87K, implying this recovery is underpinned by real on-chain behavior rather than purely speculative flows. This marks the first positive Apparent Demand reading since February and aligns with rising inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as growing accumulation by long-term holders. Data from SoSoValue shows that US-based spot BTC ETFs have recorded five consecutive days of net positive inflows, totalling more than $2.5 billion. The cumulative net inflow into spot BTC ETFs now stands at an impressive $38.05 billion. Is A BTC Rally In Sight? IT Tech noted that past reversals in Apparent Demand have historically preceded either significant rallies or periods of strong price support. If the current trend continues, BTC may have the momentum needed to challenge the $90,000 level in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surpasses Realized Price Of Recent Buyers — Rally Incoming Or Double Top? However, analysts caution that Bitcoin must hold its current support around $91,500 to maintain upward momentum. This level is particularly important because it is close to the realized price of short-term BTC holders, according to CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk. Further adding to this outlook, prominent crypto analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that Bitcoin needs to secure a weekly close above $93,500 and reclaim it as support in order to establish a clear path to $100,000. At press time, BTC trades at $94,492, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

Following a significant capital raise, the potential for a GameStop Bitcoin purchase has ignited a fascinating discussion among its stakeholders, revealing an internal debate about the scale and nature of a potential Bitcoin treasury strategy . Why is GameStop Considering a Bitcoin Purchase Now? The recent buzz around GameStop and Bitcoin stems from the company’s successful raising of approximately $1.5 billion through the sale of convertible notes. This influx of capital provides GameStop with substantial financial flexibility. Coupled with this, GameStop previously amended its investment policy to explicitly allow for investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This move signals a potential shift in how GameStop manages its corporate treasury. While traditionally, companies hold cash, short-term government bonds, or other low-yield assets, a growing number of firms are exploring alternatives, including digital assets. GameStop’s policy change paved the way, and the recent capital raise provides the means. Understanding the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy A Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet as a corporate reserve asset. The motivations behind this strategy can vary, but common reasons include: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is seen by many as a potential hedge against inflation due to its capped supply (21 million coins). As central banks print more fiat currency, the purchasing power of cash can decrease, while Bitcoin’s scarcity could potentially preserve or increase value over time. Asset Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s treasury holdings away from traditional assets, which may be subject to different market dynamics. Potential Appreciation: Companies may invest in Bitcoin with the expectation that its value will appreciate significantly over the long term, adding to the company’s overall value. Signaling Innovation: Holding Bitcoin can signal that a company is forward-thinking and embraces technological innovation, potentially appealing to a certain demographic of investors and customers. The most well-known example of this strategy is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has accumulated a substantial amount of Bitcoin over the past few years, making it a core part of their corporate strategy. This precedent provides a template, albeit an aggressive one, for other companies considering similar moves. The GameStop Debate: How Much Corporate Bitcoin Adoption is Right? While GameStop’s amended policy allows for a Bitcoin purchase and the funds are available, the extent of such an investment is reportedly a point of contention within the company and its stakeholder community. According to Strive Asset Management CEO Matt Cole, GameStop stakeholders are divided on how aggressive the company should be in allocating its newly raised capital to Bitcoin. Strive Asset Management is known for advocating for companies to take bold stances, and their push is reportedly towards a more aggressive allocation to Bitcoin. However, sources indicate that opinions within GameStop’s board of directors and even among its passionate online community, particularly on platforms like Superstonk, remain mixed. This internal debate highlights the complexities of corporate Bitcoin adoption . It’s not just a simple financial decision; it involves weighing potential benefits against significant risks and considering the views of a diverse shareholder base, which in GameStop’s case, includes a highly engaged and vocal retail investor community. What are the Challenges and Considerations? Adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy comes with notable challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for its significant volatility, which can lead to large fluctuations in the reported value of the company’s treasury holdings. Accounting Rules: Under current accounting standards (like GAAP in the US), Bitcoin is treated as an intangible asset, which must be recorded at cost and is subject to impairment charges if its market value drops below the cost basis. Gains are only recognized when the asset is sold. This ‘asymmetric’ accounting can make holding Bitcoin appear riskier on the balance sheet than holding traditional assets. (Note: New FASB rules are expected to change this soon, allowing fair value accounting, which could alleviate some concerns). Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, which can create uncertainty for companies holding digital assets. Security: Safely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to protect against hacking or loss. Shareholder Sentiment: While some shareholders may applaud a move into Bitcoin, others may be risk-averse or believe the company should focus solely on its core retail business turnaround. What Could a Bitcoin Investment Mean for GME Stock? The decision regarding a GameStop Bitcoin purchase could have various implications for GME stock . On one hand, a significant investment could be seen positively by investors who are bullish on Bitcoin and appreciate GameStop’s willingness to embrace new technologies and potentially protect shareholder value against inflation. It could attract a new class of investors interested in companies with crypto exposure. On the other hand, a large allocation to a volatile asset like Bitcoin could introduce additional risk and uncertainty for GME stock holders. Investors primarily focused on the company’s fundamental business performance might view it as a distraction or an unnecessary gamble with shareholder capital. The impact on the balance sheet due to price swings could also influence investor perception. Ultimately, the market’s reaction would likely depend on the size of the investment, the clarity of GameStop’s strategy, and the prevailing sentiment towards both GameStop and Bitcoin at the time of any potential announcement. Broader Implications for Crypto Investment GameStop’s serious consideration of adding Bitcoin to its treasury is another data point in the ongoing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption . While not as large as some tech or financial firms, GameStop’s unique position as a company with massive retail investor interest makes its moves particularly symbolic. Should GameStop proceed with a notable Bitcoin purchase, it could encourage other companies, perhaps those with similar tech-savvy customer bases or a desire to differentiate themselves, to explore crypto investment . Each instance of a publicly traded company adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet contributes to the mainstreaming and legitimization of cryptocurrencies as a corporate asset class. Actionable Insights for Readers: Monitor GameStop’s Announcements: Keep an eye on official GameStop communications for any announcements regarding treasury management or cryptocurrency investments. Observe Market Reaction: If GameStop makes a Bitcoin purchase, analyze how GME stock and the broader crypto market react. Research Corporate Adoption Trends: Stay informed about which other companies are considering or implementing Bitcoin treasury strategies . This can provide insights into the evolving corporate finance landscape. Understand the Risks: For investors, understand that a company holding volatile assets like Bitcoin introduces additional risk to the stock. Compelling Summary GameStop stands at a fascinating crossroads, debating whether and how significantly to embrace a Bitcoin treasury strategy using its recently acquired capital. While the company’s policy allows for it and the funds are available, internal divisions and differing stakeholder views, including those from Strive Asset Management and the Superstonk community, mean the exact path forward for GameStop Bitcoin remains uncertain. This decision holds potential implications not only for the future of GME stock but also serves as another test case for the broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption and the evolving landscape of crypto investment in traditional finance.

While major names like Solana and XRP continue to perform, a growing number of investors are pivoting toward this new contender with one question in mind: Is this the next multi-million dollar crypto story? From wallet activity to online chatter, it’s becoming clear— MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just another token launch. It’s looking like a serious player on the verge of something much bigger. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building Real Momentum—and It’s Happening Fast The smartest moves in crypto come before the headlines. That’s exactly where MAGACOINFINANCE is right now: rising fast, but still early enough to move on. What’s fueling the rush? It’s a combination of clean rollout mechanics, transparent development, and—most importantly—confidence from experienced traders. Unlike short-lived trends, this project is checking every box: real wallet growth, growing community participation, and a development team that’s actively delivering on promises. It’s not speculation anymore. It’s traction. Why Solana and XRP Investors Are Joining the Move Solana has become the standard for high-speed, high-performance blockchains.

But even among these giants, there’s growing recognition that MAGACOINFINANCE could be where exponential growth still lives. Others in the Mix: Polkadot, Sei, and Key Ecosystem Drivers Polkadot remains a top-tier network for chain interoperability. Its parachain structure continues to attract experimentation and development flexibility, especially among builders focused on scalable applications. Sei is emerging quickly as a speed-first blockchain designed for performance-heavy use cases like trading. It’s still in the early wave—but developer interest is growing fast. These projects are solid—but they’re already discovered. MAGACOINFINANCE is still under the radar—and that’s exactly what makes it exciting. Final Word The crypto world rewards timing—and investors know it. Right now, early buyers are treating MAGACOINFINANCE.COM as a rare shot at entering before the wave breaks. This might not be just another token. It might be the opportunity that turns today’s moves into tomorrow’s big headlines.

New Update Sparks Pi Coin Listing Hopes appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, has just rolled out a major update to its coin listing process—and it’s sparking fresh buzz around a possible Pi coin listing . While the exchange emphasized making listings fair, safe, and transparent, Pi Network supporters are laser-focused on one thing: could this mean a Pi Network Binance listing is finally on the horizon? Also Read: Pi Coin Trading Suspended by BitMart, Delisted by Banxa: What’s Next for Pi Network Price? Binance Simplified Its Listing Rules In a recent announcement , Binance posted a detailed update on how it chooses which coins to list. The exchange said it wants the process to be fair, safe, and focused on good-quality projects. They’ve added three ways for coins to get listed—Binance Alpha, Futures, and Spot Trading—each with its own set of rules. Binance Alpha is like a test zone where early crypto projects can show their potential. It allows users to trade new tokens easily without needing special wallets. Projects listed here are often the first in line for bigger listings. Futures listings focus more on market activity. To qualify, tokens must show high trading volume and stable prices, and must follow clear rules around token release and team behavior. Spot listings , the most direct way to trade, are usually for tokens already proven in Futures or Alpha. Binance looks at price stability, trading activity, and community support before making a decision. 85% Want Pi Coin Binance Listing The excitement around the Pi Network Binance listing isn’t just wishful thinking. Back on February 17, Binance held a community vote asking users which coin they wanted listed next. The result? A massive 85% voted “yes” for Pi coin listing. Although Pi Coin hasn’t officially landed on Binance yet, the overwhelming support is fueling speculation that it might just be a matter of time. Pi Coin Price Outlook Even with the crypto market going up as BTC just hit the 2 month high of $95k, Pi Coin has stayed mostly steady in the past few days. As of now, it’s trading around $0.65, showing a small drop in the last 24 hours. Pi coin price seems to be getting ready to test a key resistance level near $0.825. If buyers step in and gain control, the price could even push higher toward the next resistance level at $1. But if selling pressure grows stronger, Pi Coin might fall and test a lower support zone, possibly dropping toward $0.50 in the coming days. Will Binance list Pi Network? Binance has not officially confirmed a Pi Network listing yet, but strong community support in the recent Binance vote has increased the chances. Giá Pi Network hiện tại là bao nhiêu? Giá Pi Network hiện tại dao động quanh mức $0.65, nhưng giá này chưa phải là giá chính thức từ mainnet giao dịch. What is the latest Pi Network coin price in INR?

This DeFi Project Is Raising Millions While Others Are Dropping,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/this-defi-project-is-raising-millions-while-others-are-dropping/,"The post Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now? This DeFi Project Is Raising Millions While Others Are Dropping appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While much of the crypto market is struggling to find its footing, a lesser-known DeFi protocol is quietly gaining speed—and buyers are rushing in before the next price jump. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at just $0.025, but with over half of Phase 4 already sold out, investors are looking ahead to Phase 5, where the price is set to climb. Out of the total 11 presale phases, each stage brings a slightly higher token price—and as demand builds, that price window won’t stay open for long. In total, more than 420 million tokens have been sold, and the presale has already raised over $7 million. The growing community of nearly 9,000 holders shows that Mutuum is no longer a hidden gem—it’s becoming a strategic move for those hunting value before listings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum sets itself apart in the DeFi space by combining both Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer earning mechanisms within one unified protocol. In the Peer-to-Contract model, participants contribute their crypto assets to communal liquidity pools. Borrowers tap into these pools by posting collateral, and the interest they pay goes directly to the liquidity providers. Interest rates fluctuate based on usage—when a pool is heavily borrowed from, the rate increases, benefiting lenders with higher returns. The Peer-to-Peer model, on the other hand, introduces a more personalized approach. Here, users negotiate directly with each other, setting custom terms based on market sentiment and asset type. This is especially useful for more speculative tokens like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and other meme coins that aren’t always supported in traditional lending protocols. By isolating these assets from the main liquidity pools, Mutuum allows more flexibility while keeping the core protocol stable. This dual-approach structure creates room for both conservative strategies and higher-risk, higher-reward plays—all within the same ecosystem. Beyond the presale excitement, Mutuum is building something more durable than just a trading vehicle. The protocol includes a built-in overcollateralized stablecoin, created when users deposit excess collateral into the system. The protocol’s stablecoin maintains an algorithmic link to the U.S. dollar and is designed to serve as a core component of the ecosystem, allowing users to access liquidity without needing to part with their underlying assets. Users who contribute assets to the liquidity pools are issued mtTokens in return. These tokens reflect a user’s portion of the liquidity pool and automatically grow in value as interest accrues. Holders can keep them, exchange them, or utilize them across other DeFi applications. Importantly, they also grant access to passive rewards, since Mutuum distributes a portion of its revenue to active participants. The platform buys MUTM tokens from the open market using protocol revenue and redistributes them to users—rewarding activity rather than speculation. With Phase 4 nearing completion, focus is shifting toward the upcoming stage, where the token’s price will rise to $0.03. For those who want to maximize their allocation, getting in before the next price tier is key. With 11 total presale phases, each step increases the entry cost—and early buyers stand to benefit the most once the token goes live. Mutuum has announced plans to release a beta version of its platform in conjunction with the token launch. That means buyers won’t have to wait long to interact with the system and test its full features. Combined with upcoming exchange listings, this rollout could create a strong wave of buying pressure—especially if the token hits the open market at or above the $0.06 mark. With major crypto assets facing resistance and many new tokens fading shortly after launch, Mutuum Finance is carving out a different path. It’s combining structured DeFi tools with real incentives, and its presale progress is proof that the market is paying attention. For investors looking for the best cheap crypto to buy now, it’s rare to find something that offers both a low entry point and a roadmap rooted in functionality. But with half of the current phase already sold out and a powerful dual lending model in place, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the most promising DeFi projects of the year. If the current pace continues, Phase 5 will open sooner than expected—meaning now might be the last window to secure tokens at $0.025 before the next price increase locks in.

43818877,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153020,1745647834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Controversy: TRUMP Token Surge Triggers Ethics Investigation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-token-ethics-inquiry/,"The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to volatility and controversy, but a recent surge involving a specific digital asset has thrust the intersection of politics and crypto into the spotlight. The TRUMP token , a meme coin associated with former President Donald Trump, has seen its market value skyrocket, leading to significant gains for holders. However, this rapid ascent isn’t just making headlines for its financial performance; it’s also sparking serious questions about crypto ethics and potential conflicts of interest at the highest levels of government. What’s Behind the TRUMP Token’s Explosive Rise? The TRUMP token, officially known as MAGA (TRUMP), has experienced an extraordinary increase in value. Reports indicate its market capitalization briefly reached an astonishing $15 billion, a figure that commands attention in any financial market, let alone the often-speculative realm of meme coins. Several factors appear to have fueled this surge: High-Profile Endorsements: Posts and statements from President Trump himself have undoubtedly played a significant role. When a figure with such a massive public following engages with a specific asset, it can create immense buzz and drive demand. Exclusive Holder Benefits: A key catalyst was an offer reportedly extended to the top 220 holders of the TRUMP token: an invitation to attend a dinner event with President Trump scheduled for May 22nd. This offer created a direct incentive for individuals to acquire and hold large quantities of the token, potentially driving up its price. Meme Coin Mania: The broader market has seen periods of intense speculation around meme coins, where value is often driven more by social media trends, community hype, and celebrity endorsements than by underlying technology or utility. This combination of political influence, exclusive access, and speculative fervor created a potent mix that propelled the TRUMP token into unprecedented territory. Why Are Senators Calling for an Ethics Inquiry? The intersection of President Trump’s promotion of an asset he seemingly benefits from and the offer of exclusive access tied to holding that asset has raised red flags among lawmakers. Democratic Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren have voiced strong concerns, formally calling on the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to launch an investigation. Their primary concern revolves around the potential for a “pay to play” scenario. The argument is that offering access – in this case, a dinner with a former President and potential future candidate – in exchange for holding a specific financial asset (the TRUMP token) could constitute a form of quid pro quo, blurring the lines between political engagement and personal financial gain. Senator Schiff highlighted the potential for this to be seen as using public influence for private profit, while Senator Warren has been a vocal critic of the crypto space, often citing concerns about market manipulation, lack of transparency, and risks to consumers. The call for an OGE investigation underscores the growing scrutiny on how political figures interact with and potentially benefit from digital assets, particularly those directly linked to their own name or brand. The Murky Waters of Political Tokens and Crypto Ethics The TRUMP token is not the only example of political figures or movements having associated cryptocurrencies or NFTs. This trend introduces complex ethical dilemmas: Conflict of Interest: When a political figure promotes or holds a token directly tied to them, it creates a potential conflict of interest, especially if their public actions or statements can influence the token’s value. Market Manipulation Concerns: High-profile endorsements can be perceived as attempts to manipulate the market, artificially inflating the value of an asset for the benefit of insiders or large holders. Transparency Issues: The ownership structure and financial flows associated with these political tokens can be opaque, making it difficult to track who is benefiting and by how much. Defining “Promotion”: The line between a casual mention, an endorsement, and active promotion of a financial asset can be blurry, especially in the context of social media and political rallies. These issues challenge the established norms of government ethics and campaign finance, which have existing rules around donations, gifts, and the use of public office for private gain. Applying these rules to the novel and rapidly evolving crypto landscape is a significant challenge for regulators. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation ? This incident adds another layer to the ongoing debate surrounding crypto regulation in the United States and globally. Critics of the crypto space will likely point to the TRUMP token situation as evidence of the need for stricter oversight, particularly regarding market integrity, investor protection, and the potential for illicit activity or ethical breaches. Key areas that might see increased focus include: Defining Securities: Are political tokens securities? The answer has significant implications for how they can be offered, traded, and promoted under existing laws. Political Finance Rules: How do existing campaign finance laws apply to contributions or benefits derived from cryptocurrencies, especially those directly tied to a candidate or political figure? Disclosure Requirements: Should political figures be required to disclose their holdings of specific cryptocurrencies, especially those linked to their own identity or campaign? Enforcement Mechanisms: How can regulatory bodies effectively monitor and enforce rules in the decentralized and global nature of the crypto market? The OGE investigation, if it proceeds, could set precedents or at least highlight the gaps in current regulations when it comes to the intersection of politics and digital assets. It puts pressure on lawmakers and regulatory bodies like the SEC, CFTC, and potentially the FEC to clarify rules and enhance oversight. Navigating the Ethical Minefield: Actionable Insights For investors, developers, and political figures operating in or interacting with the crypto space, the TRUMP token situation offers several important takeaways: Due Diligence is Crucial: Investors should be extremely cautious when considering tokens associated with political figures. Understand that their value can be highly speculative and susceptible to political events and endorsements. Transparency Matters: Projects and individuals involved in political tokens should prioritize transparency regarding ownership, distribution, and any associated benefits or promotions. Understand Regulatory Risk: The regulatory landscape for crypto, especially political tokens, is uncertain. Be aware that rules can change rapidly, and enforcement actions are possible. Consult Legal Counsel: Political figures or campaigns considering engaging with crypto should seek expert legal advice to navigate potential ethical and legal pitfalls related to campaign finance and government ethics. This event serves as a stark reminder that while cryptocurrency offers innovative possibilities, it also introduces new avenues for potential ethical conflicts and regulatory challenges, particularly when it intersects with the established world of politics and power. Summary: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto and Politics The dramatic surge of the TRUMP token and the subsequent call for a government ethics inquiry highlight the increasing complexity and potential risks at the intersection of cryptocurrency and politics. The allegations of a potential “pay to play” scheme underscore the urgent need for clearer guidelines and increased scrutiny regarding how political figures interact with digital assets. This incident will likely fuel further debate on crypto ethics and push the conversation around crypto regulation forward, potentially leading to new rules to address the unique challenges posed by political tokens and celebrity endorsements in the digital asset space. It’s a critical moment that demands attention from regulators, investors, and the political class alike.

The move has gained momentum since U.S. President Donald Trump imposed new tariffs that critics say could destabilize international markets. The movement is launching a referendum initiative aimed at amending the Swiss constitution to make it mandatory for the SNB to hold Bitcoin alongside gold as part of its official reserves. The initiative is being led by the Bitcoin Initiative, a group founded by Luzius Meisser, a prominent figure in the Swiss crypto community. Related News: Critical Number Revealed for Bitcoin: Miners Start Losing Money If BTC Falls Below This Number Despite this momentum, Schlegel remained steadfast. “Cryptocurrencies are not currently fulfilling the requirements for our foreign exchange reserves,” he said. He emphasized the need for the central bank to reliably buy and sell assets, raising concerns about market liquidity. Schlegel also pointed to the extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies, describing their value swings as “very, very high,” casting doubt on their role as stable reserve assets. Addressing shareholders earlier in the meeting, Meisser argued that Bitcoin offers strategic value in a changing geopolitical environment. “I must admit that it may not be very valuable in the scenarios that most of you consider normal,” he said, adding, “But Bitcoin will be very valuable in the specific scenario of a multipolar world order where reliance on sovereign debt is decreasing.” *This is not investment advice.

He criticized them for the continued spread of baseless and exaggerated claims. The post responds to a rumor that XRP could reach $200–400 in four weeks, supposedly cited by Forbes. Responding to this claim, All Things XRP wrote, “If you’re still posting this garbage, you’re not helping. You’re hurting.” The influencer urged others to prioritize depth, accuracy, and effort over speculation and engagement tactics. He added, “Will my audience be smarter, more informed, or better off after reading this? If yes—post it. If no—don’t.” Dear XRP influencers (again), I just saw this post: ""JUST IN: According to Forbes, XRP might reach $200–400 during the next four weeks."" Seriously? If you're still posting this garbage, you're not helping. You're hurting. The XRP community is done with hype. They want… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 24, 2025 Community Response The message aligned with the views of many in the XRP community. One user criticized the environment of content farming, stating, “Anything for engagement. Old news, fake news, redundant news, hype, and AI-generated content.” He said he actively unfollows accounts that rely on these tactics to reduce noise in his feed. Other experts, including Alex Caraco, the former CEO of a stock market firm, have weighed in on the wild claims, condemning them as harmful to the XRP army. He believes the asset will grow, but expects it to happen gradually as adoption increases. Another commenter acknowledged having once fallen for hype but said he had shifted to a fact-based approach. “I fell for the hype in the beginning… now, I post facts. I look up everything,” he explained. His focus now is on providing real-time corrections and educating others without engaging in personal attacks.

Many in the XRP community believe this kind of messaging undermines the asset’s reputation and the credibility of those who promote it.

The traders who spotted momentum early, the coins that defied expectations, and the small bets that turned into fortune-changing wins. As the market heats up, bold voices are suggesting that MAGACOINFINANCE.COM and XRP might be two of the next breakout names—and those watching closely don’t want to miss it. With narrative, structure, and timing all aligning, the potential for a true breakout story feels possible again. And MAGACOINFINANCE is standing at the center of that conversation. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Acting Like a Token Built for This Moment When most tokens are fighting for attention, MAGACOINFINANCE is doing something different—it’s gaining it naturally. There’s no fake flash, no inflated announcements—just real community momentum and steady technical development that’s creating one of the most watched early-stage plays in 2025. Investor channels are increasingly referencing it as a strategic long shot with high conviction. Its roadmap is on track. Wallet creation is climbing. And most importantly, the energy around the project doesn’t feel temporary—it feels earned. The question is no longer “what is MAGACOINFINANCE ?” but “how early am I?” Momentum Watch: Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei Solana remains a high-performance network that continues to attract developers across sectors—from gaming to tokenized tools. Its scalability and low transaction costs remain a competitive advantage. Toncoin is becoming known for seamless onboarding through mobile-native interfaces and social app integrations. Its user-first approach continues to broaden its reach. Optimism is leading the charge in Layer-2 scaling solutions. As Ethereum evolves, OP’s tech remains central to reducing costs and improving access to key dApps. Sei is still in its early phase, but it’s showing promise with performance-focused infrastructure designed to serve next-gen financial applications. Each of these plays has merit—but none are where MAGACOINFINANCE is right now: rising fast, still early, and increasingly hard to ignore. Final Word From $999 to $999K? It’s the kind of question that makes crypto exciting. MAGACOINFINANCE.COM and XRP aren’t just trending—they’re proving that momentum, utility, and smart execution still matter in a market that moves fast.

Several meme coins have produced impressive gains over the past 24 hours, led by BONK and TRUMP, both of which have soared by over 20%. BTC Calms at $95K The primary cryptocurrency began the trading week on the right foot, with its price surging from $84,000 to over $87,000. Thus, it broke above the upper boundary of its recent consolidation range. The gains continued in the following days, including a surge past $90,000 on Tuesday, and BTC hasn’t looked back since. It jumped to $93,000 on Wednesday, where it faced minor resistance and was pushed down to $92,000. However, that was short-lived, and the asset started pushing north once again on Thursday and Friday. The culmination came yesterday when BTC came inches away from tapping $96,000. Although it couldn’t penetrate that level, it still marked a two-month high. For now, its price stands just below $95,000 after a small correction on a daily scale. Its market cap has calmed at $1.880 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts has declined slightly to 61.2%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView TRUMP on the Rise Again After the news went out that the top 220 TRUMP holders would have the chance to attend a special dinner with the US President, the meme coin’s price went parabolic. As more information is revealed by the team, investors rush into buying the token, and its price is up by another 20% on a daily scale. Its value has roughly doubled in the past week, currently trading close to $15. The top performer today is Bitcoin SV, though, which has returned to the biggest 100 alts by market cap after a 31% surge. WLD follows with 24%, and BONK completes the top 3 with a 22% increase. Most larger-cap alts are trading more quietly, aside from SHIB and PEPE, which have posted impressive gains. DOGE and XLM are also in the green. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

43819764,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153022,1745649628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Solana Acquisition: Massive Potential as DeFi Development Corp. Plans $1B Offering,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/solana-acquisition-plan/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news that could signal a significant shift for one of its leading blockchains. Reports indicate that DeFi Development Corp. (formerly known as Janover Inc.) is exploring a substantial financial maneuver that could directly impact the Solana ecosystem. This development, centered around a potential Solana acquisition , has captured the attention of investors and market observers alike, highlighting the increasing complexity and ambition within the decentralized finance (DeFi) and broader crypto space. What’s Behind the DeFi Development Corp. $1 Billion Plan? According to a report by Wu Blockchain on X, DeFi Development Corp. has taken a major step towards potentially funding significant corporate activities, including a possible Solana acquisition . On April 25, the company filed a Form S-3 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing indicates a plan to offer up to $1 billion in various securities. Additionally, the filing includes the registration of 1,244,471 shares for potential resale by selling shareholders. The stated purpose for the proceeds from this offering is broad, covering general corporate purposes. However, the filing specifically mentions that these funds could be used for the “acquisition of Solana (SOL)”. This particular detail is what has ignited widespread discussion and speculation across the crypto community. Understanding the SEC Filing and its Implications An SEC filing , particularly a Form S-3, is a standard regulatory step for companies looking to raise capital in public markets. A Form S-3 is typically used by companies that have been public for at least 12 months and meet certain filing requirements, allowing them to register securities quickly and efficiently. This type of filing provides flexibility, enabling the company to sell securities ‘off the shelf’ when market conditions are favorable, up to the registered amount. Here’s a breakdown of what the filing signifies: Registration of Securities: DDC is registering different types of securities (which could include stocks, bonds, warrants, etc.) to be sold to the public or institutional investors. Potential $1 Billion Raise: The filing allows DDC to raise up to this significant amount over time. It doesn’t mean they will raise the full amount immediately or even at all, but it provides the framework to do so. Share Resale: The registration of existing shares for resale allows certain shareholders (often insiders or early investors) to sell their holdings publicly under specific conditions. Transparency: Filing with the SEC makes the company’s intentions and financial status public, providing transparency to potential investors and the market. The mention of using proceeds for a Solana acquisition within an official SEC filing lends credibility to the possibility, moving it beyond mere rumor into a stated potential use of funds by the company itself. What Does a Potential Solana Acquisition Mean? The phrase “acquisition of Solana (SOL)” is open to interpretation, especially in the context of a decentralized network. It could mean several things: Acquiring Significant SOL Tokens: DDC could plan to use a portion of the raised funds to purchase a large amount of SOL tokens on the open market or through private deals. This would represent a major investment in the network’s native asset. Acquiring the Solana Foundation or Related Entities: It might refer to acquiring the non-profit foundation or specific companies heavily involved in the development or ecosystem of Solana. Acquiring Assets or Projects within the Solana Ecosystem: The funds could be targeted at buying up promising DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, or other projects built on Solana to integrate them into DDC’s operations. Given DDC’s name, focusing on “DeFi Development,” the latter interpretations, or a combination involving significant SOL holdings, seem plausible. A large-scale Solana acquisition , in any form, would be a landmark event in the crypto industry, potentially bringing new resources, strategies, and attention to the Solana network. How Could This Impact SOL Price? News of a potential large-scale investment or acquisition often has a significant impact on asset prices. For SOL price , the implications could be substantial, although market reactions are complex and depend on various factors. Increased Buying Pressure: If DDC intends to use a significant portion of the $1 billion to acquire SOL tokens, this would create considerable buying pressure, potentially driving the SOL price upwards. Market Confidence: A major corporation planning such a large investment could be seen as a vote of confidence in Solana’s technology, ecosystem, and future potential, attracting other investors. Speculation: The news itself can fuel speculation, leading to increased trading volume and volatility as market participants react to the potential acquisition. Funding Certainty: Knowing that a large pool of capital is potentially earmarked for Solana-related activities could provide a level of certainty and positive sentiment for the ecosystem. Conversely, the market’s reaction will also depend on the specifics of the plan, regulatory hurdles, overall market sentiment, and whether the offering successfully raises the intended capital. Investors should watch for further announcements from DDC and monitor market dynamics closely to understand the evolving impact on SOL price . Broader Trends in Crypto Acquisition This potential move by DDC fits into a growing trend of crypto acquisition and consolidation within the blockchain industry. As the space matures, companies are looking for ways to expand their reach, acquire technology, gain market share, and integrate different parts of the ecosystem. We’ve seen acquisitions in various sectors of crypto, including: Exchanges acquiring trading platforms or data providers. DeFi protocols merging or acquiring complementary services. Traditional companies acquiring crypto startups to enter the space. A large-scale crypto acquisition like a significant investment in or acquisition related to a major blockchain like Solana would represent a new level of institutional interest and strategic maneuvering. It highlights the increasing value placed on established blockchain ecosystems and the potential for traditional corporate finance structures (like public offerings) to fund growth in the crypto sector. Key Considerations and Actionable Insights This development raises several points for consideration: Regulatory Scrutiny: A large offering and potential acquisition involving a major blockchain asset could attract significant attention from regulators beyond the initial SEC filing . Execution Risk: Raising $1 billion is a significant undertaking, and successfully deploying it for an acquisition in the volatile crypto market presents challenges. Integration: If DDC acquires entities or projects within the Solana ecosystem, successful integration will be crucial for long-term value creation. Community Reaction: The Solana community’s response to a potential corporate acquisition could influence the outcome and perception of the move. For investors and market participants, actionable insights include: Monitor DDC Announcements: Keep an eye on official statements from DeFi Development Corp. regarding the offering and their plans for the proceeds. Track SEC Updates: Follow any further filings or communications with the SEC related to the Form S-3. Observe SOL Price Action: Analyze how the market reacts to this news and subsequent developments. Evaluate the Specifics: Wait for details on *how* DDC intends to use the funds for “acquisition of Solana (SOL)” before making investment decisions based solely on this initial news. In Conclusion The news of DeFi Development Corp.’s $1 billion securities offering and the stated potential use of funds for a Solana acquisition is a significant development. It underscores the growing intersection of traditional finance mechanisms and the dynamic world of decentralized technology. While the specifics of the “acquisition” remain somewhat ambiguous, the sheer scale of the potential offering and the explicit mention of Solana in an SEC filing make this a story worth following closely. The outcome of this offering and DDC’s subsequent actions could have meaningful implications for DeFi Development Corp. , the SOL price , and the broader landscape of crypto acquisition in the coming months.

Despite sellers trying to push prices down, the market remains strong, and it looks like it could continue climbing. Solana Meme Coins Lead the Way Bonk (BONK), a meme coin on the Solana network , shot up this week, reaching $0.000020, its highest point since early February. The coin has more than doubled from this month’s low, rising over 127%. This surge came as traders flocked to meme coins again, especially those built on Solana. The rise of a newer Solana meme coin, Fartcoin, played a major role in Bonk’s price jump. Fartcoin skyrocketed more than 450%, which sparked excitement about other Solana meme coins. This momentum lifted other tokens like TRUMP, Dogwifhat, Pudgy Penguins, and Popcat, all rising by over 50% in a short time. Although Trump’s meme coin gained on news of a dinner with top holders , it dropped 18% the next day, but remains up this week. Bonk, being one of the more established meme coins, quickly followed the trend. Crypto Market Pushes BONK Memecoin Higher Bonk’s rise is also tied to the overall strength of the crypto market. Bitcoin recently broke past $95,000, Ethereum neared $2,000, and Solana reached $150. When major coins like these perform well, smaller ones like Bonk often follow. Investor confidence is returning, and this is driving prices higher across the board, including for Bonk. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : FLOKI Price Prediction 2025: Is 270% Surge Incoming? , BONK Price Analysis From a technical standpoint, Bonk looks promising.

The technical indicators show growing strength, suggesting Bonk could keep rising. Bonk’s price surge is a combination of factors: the rise of Solana-based meme coins, the overall strength of the crypto market, and positive political news. With strong technical indicators, Bonk could continue to climb shortly. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43820072,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153026,1745650247,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,XRP ETF: Brazil Unlocks Historic First Crypto ETF Launch,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/xrp-etf-brazil-launch/,"Get ready for some exciting news from the world of digital assets! A major milestone has just been reached that could significantly impact how institutional investors access the XRP market. The world’s first ever XRP ETF has officially launched, and it’s happening in Brazil. XRP ETF: A Historic Launch on the Brazil Stock Exchange The buzz is real. Hashdex, a prominent player in the crypto asset management space, has just made history. Their XRP ETF , known by the ticker symbol XRPH11, commenced trading today on the Brazil Stock Exchange , also known as B3. This isn’t just another fund; it’s the very first exchange-traded fund globally that focuses specifically on XRP. The approval for this groundbreaking fund came in February, paving the way for its debut this week. The structure of XRPH11 is designed with a clear focus: it will invest a minimum of 95% of its assets directly or indirectly in XRP. This high allocation ensures that investors in XRPH11 gain significant exposure to the performance of the XRP digital asset. Why is this such a big deal? For years, the financial world has been eyeing ways to bridge the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. ETFs are a familiar and regulated investment vehicle for institutions and retail investors alike. The launch of an XRP ETF on a major regulated exchange like the Brazil Stock Exchange represents a significant step towards mainstream acceptance and accessibility for XRP. Hashdex: Pioneering Crypto Investment Products Who is behind this innovative product? Hashdex is the asset manager responsible for bringing the XRPH11 to market. They have been at the forefront of creating regulated crypto investment products in Brazil and other markets. Their experience in navigating the regulatory landscape and structuring funds that meet institutional requirements is crucial for such a launch. Hashdex’s move into the XRP space follows their previous successes in the crypto ETF market. Brazil, in fact, has been a pioneering country in this regard. Last year, the Brazil Stock Exchange also saw the launch of the world’s first Solana ETF, also facilitated by Hashdex. This track record demonstrates Brazil’s progressive stance on crypto regulation and Hashdex’s commitment to expanding investment opportunities in the digital asset class. The decision by Hashdex to launch an XRP-focused fund signals growing confidence in XRP as an investable asset and acknowledges the demand from investors looking for regulated exposure beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Institutional Adoption: Why This Matters for XRP The primary target audience for the XRPH11 fund is institutional adoption . While retail investors can also access ETFs, the structure and regulatory wrapper make them particularly attractive to large financial institutions, wealth managers, and corporate treasuries. Here’s why this launch is significant for fostering Institutional Adoption : Regulatory Clarity: Investing in a regulated ETF on a traditional stock exchange offers a level of regulatory clarity and compliance that direct crypto holdings might lack for some institutions. Ease of Access: Institutions can buy and sell ETF shares through their existing brokerage accounts, simplifying the process compared to setting up crypto wallets or accounts on various exchanges. Custody Handled: The ETF structure means the asset manager (Hashdex) handles the complexities and security risks associated with storing the underlying XRP, a major concern for institutions. Familiar Structure: ETFs are a well-understood investment vehicle, making it easier for investment committees and compliance departments within institutions to approve allocations. Increased Institutional Adoption through products like the XRPH11 could potentially bring significant capital into the XRP market, leading to increased liquidity and potentially impacting price discovery. It also lends further legitimacy to XRP as a recognized asset class within traditional finance. The Global Crypto ETF Landscape and Future Implications The launch of the first XRP ETF in Brazil is not happening in isolation; it’s part of a larger global trend towards integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional financial markets via ETFs. While the U.S. has seen the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the regulatory path for altcoin ETFs, including XRP, has been less clear and often subject to significant debate. The performance and trading volume of XRPH11 on the Brazil Stock Exchange will be closely watched by market participants and regulators worldwide. According to a report by BeInCrypto, while the initial trading volume figures for XRPH11 are not yet publicly available, the fund’s performance and the level of investor interest it garners could provide valuable insights. Specifically, these insights could be particularly relevant for jurisdictions like the United States, where discussions around approving altcoin ETFs are ongoing but have faced hurdles. A successful, well-performing XRP ETF in a regulated market like Brazil could serve as a compelling case study, demonstrating market demand and the feasibility of managing such a product within a regulated framework. The approval process for crypto ETFs varies significantly by country. Here’s a simplified look at the landscape: Country/Region Status of Crypto ETFs Examples Brazil Approved (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Multi-crypto) Hashdex Crypto Index ETF, QR Capital Bitcoin ETF, Hashdex XRP ETF (XRPH11) Canada Approved (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Multi-crypto) Purpose Bitcoin ETF, CI Galaxy Ethereum ETF Europe (various exchanges) Approved (ETPs/ETNs for various cryptos including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.) CoinShares Physical Bitcoin, 21Shares Ethereum ETP United States Approved (Bitcoin Spot & Futures) BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) Australia Approved (Bitcoin, Ethereum) Various funds on Cboe Australia This table highlights that Brazil is among the leaders in offering a diverse range of crypto ETFs, including now the first dedicated XRP ETF . Potential Benefits and Challenges Ahead While the launch is undoubtedly positive, it’s important to consider both the potential benefits and the challenges that lie ahead for the XRPH11 and the broader trend of Crypto ETF launches. Potential Benefits: Increased legitimacy and awareness for XRP. New avenue for capital inflow from traditional finance. Potential for reduced price volatility due to increased liquidity (though this is not guaranteed). Provides a regulated option for investors who are uncomfortable with direct crypto ownership. Potential Challenges: Market volatility of XRP itself, which will directly impact the ETF’s performance. Regulatory uncertainties in other major markets (like the US) could limit global impact. Competition from other investment products or direct crypto ownership. Educating traditional investors about XRP and the nuances of crypto ETFs. The success of XRPH11 will depend on investor demand, market conditions, and the ongoing evolution of the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies worldwide. It serves as a crucial experiment and a potential catalyst for further approvals elsewhere. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for XRP and Crypto ETFs The launch of the world’s first XRP ETF by Hashdex on the Brazil Stock Exchange is a truly historic moment for the cryptocurrency market. It represents a significant step forward for Institutional Adoption of XRP and highlights Brazil’s leading role in creating regulated investment products for digital assets. While challenges remain, particularly in terms of global regulatory harmonization, the XRPH11 offers a new, accessible pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP. This development could provide valuable data and inspiration for other countries considering similar funds, potentially accelerating the integration of altcoins into the mainstream financial system. The crypto world watches with anticipation to see how this pioneering Crypto ETF performs and the doors it might open for the future.

On the list of the best cryptos to buy, three tokens stand out: FXGuys ($FXG), Stellar (XLM), and Hedera (HBAR). However, the true winner among the three is FXGuys, a new crypto trading platform that holds massive growth promise, excellent benefits, and incredible utility, securing its top spot among the best cryptos to buy before the next bull run begins. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys: The New Crypto Trading Platform That Everybody Wants It might come as a surprise that a new crypto trading platform is at the top of the list of the best cryptos to buy before the next bull run starts. But once you take a closer look at FXGuys, you will not only understand why it is at the top but you will also agree with its placement. The FXGuys may be new, but it brings solutions to problems that go back years. First off, this new crypto trading platform provides same-day payouts and unlimited withdrawals, solving the years-long issues traders have had with payout delays. These two features also allow traders to manage their earnings as they wish, providing them with the flexibility they have long been waiting for. Another major factor that has made the $FXG public presale one of the most popular on the market is the free trial FXGuys launched for its BETA trading platform. This allows investors and traders to try out the FXGuys before investing in it. This is quite an uncommon move for a DeFi presale, as most wait for it to be over before realizing anything. As a result, this move by the FX Guys is not only a show of confidence but a testament to the quality and smooth service this new crypto trading platform offers. FXGuys also provides excellent terms for traders who need funding, like an 80/20 profit split and access to $500,000 in funds. This way, funded traders can make thousands in profits with just one FX Guys account. This new crypto trading platform also offers great rewards. One of them is the FXGuys Trade2Earn program which allows traders to earn $FXG tokens by making trades. Another is the FX Guys staking rewards program, which traders can use to stake their $FXG tokens, earning a share of the FXGuys trading volume and fees in return. So, after learning more about this new crypto trading platform, it is clear why it has secured its spot at the top of the best cryptos to buy list. And as the next bull run approaches, investors are eager to join this amazing project before $FXG enters its next presale stage and its price rises. Stellar At a Make-Or-Break Point Stellar is facing uncertain waters at the moment. As XLM hits its current price level, the Stellar community is left wondering whether the XLM price is going to go up or down from here. Experts say that XLM will need strong whale activity if it wants to break above $0.5 before the next bull run. However, they say that this might prove to be difficult, as XLM has formed a bearish price pattern. So, much to the disappointment of the Stellar community, experts believe that if the bearish XLM pattern materializes, Stellar could see its native XLM token crash by 30%. Many Stellar holders are still holding strong, believing that XLM is not only one of the best cryptos to buy right now but that it will also experience a rally before the next bull run. However, most Stellar holders are not that confident, opting to invest in FXGuys instead as this new crypto trading platform shows promise and potential XLM currently cannot match. Will Hedera Reach $0.2 Before the Next Bull Run? After HBAR lost over 19% of its value in the past week, things seem to be looking up for Hedera. Namely, the Hedera community and experts alike have noticed strong buying pressure surrounding HBAR. Currently, the HBAR price is facing a critical resistance level at $0.19. If the Hedera community manages to band together and push the HBAR price to break above this resistance, HBAR could see a 40% increase in its price. On the other hand, if Hedera holders do not manage to sustain an upward momentum, the HBAR price could drop below $0.17 before the next bull run. Experts say that, due to the lack of interest from outside investors in Hedera, the second scenario is most likely to happen. And by the looks of it, many Hedera holders agree with this sentiment, choosing to jump ship and take their money to the $FXG presale in search of bigger and more stable gains. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG: One of the Best Cryptos To Buy In 2025 With all the perks and amazing utility it offers, it’s no surprise that $FXG has become one of the best cryptos to buy even before it launches on exchanges. Currently in Stage 3 of its presale, $FXG is available at $0.05. However, as this presale stage nears its end, $FXG will soon enter Stage 4 of its presale, where its price will go up to $0.06. Once $FXG reaches $0.10 and launches on exchanges, experts predict a huge rally for the token. They predict that $FXG will rise by 100x before Q2 of 2025, delivering massive gains to its holders. So, if you want to secure such gains for yourself, head over to the $FXG presale and stock up!

CME Group, a key player in the global derivatives market, announced that it will officially launch XRP futures on May 19, 2025. While CME is not the first entity to offer regulated XRP futures, it is undoubtedly the most influential. The community has anticipated this move for months as enthusiastic community members found the Beta website in January. Given CME’s dominant position in the market, introducing this product marks a pivotal moment for XRP, one that is expected to draw considerable attention from institutional investors and market participants alike. While overdue in a bunch of ways, this is an incredibly important and exciting step in the continued growth of the XRP market! https://t.co/mnwJXKH5hi — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) April 24, 2025 CME Group’s Market Position and Significance CME Group’s influence in the cryptocurrency market is substantial. CME currently holds the largest share of Bitcoin futures open interest, with over 21% of the $65 billion market. This places CME ahead of other crypto-native exchanges such as Binance and OKX, showcasing its established presence and credibility in the digital asset space. This strong market position gives added weight to the launch of XRP futures, as CME’s influence is expected to bring greater legitimacy and exposure to XRP as an asset class. CME’s entry into the market for XRP futures follows a series of important milestones for the exchange in the crypto derivatives space. In January 2018, CME Group launched Bitcoin futures, marking a key moment in the cryptocurrency market’s development, though it coincided with the onset of a major bear market. More recently, in February 2021, CME introduced Ethereum futures. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 More Exciting News for the XRP Community The introduction of regulated futures for XRP addresses a significant barrier that has long impeded the approval of a spot-based XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. The lack of regulated futures products for XRP was previously seen as a key obstacle by regulators, particularly the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CME’s upcoming product and Bitnomial’s recent product launch have increased the chances of a spot XRP ETF receiving approval from the SEC in 2025. Given the regulator’s increasing openness to cryptocurrency products, the approval of an XRP ETF appears imminent.

This recovery has drawn attention from analysts, who seem to be looking into the asset’s movement for signs of sustained strength or renewed volatility. Despite this short-term rise, ETH remains approximately 63% below its all-time high of $4,878 reached in 2021, highlighting the broader downturn that has characterized the Ethereum market since late 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Just Accumulated 640K ETH, Is a Bigger Rally Coming? Ethereum Derivative Exchange Inflows Point to Potential Volatility Recent on-chain data and exchange flows suggest Ethereum’s price trajectory may be influenced by broader macro factors and strategic trading behavior. Among the latest observations is a notable surge in ETH sent to derivative exchanges, a metric often linked to increased speculative activity or changes in trader positioning. This trend, coupled with key political developments in the US, has raised new questions about what might be next for Ethereum and the wider crypto market. According to an analysis by Amr Taha, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, Ethereum has recorded unusually large inflows to derivative exchanges in the past 48 hours, with one spike exceeding 80,000 ETH. Historically, such inflows are seen ahead of periods of increased volatility, as traders shift assets to leverage positions or hedge against expected price movements. While not a definitive predictor of direction, this behavior suggests rising expectations of short-term market activity. Taha’s analysis notes that the inflow coincided with a recent political statement from US President Donald Trump, who confirmed he has no intention of removing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. This announcement was interpreted by markets as a signal that the Fed will continue to operate independently, easing concerns about political interference in monetary policy. Taha notes that given how closely crypto markets respond to central bank tone and economic indicators, this development added a layer of macro stability to a market already reacting to technical signals. BTC Whale Activity and Derivatives Data Suggest Tactical Shifts While Ethereum-specific data remains the primary focus, Taha also highlighted key movements in Bitcoin markets that may have indirect effects on ETH. On April 23, over $600 million worth of BTC was transferred from whale wallets to exchanges, marking the largest single-day BTC inflow in several weeks. This came after a breakout in the BTC/GBP pair, which triggered significant short liquidations. According to Taha, the large BTC transfer may reflect a setup where late long entries could face downside risk if selling pressure intensifies. For Ethereum, this backdrop raises the possibility of a short-term retracement, especially if correlated selling occurs across major digital assets.

43820311,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153025,1745650842,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Custody: SEC Commissioner Calls for Crucial Allowance for State Trust Companies,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-bitcoin-custody-rules/,"The landscape of digital asset regulation is constantly evolving, and a recent comment from a key U.S. official has sparked significant discussion. SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda has voiced his opinion that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should pave the way for state-chartered trust companies to handle the custody of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just a technical point; it touches upon fundamental questions about how digital assets fit into the existing financial system and who is best equipped to safeguard them. Understanding SEC Crypto Regulation and Commissioner Uyeda’s Stance The U.S. regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains complex, with multiple agencies asserting jurisdiction. The SEC, primarily focused on securities, has taken various actions regarding crypto assets it deems to be securities. However, the regulation surrounding the custody of assets, particularly non-security digital assets like Bitcoin, involves other bodies, including state financial regulators and federal banking agencies. According to a report by Bitcoin Magazine via X, SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda expressed a view that could potentially simplify or clarify one aspect of this complexity. He stated that the SEC should allow state-chartered trust companies to provide custody services for Bitcoin and other digital assets. This suggestion is noteworthy because it comes from within the SEC and points towards a potential path for traditional financial institutions operating under state charters to more formally engage with the crypto market. Currently, the path for traditional financial entities to offer robust Bitcoin custody services is often fraught with regulatory uncertainty. While some federal regulators have issued guidance, the interaction with securities laws, as enforced by the SEC, adds layers of complexity, especially for entities dealing with assets that might be perceived differently by various agencies. Why State Trust Companies Matter for Bitcoin Custody State-chartered trust companies have a long history in the U.S. financial system. They are regulated at the state level and specialize in holding and managing assets on behalf of individuals, families, or institutions. Their traditional role includes managing trusts, estates, and providing custodial services for various types of assets, from real estate and equities to precious metals. Here’s why Commissioner Uyeda’s focus on these entities for Bitcoin custody is relevant: Existing Regulatory Framework: State trust companies already operate under established regulatory and fiduciary duties tailored to asset custody. Experience with Complex Assets: While digital assets are new, trust companies are experienced in securely holding and managing diverse and sometimes complex asset classes. Client Relationships: They often serve high-net-worth individuals and institutions already interested in digital asset exposure. State-Level Innovation: Some states have been proactive in developing frameworks for digital assets, potentially offering clearer pathways than federal routes in certain instances. Allowing these entities a clear path for Bitcoin custody could leverage existing infrastructure and expertise, potentially providing a familiar and regulated option for investors seeking secure storage for their digital assets. Exploring Potential Benefits and Challenges of Expanded Crypto Custody Rules Commissioner Uyeda’s suggestion, if adopted or acted upon by the SEC, could bring several benefits, but it also presents potential challenges that need careful consideration. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Investor Protection: State trust companies are subject to rigorous audits, capital requirements, and fiduciary standards, which could offer a higher level of security and accountability for custodial services compared to some unregulated or less-regulated options. Increased Clarity: Clearer crypto custody rules from the SEC regarding state-chartered entities would reduce regulatory ambiguity, making it easier for trust companies to enter the market. Facilitating Traditional Finance Entry: Providing a clear regulatory on-ramp could encourage more traditional financial institutions, including banks and trust companies, to offer digital asset services, bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto. Driving Institutional Crypto Adoption: A major hurdle for institutions entering the crypto space is the lack of regulated, secure, and scalable custody solutions they are comfortable with. Allowing state trust companies could significantly boost institutional crypto adoption . Competition and Innovation: Increased participation from established financial players could foster competition and drive innovation in secure digital asset custody solutions. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Overlap and Conflict: Navigating the intersection of state-level regulation and federal SEC crypto regulation could still be complex. Ensuring consistent standards and avoiding regulatory arbitrage is crucial. Technical Expertise: While experienced in traditional custody, trust companies would need to develop or acquire specialized technical expertise in managing private keys, securing digital wallets, and navigating blockchain technology. Security Risks: Digital assets face unique security threats (hacking, protocol risks) that differ from traditional assets, requiring specialized infrastructure and protocols. Varying State Laws: Regulations for trust companies and digital assets vary from state to state, which could create a fragmented national landscape for crypto custody services. SEC’s Jurisdiction: The extent of the SEC’s authority over non-security digital assets and the custody thereof remains a debated topic, which could impact the implementation and effectiveness of any new rules. Impact on Institutional Crypto Adoption One of the most significant potential impacts of clearer crypto custody rules for entities like state trust companies is on institutional crypto adoption . Large financial institutions, asset managers, and corporate treasuries require highly secure, compliant, and insured custody solutions before they can commit significant capital to digital assets. Traditional finance operates within a framework where asset segregation, security audits, and regulatory oversight are standard. The ability to use a familiar entity like a state-chartered trust company for Bitcoin custody could lower the barrier to entry for these players. It provides a level of comfort and trust that is often missing when relying solely on crypto-native startups, many of which do not have the same long history or regulatory background. Increased institutional crypto adoption driven by improved custody options could lead to greater market liquidity, stability, and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. It’s a critical piece of the puzzle for the continued maturation of the crypto market. What’s Next for State Trust Companies and Bitcoin Custody? Commissioner Uyeda’s comment is a significant signal, but it is just that – a comment from one commissioner. It doesn’t instantly change SEC crypto regulation or establish new crypto custody rules . However, it does highlight an area where regulatory clarity is needed and suggests a potential path forward that leverages existing, regulated financial infrastructure. The next steps would likely involve: Further discussions and potentially formal proposals within the SEC regarding digital asset custody. Coordination (or lack thereof) between the SEC and state financial regulators. State trust companies assessing the technical and regulatory requirements to offer these services. Industry participants advocating for clear and workable rules. The journey towards fully integrated and regulated Bitcoin custody solutions for traditional finance is ongoing. Commissioner Uyeda’s statement represents a notable voice advocating for a specific, potentially effective, approach. Conclusion: SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda’s suggestion to allow state-chartered trust companies to custody Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a noteworthy development in the ongoing discussion about digital asset regulation in the U.S. By potentially leveraging the existing framework and expertise of these traditional financial entities, the SEC could help provide clearer crypto custody rules , enhance investor protection, and significantly boost institutional crypto adoption . While challenges related to regulatory coordination and technical requirements remain, this perspective offers a promising avenue for integrating digital assets more seamlessly and securely into the broader financial system. The path forward requires careful consideration and collaboration among regulators and industry participants to build robust and trustworthy infrastructure for the future of finance.

Cowen tells his 894,000 YouTube subscribers that, based on the social risk metric, which gauges crypto market sentiment based on the social media activity of market participants, altcoins could continue underperforming the crypto king. “I have often said Ethereum is sort of like the index of the altcoin market. If it’s doing poorly, interest in crypto is not that high and altcoins aren’t really doing that great. And you can see that as Ethereum has collapsed, so too did the social risk. So when we talk about the social interest in crypto and it being low, what it means is that altcoins will likely keep bleeding to Bitcoin.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube According to the widely followed analyst, the loosening of the US monetary policy could turn the tide in favor of altcoins. “Despite what people say, they truly want altcoin season. That’s what they want. And because they keep not getting it, altcoins keep bleeding to Bitcoin… …in order to see this change, you need monetary policy to change, which can ultimately lead to people getting more interested in the asset class… …the way you get monetary policy change is you get pain in the markets. We are getting pain in the markets right now. We have seen a lot of pain in the markets. And the more pain that the markets get, the higher the chance that loose monetary policy comes. But in order to see change, you have to have the pain. Welcome to the pain. I don’t know how long the pain is going to last, but it’s this type of pain in the markets that you see persist over a long time that then leads to changes in monetary policy.” ?

The changes came straight from Washington, as US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy rolled out new rules to loosen federal safety standards. Source: TradingView Duffy said on Thursday that the new framework would help American carmakers beat Chinese rivals. The updated rules mean some self-driving vehicles that don’t meet old federal standards, like needing rearview mirrors, will now be allowed to operate on public roads. Companies building these vehicles will no longer have to report every minor crash right away. Instead, they can now file monthly updates and only report serious incidents. The government also raised the damage threshold that triggers a required crash report for self-driving vehicles. Looser safety rules give Tesla more room to grow Consumer Reports reacted fast, warning that the changes would let cars with systems like Tesla Autopilot off the hook for reporting accidents unless someone dies, someone gets hospitalized, a pedestrian is hit, or an airbag goes off. Under the new setup, small incidents would slip under the radar, making it harder for watchdogs to track problems. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it would expand an exemption program that lets certain autonomous vehicles bypass normal safety rules. NHTSA also promised to simplify how automakers report crashes involving both self-driving and advanced driver assistance systems. The move was designed to speed up the rollout of autonomous tech, but not everyone liked the idea. The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety slammed the Transportation Department for watering down safety rules. The group said it was “disappointed” that reporting requirements were being diluted instead of strengthened. It warned, “without safeguards, safety regulations, transparency and accountability, the success of AV deployment is imperiled at best and could result in deadly consequences at worst.” Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive and a close adviser to Trump, has been pushing hard to launch commercial robotaxis. The eccentric billionaire has promised the service would be ready soon, even as Tesla faces investigations from NHTSA after a fatal crash involving its Full Self-Driving software. The new rules are seen as removing major hurdles Musk has been fighting against for years. Stock market stages a wobbly recovery amid Trump’s rampant policy changes Trump’s changes earlier in the week lifted the entire stock market. The S&P 500 rose by 0.74% to close at 5,525.21. The Nasdaq Composite climbed by 1.26% to 17,282.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a 20-point gain, closing 0.05% higher at 40,113.50. Tech stocks saw major action too. Alphabet, the parent company of Google and a member of the “Magnificent Seven,” rose 1.5% after beating Wall Street forecasts for the first quarter. Nvidia gained 4.3%, and Meta Platforms added 2.7%, riding the wave of optimism sparked by the Trump administration’s announcement. Source: TradingView Tesla, however, led the pack with its 9.8% surge, making it the loudest winner among major tech names. Investors piled into Tesla shares on hopes that lighter rules would speed up the rollout of autonomous fleets without regulatory roadblocks. For the week, the major indexes all posted gains. The S&P 500 gained 4.6%, while the Nasdaq surged 6.7%. The Dow lagged a bit but still posted a 2.5% gain. Even with these jumps, the S&P 500 remains down 1.5% for the month, and the Dow has taken a brutal 4.5% beating in April.

Cybercrime syndicates in Southeast Asia are really stepping up their game, and crypto is right at the heart of their growing scams. Even though authorities have been cracking down, these criminal networks are spreading globally, creating a tangled mess from Myanmar to Mexico , according to a United Nations report . The data shows that Southeast Asia has become home to some of the world’s largest and most profitable cybercrime operations, with cryptocurrency playing a central role. According to the report, the regional cyberfraud industry has outpaced other transnational crimes, given that it is easily scalable and able to reach millions of potential victims online. Expansion of select sites hosting cyber-enabled fraud operations, 2022 — 2025 | Source: The UN The report estimates that up to $37 billion was lost to cyber fraud in East and Southeast Asia alone in 2023, with a significant portion of those losses linked to crypto scams. Benedikt Hofmann, the UN’s acting regional representative for Southeast Asia, told Reuters in a commentary that the operations spread “like a cancer.” Shady stablecoins The shift, largely facilitated by the pseudoanonymity and global reach of cryptocurrencies, has made it increasingly difficult for governments to contain the issue. As law enforcement intensifies its efforts in known scam centers, networks are simply relocating to more remote locations or moving operations online, often using technologies like Starlink satellite internet to bypass government crackdowns. “This [scale of Southeast Asia’s scam network] has extended far beyond the construction and management of physical scam centres to include online gambling platforms and software services, unlicensed payment processors and cryptocurrency exchanges, encrypted communications platforms and, most recently, stablecoins, blockchain, networks, and illicit online marketplaces, often controlled by the same criminal networks.” The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime In the report, the UN also highlighted the growing use of illicit cryptocurrency exchanges to fuel these scams. One such platform, Huione Guarantee — now rebranded as Haowang — has become a central hub for cyber-enabled fraud. Value of estimated crypto inflows of largest illicit online marketplaces of all time | Source: The UN The platform, which is linked to Cambodia and several other countries, has processed tens of billions of dollars in cryptocurrency transactions since 2021, the report reads. It has become so big, it has even recently launched a range of its own cryptocurrency-related products including a cryptocurrency exchange and trading application, online gambling platform, blockchain network, and even “U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin designed to circumvent government controls,” the report reads.

As of the latest data, Huione Guarantee has grown to more than 970,000 users, many of whom are involved in illicit activities ranging from online gambling to large-scale fraud. According to the UN’s report, Huione Guarantee vendors have received inflows totaling at least $24 billion over the past four years. Crypto scams expand their reach The rise of platforms like Huione Guarantee and their use of cryptocurrency highlights the growing intersection of digital currencies and global cybercrime. These platforms act as one-stop shops for criminals, offering the technology, infrastructure, and financial tools needed to execute large-scale scams. The growing use of crypto in scams is not just limited to Southeast Asia though. Criminal gangs are collaborating with networks in South America, Eastern Europe, and Africa, expanding the reach of their fraud operations, the UN alarms. In the U.S. alone, crypto-related scams, including “pig butchering” schemes, led to over $5.6 billion in losses in 2023, the data shows. You might also like: Google delists Huione app after Elliptic report The report claims that Southeast Asia has become a breeding ground for online crimes mainly due to its relatively weak governance in certain areas. The criminals are exploiting regions with high levels of corruption and limited law enforcement capacity, making it easier for their operations to thrive. This has led to the establishment of massive scam compounds in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, with tens of thousands of trafficked individuals working under forced conditions. The UN report identifies victims from more than 55 countries, mostly from Asia and Africa, who are exploited in scam operations where trafficked individuals are forced to trick others into sending money, often through cryptocurrency. The report also warned that despite ongoing efforts to shut down scam operations, the syndicates are adapting. “ several competing entities with known criminal ties have been observed expanding their virtual asset service businesses,” the UN report noted, highlighting that these new platforms are emerging on messaging services like Telegram. The developments have prompted international calls for more robust cooperation among governments to combat the growing threat posed by cybercrime syndicates as failure to address the problem “would have unprecedented consequences for Southeast Asia that reverberate globally,” the UN warned.

Recently, a notable incident involving Anthropic’s Anthropic Claude Code has highlighted the stark differences in approach compared to rivals like OpenAI and their OpenAI Codex CLI , leading to significant developer discussion and some backlash. The Clash of AI Coding Tools Anthropic’s Anthropic Claude Code and OpenAI’s OpenAI Codex CLI are designed to empower developers by allowing them to leverage powerful cloud-based AI models for coding tasks. Both tools aim to capture developer attention and integrate AI into the software development workflow. Released relatively close to each other, they represent a race to dominate the ‘agentic’ coding tool space, where AI acts more autonomously to assist developers. However, their rollout and underlying philosophies differ significantly, particularly regarding accessibility and licensing. This difference became a focal point when a developer attempting to understand and modify Anthropic Claude Code received a legal challenge. The Takedown Notice and Developer Reaction The core issue revolves around licensing and source code access. While OpenAI released the source code for its OpenAI Codex CLI under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, allowing for broad distribution and commercial use, Anthropic Claude Code operates under Anthropic’s commercial license. This license is more restrictive, limiting modifications without explicit company permission. Adding to the contrast, Anthropic also ‘obfuscated’ the source code for Anthropic Claude Code , making it non-transparent and difficult to examine. When a developer successfully de-obfuscated this code and published it on GitHub, Anthropic responded by filing a DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) complaint. This copyright notification requested the immediate removal of the de-obfuscated code. This move by Anthropic did not sit well with the developer community. On social media platforms, many developers expressed their disappointment and drew unfavorable comparisons to OpenAI’s approach with OpenAI Codex CLI . The incident sparked conversations about transparency, open source principles, and how AI companies should engage with the developer ecosystem. Comparing Approaches: Licensing and Goodwill The licensing model is a critical differentiator influencing developer goodwill: Anthropic Claude Code: Uses a commercial license. Source code is obfuscated. Modification requires explicit permission. OpenAI Codex CLI: Uses an Apache 2.0 license. Source code is open and available. Allows for distribution and commercial use. In the short time since OpenAI Codex CLI ‘s release, OpenAI has actively engaged with developers. They have merged numerous community suggestions into the tool’s codebase. Notably, they even incorporated a suggestion allowing OpenAI Codex CLI to utilize AI models from rival providers, including Anthropic’s own models. This openness and willingness to integrate community contributions and support a multi-model environment has garnered positive sentiment among developers, contrasting sharply with the reaction to Anthropic’s takedown notice. Potential Reasons and Future Outlook for AI Licensing While the takedown notice generated negative PR for Anthropic, there are potential reasons for their approach. Anthropic Claude Code is still in beta, and like many beta products, it may be buggy or incomplete. Companies sometimes obfuscate code for security reasons or to protect intellectual property during early development phases. It’s possible Anthropic may decide to release the source code under a more permissive license in the future as the tool matures. However, the incident also represents a somewhat surprising PR win for OpenAI. In recent times, OpenAI has often been perceived as moving away from open-source releases towards more proprietary products. This moment, showcasing their comparative openness with OpenAI Codex CLI , might signal a shift in strategy. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has previously commented on the company being on the ‘wrong side of history’ regarding open source, suggesting a potential internal re-evaluation of their approach. The Importance of Developer Tools in the AI Race The competition between companies like Anthropic and OpenAI extends beyond just developing powerful AI models; it includes building the surrounding developer tools and ecosystems. The ease of use, flexibility, and licensing terms of these tools significantly impact adoption and developer loyalty. Incidents like the Anthropic Claude Code takedown highlight the importance of transparency and community engagement in building successful developer platforms. For the crypto community, which often values decentralization and open source principles, this situation resonates deeply. The debate over open versus closed AI models and tools mirrors discussions about open versus closed blockchains and protocols. The choice of AI licensing directly impacts innovation, accessibility, and the power dynamics between large corporations and individual developers. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of AI Developer Tools The incident involving Anthropic’s takedown notice for Anthropic Claude Code serves as a valuable case study in the competitive landscape of AI coding tools . While Anthropic’s reasons may include beta status or security, the move has contrasted sharply with OpenAI’s more open approach with OpenAI Codex CLI , leading to a clear difference in developer sentiment. As AI continues to integrate into software development, the strategies employed by companies regarding licensing, transparency, and community engagement will be critical in shaping the future of developer tools and influencing who wins the trust and adoption of the developer community.

Once a main force in driving the market’s narrative, Ethereum’s dominance has slipped to just 7.4%. That’s a far cry from where it was in 2021. Ethereum’s declining dominance clearly reflects what’s happening in the larger crypto market. Investors increasingly look to other assets for narratives—e.g., Solana (SOL)—or they’re re-embracing old solutions with new spins, viz. Bitcoin (BTC). Why is this decline in dominance happening? Ethereum’s Declining Market Position In 2021, Ethereum had a robust trading ratio compared to Bitcoin, with 1 ETH equaling 0.08 BTC. This trading ratio was a sign of Ethereum’s growth and its relevance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the space of decentralized smart contracts. By 2023, however, the trading ratio had decreased again, this time in favor of Solana (SOL). In 2023, the ratio of 1 ETH to SOL was 111, indicating that not only is Solana growing in development, but it is also growing in the trading space and is now far more popular than Ethereum. Ethereum dominance nears 2020 levels #ETH market dominance drops to just 7.4%. Back in 2021, 1 $ETH = 0.08 $BTC In 2023, 1 $ETH = 111 $SOL Today, 1 $ETH = 0.018 $BTC and 11.5 $SOL 4 times less #BTC and 10 times less #SOL . pic.twitter.com/hyUMyaoJT2 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 25, 2025 The current trading ratio of HY (ETH) to BTC is a stunning decrease in ratio from the 2021 highs, dropping from 0.08 BTC worth per ETH to just 0.018 BTC worth per ETH. On the flip side, ratios of Altcoins to Ethereum are also dropping. In 2023, the trading ratio of SOL to ETH is 11.5. What’s obvious from this situation is that either one or a combination of factors is causing Ethereum to drop substantially TO both BTC and SOL. Whale Activity and Shifting Market Sentiment As Ethereum loses its former glory, the latest developments in the market can, to no small degree, be attributed to our old pals, the whales. They’ve shifted an eye-popping 305,000 ETH to exchanges in the past week alone, clearly looking to profit from the recent upswing in prices. And let’s not overlook the even larger sum of 63,000 ETH that they funneled out in just the last two days. This is all making going long look better and better for the folks who can’t make up their minds about parting with their Ethereum. Everyone known to be a major player in the Ethereum space tends to be a decent enough bellwether when it comes to signaling market sentiment. When these types of holders move around a significant amount of ETH, that often suggests they’re looking to take profits, hedge against volatility, or signal a potential reversals in momentum. 305,000 #Ethereum $ETH have been moved to exchanges over the past week! pic.twitter.com/uLvMZiutPd — Ali (@ali_charts) April 24, 2025 Ethereum ETFs See Modest Institutional Inflows Despite losing some of its market strength and witnessing large sell-offs by some of its biggest holders, Ethereum has managed to maintain a bit of institutional interest. The most recent sign of that interest—and one of the more exciting signs for Ethereum bulls—came on April 24, when spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a net inflow of $63.49 million. In theory, that’s an increase of investment confidence in Ethereum, especially from institutional investors, that might have usurped the kind of insatiable demand that characterized the Ethereum bull run of 2020 and 2021. On April 24, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $442 million, marking five consecutive days of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $63.49 million, with Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) being the only one to register a net outflow.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 25, 2025 However, if you dig a little deeper, you’ll find that these net inflows into spot Ethereum funds (available to institutional investors) are seemingly not being funneled through Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, the direct-access fund that has outperformed the spot market the most since Grayscale’s inception. Conclusion: Ethereum Faces Increasing Competition in the Market Ethereum faces truly serious challenges to its dominance in the market and to its position in the crypto ecosystem. The decrease in ETH’s market value relative to that of Bitcoin and Solana signals that investors are giving up on the so-called “Ethereum 2.0 narrative” and are, instead, looking for something else. And let’s be candid; at this stage, any other narrative would have a better chance of getting them to reach for their wallets. Meanwhile, when some of the most connected pro-crypto individuals are reportedly part of a scheme to make it look like a lot of ETH (in fact, billions of dollars worth) has just been sitting around untapped even though it’s really been sitting around and getting very little in the way of damn good price action, that’s Ethereum making itself a key player in the crypto space.

According to the analysis, BTC’s rise above the $95,000 level, reaching its highest value since February, has brought winds of optimism to the crypto community. Data from Santiment shows that bullish sentiment for Bitcoin has increased significantly on social media, with the firm describing the rally as “the largest bullish share increase since the night of Trump’s election victory on November 5, 2024.” Related News: Bloomberg Analyst Mike McGlone Warns About Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies However, Santiment warned that the crypto market could see a sideways trend or a slight pullback as we enter the weekend. According to the analysis, this could lead some individual investors to take profits. In such a scenario, it is stated that “whales” could take advantage of these sales and support BTC's repurchase, pushing the price above $100,000 in the next 1-2 weeks. Santiment also noted market sentiment, with the analysis suggesting that trends in the community’s balance of greed and fear will play a key role in determining whether Bitcoin will make a local peak or break away from its correlation with traditional markets. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency’s 11.2% price increase has left a number of bearish traders feeling regret over their decision to sell off their holdings. This recent surge, too, has not only reignited bullish sentiment all across the market but also underscored the growing influence of some key market participants—whales and institutional investors—who have been steadily adding BTC to their books. Whale Accumulation Drives Market Confidence A strong signal of this rally has been the ongoing accumulation of Bitcoin by large holders, especially the ones holding between 10,000 and 100,000 BTC. These wallets, usually called “whales,” have added 19,255 BTC to their already huge holdings during this recent price surge. Accumulating confidence in this long-term value asset is what directional price advocates look for when trying to gauge future price moves for Bitcoin. Bitcoin's value has jumped +11.2%, and this has once again coincided with key whales & sharks adding on to their already enormous bags. Wallets holding 10-10K $BTC have added 19,255 more coins in this short stretch, and continue to be one of crypto's most powerful indicators. pic.twitter.com/b3TiVd71iD — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 25, 2025 Buying power from Bitcoin whales has, for some time now, been a defining feature of the cryptocurrency’s price chart, helping to stabilize it whenever the digital asset threatens to dip too close to the $20,000 mark (or even lower). They also provide quite a bit of certainty with their purchases, as it seems Bitcoin is a good long-term bet for them. This consistency with their buying only reinforces the idea that Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuation is a bit of a head fake. Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits as Prices Surge The Bitcoin miners have also benefited from the rally, experiencing profits from the surging price of the cryptocurrency, which recently broke past $93,000. By some estimates, in just a few days, Bitcoin miners racked up more than $18.57 million in profit. This is important because the miners, who do a kind of secure-the-network, validate transactions job, are a crucial and virtually irreplaceable part of Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Without them, the system could not function. #Bitcoin $BTC miners locked in over $18.57 million in profits as prices surged past $93,000! pic.twitter.com/ZgXosyJ5WU — Ali (@ali_charts) April 24, 2025 When prices for Bitcoin shoot up, they drive miners’ profits way up, and that’s especially true for the big Bitcoin mining operations that scale well. As a reminder, Bitcoin’s mining is a process that secures the network, verifies transactions, and mints new coins, but it’s a pretty capital-intensive and energy-hungry endeavor that seems to pay off best when the currency’s price is high. Something like the recent price spike is almost, in my opinion, the best Bitcoin advertisement there could be, not just for the profit opportunities it holds out to would-be miners but also for the clear demand for Bitcoin that those mining it presumably see. If Bitcoin’s not a store of value, then what’s all this mining about? Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attract Record Inflows Interest from institutions in Bitcoin continues to increase and further confirms Bitcoin’s standing as a legitimate asset class. On April 24, spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) saw net inflows totaling $442 million. This marks the fifth consecutive day of net inflows into Bitcoin-focused ETFs and reflects a steady increase in institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency. On April 24, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $442 million, marking five consecutive days of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $63.49 million, with Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) being the only one to register a net outflow.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 25, 2025 The rising interest in Bitcoin ETFs, which let investors gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly buying and tending to the cryptocurrency, is a big deal for the market. These are financial products offering a way to access Bitcoin that’s more traditional and regulated, and the very fact that they’re growing in popularity suggests that there’s more institutional money ready to enter the cryptocurrency space. We’re not saying this will happen tomorrow, but Bitcoin price appreciation might be a possible outcome that could materialize as these products keep gaining traction. The Bitcoin ETF’s record inflows are also a sign of a broader trend toward the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. When we look at financial institutions and traditional investors, we see that they are adopting Bitcoin as part of their portfolios. When we see that, we also see that the legitimacy of this asset is strengthening, and its role in the global financial system is becoming more pronounced. Conclusion: A Bullish Outlook for Bitcoin The price surge of Bitcoin beyond $95,000 is an obvious indication that the market thinks something has fundamentally shifted. What had seemed to be a price correction from worried investors over possible tariffs and their impact on Bitcoin had changed course and become a full-fledged rally. Whales have continued to buy and hold; in addition, many reports have surfaced indicating that institutional buying activity has also picked up. Interest in a Bitcoin ETF seems to be growing as well, and these entities pushing buying activity certainly seem to have the wind at their back with this surge. The allure of Bitcoin for those who mine it and for large investors and institutions can only rise along with its price. And in fact, these days, the Bitcoin price is moving up, drawing with it a dazzling array of new accumulation and capital inflow from the sector of traditional finance. Reduced volatility during this recent price appreciation has further added to the sense of Bitcoin being resilient and its nearing a return to something more like “normal” value behavior. The current market conditions allow traders and investors in the space to assess the rapidly strengthening fundamentals of Bitcoin. They now seem obviously to be what we’ve long suspected: the coming price moves will happen on the upside, and this is primarily because the whales, the miners, and the institutions are all doing the same thing: they’re accumulating.

A group of crypto advocates has launched a referendum, urging the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to add Bitcoin alongside gold to its reserves as a safeguard against global instability. Swiss National Bank Rejects Bitcoin Reserve Push Despite mounting calls, the SNB remains firm. In a recent meeting , SNB Chairman Martin Schlegel dismissed the idea, calling Bitcoin too volatile for Switzerland’s official reserves. Schlegel emphasized the need for assets that are highly liquid and stable in value—qualities Bitcoin, in his view, does not consistently deliver. He also raised concerns over Bitcoin’s reliability, highlighting that, being a software-based asset, it could face technical glitches. Schlegel underlined that the SNB has no intention of incorporating crypto into its reserve strategy at this time. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today Live : Crypto tax , Bitcoin Price, Pi Network Listing, XRP News, Dogecoin Price , Global Trends Highlight Growing Interest in Crypto Reserves While Switzerland maintains a cautious stance on crypto regulation, other countries are beginning to explore different paths. The United States, for instance, has started building a Bitcoin reserve using coins seized from criminal investigations , a move that is sparking discussions worldwide. Even so, many governments remain hesitant, citing extreme price volatility and operational risks. For now, Switzerland appears committed to its traditional financial framework, resisting global trends that are slowly shifting toward Bitcoin and digital assets. The growing debate over Switzerland’s crypto regulation and Bitcoin reserve strategy suggests that pressure on the SNB may not ease anytime soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43821148,https://nulltx.com/?p=148267,1745652494,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Moves: AI and Memecoins Dominate Wallet Accumulations as New Narratives Emerge,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-moves-ai-and-memecoins-dominate-wallet-accumulations-as-new-narratives-emerge/,"The world of crypto is always changing, and so too are the signals it sends to investors. You would think, given the age of crypto, that early movers would be better at picking trends. But some wallets still kick up dust, and an observed move by 43 smart money investors in the last day sparks thought. It makes you think because some wallets are very good at finding new plays while avoiding bad ones. And if you believe on-chain data, these 43 crypto cunning folks have reckoned that the next big thing to happen in digital asset land will involve one or a combination of the following three things: AI, the community/tokens/memes theme, or DeFi. AI and Agentic Frameworks Lead the Way The recent surge in recent wallet activity has been driven by an uptick in interest around AI-based crypto projects. Within this narrative, a total of 27 smart money wallets have accumulated tokens, which clearly underlines the fact that the market is increasingly spelling out the core satisfaction that AI offers in terms of the kind of revolutionary change we can expect to see with the automation of such decentralized networks. Spearheading the AI-centered charge is $AI16Z, a token that is heavily focused on artificial intelligence and is backed by Script Network, a recent entry into the Web3 space. This project pulled in three smart wallets, whose top-up investments totaled over $462,000. The project’s relatively small market cap of about $253 million belies its potential, especially as it has begun integrating with @agentwoodstudio, a highly relevant player in the AI + entertainment space. $SPX6900 is a notable AI entry and a community-driven project that combines the look of financial resistance with the optica of AIl generated decentralization. With four wallets contributing $163,000 to its accumulations, this project sits with a $592 million market cap. It seems to be building some narrative momentum around (1) unity; (2) an optica of financial resistance; and (3) a blend of anti-establishment sentiment and the promise of AI-generated decentralization. Lower down the market cap ladder, $AGiXT—focused on real-world robotics and automation—also saw movement. One smart money wallet added $23,000 worth of this lower-cap project, which has a current valuation of just $10 million. Backed by an active development community and real-world utility potential, $AGiXT has emerged as a favorite among early-stage tech-centered investors. Meme Coins Maintain Their Magnetic Pull Even though the AI sector may have drawn the lion’s share of the limelight, meme coins remain a potent force in the marketplace. Eleven wallets were spotted accumulating across the meme token spectrum, suggesting that some not-so-dumb money is still quite enthusiastic about tokens that live and die by their community engagement and viral appeal. The largest buzz was around $Fartcoin, a memecoin with a huge $1.09 billion market cap and a massive social media presence. Seven smart wallets brought $Fartcoin a total of $163,000 in new inflows. That seems like a joke, and in some ways it is; the token’s branding is fundamentally comic. But in another way, it is not a joke at all. The latest from on high in crypto is that serious people are taking the token seriously. Another meme favorite, $Jingle, witnessed two wallets pour $134,000 into the project. With a modest market cap of $11 million, $Jingle is still in the early stages but appears to be gaining grassroots support. One of the more interesting entries in the meme category is $Zala, an AI-meme hybrid token that some think might be linked to Solana and are definitely convinced is a potential Amazon collaborator. Eight very smart wallets have funneled $37,000 into this thing, which we can now say apparently has a $2 million valuation. Its creator, @Zala_AI, suggests it has a real shot at being a breakout project that combines serious tech with meme hype. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: AI & Agentic Frameworks (27 wallets) MEME & Community Tokens (11 wallets) Stablecoins & DeFi (5 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $AI16Z -> Strong narrative… pic.twitter.com/K6umlTUQQ4 — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) April 25, 2025 Stablecoins and DeFi Tokens See Steady Accumulation Although the trades that grab the headlines tend to be those involving tokens with vivid stories attached to them, more and more, the Eye of Sauron that is the crypto market seems to be focusing on good, old-fashioned stablecoins. In a not-too-shocking plot twist, secure stablecoins that pay interest are becoming popular investment vehicles in today’s risky and uncertain crypto landscape. Five wallets presumed to be controlled by smart money have been out and about lately, and they’ve seemed to focus on two stable stablecoins: $Resolv USD and $EURC. $Resolv USD, a stablecoin that’s gaining traction in decentralized finance, attracted two wallets with $39,000 in accumulation. With a $67 million market cap, it’s starting to look like a reliable asset for liquidity. At the same time, Circle’s euro-denominated stablecoin, $EURC, attracted $311,000 in fresh investment from three new wallets. With a market cap of $230 million and an expanding ecosystem, $EURC is increasingly seen as a legitimate alternative to dollar-backed stablecoins, especially for users in the Eurozone. Conclusion: Narratives Are Back—and Smart Money Is Listening One thing that is clear from this recent wave of smart wallets making moves, it’s that stories really do matter again. Be it AI powering the next Web3 transformation, the community token’s new viral moment, or the decentralized finance infrastructure quietly absorbing the market’s blow-ups, smart money is re-embracing narrative bets. The wallets that spearhead these trends present a dependable compass to what might be in store for the next cycle of crypto growth. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The fund began trading on April 25 on Brazil’s primary stock exchange, B3, according to a press release from Valor Econômico . Named Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Fundo de Índice (FI), the ETF is managed by Brazilian asset manager Hashdex and administered by Genial Investments Securities Brokerage SA, with Genial Bank SA serving as custodian. Brazil’s CVM Clears XRP ETF Following Previous Approval of Hashdex’s Solana Fund The Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) approved the XRP-focused ETF in February, marking another milestone after its greenlight for Hashdex’s spot Solana ETF in August 2023. Following regulatory approval, the fund entered a pre-operational phase before officially launching on the exchange under the ticker XRPH11. The ETF mirrors the XRP Reference Price Index (NQXRP), which tracks the real-time spot price of XRP across major cryptocurrency exchanges. According to fund documents, at least 95% of XRPH11’s net assets will be allocated to XRP and related digital assets, securities, or futures tied to the index. The ETF currently reports a net worth close to $40 million. XRPH11 – The world's first XRP ETF. Another crypto milestone on the Brazilian stock exchange! Hashdex just launched XRPH11, giving investors secure and regulated access to $XRP — one of the leading #crypto assets focused on fast, low-cost international payments. pic.twitter.com/kpokQP5NM4 — Hashdex (@hashdex) April 25, 2025 XRPH11 carries a competitive fee structure, including a maximum annual fee of 0.7% for administration, management, and distribution, along with a custody fee capped at 0.1% per year. The fund does not impose any structuring fees. With this launch, Hashdex has expanded its crypto ETF offerings on B3 to nine products. Samir Kerbage, Chief Investment Officer at Hashdex, said that XRPH11 joins the firm’s lineup of mono-asset ETFs, which includes products tied to Bitcoin (BITH11), Ethereum (ETHE11), and Solana (SOLH11). These funds are designed for institutional investors seeking exposure to digital assets through Brazil’s regulated markets. As Brazil leads with the first XRP ETF, anticipation grows in the United States, where the SEC is reviewing applications for spot Solana and XRP ETFs. SEC Lawsuit Against Ripple Labs Concludes After Four Years The legal dispute between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has concluded after more than four years , marking a significant development in cryptocurrency regulation.​ In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, alleging that the company conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP tokens, raising over $1.3 billion. Ripple contested the claim, arguing that XRP is a digital currency, not a security.​ In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres delivered a mixed ruling: she determined that XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws, while sales on public exchanges did not. Consequently, Ripple was ordered to pay a $125 million civil penalty. ​ In March 2025, Ripple and the SEC reached a settlement. Under the agreement, Ripple would pay $50 million of the previously imposed fine, with the remaining $75 million returned to the company. Both parties agreed to drop their respective appeals, effectively ending the litigation.

One of the standout names right now is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a DeFi protocol in presale that’s already caught the attention of nearly 9,000 holders, despite still being priced at just $0.025. Unlike larger caps that rely on past reputation or speculative trading cycles, Mutuum is building something that directly connects value creation with platform usage. And as of today, over 420 million tokens have already been sold, and nearly 50% of the 4th presale phase is now sold out—making this feel like the last stretch before a major price shift. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The momentum is clear. With more than $7 million raised so far, the project’s presale has evolved beyond just a fundraising event—it’s becoming a case study in how early community engagement can build a healthy launchpad for a new crypto. And here’s the catch: once Phase 4 wraps up, the token price will rise to $0.03, setting the stage for a continued climb through the 11-phase roadmap. This creates a window of opportunity. Early backers aren’t just speculating—they’re entering a protocol that’s aligning utility with financial rewards in a more grounded way. Mutuum isn’t just pitching a vague DeFi idea. The project is developing a dual-layer lending protocol that allows both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) interactions. Through P2C, users can deposit their assets into liquidity pools and earn passive returns based on usage and pool activity. The P2P model, on the other hand, offers direct lending between individuals—supporting even high-volatility tokens, including meme coins like SHIB or PEPE. This gives users more choice in risk, strategy, and timing. But what really elevates the ecosystem is how it rewards users. When you deposit assets, you receive mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens that grow in value as the protocol generates yield. These tokens are more than placeholders—they can be traded, held, or used in other DeFi strategies. And in a move that sets it apart from most new protocols, Mutuum’s stablecoin—designed to be algorithmically pegged to the U.S. dollar—offers on-chain liquidity without requiring users to sell their assets. This lets borrowers unlock capital without exiting their core holdings, maintaining exposure while funding new opportunities. Mutuum has also confirmed a revenue-sharing structure that funnels protocol earnings into buying MUTM tokens directly from the open market. The model redirects platform success back to the community. Holders who actively participate—especially by holding or staking their mtTokens—are positioned to benefit directly from this buy-and-distribute loop. The tokenomics are designed to create long-term alignment between the project’s growth and user incentives. It’s a structure that avoids the short-termism seen in many other launches. Trust and transparency are top priorities for Mutuum. That’s why the team is currently undergoing a full CertiK audit, one of the leading firms for Web3 security reviews. The audit process is underway, and the final report will be made public before launch—helping potential backers evaluate the technical integrity of the platform before the token goes live. Additionally, the team has confirmed plans to roll out a beta version of the platform around the time of the token launch. This means users will be able to test core lending and borrowing features early on, adding another layer of credibility and confidence. Before wrapping up, there’s one more reason investors are paying attention: Mutuum is running a $100,000 giveaway campaign tied to early participation. With this initiative, Mutuum is signaling that early involvement isn’t just appreciated—it’s going to be rewarded. While bigger names remain in holding patterns, MUTM is gathering speed, fueled by a combination of smart tokenomics, rising presale momentum, and real DeFi utility. With Phase 5 on the horizon and a strong economic model behind it, the current $0.025 entry point may not be around much longer. For anyone watching the cryptocurrency market and wondering where the next breakout project will emerge—Mutuum Finance should be high on that list.

It is easy to mistake these big guns of the crypto world as ‘establishment’, but as little as two years ago, some of these were small-cap tokens or even non-existent. Shiba Inu has been trying to make the top ten for a while and Sui had aspirations, but is losing ground. According to GPT, the new PayFi token Remittix , however, has grabbed attention for being a smaller token with genuine top-ten capacity. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Meme coin promise fails to materialize Shiba Inu fell from its enormous peak in October 2021 to almost nothing, shattering the meme coin myth. Shiba Inu made a few billionaires, but many more lost their shirts. To its credit, Shiba had a second bite of the cherry in February 2024 when it pumped 4x in ten days, and everyone thought Shiba Inu was back. Sadly, it was a false dawn, and Siba fell again, only to raise hopes again in December last year. The truth is, though, Shiba Inu is trading at a mere 15% of its heydays in 2021 and while it is currently in the top twenty tokens by market cap, the chances of Shiba gaining enough to crack a top ten spot is slim. The days of meme coins are over and utility tokens are coming up in the ranks. Source: Coincodex Sui ( SUI ): Facebook’s pet project fizzles Sui came as a result of Facebook’s DIEM project and for a while there, it looked like Sui would be the next big thing. Taken at face value, it seems Sui was doing brilliantly and in January, it was flying high, reaching its ATH on January 4th, and predictions of 5x in the next month were made. But then the market crashed and Sui lost more than half its value in four months. Source: Coincodex However, if one compares Sui to other layer 1 solutions like Solana, it becomes clear that Sui may look good on the surface, but is outclassed by Solana on almost every front. Sui ’s aspirations of a top ten spot were hit by a blow. The key takeaway here, however, is how new tokens can go big in the blink of an eye. Sui did not exist two years ago, but now it is placed in the top fifteen. This gives hope to tokens like Remittix that the top ten spot may be a high bar, but it is reachable! Remittix (RTX): GPT’s favourite presale with top-ten potential GPT is getting better by the day, and it can do deep dives into markets. When asked which presale token has the potential to crack the top ten, Remittix came out on top of the pile. The reason is startlingly simple. Remittix is a utility token that solves a real-world problem. Remittix allows its users to make crypto-to-fiat payments to almost any currency on the planet. This means that with Remittix , users can utilize the speed, functionality and low fees of crypto to make international cross-border bank accounts, which means faster settlements and lower costs. This opens the gates of international trade and the use of Remittix is enormous, making Remittix the best crypto to buy now. Conclusion While Sui and Shiba Inu battle out for a top-ten spot, Remittix is a new token with the potential to get there faster than one can imagine. The capacity to finally use crypto in a legitimate transaction, both locally and globally, is the game changer crypto was meant to be and the investment potential here cannot be overstated. Remittix is now available at $0.0757 directly from their website.

43821184,https://nulltx.com/?p=148268,1745652611,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Aptos Emerges as a Silent Powerhouse in H2 2024 With Explosive Growth and Real-World Integration,https://nulltx.com/aptos-emerges-as-a-silent-powerhouse-in-h2-2024-with-explosive-growth-and-real-world-integration/,"Even though the much of the focus in 2024 was on prominent chains and memecoin storylines, Aptos went largely unnoticed as it staged one of the most impressive comebacks in the crypto world during the latter half of the year. With a remarkable 700% surge in total value locked (TVL), an extraordinary uptick in network activity, noteworthy partnerships with real-world assets (RWAs), and growing support for cross-chain stablecoins, Aptos has solidified its position as a top contender in the crypto space for institutional and real-world on-chain adoption. The performance of Aptos was not fueled by hyper but by continuous infrastructure expansion, enterprise use cases, and user-centric innovation. . @Aptos quietly had one of the strongest second halves of 2024. 700% TVL growth Major RWA integrations Stablecoins going cross-chain And a surge in real-world adoption across payments and enterprise. Here’s the thread breakdown pic.twitter.com/b3u2Rvbuaz — Nansen (@nansen_ai) April 24, 2025 It is now emerging as a high-performance layer-1 that connects traditional finance and the decentralized world—more or less seamlessly, and with increasing momentum. From Network Traction to DeFi Expansion: The Rise of Aptos Aptos wrapped up 2024 with statistics that most chains would envy. Its network was alive with activity, as total transactions exceeded 2 billion, and active accounts reached an impressive 8 million. The most jaw-dropping figure—peak daily transaction volume—occurred with the launch of the blockchain-based game “Tapos,” with 326 million transactions confirmed in a single day. If you want to know why everyone is so hyped about Aptos, look at these numbers. Impressively, the platform’s count of daily active addresses increased almost five times, compared to the levels of the middle of the year. It finished at between 800,000 to 1 million active addresses per day. Not only does this underscore the organic growth of the platform and the even pace at which it is accumulating users, it also highlights the continued unfurling of the necessary design features and the overall architecture of the still-embryonic technical environment. The ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Aptos is experiencing a renaissance. Total value locked (TVL) shot up 700% in the latter half of maybe your year or last year, propelled by a burgeoning range of protocols like Thala Labs and Arius Markets, Amnis Finance, and LiquidSwap by Pontem Network. In this brave new world of lending, staking, and CDPs, Aptos is the place to be. Importantly, USDY—a yield-bearing stablecoin backed by real-world assets—saw quite the adoption, offering users a 5.3% APY with over $300 million in cross-chain liquidity. The presence of such stablecoins has helped draw more serious capital into the ecosystem and made Aptos a growing hub for yield-seeking users. Cross-Chain Stablecoin Momentum and RWA Integrations In late 2024, stablecoins emerged as a central component of the Aptos narrative. USDT was the first stablecoin with which to go live on Aptos, thus making it the first stablecoin to operate on a Move-based chain and to be integrated into the Aptos core multichain architecture. Not long after USDT, Circle snagged USDC, the world’s second-largest stablecoin by market cap, to also integrate into the Aptos ecosystem. USDC, like USDT, can be used in various multichain scenarios that involve Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol. To better enhance its already robust stablecoin offering, Stripe set in motion the on-ramping and off-ramping of fiat currencies to and from the Aptos Ecosystem. Accordingly, Aptos users can now convert their fiat to crypto and their crypto back to fiat with the help of financial services giant Stripe—all without using any centralized exchanges. The upshot? More retail and institutional users in the Aptos Ecosystem because it’s now easier than ever to conduct crypto transactions. From an institutional perspective, Aptos has become a primary destination for the tokenization of real-world assets. It now accommodates an expanding roster of major real-world asset funds, including BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX, and Ondo’s USDY. This is in line with a larger trend of deploying tokenized real-world assets and makes Aptos a contrasting choice, given its regulatory touchpoints, for blockchain-accessible tokenized versions of traditional financial products. Frictionless User Experience and Enterprise Partnerships Aptos made major strides in a user-friendly experience and payment infrastructure beyond DeFi and institutional capital. With Aptos Keyless, a new feat of engineering that makes it possible for average people to “log in” to Aptos using Apple or Google, the average user completely bypasses the management of a private key. In other words, they don’t have one. At the same time, collaboration with international telecom companies is taking blockchain to everyday users. In South Korea, for instance, SK Telecom has integrated Aptos-native USDT into its T-wallet, while Petra Wallet is now offering several new, consumer-friendly features—like Petra Pay and Petra Earn—that make it easier to spend, save, and earn crypto. These developments, when considered collectively, depict a platform that is not only expanding in a technical sense but also in a cultural one. It is appealing, with equal mastery, to both kinds of users: the crypto natives and the traditional finance crowd. Aptos is developing a unique area in crypto—integration with real-world finance. It has a high level of developer activity, top enterprise-grade integrations, and an increasing level of on-chain activity. Consequently, it has emerged as a leading platform for the sort of regulated finance that working-world institutions prefer. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

What had been only a continuation of bullish market momentum from late 2024 has now progressed into a more cautious, defensive phase. Sentiment in the market has become a lot more fragile, as the large-cap altcoin liquidity has thinned out considerably in recent weeks, while the macroeconomic backdrop has pushed a lot of the now-income-seeking investors into the safety of only their high-conviction digital assets. This ever-changing risk landscape is mirrored in the market’s overall structure. The current leading digital asset, Bitcoin ($BTC), reigns supreme as the most popular cryptocurrency. By market share, it now represents 63% of the total crypto marketplace, reflecting the highest level of dominance it has asserted since early 2021. This surge in dominance underscores the effect of volatility across the broader crypto market, as investors seemingly seek refuge in the most stable and institutionally supported assets. Institutional Flows Hold Steady as Bitcoin ETFs Lead the Pack A core part of this defensive rotation has been the lasting demand from institutions, especially through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Inflows of capital have been directed to Bitcoin ETFs, which serve as an effective vehicle for the expression of institutional demand for the asset. Demand from institutions and the consequent performance of Bitcoin ETFs have given the asset an appearance of strength and resilience that is becoming increasingly evident in the context of a broader market that is struggling to find its footing. Ethereum ($ETH) has also started to establish a significant space in the ETF landscape. With the latest approvals and the increasing embrace of ETH-based spot ETF products, the second-largest cryptocurrency is not building a meaningful foothold of its own. While it remains behind Bitcoin in terms of total ETF balances, the presence of these ETFs tells us that institutional interest is on the rise, and Ethereum is very much part of that conversation. We’re pleased to share the Q2 2025 edition of Charting Crypto – the newly renamed and redesigned joint market report from @Glassnode and @CoinbaseInsto . This quarter’s insights reflect a market in transition, where macro pressure is exposing what’s durable in crypto pic.twitter.com/mhNcwWDwD4 — glassnode (@glassnode) April 25, 2025 Significantly, access to ETFs is still restricted on many of the key brokerage platforms, which keeps inflows at this current low level. But analysts see some latent potential here. If access on those platforms were to open up and, say, 2% of the assets that those firms manage were to flow into crypto ETFs, the annual inflow number for 2024 could be 22x what KFC is forecasting. The number gets even bigger if you cue up the next prospect of ETF growth and put Bitcoin as a top holding in a portfolio. Solana Quietly Delivers Amid the Noise Although meme coins have captured attention recently, the basic elements of blockchain technology tell another story. This is especially true for Solana ($SOL). This high-throughput, low-cost environment makes Solana a frequent target for retail speculation. It’s also a solid proving ground for the proposition that not all basic attention tokens are shilled by influencers. In fact, Solana seems to have plenty going for it. In Q1 2025, Solana not only outperformed every other blockchain in revenue generation but also even surpassed Ethereum in several key metrics. This performance reflects quite positively on Solana and is a testament to the user engagement on the platform. It is engagement that is not just about users buying and holding tokens but also about real economic activity—DeFi transactions taking place on the platform, enterprise-level applications being built on Solana, and other activities that could, and might, take place in the metaverse that many platforms are currently building. Stablecoin Metrics Signal Rising Global Adoption In this atmosphere of caution, one part of the crypto economy shows real strength: stablecoins. Recent data indicate that both the supply and the transaction volume of stablecoins are at all-time highs. This suggests that the demand for dollar-pegged crypto assets was, and is, very strong. And the performance of stablecoins is especially relevant for inflation-sensitive economies, where many citizens increasingly use these assets for cross-border payments, remittances, and capital preservation. Adjusted blockchain statistics indicate that a large portion of the stablecoin activity is not speculative but rather serves practical purposes, showing the increasing use of crypto in the world’s real financial infrastructure. Looking Ahead: A Flight to Quality in a Complex Landscape As the crypto market reconfigures, the trend is unmistakable: capital is directing itself toward assets that have the appearance of resilience and utility. Bitcoin and Ethereum, with the help of access to ETFs and some regulatory clarity, are now directing an institutional flow of capital toward them. Meanwhile, beneath all the hype, Solana appears to be demonstrating some robust economic fundamentals. Finally, it’s also worth noting that stablecoins appear to be evolving into some kind of global financial tool. The road ahead might still be bumpy, especially with macro headwinds and regulatory changes happening. But the crypto foundation is maturing. In times of uncertainty, quality factors take the stage, and we are seeing this unfold in the digital asset markets today. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

According to the latest on-chain data, the amount of $RLUSD supplied on Aave has climbed to an impressive 77,350,849.54 RLUSD. This surge in the supply of $RLUSD on Aave reflects not just the rising adoption of the stablecoin, but also a kind of behind-the-scenes, strategic pivot toward Ethereum-based DeFi protocols. ATH The amount of $RLUSD supplied on @aave reached a new all-time high of 77,350,849.54 RLUSD pic.twitter.com/bpOT4bBh43 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 25, 2025 The figures by themselves indicate that Ripple’s stablecoin has gathering momentum. But when you take a closer look at what has recently been happening with the stablecoin, things get even more interesting and suspicious. In recent months, about $39 million worth of $RLUSD has been burned on the XRP Ledger and minted on Ethereum, kicking off some serious speculation across the crypto community. Inventory Transfers: A Common Practice Among Stablecoin Issuers Before dissecting the importance of this maneuver, it is worth understanding a key concept in the stablecoin ecosystem—inventory transfers. Stablecoin issuers such as Circle and Tether frequently perform what are known as inventory transfers. These operations involve moving reserves of stablecoins owned by the issuers from one blockchain to another, often to balance liquidity and meet demand across a multi-chain environment. Inventory transfers let stablecoin issuers work with the fundamentals of supply and demand. If demand for a stablecoin spikes or a shortfall develops on one particular blockchain, stablecoin providers can execute an inventory transfer: burning, or effectively destroying, the tokens on one blockchain and minting new ones on another in a 1:1 ratio. This recent inventory transfer by Ripple of $RLUSD looks like a classic example of the stablecoin issuer managing its supply to optimize accessibility and utility for users. Instead of indicating a change of direction for the XRP Ledger, the $39 million burn of RLUSD on XRP and its simultaneous mint on Ethereum most likely reflects Ripple’s plan for the newly minted RLUSD to serve the anticipated uprise of demand on Ethereum—especially in the wake of new listings of RLUSD on high-profile DeFi protocols like Aave. Ethereum DeFi and Institutional Liquidity Driving the Shift This inventory shuffle is not coincidental. Of late, Ripple has made strides to integrate $RLUSD into Ethereum’s vibrant DeFi ecosystem. The first step in that integration was the listing of $RLUSD on Aave, a leading DeFi protocol that has billions in total value locked in it. With Ethereum still clearly dominating the DeFi landscape when it comes to usage, liquidity, and developer activity, it makes all the more sense for Ripple to ensure that there is ample liquidity for $RLUSD on Ethereum-based platforms. $39,000,000 in $RLUSD has been burned on the XRP Ledger and minted on Ethereum. Many speculate on the reasons for it. Before we dive how the UK, SBI and Institutional liquidity is behind it, we need to get a tiny educational piece in for this. Stablecoin issuers like Circle… pic.twitter.com/pvRESntJ5B — Vet (@Vet_X0) April 24, 2025 Additionally, we cannot ignore the institutional perspective. Ripple has long-standing connections with major financial players, especially in the UK and Asia, thanks to partnerships with SBI Holdings and others. These financial institutions are now venturing into exploring how to engage with digital assets. Meanwhile, Ethereum has emerged as the preferred platform, offering not just regulatory clarity but also a richly diverse “DeFi” (decentralized finance) infrastructure. Ripple’s apparent decision to direct its liquidity to Ethereum could well be a move to position itself to meet as yet unexplored institutional needs for access to just such an on-chain finance engine. This narrative receives additional support from the burgeoning speculation that institutions—especially those in the UK and Japan—are investigating RLUSD as a feasible stablecoin alternative in DeFi. If that is the case, then moving liquidity from the XRP Ledger to Ethereum might be viewed as a forward-thinking insurance policy to guarantee the enterprise clients that Ripple serves access to the kind of financial products that live natively on Ethereum. A Strategic Move, Not a Shift in Loyalty Some may interpret the large XRP Ledger burn as a lack of confidence or a shift in focus, but that view seems overly simplistic. It also doesn’t seem to align with Ripple’s real-world actions or its stated multi-chain strategy. If you look at the purposeful and nearly surgical way Ripple has burned tokens on the XRP Ledger specifically, it seems like less of an infrastructure concern and more a case of Ripple flexing its multi-chain muscles to make its USD stablecoin accessible where it can be well-used on multiple-chain-dapp platforms. Essentially, this cross-chain inventory transfer is less a migration and more a signal of Ripple’s growing foothold in the expansive DeFi realm—especially on Ethereum. As our RLUSD token becomes more prominent on platforms such as Aave and others, and as our moves attract even more institutional interest, look for strategic supply moves like this one to become more common and the more common they get, the more influential they will be. Speed is the essence in the stablecoin arena. Ripple appears to have grasped this very well. Adaptability in cross-chain supply under demand scenarios is something many assets strive for. RLUSD’s growing footprint on Ethereum could be just the start of a series of evolutions on other Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Their latest on-chain analysis centers on Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) that serve as a reliable means of gauging not just the whole amount but also the whole pattern of different kinds of investors who are supposed to be holding $LTC at this time. And what the UTXOs are telling us is that across the whole Litecoin ecosystem, there are two distinct groups of long-term holders who have amassed a sizable amount of $LTC. The chart by IntoTheBlock categorizes holders of Litecoin according to the amount of time they have held their UTXOs, which gives us a nice view into the behavior and sentiment of their investors over time. One thing that is unmistakable to see from this data is that Litecoin is more than just a short-term trading asset for a lot of its investors. A number of these holders seem to be in it for the very long term. Diverging Strategies: The 3–5 Year Holders vs. the 5+ Year Believers The data highlights two key parts within the long-term holder base. The first is made up of wallets that were acquiring Litecoin during the last bull market—some three to five years ago now. These addresses are highlighted in red boxes in the chart and show a behavior that’s well-known to experienced market observers. They seem to sell into strength during subsequent rallies, taking profits as the price goes up, and to again sell during downturns—likely under the influence of heightened market fear or a need for cash. This conduct aligns with a more cyclical investment strategy. These holders, while being long-term by crypto standards, still seem to time the market, making the most of volatility. Their walks during both upswings and downtrends suggest they are not emotionally or ideologically attached to Litecoin but instead see it as a tool for profit generation within defined windows. Next up is the second category, which is more intriguing and maybe even more important to Litecoin’s long-term health. It’s the holders who have kept their LTC for over five years. And these addresses show consistent growth across all kinds of market conditions and ways of participating in the market, regardless of what the price is doing. Right now, according to IntoTheBlock, over 20.6% of all Litecoin UTXOs belong to this group. This is a big figure. The unfaltering increase of this group suggests not just forbearance but a rare level of commitment in an industry that usually thrives on immediate gratification and very often, in my opinion, short-sightedness. These are probably HODLers of the first order—individuals who have gone through at least two bull-bear cycles and have used each to add to their Litecoin stash. Lightning Network: A Decentralized UDP-like Protocol Their behavior suggests they hold a deep belief in Litecoin’s long-term value proposition, be that as a decentralized payment network, a Bitcoin alternative with faster transaction speeds, or just as a digital asset that has stood the test of time. This chart shows $LTC belonging to long-term holders based on UTXOs. These long-term Litecoin holders display distinct patterns across market cycles. The red boxes mark wallets that accumulated in the previous bull run and have been holding for 3 to 5 years. They tend to sell… pic.twitter.com/KTU64nZPA7 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 24, 2025 Implications for Litecoin’s Future These two groups are differentiated for good reason. They tell us quite a lot (and in some ways, everything we need to know) about the holders of Litecoin. The next element in the analysis takes these two groups and adds a significant timeframe element: the 3–5 year holders and the 5+ year holders. This is important for the analysis as these two groups represent something very different in terms of the act of holding Litecoin. Indeed, we may have injected a bit of volatility with our analysis by failing to mention the fact that there are these two groups of holders. We shall try not to do that in the future. Moreover, as a greater number of UTXOs shifts into the 5+ year category, the base of investors in Litecoin becomes even more “diamond-handed,” which might bolster the long-term cred of the asset in the eyes of both retail and institutional investors. This also indicates a ripening ecosystem. Frequently described as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” Litecoin has had its share of the ups and downs of the crypto markets. Still, the steadfastness of such a committed segment of holders hints that, beyond mere speculation, there’s a core of belief in the long-term value of Litecoin. An industry where stories turn rapidly and investor loyalty might be short-lived, Litecoin’s assembly of holders may guarantee it some staying power. In the next cycle, all eyes will be on whether this trend continues—and what it continues to mean for the future trajectory of LTC. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In just nine days, it has sold $MELANIA tokens and raised an extra $5.41 million. How? Through a method known as unilateral liquidity provisioning. Since it was launched, the project has drawn a lot of notice — not just for its connection to a celebrity, but also for an ambitious sales strategy that has seen it offload 31.685 million tokens for a total of 138,800 SOL — which is about $18.41 million at the time of the transaction. The latest tranche of activities occurred during the past nine days, with the team responsible for the Melania-themed cryptocurrency selling another 12.685 million $MELANIA tokens. These tokens were sold through liquidity pools, a standard maneuver in decentralized finance (DeFi), where token creators offer one half of a trading pair — in this instance, $MELANIA — while hoping that market participants will somehow enable the other half of that trading pair to be functional. In this pair’s case, that other half would be some other token or asset that individuals both inside and outside of the DeFi world are willing to trade. 自上次统计后到现在 9 天时间，特朗普老婆 MEME 项目 Melania 在此期间又通过单边流动性出售了 1268.5 万枚 $MELANIA ($5.41M)。 从 3/16 以来，Melania 项目方从 Community (社区) 跟 Liquidity (流动性) 地址累计转出 3168.5 万枚 $MELANIA 然后通过添加单边流动性的形式出售换成了 13.88 万枚… https://t.co/DCOMFOsGfz pic.twitter.com/Waihv8OzrW — 余烬 (@EmberCN) April 25, 2025 Aggressive Distribution Strategy Raises Eyebrows The liquidity and token sale strategies of the $MELANIA project have led to doubts about its long-term aims and sustainability. Instead of using a mechanism that would allow tokens to be gradually distributed to investors and that would let the investors perform market activities driven by their own incentives, the project has, day after day, week after week, and now month after month, sent a steady stream of token transfers from its Community and Liquidity reserves straight into the DEXs. From March 16 to the present, the project has operated this method to transfer and sell a cumulative amount of 31.685 million $MELANIA tokens. To date, it has received in return 138,800 SOL, which, at current market valuations, translates to approximately $18.41 million. This total, and the number of tokens sold, yields an average price of $0.581 per token. Although this may appear to be an effective method for raising funds, some people in the crypto community see it as a warning sign and advise against it. What is meant by “unilateral liquidity”? This is when a project continually sells tokens into the market in order to create the appearance of liquidity. If a project does not have sufficient demand for its token, and it is consistently selling into the market, then this is not actually a continual path to upward price movement. By all means, raise money however you can, but do not do it this way. Even with these worries, the project has found a way to spotlight itself — by both hitching a ride with Melania Trump, the erstwhile First Lady, and by raking in cash at an almost alarming speed. Melania hasn’t been making any evening news lately, but she is still very much a part of this story. Market analysts are divided on what it means. Some see it as a blatant money grab, capitalizing on today’s obsessive meme coin crypto culture. Others think it shows potential to turn into a boring, community-driven project that might actually last beyond the next bull run. At the moment, the statistics depict a project very much in active liquidation mode, busily injecting rapid liquidity and selling off reserves. Whether this strategy will secure the project a sustainable liftoff or whether it will trigger a swift market correction in the not-so-distant future is anyone’s guess. Even investors and observers are warned to tread carefully. The next steps taken by the project could substantially affect not just the price of the token, but also the mood of the market.

These tokens, often created by supporters or developers hoping to capitalize on a political figure’s popularity, have become a unique, albeit volatile, niche within the market. A recent report has sent ripples through this space, highlighting significant earnings by individuals associated with the TRUMP token. How Did TRUMP Memecoin Insiders Earn $900K in Crypto Trading Fees? According to data cited by CNBC from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, individuals identified as insiders behind the TRUMP memecoin reportedly collected a staggering sum approaching $900,000 in crypto trading fees within a mere two-day period. This isn’t just random market activity; the timing is key. This substantial earning spree followed a specific, high-profile announcement: a gala dinner scheduled for May 22nd, featuring former U.S. President Donald Trump himself. The invitation? Extended to the top 220 holders of the TRUMP token. This direct link between holding a specific cryptocurrency and gaining potential access to a major political figure appears to have ignited trading activity. Here’s a breakdown of how this likely unfolded: The Announcement: The news of the dinner for top holders created immediate buzz and desirability for holding a large quantity of TRUMP tokens. Increased Demand & Trading: Potential attendees or speculators looking to buy their way into the top ranks, or simply profit from anticipated price pumps, increased buying and selling pressure on the token. Transaction Taxes/Fees: Many memecoins, including TRUMP, implement a small tax or fee on every transaction (buy or sell). This fee is often distributed in various ways, sometimes to holders, sometimes to a treasury, and often, a portion goes back to the token’s developers or ‘insiders’. Fee Accumulation: With heightened trading volume driven by the dinner news, these small per-transaction fees rapidly accumulated, resulting in the reported $900,000 sum for those controlling the fee distribution mechanism. It’s crucial to understand that these aren’t necessarily profits from the token’s price increase, but rather direct income generated from the volume of transactions occurring on the token’s smart contract. The higher the trading activity, the more fees are collected. What’s Behind the Donald Trump Crypto Connection? The existence and popularity of tokens like TRUMP (often referred to as MAGA, trading under ticker TRUMP) are a direct reflection of the passionate support base surrounding Donald Trump crypto ventures and his political movement. While the former President has launched official NFT collections and has expressed some views on crypto, the TRUMP memecoin itself is generally understood to be an unofficial, community-driven project capitalizing on his brand. The token’s value and trading volume are heavily influenced by events related to Donald Trump, his political campaigns, and public sentiment surrounding him. The announced gala dinner serves as a prime example of how real-world political events can have a significant and immediate impact on the market dynamics of these politically themed digital assets. The connection raises interesting questions about the convergence of political influence and decentralized finance. It highlights how the actions and announcements of public figures, even if not directly endorsing a specific unofficial token, can inadvertently or intentionally create financial opportunities for those involved with these assets. Are Political Memecoins Raising ‘Pay to Play’ Concerns? This is where the situation moves beyond just market mechanics and into the realm of ethics and potential political impropriety. The fact that access to a former President is being offered to top holders of a specific, privately managed cryptocurrency token has drawn sharp criticism. Following the report of the substantial fee earnings, Democratic Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren voiced serious concerns. They are reportedly calling for an investigation by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) into potential pay to play crypto issues surrounding the promotion of this dinner and the associated token activity. The core of the ‘pay to play’ concern is the allegation that individuals are effectively buying potential access or influence by acquiring and holding a significant amount of a specific digital asset managed by insiders. This raises questions about: Whether holding or trading the token could be seen as a form of political contribution or payment for access. The transparency and ethics of a political figure being associated, however indirectly, with a scheme that appears to financially benefit token insiders based on access being offered. The potential for manipulation or unfair advantage when political events directly impact the value and fee generation of such tokens. While the TRUMP memecoin may be unofficial, the reported financial activity and the offer of access linked to token holding blur the lines between political engagement and speculative, potentially problematic, financial schemes. The call for an investigation underscores the growing scrutiny on how political figures interact with the burgeoning crypto market, especially concerning assets that are explicitly tied to their identity or movement. What Does This Mean for Political Memecoins and the Market? The TRUMP memecoin situation serves as a potent case study for the volatile and often controversial world of political memecoins . While these tokens can generate significant excitement and profits for some, they also come with substantial risks and ethical considerations. For investors, the primary risk is volatility driven by sentiment and political events, rather than fundamental value. The potential for pump-and-dump schemes or sudden crashes based on news or regulatory actions is high. The fact that insiders can generate significant income purely from trading volume adds another layer of complexity, as their incentives may not always align with long-term token health or small holder interests. For the broader crypto market, incidents like this highlight the challenges regulators face in keeping pace with new digital asset classes. The intersection of politics, finance, and decentralized technology creates novel scenarios that don’t fit neatly into existing regulatory frameworks. Increased scrutiny on political tokens could potentially lead to calls for stricter regulations or outright bans on assets perceived as attempts to monetize political affiliation in potentially unethical ways. Ultimately, the TRUMP memecoin’s reported fee generation and the subsequent ‘pay to play’ allegations underscore the speculative nature of political tokens and the ethical tightrope walked when political figures become associated with specific digital assets, official or otherwise.

The call comes after a controversial scheme by President Trump to offer top-tier investors access to a gala dinner in return for his freshly unveiled cryptocurrency, $TRUMP. ​ The event, to be held on May 22 at Trump National Golf Club near Washington, D.C., promises to give the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP coin an “intimate private” dinner with the president. Additionally, the top 25 investors are offered a VIP reception and a special tour, initially billed as a “White House Tour” before the labeling was removed following public scrutiny. Speaking at a heated town hall in Georgia on Friday, Ossoff told a crowd, “When the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him — there is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense.” Ossoff condemned the arrangement as unethical and dangerous, arguing that it blurs the line between politics, personal gain, and public trust. He added that the President is granting audiences to people who purchase the meme coin that directly enriches him. Trump meme coin jumps after gala dinner announcement The meme coin at the center of the controversy, $TRUMP, has seen a sharp rise in value . Since the gala dinner announcement, the token has surged over 50%. That increase has added millions to the estimated $10.8 billion tokens Trump and his associates held. The TRUMP coin was launched earlier this year and has gained a loyal base of retail crypto investors. It’s one of several Trump-linked crypto ventures, which include a stablecoin issuer, a Bitcoin mining project, and a crypto ETF (exchange-traded fund). The president has made cryptocurrency a cornerstone of his economic messaging, promising to turn the United States into a “Bitcoin superpower.” He has appointed pro-crypto figures to key financial oversight roles and publicly encouraged crypto adoption. But ethics experts and many political opponents have sounded the alarm. They say Trump’s deep involvement in crypto ventures — especially ones that appear to profit him directly — creates a massive conflict of interest. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin called the gala move state-sponsored market manipulation. Although Trump does not directly receive proceeds from token sales, critics argue that the gala incentive can still drive token prices up — increasing Trump’s wealth and influence without transparency or accountability. Democrats demand accountability as Trump faces new corruption allegations Democratic lawmakers have expressed alarm over the potential ethical violations. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff requested that the U.S. Office of Ethics open a probe into the President’s actions, noting that the dinner could indicate that Trump and his officials may be engaging in ‘pay to play’ corruption by selling presidential access to individuals or entities. Senator Chris Murphy labeled the initiative as the “most brazenly corrupt” action by a sitting president. ​ Despite the strong opinion from Senator Ossoff, a formal inquiry seems improbable — the Republicans control Congress, and President Trump fired the Ethics Office director in February. The White House has argued that his children manage his assets and that he has no conflict of interest. To begin impeachment proceedings, the House of Representatives must vote to charge the president with “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” If passed, the Senate would then hold a trial. Two-thirds of senators must vote to convict or remove the president. Trump already faced two impeachments in his first term, failing to lead to conviction in the Senate. Senator Ossoff warned that the issue extends beyond a single gala or cryptocurrency. He said the U.S. political system is already plagued by a troubling norm where elected officials often give access in exchange for campaign contributions. However, Ossoff noted that what President Trump is doing marks a dangerous new development — granting access based on an asset that increases in value and directly benefits him. He urged voters to back Democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm elections, saying restoring checks and balances would only be possible if Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives. Ossoff told the audience that achieving meaningful accountability depended on securing a Democratic majority. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

43821762,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153096,1745653812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Rally: Santiment Data Reveals Explosive Optimism & Potential Retail Selling,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-rally-santiment-data/,"The cryptocurrency world is experiencing a surge of excitement! Bitcoin has been on an impressive run, capturing the attention of investors globally. This significant Bitcoin Rally has naturally led to a wave of optimism, but according to leading on-chain analytics platform Santiment, this renewed confidence comes with interesting signals about potential market movements, particularly concerning Retail Investors and larger players. Santiment Data Reveals Current Crypto Market Sentiment Understanding the pulse of the market is crucial, and that’s where platforms like Santiment come in. Santiment provides deep insights by analyzing on-chain data and social sentiment across various platforms. Their recent findings paint a vivid picture of the current Crypto Market Sentiment . According to a report shared by Santiment on X (formerly Twitter), the recent upward movement in the Bitcoin Price has correlated with a dramatic increase in social media sentiment. Specifically, they noted that social media ‘greed’ levels have reached their highest point since a significant past event often associated with peak market excitement, like the night of the U.S. presidential election on November 5, 2024 (as referenced in their report, indicating a comparison to a period of intense market focus and potential speculation). This high level of social optimism, while reflecting positive price action, is a key piece of Santiment Data that market observers watch closely. The Psychology of the Bitcoin Rally: Optimism vs. Caution A strong Bitcoin Rally naturally fuels optimism. When prices go up, people feel good about their investments, and those on the sidelines feel the fear of missing out (FOMO). This collective positive sentiment can create a powerful feedback loop, pushing prices even higher. However, seasoned traders and analysts often view extreme levels of social greed as a potential contrarian indicator. Historically, periods of peak public optimism and widespread ‘greed’ have sometimes preceded market pullbacks or corrections. It’s a signal that perhaps too much short-term expectation is priced into the market, and many participants might be looking to secure profits. Will Retail Investors Take Profits This Weekend? Based on the elevated sentiment, Santiment’s analysis suggests a potential shift in market dynamics, particularly among Retail Investors . With the market showing strong gains, the temptation to take profits after the recent Bitcoin Rally becomes significant for those with shorter-term horizons. Santiment indicated that the upcoming weekend could see sentiment potentially normalize or even lead to a slight pullback. This is the phase where individual investors, who may have bought in at lower prices, might decide to sell some of their holdings to lock in gains. This potential wave of profit-taking could introduce temporary selling pressure into the market. How Whales Could Fuel the Next Bitcoin Price Surge While Retail Investors might consider selling, the narrative often shifts when looking at larger market participants – commonly referred to as ‘whales’ due to their significant holdings. Santiment’s report highlights the intriguing possibility that coins sold by retail investors during a potential weekend pullback could be strategically acquired by these whales. Whales often have a longer-term perspective and deeper pockets, allowing them to buy during periods of increased supply or slight price dips caused by retail selling. This accumulation by large holders can absorb the selling pressure and build a strong base for the next leg up in the market. This dynamic is crucial, as significant whale accumulation following a retail sell-off could provide the necessary momentum for the Bitcoin Price to break through key resistance levels and potentially target the highly anticipated $100,000 mark in the coming weeks or months. Navigating Market Sentiment: Actionable Insights for Retail Investors So, what does this analysis mean for you as a Retail Investor navigating the current Bitcoin Rally and the insights from Santiment Data ? Here are a few actionable points: Monitor Sentiment, But Don’t Blindly Follow: Understand that high greed can precede pullbacks, but it doesn’t guarantee one. Use sentiment data as one tool among many. Have a Strategy: Know whether you are investing for the long term or trading for the short term. This will dictate how you react to potential weekend volatility. Consider Your Entry Price: If you bought in much lower, taking *some* profits might be a valid strategy, but consider the potential for further upside driven by whale accumulation. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Market predictions, even those based on sophisticated Santiment Data , are not guarantees. The current environment reflects a fascinating interplay between enthusiastic retail participants and strategic whale movements, all occurring as the Bitcoin Price eyes significant milestones. Conclusion: The recent Bitcoin Rally has undeniably injected significant optimism back into the market, driving social greed levels to notable highs according to Santiment Data . While this widespread positive sentiment is exciting, it also raises the possibility of short-term profit-taking from Retail Investors , potentially leading to a slight weekend dip. However, this very scenario could present an opportunity for whales to accumulate, laying the groundwork for renewed momentum and a potential push towards the $100,000 target. As the Crypto Market Sentiment continues to evolve, staying informed about these on-chain dynamics is key to navigating this potentially explosive phase for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Realized Profit Has Spiked Alongside Recovery Rally In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has talked about the recent trend in the Realized Profit of Bitcoin. The “Realized Profit” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, as its name suggests, measures the total amount of profit that the BTC investors are realizing through their selling. Related Reading: Litecoin Conviction Remains Strong: More Than 20% Of Supply Frozen Since 5+ Years The indicator works by looking at the transaction history of each coin being transferred or sold on the network to check what price it was previously transferred at. Sales of coins that have a price lower than the latest spot value are assumed to be resulting in profit realization equal to the difference between the two. The Realized Profit sums up this difference for each token being sold at a profit to gauge the network total. Another indicator called the Realized Loss keeps track of the sales of the opposite type. Now, here is the chart for the hourly Bitcoin Realized Profit shared by the analytics firm in the report: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Profit has witnessed a sharp spike recently. The increase in the indicator has come as BTC has been rallying, so it would appear that the investors have been looking to cash in on the opportunity. So far, the indicator has achieved a peak of $139 million per hour, which is about 17% higher than the baseline value of $120 million per hour. While this level isn’t too high when compared to the profit-taking sprees from the last bull rally (highlighted in green), it’s still notable, especially when considering how much lower it has been during the last couple of months. “If the market can absorb this selling pressure without breaking down, it paints a more constructive picture on the road ahead,” notes Glassnode. “Conversely, failure to hold these levels, under heavy profit realization, could mark this move as another dead cat bounce, which would be consistent with prior relief rallies that faded under similar conditions.” As for which side of the Bitcoin market is involved in this profit-taking event, data points toward the short-term holder cohort. The short-term holders (STHs) refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Back In ‘Full Force’ For The Rally, Glassnode Reveals Below is a chart that shows the trend in the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a metric that keeps track of the ratio between Realized Profit and Realized Loss, for the STHs. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin STH SOPR has seen a sustained move above the 1.0 mark, which suggests profit-taking is now notably outweighing loss-taking from these investors. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $94,600, up almost 12% in the last week.

If so, you’ve probably felt the shift in atmosphere. A key indicator many traders and investors track is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , and it’s just seen a notable uptick. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by software development platform Alternative, serves as a pulse check on the general sentiment prevailing in the cryptocurrency market. It distills complex market data into a single, easy-to-understand number ranging from 0 to 100. 0-24: Extreme Fear – Indicates investors are very worried, potentially a buying opportunity for the brave. 25-49: Fear – Market is nervous, cautious sentiment dominates. 50: Neutral – Sentiment is balanced, neither fear nor greed is dominant. 51-74: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic or even euphoric, potentially a sign of an overbought market. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Market is running hot, high risk of a correction as euphoria peaks. As of April 26, the index registered a reading of 65, a five-point increase from the previous day. This places it firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone, suggesting that positive sentiment is currently outweighing fear among market participants. What Drives the Index? Key Factors The index isn’t just a random number; it’s calculated using a blend of six weighted factors, aiming to provide a holistic view of crypto market sentiment : Factor Weighting Description Volatility 25% Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns compared to average values. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes current market volume and momentum compared to long-term averages. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greed. Social Media 15% Scans Twitter for specific hashtags and analyzes the speed and number of posts. High engagement, especially with positive sentiment, can signal greed. Surveys 15% Polls users on market sentiment (currently paused). Historically, this provided direct insight into investor mood. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Increasing dominance can indicate fear (people moving to ‘safer’ Bitcoin), while decreasing dominance can signal greed (altcoin speculation). Google Trends 10% Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might signal fear, while terms like “buy crypto” might signal greed. What Does 65 in the ‘Greed’ Zone Mean for the Crypto Market? A reading of 65 indicates that the average investor is feeling optimistic, perhaps even bullish, about the market’s prospects. This positive sentiment often accompanies rising prices and increased trading activity across the crypto market . However, it’s crucial to remember the old adage: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” While a high greed score reflects positive momentum, it can also suggest that the market might be becoming overheated. When greed is high, there’s an increased risk of a price correction as investors might start taking profits. Using the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index in Your Strategy The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (often used interchangeably with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index due to Bitcoin’s market dominance) is not a standalone trading signal. You shouldn’t buy or sell *just* because of the index reading. Instead, think of it as a supplementary tool to gauge the prevailing emotional state of the market. Actionable Insights: High Greed (like 65): Proceed with caution. It might not be the best time to make large, speculative buys. Consider taking some profits or setting tighter stop-losses. High Fear: This is often historically a better time for accumulation for long-term investors, assuming your fundamental analysis supports the assets. Combining Tools: Use the index alongside technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators), fundamental analysis (project utility, adoption), and overall market news. Navigating the Current Crypto Greed Zone Being in the crypto greed zone at 65 means many investors are feeling good. This could be fueled by positive news, recent price pumps, or anticipation of future developments. While this creates a positive feedback loop that can push prices higher, it also raises the collective risk profile of the market. It’s a time for vigilance. Avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Stick to your investment plan, manage your risk, and remember that market sentiment can shift rapidly. Conclusion The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 65, keeping it within the ‘Greed’ zone, is a clear signal that positive sentiment is currently dominating the market. While this reflects recent strength and optimism in the crypto market sentiment , it also serves as a reminder to exercise caution. The index is a valuable snapshot of the market’s emotional temperature, but wise investors use it as one piece of a larger analytical puzzle when navigating the exciting, and sometimes volatile, world of cryptocurrency.

Here’s the Truth,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-is-a-surge-to-33-100-realistic-heres-the-truth/,"The post XRP Price Prediction: Is a Surge to $33–$100 Realistic? Here’s the Truth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP News April 26th: Sistine Research’s latest XRP price prediction has stirred strong reactions across the crypto community, sparking both excitement and skepticism. Based on a technical “cup-and-handle” pattern, the forecast suggests XRP could reach between $33 and $100, fueling optimism among XRP supporters. However, experts warn that real-world adoption and strong fundamentals are crucial for such a bullish scenario to materialize. XRP Price Prediction: What’s the Realistic Target? According to Sistine Research , the XRP price prediction points to a potential surge to $33–$50 under normal conditions and as high as $77–$100 in an extreme case. The analysis leans heavily on the cup-and-handle chart pattern formation, historically associated with strong bullish breakouts. However, experts caution that technical patterns alone cannot justify such steep price targets without solid support from fundamentals like adoption and regulatory clarity. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why BlackRock Is Not Filing XRP ETF? , In Contrast, A crypto analyst recently analyzed Sistine Research’s bold XRP prediction and urged investors to stay grounded. The analyst explained that while XRP could technically rise to $33–$100 based on a “ cup-and-handle” chart pattern , technical patterns alone are not enough to trigger such a massive rally. To reach those prices, XRP would need global adoption and major real-world use cases, which have not materialized yet. Instead, the analyst suggested that a more reasonable XRP price range would be between $5 and $10 during a strong bull market , emphasizing that real growth and solid market support are essential for any major rally. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43822349,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153098,1745655023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Debate: Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal Urges SEC Employees Be Allowed to Hold Crypto,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-employees-hold-crypto/,"A significant conversation is unfolding at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government oversight. Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) at leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, has recently put forward a compelling argument that could reshape internal ethics policies at one of the United most powerful financial regulators: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a move that has sparked considerable discussion within both the crypto community and regulatory circles, Grewal publicly stated via X (formerly Twitter) that he has formally requested the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to consider allowing SEC employees hold crypto assets. This isn’t just a technical ask; it delves deep into questions of personal freedom, professional conduct, and the very nature of regulating a rapidly evolving digital asset class. Why is Allowing SEC Employees to Hold Crypto Such a Hot Topic? At its core, the debate centers on the potential for a conflict of interest . Regulatory bodies like the SEC are tasked with overseeing financial markets and protecting investors. Employees within these agencies often have access to non-public information that could significantly impact market prices. To prevent the misuse of such information and maintain public trust, strict ethics rules are in place regarding employees’ personal investments. Traditionally, these rules might restrict or prohibit employees from holding assets in industries they directly regulate, especially if they are senior staff or involved in policy-making. The concern is that an employee’s personal financial stake in an asset could improperly influence their official duties or give them an unfair advantage in trading. However, the world of crypto is unique. It’s a new technology, a new asset class, and for many, a fundamental shift in finance. Prohibiting employees from holding any crypto assets raises questions: Does it hinder regulators from truly understanding the technology they are regulating? Is a blanket ban overly restrictive, especially for junior staff or those not involved in direct crypto enforcement? How does one distinguish between speculative trading (potentially problematic) and simply holding a small amount of crypto as a personal investment or to engage with the technology? This is the complex landscape that Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal is navigating with his request to the OGE. Understanding the Players: SEC, OGE, and Coinbase To fully grasp the significance of Grewal’s request, it helps to understand the roles of the key entities involved: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): This independent agency of the U.S. federal government is responsible for protecting investors, maintaining fair and orderly functioning of securities markets, and facilitating capital formation. Under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has taken an increasingly active, and often controversial, stance regarding crypto regulation , frequently classifying various digital assets as securities and pursuing enforcement actions against crypto companies. The U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE): This is an independent agency within the executive branch of the U.S. government. Its role is to provide overall leadership and oversight of the executive branch ethics program. The OGE works with agency ethics officials (like those at the SEC) to establish, communicate, and enforce ethics standards, including rules around financial holdings and conflicts of interest for federal employees. While the SEC has its own ethics office, OGE provides guidance and oversight for the entire executive branch. Coinbase: One of the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges globally. As a major player in the crypto space, Coinbase is directly impacted by SEC policies and regulations. The company has also been involved in legal disputes with the SEC regarding the classification of assets listed on its platform and its exchange operations. Paul Grewal, as Coinbase’s CLO, is at the forefront of the company’s interactions with regulators and legal challenges. His request to the OGE is a strategic move, aiming to influence the foundational ethics rules that govern the very people tasked with regulating his industry. What Are the Current Rules for SEC Employees Regarding Crypto? While specific internal policies can be complex and subject to change, federal ethics rules generally require employees to avoid situations that create a conflict of interest . This often involves disclosing financial holdings and potentially divesting assets that could be affected by their official duties. For agencies like the SEC, this has historically meant strict rules around holding stocks or other securities in industries they regulate. Regarding crypto, the rules have evolved as the asset class has grown. Given the SEC’s view that many cryptocurrencies are securities, the existing ethics framework likely subjects crypto holdings to scrutiny similar to stock holdings. This could mean: A potential ban on holding specific cryptocurrencies deemed securities by the SEC. Restrictions on trading frequency or volume. Requirements to disclose any crypto holdings above a certain de minimis threshold. Potential divestment requirements for employees in roles with direct regulatory oversight of crypto. The precise details are often internal, but the underlying principle is clear: prevent personal financial interests from influencing regulatory actions. Grewal’s request implies that the current framework may be overly restrictive or not adequately adapted to the unique nature of crypto assets. The Argument FOR Allowing SEC Employees to Hold Crypto Paul Grewal and others who support this view likely base their arguments on several key points: Enhanced Understanding: How can regulators truly understand blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other crypto innovations if they are prohibited from interacting with them directly? Holding and using crypto, even in a limited capacity, provides invaluable firsthand experience that reading reports or listening to presentations cannot replicate. This practical knowledge could lead to more informed and effective crypto regulation . Fairness to Employees: Crypto has become a significant asset class. Prohibiting employees from participating, even cautiously, in this market could be seen as an undue restriction on their personal financial freedom, especially if similar restrictions aren’t applied consistently across all emerging asset classes or technologies. Distinguishing Holding from Trading: Simply holding a small amount of Bitcoin or Ethereum is vastly different from actively trading dozens of obscure tokens based on potentially non-public information. Ethics rules could be nuanced to allow passive holding while still prohibiting active trading or holdings of assets directly tied to ongoing enforcement actions. Attracting Talent: In a world where crypto is increasingly relevant, overly strict personal investment rules might make it harder for the SEC to attract and retain talent, particularly individuals with deep expertise in technology and finance who may already hold crypto. The core idea is that a complete ban might be counterproductive, potentially leading to regulators who lack practical understanding of the market they oversee. Allowing SEC employees hold crypto under clear, limited conditions could be a path forward. Addressing the Concerns: The Conflict of Interest Challenge Despite the arguments for allowing crypto holdings, the concerns about conflict of interest are legitimate and cannot be easily dismissed. Critics of Grewal’s proposal would raise points such as: Potential for Insider Trading: Even passive holding could be problematic if an employee has advance knowledge of a major regulatory action (like an enforcement case or a rule approval/rejection) that could drastically affect the price of the crypto asset they hold. Erosion of Public Trust: If the public perceives that regulators might benefit financially from the outcomes of their regulatory decisions, it could severely damage the credibility and trust placed in the SEC. Difficulty in Monitoring: The decentralized and often pseudonymous nature of crypto can make it challenging for ethics offices to effectively monitor employee holdings and transactions, increasing the risk of undetected violations. Regulatory Bias: A personal financial stake, however small, could unconsciously (or consciously) bias an employee’s perspective on policy decisions or enforcement priorities. These are serious concerns that any revised ethics policy would need to address rigorously. The OGE’s role is precisely to weigh these potential risks against the arguments for allowing certain activities. Potential Paths Forward: Finding a Balance If the OGE and SEC were to consider allowing SEC employees hold crypto , it wouldn’t likely be a free-for-all. Any revised policy would almost certainly include stringent safeguards, potentially including: Strict Disclosure Requirements: Mandating detailed and regular reporting of all crypto holdings and transactions. Holding Period Requirements: Implementing minimum holding periods to discourage short-term trading based on market fluctuations or non-public information. Restrictions on Specific Assets: Prohibiting ownership of assets directly involved in ongoing investigations or those deemed particularly susceptible to manipulation. Blind Trusts: Requiring employees to place crypto assets in blind trusts managed by independent third parties, where the employee has no knowledge or control over specific investment decisions. De Minimis Exceptions: Allowing employees to hold a very small, nominal amount of widely held cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) for educational purposes, below a threshold that would pose a significant financial incentive. Training and Education: Providing extensive ethics training specifically tailored to the nuances of digital assets. The goal would be to find a balance that allows employees sufficient exposure to understand the technology while completely mitigating the risk of insider trading or perceived bias. This is where the expertise of the Office of Government Ethics is crucial – they are the body designed to navigate these complex ethical landscapes for federal employees. The Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation Paul Grewal’s request is more than just an internal personnel matter for the SEC. It has broader implications for the future of crypto regulation in the United States. If regulators themselves are encouraged or allowed to engage with crypto, it could potentially lead to a more nuanced, informed, and perhaps even more collaborative approach to regulation. Conversely, if the strict ban remains or is reinforced, it could perpetuate a disconnect between regulators and the regulated industry, potentially leading to policies based on theoretical understanding rather than practical experience. This debate highlights the ongoing tension between traditional financial regulatory frameworks and the innovative, often disruptive, nature of cryptocurrency. The outcome of Grewal’s request to the Office of Government Ethics could set a precedent, not just for the SEC, but potentially for other federal agencies that interact with digital assets. It forces a necessary conversation about how government employees can ethically interact with emerging technologies that also function as investment assets. Key Takeaways from the Debate Here are some actionable insights and key points to consider from this developing story: The request from Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal directly challenges existing assumptions about conflict of interest in the digital age. Allowing SEC employees hold crypto could enhance regulatory understanding but raises significant ethical hurdles. The Office of Government Ethics is the key body tasked with evaluating the ethics rules for federal employees, including those at the SEC. The debate is a microcosm of the larger challenge facing regulators: how to oversee a new technology without stifling innovation or creating undue restrictions. Potential solutions involve stringent disclosure, holding periods, and restrictions on specific assets, rather than a complete free pass. The outcome could influence the future direction and approach of crypto regulation in the U.S. A Compelling Summary: Navigating the Ethical Waters of Digital Assets Paul Grewal’s bold request to the Office of Government Ethics to allow SEC employees to hold and use crypto assets has ignited a vital debate. It forces a confrontation between traditional conflict of interest rules designed for conventional markets and the unique realities of the digital asset space. While concerns about insider trading and maintaining public trust are paramount and require robust safeguards, prohibiting regulators from engaging with the technology they oversee could be counterproductive to effective regulation. The outcome of this deliberation by the OGE will not only impact the personal finances of SEC staff but could also significantly shape the future landscape of crypto regulation in the United States, determining whether future policies are built on practical understanding or remain disconnected from the technology they govern. It’s a crucial moment in defining the ethical boundaries for public servants in the age of decentralized finance.

This is the promise of crypto staking , a process where cryptocurrency holders lock up their assets to support the operations of a blockchain network. Yet, despite its potential, access to this opportunity remains restricted for many in the United States. Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, recently voiced a powerful sentiment on X (formerly Twitter): every American, he believes, should have the ability to access crypto staking . What Exactly is Crypto Staking and How Does It Work? Before diving into the regulatory battles, let’s understand what crypto staking entails. It’s fundamentally tied to blockchain networks that use a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Unlike Proof-of-Work (PoW), which relies on computational power (mining) to validate transactions and secure the network, PoS relies on participants ‘staking’ their cryptocurrency. Validators: Instead of miners, PoS networks have validators. These are participants who have staked a certain amount of the network’s native cryptocurrency. Validation Process: Validators are randomly selected to propose and validate new blocks of transactions on the blockchain. The more they stake, the higher their chance of being selected. Rewards: For successfully validating blocks and securing the network, validators receive staking rewards , typically in the form of new coins or transaction fees. Delegation: For individuals who don’t have enough crypto to become a full validator or lack the technical expertise, they can delegate their holdings to a staking pool or a service provider like Coinbase. This allows them to earn a portion of the staking rewards without running their own node. This process is crucial for the security, efficiency, and decentralization of many modern blockchain networks, including Ethereum, which transitioned to PoS in 2022. The Promise of Staking Rewards : Why It Matters to Users For individual crypto holders, crypto staking offers compelling benefits: Passive Income: It provides a way to earn returns on idle cryptocurrency holdings, similar to earning interest in a traditional savings account, but often with potentially higher yields (though also higher risk). Network Participation: Staking allows users to actively participate in the governance and security of the blockchain networks they support. Simplicity (via exchanges): Platforms like Coinbase staking simplify the technical complexities, making it accessible to everyday users. Potential for Compounding: Rewards earned can often be restaked, potentially leading to compounded returns over time. These potential staking rewards represent a significant opportunity for individuals seeking to grow their digital assets. However, this is where the complexities of US crypto regulation come into play. Coinbase Staking : A Gateway Under Scrutiny Coinbase has been a major provider of staking services, allowing millions of users to easily stake assets like Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and others directly through their platform. This ease of access is precisely what Brian Armstrong and Coinbase advocate for. However, Coinbase staking services have faced significant challenges from regulatory bodies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken the stance that certain staking services offered by platforms constitute unregistered securities offerings. This view led to enforcement actions against other platforms, and while the SEC filed a broader lawsuit against Coinbase alleging various securities violations (including staking), the direct focus on staking as a standalone suit against Coinbase was averted, partly due to ongoing dialogue and the broader legal context. Despite the federal situation evolving, several individual US states have pursued their own actions regarding staking services offered by exchanges like Coinbase. According to information shared by Coinbase on X, while the SEC and five states have reportedly dropped staking-related suits or inquiries against the exchange, users in specific states are still unable to access these services. Why is US Crypto Regulation Clashing with Staking? The core issue often boils down to how regulatory bodies classify crypto assets and services. The SEC typically uses the Howey Test, derived from a 1946 Supreme Court case, to determine if something is an investment contract and thus a security subject to their jurisdiction. The Howey Test asks if there is: An investment of money In a common enterprise With an expectation of profits Derived solely from the efforts of others Regulators applying this test to staking services, particularly those offered by centralized platforms like Coinbase, argue that users invest money (their crypto), in a common enterprise (the staking pool/service), expect profits ( staking rewards ), derived from the efforts of others (the exchange managing the staking process). This interpretation classifies the service as an unregistered security offering, requiring registration and compliance with securities laws. The crypto industry, including figures like Brian Armstrong , often counters that staking is a fundamental technological process essential for network operation, not an investment contract in the traditional sense. They argue that existing regulations are ill-suited for this new technology and that a lack of clear, tailored US crypto regulation stifles innovation and harms consumers by limiting access to legitimate earning opportunities. The Human Impact: Millions in Lost Staking Rewards The regulatory hurdles aren’t just abstract legal battles; they have tangible consequences for everyday Americans. Coinbase specifically highlighted the plight of users in four states: California, New Jersey, Maryland, and Wisconsin. Due to regulatory actions or ongoing restrictions in these specific jurisdictions, crypto users living there have been unable to participate in Coinbase staking . The financial impact is significant. According to Coinbase’s communication, users in these four states alone have missed out on over $90 million in potential staking rewards since June 2023. This isn’t just about large institutional investors; it affects individual retail users who could have used these earnings for various purposes, from supplementing income to reinvesting in their portfolios. This situation underscores the direct cost of regulatory uncertainty and fragmented state-by-state approaches to US crypto regulation . While users in many other states (and globally) can access these services, those in the restricted areas are left behind, unable to benefit from opportunities available elsewhere. Brian Armstrong ‘s Stance: Advocating for Access Brian Armstrong ‘s X post wasn’t just a casual observation; it was a direct advocacy statement reflecting Coinbase’s ongoing efforts to ensure broader access to crypto services in the US. His belief that ‘Every American should be able to access crypto staking’ is rooted in the principles of financial inclusion, innovation, and consumer choice. Coinbase views staking as a core utility of many modern blockchains and a legitimate way for users to earn returns while supporting decentralized networks. They argue that restricting access unfairly disadvantages US citizens compared to those in countries with clearer or more permissive regulatory frameworks. The exchange has been actively engaging with regulators and policymakers at both the federal and state levels to achieve regulatory clarity and ensure that products like Coinbase staking can be offered legally and safely across the entire country. Brian Armstrong has been a vocal proponent for tailored crypto legislation that provides clear rules of the road, rather than trying to fit novel technology into outdated frameworks. Challenges and the Path Forward for Coinbase Staking Despite some positive developments, such as the reported dropping of certain suits, the path forward for universal Coinbase staking access in the US remains challenging. The regulatory landscape is complex and constantly evolving. State-level actions can pose significant hurdles, even if federal issues see progress. Coinbase continues its efforts through various avenues: Legal Advocacy: Engaging in dialogue and, where necessary, legal challenges to clarify the regulatory status of staking. Lobbying and Education: Working with policymakers to educate them about the technology and advocate for sensible, clear rules. Product Adaptation: Potentially adapting services to better fit within existing or future regulatory boundaries, while striving to maintain user access and benefits. The goal is to create an environment where innovations like crypto staking can thrive under appropriate consumer protections without being effectively banned through regulatory ambiguity or overreach. What This Means for the Future of Crypto Staking in the US The outcome of the debate around crypto staking and US crypto regulation will have significant implications. If access remains restricted or becomes overly burdensome, it could: Push crypto activity offshore, making it harder to monitor and potentially exposing users to less protected environments. Stifle innovation within the US, as companies may choose to build and offer services elsewhere. Disadvantage US investors compared to their global counterparts. Limit the ability of US citizens to participate in and benefit from the growth of decentralized networks. Conversely, achieving regulatory clarity that allows for compliant crypto staking services could foster a healthier, more transparent, and more innovative crypto ecosystem within the United States. Actionable Insights for Users If you are interested in crypto staking or affected by current restrictions, here are a few insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources, updates from exchanges like Coinbase, and information from regulatory bodies. Understand the Risks: Staking involves risks, including potential loss of staked assets if a validator is penalized (slashed), smart contract risks, and price volatility of the underlying asset. Understand these risks before participating. Advocate: Consider contacting your state and federal representatives to express your views on the importance of clear and enabling US crypto regulation . Explore Compliant Options: If you are in a restricted state, research if there are any compliant staking options available to you, or consider alternative ways to earn yield on crypto that are permitted in your jurisdiction (while understanding the differences and risks). Conclusion: The Fight for Fair Access Brian Armstrong’s assertion that every American should have access to crypto staking highlights a critical juncture in the development of US crypto regulation . The ongoing situation, particularly the millions in lost staking rewards for users in states like California, New Jersey, Maryland, and Wisconsin, underscores the real-world impact of regulatory uncertainty and inconsistency. While challenges remain, the push for clear, enabling rules continues. Ensuring fair and compliant access to opportunities like crypto staking is vital not just for individual investors, but for the future of financial innovation and participation in the United States. The outcome of this regulatory debate will significantly shape the landscape for Coinbase staking and the broader crypto market for years to come.

43822912,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153101,1745656209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Ethereum ETF Inflows Surge: US Spot ETH ETFs Attract $104.56M in Promising Trend,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-etf-inflows-surge/,"Are you tracking the latest moves in the crypto market? On April 25, the U.S. spot Ethereum ETF landscape saw a significant positive shift, recording a combined net inflow of $104.56 million . This marks the second consecutive trading day where these investment vehicles have attracted fresh capital, signaling potentially growing investor confidence. What’s Driving These Significant ETH Inflows? According to data shared by crypto observer Trader T (@thepfund) on X, this recent wave of ETH Inflows highlights renewed interest following periods of outflows or stagnation. The substantial figure of over $100 million in a single day is noteworthy for the relatively nascent spot Ethereum ETF market in the U.S. Let’s break down which specific Spot Ethereum ETF products led the charge: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund was the clear frontrunner, pulling in a robust $54.82 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s entry into the crypto ETF space has been closely watched, and this performance underscores its impact. Fidelity’s FETH: Following BlackRock, Fidelity’s offering attracted a healthy $35.94 million . Fidelity is another major financial player whose participation lends credibility to the sector. Grayscale’s mini ETH: Grayscale, a long-standing name in crypto asset management, saw its mini Ethereum product receive $10.2 million in net inflows. This indicates continued interest across different product types offered by the firm. Bitwise’s ETHW and Invesco’s QETH: Both of these ETFs also contributed positively, each seeing a net inflow of $1.8 million . While smaller amounts compared to the leaders, these still represent positive movement. Several other U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs reported no change in their holdings on April 25, meaning they neither gained nor lost assets that day. Why Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Important for Crypto Investment? The introduction and performance of products like the Spot Ethereum ETF are crucial for broadening access to Crypto Investment . They allow traditional investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency itself. This accessibility through regulated financial products can attract a wider range of investors, including institutions, who might be hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and private key management. The inflows into funds like BlackRock ETHA and Fidelity FETH are often seen as indicators of increasing institutional adoption and confidence in Ethereum as an asset class. Positive inflows can also contribute to positive market sentiment around ETH. Benefits and Challenges of Investing via Ethereum ETFs Benefits: Accessibility: Easy to buy and sell through traditional brokerage accounts. Regulation: Operates within a regulated framework, potentially offering more investor protection compared to some direct crypto platforms. Convenience: Eliminates the need for digital wallets and understanding blockchain technology for basic price exposure. Challenges: Fees: ETFs typically charge management fees, which can eat into returns over time. Tracking Error: The ETF’s price might not perfectly track the underlying asset’s price due to operational factors. Market Volatility: While the ETF structure is traditional, the underlying asset (Ethereum) remains highly volatile. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although the ETFs themselves are regulated, the broader crypto landscape still faces evolving regulatory challenges globally. What Does This Trend Suggest for the Future of ETH Inflows? Two consecutive days of positive net inflows, especially led by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, could signal a potential shift in sentiment or increased accumulation interest. While not a guarantee of future performance, sustained positive ETH Inflows into Spot Ethereum ETF products would be a strong bullish indicator for Ethereum’s price and the overall health of institutional participation in the crypto market. Investors interested in Crypto Investment should monitor these inflow trends closely, as they can provide insights into market demand from traditional finance sectors. The performance of funds like BlackRock ETHA serves as a key metric in this regard. Conclusion: A Promising Sign for the Spot Ethereum ETF Market The $104.56 million in net inflows on April 25 is a significant positive development for the U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF market. It underscores growing interest and capital allocation, particularly from investors utilizing products offered by major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. As the market matures, sustained positive ETH Inflows will be a critical factor to watch for those involved in or considering Crypto Investment . This trend offers a glimpse into the increasing integration of digital assets into traditional financial portfolios.

Because when three distinct innovations begin turning heads in separate sectors—digital privacy, AI-integrated smart contracts, and institutional-grade financial tools—something big is brewing. Qubetics, NEAR Protocol, and XRP aren’t just trending; they’re reshaping what tomorrow’s decentralized finance looks like. Their latest updates reflect more than momentum—they show direction, purpose, and real-world traction. NEAR Protocol’s recent inclusion in Grayscale’s AI-Crypto Fund has sparked sharp interest among data scientists, developers, and fintech professionals. Meanwhile, XRP is gaining institutional credibility fast—CME and Bitnomial introducing regulated futures has recalibrated how major funds are engaging with digital currencies beyond Bitcoin. Now, turn the spotlight to Qubetics ($TICS). Built with solutions in mind, it steps where others hesitate. By tackling digital vulnerability through a decentralized VPN and streamlining enterprise workflows with privacy-first tools, Qubetics isn’t patching old wounds—it’s building fresh paths. For developers, data guardians, and communities seeking practical innovation, Qubetics rises as a token with staying power and unmatched ROI potential. Qubetics: Decentralized Innovation for Real-Life Solutions Qubetics isn’t just another protocol—it’s a privacy-focused ecosystem that takes on real-world friction with sharp, scalable tools. One standout is its decentralized VPN, which ensures unrestricted, secure access to information without relying on centralized data choke points. Imagine a digital agency operating in restrictive jurisdictions, or a multinational navigating censorship walls—Qubetics enables seamless, borderless browsing without data leaks or surveillance. Professionals handling sensitive files can securely collaborate across nodes, knowing that each file is shielded by blockchain-grade encryption. Content delivery networks, research institutions, and freelancers managing remote teams benefit from the smooth, secure, and anonymous exchange that Qubetics facilitates. This isn’t theory; it’s utility in action. Over 509 million $TICS tokens have been sold, raising more than $16.4 million. With the current crypto presale price at $0.1902 in its 31 stage and projections indicating potential ROI surpassing 5,000% post-mainnet, the momentum is undeniable. More than 25,200 holders already back the movement. As blockchain heads toward utility-based architecture, Qubetics might just be the best crypto investment quietly building the future. $500 Investment in $TICS Drop $500 in now and bag nearly 2,628 tokens. When $TICS rises to $6, that’s a potential $15,768. And if the token rallies to $15, you’re sitting on $39,420. From $500 to nearly 40 grand? This isn’t a dream—this is the kind of moonshot crypto heads chase all cycle long. NEAR Protocol: AI Integration and Smart Scalability NEAR Protocol’s trajectory in 2025 reflects sharp integration with emergent tech trends, especially AI. Now trading at $2.53, NEAR has seen a 4.55% boost in just 24 hours, supported by highs of $2.57. Its recent inclusion in Grayscale’s AI-Crypto Fund speaks volumes about institutional belief in its role bridging AI and decentralized computing. That’s not mere exposure—it’s validation. The anticipated Nightshade 2.0 upgrade, designed to enhance scalability and transaction throughput, is fueling speculative interest. But beneath the speculation lies a tangible strength: developers already building data-intelligent applications on NEAR’s sharded infrastructure are reporting better performance and lower latency. NEAR’s technical blueprint aligns with the demand for high-performance computing on-chain. It’s like turning a two-lane road into a 10-lane expressway for smart contracts. With price forecasts ranging from $5.70 to $8.24 by year-end, depending on market behavior and adoption rate, many community members view NEAR as one of the best crypto investment tokens to watch. XRP: Institutional Entry and Market Tools Expansion XRP is rapidly becoming a foundation stone in institutional crypto portfolios. At a trading value of $2.18, with a minor dip of 0.46%, XRP is poised at a moment of market awakening. CME’s decision to launch cash-settled XRP futures on May 19, 2025, reflects a broader strategy: opening new doors for hedge funds and financial entities to engage with digital currencies. Bitnomial’s earlier launch of physically settled XRP futures—and the legal clarity following the SEC’s dropped charges—signals a new era for XRP. These derivatives don’t just offer leverage; they offer legitimacy. They transform XRP into a serious tool for hedging, planning, and execution within regulated frameworks. What makes XRP stand apart is its payment-focused infrastructure, enabling near-instant global transfers with minimal fees. It has already embedded itself into remittance corridors and is now gaining traction in smart finance. For those seeking a reliable, compliant, and scalable token, XRP’s current developments mark it as a strategic inclusion in any best crypto investment portfolio. Future Ready: Qubetics, NEAR Protocol, XRP Driving Forward Each project represents a distinct flavor of blockchain evolution. Qubetics focuses on real-life usability—data privacy, secure collaboration, and infrastructure decentralization. NEAR Protocol plays the long game, merging AI with Web3 for smarter, more responsive apps. XRP, on the other hand, bridges the gap between legacy finance and blockchain functionality with tools that traditional markets respect. These are not passing trends. They’re strategic moves—well-planned and finely executed. Early buyers in the Qubetics presale have already sensed the potential with over $16.4 million raised, while NEAR’s institutional traction and XRP’s regulated futures show that the crypto market is maturing fast. All three tokens reflect a deeper shift toward accessible, applicable blockchain solutions, and for those exploring the best crypto investment of 2025, the choice is now clearer than ever. For the ones who understand where blockchain is heading, now isn’t the time to wait. It’s time to explore.

Its real-world utility, decentralized VPN, and 5,000%+ ROI potential make Qubetics a top pick for practical, future-ready blockchain adoption. How does NEAR Protocol benefit from the AI-Crypto fund by Grayscale? It gains institutional validation and momentum as a key infrastructure for AI-integrated smart contracts and dApps. What does the launch of XRP futures mean for market participants? It offers compliant trading tools, boosts institutional access, and strengthens XRP’s position in mainstream finance.

Lummis called the Fed’s April 24 announcement — withdrawing its 2022 supervisory letter that had discouraged banks from engaging with crypto and stablecoin activities — “just lip service.” Lummis’ tone was different from the rest of the crypto industry Lummis, a pro-crypto advocate known for introducing the Bitcoin ( BTC ) Strategic Reserve Bill in July 2024, pointed out several flaws in the Fed’s announcement, even as Strategy founder Michael Saylor and crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano suggested it was a step forward for banks and crypto. Source: Anthony Pompliano She argued that the Fed continues to “illegally flout the law on master accounts” and still relies on reputational risk in its bank supervision practices. It comes as the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC) is working on a rule to stop examiners from considering reputational risk when reviewing a bank’s operations, according to a recent Bloomberg report . Lummis also highlighted the Fed’s policy statement in Section 9(13), which hasn’t been withdrawn, stating that Bitcoin and digital assets are considered “unsafe and unsound.” She also reiterated many of the same staff behind Operation Chokepoint 2.0 are still involved in crypto policy today. “We are NOT fooled. The Fed assassinated companies within the industry and hurt American interests by stifling innovation and shuttering businesses. This fight is far from over.” “I will continue to hold the Fed accountable until the digital asset industry gets more than a life jacket, Chair Powell — they need a fair shake,” Lummis said. Related: If Trump fired Powell, what would happen to crypto? Custodia Bank founder and CEO Caitlin Long seemed to share a similar view to Lummis. “THANK YOU for seeing this for what it is,” Long said . Source: David Sacks However, many crypto executives praised the Fed’s announcement as a positive development for the industry. Saylor said in an April 25 X post that the Fed’s move means that “banks are now free to begin supporting Bitcoin.” Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum, said the Fed’s decision “is a significant development, as it will simplify the path to institutional adoption.” Magazine: Ethereum is destroying the competition in the $16.1T TradFi tokenization race",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-26 08:33:04

U.S. President Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday a de-escalation of their continued tariff battle, adding that direct talks were already ongoing. In a Friday interview with Time Magazine, he also said that his administration was talking with China to strike a tariff deal and that Chinese President Xi Jinping also called him. On April 25, several businesses notified of the changes said China issued some exemptions from its 125% tariffs on U.S. imports. The country also allegedly asked companies to identify the goods eligible for exemptions. “I don’t think that anything’s necessarily much clearer now, but it does feel like there’s no more ramping up. It feels like it’s coming the other way, and if anything, it seems to be heading more towards de-escalation than escalation.” ~ Fiona Cincotta, Market Strategist at City Index. Cincotta acknowledged that she has seen the dollar pull out of oversold territory before. She also argued that it’s too early to celebrate the dollar recovery because “we’re not quite there yet.” The dollar outperforms safe haven currencies The U.S. currency surged by 0.82% on the day against the yen at 143.775. The dollar was also up 0.42% against the Swiss franc at 0.82985. The pound plummeted 0.12% to $1.332, while the euro dropped 0.24% to $1.1363, even after unexpectedly strong UK retail sales. The President caused the dollar to drop against other major currencies at the start of the week after his threats to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. The dollar bounced back on Tuesday after Trump mentioned he never intended to replace the central bank boss. South Korea and Japan have made some progress in early trade talks with Washington. After meeting U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Japan’s Finance Minister Katsunobu Katō stated they had no talks on currency targets. The country’s chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, acknowledged that he will hold a second round of trade talks with Bessent next week. The U.S. President has also accused Tokyo of weakening its currency to help its exporters. MUFG strategist Derek Halpenny argued that even if reports suggest there will be some easing of tariff rates, a hit to U.S. growth was on the way. He argued that the hit would ensure that volatility levels remain high, equity markets would be pressured to the downside, and the global backdrop would remain unfavorable for any sustained move higher in the dollar/yen. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda echoed on Thursday the central bank’s commitment to raising interest rates if the underlying inflation moved toward 2% as projected. He also acknowledged that policymakers needed to review the fallout from U.S. tariffs. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain rates at current levels at its two-day meeting that ends on May 1.

This milestone, confirmed by Solscan data, underscores the growing prominence of USDC on Solana and highlights the increasing demand for fast, low-cost stablecoin transactions. Understanding USDC on the Solana Network Before diving into the significance of the $10 billion figure, let’s quickly touch upon what USDC on Solana actually is. USDC, or USD Coin, is a popular stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. It’s issued by Circle and Coinbase and is designed to provide stability in the volatile crypto market. While USDC exists on many different blockchain networks, its presence on the Solana network has seen explosive growth. Solana’s architecture, known for its high throughput and incredibly low transaction fees, makes it an ideal environment for stablecoin transfers and decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. Unlike networks where sending stablecoins can be costly and slow, the Solana network allows users to move large amounts of value quickly and economically. This technical advantage has been a key driver behind the rapid adoption of Solana USDC . The $10 Billion USDC Market Cap Milestone Explained Surpassing a USDC market cap of $10 billion on a single network like Solana is more than just a big number; it’s a powerful indicator of several key trends: Increased Adoption: A larger market cap directly reflects more USDC being issued and held on the Solana network . This means more users, developers, and institutions are choosing Solana as their preferred chain for stablecoin operations. Growing Liquidity: A high market cap implies deep liquidity. This is crucial for DeFi protocols, exchanges, and trading platforms built on Solana, as it allows for larger trades with minimal slippage. Confidence in Solana: The willingness of users and issuers to hold such a significant amount of value on Solana signals increasing confidence in the network’s stability, security, and long-term viability, despite past challenges. Ecosystem Health: A robust stablecoin presence is vital for any thriving blockchain ecosystem. The $10 billion USDC market cap on Solana demonstrates the health and activity within its DeFi, NFT, and payment sectors. According to Solscan data, the ascent to this $10 billion figure hasn’t been linear but reflects sustained growth driven by the increasing utility of the Solana network . Why Choose Solana for Stablecoins? The Appeal of the Solana Network The growth of Solana stablecoins , led by USDC, isn’t accidental. It’s a direct result of the technical advantages offered by the Solana network . Let’s look at some reasons why users and developers are flocking to Solana for stablecoin activities: Lightning-Fast Transactions: Solana boasts transaction speeds measured in thousands per second (TPS), significantly higher than many legacy blockchains. This speed is critical for trading, payments, and complex DeFi strategies. Ultra-Low Fees: Transaction fees on Solana are typically fractions of a cent. This makes frequent stablecoin transfers, micro-payments, and high-frequency trading economically viable, unlike networks with high gas fees. Scalability: Solana’s architecture is designed for scale, capable of handling a massive volume of transactions simultaneously. This ensures that the network can support a growing USDC market cap and increasing user activity without congestion. Growing Ecosystem: The vibrant and expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) on Solana provides numerous use cases for Solana USDC , from swapping and lending to earning yield and buying digital assets. These factors collectively make the Solana network a highly attractive platform for stablecoin issuance and usage, directly contributing to the impressive USDC market cap figure. The Impact of Solana USDC on the Ecosystem The massive $10 billion Solana USDC market cap isn’t just a statistic; it has tangible impacts on the broader Solana ecosystem. The presence of such a large pool of stable value fuels various activities: DeFi Hub: Solana has become a significant hub for decentralized finance. Protocols like Raydium, Serum (though its role has evolved), Orca, and Marinade Finance rely heavily on Solana USDC for liquidity in trading pairs, lending pools, and yield farming opportunities. The $10 billion provides the necessary depth for these platforms to function efficiently. Enhanced Trading: Exchanges and trading platforms on Solana benefit immensely from the deep USDC market cap . Traders can execute large orders for various crypto assets against USDC with minimal price impact. Payments and Remittances: The low cost and high speed of USDC on Solana make it increasingly viable for cross-border payments and remittances, offering a faster and cheaper alternative to traditional systems. NFT Marketplace Liquidity: While SOL is often used for base transactions, Solana stablecoins like USDC provide stability for pricing and trading NFTs, especially for high-value assets. The success of Solana USDC is intertwined with the success of the entire ecosystem built on the Solana network . The $10 billion figure is a testament to this symbiotic relationship. Challenges and the Road Ahead for Solana Stablecoins While the $10 billion USDC market cap is a cause for celebration, it’s also important to acknowledge the challenges. The Solana network has faced scrutiny over past network outages and stability issues. While improvements have been made, maintaining network reliability is paramount for sustaining and growing the confidence required to hold such a large stablecoin value. Furthermore, stablecoins themselves face increasing regulatory attention globally. The future regulatory landscape could impact the issuance and usage of Solana stablecoins like USDC. Circle, as the issuer, must navigate these evolving regulations, which could in turn affect USDC on Solana . Despite these challenges, the trajectory for Solana stablecoins appears positive. Continued improvements to network infrastructure, coupled with the ongoing development of innovative dApps on the Solana network , are likely to drive further adoption and potentially push the USDC market cap even higher. Actionable Insights from the $10 Billion Milestone What does this significant USDC market cap milestone mean for different participants in the crypto space? For Users: It signals increased liquidity and opportunity within the Solana ecosystem. Using USDC on Solana for trading, lending, or payments is likely to become even more efficient and cost-effective. Explore Solana-based DeFi platforms that utilize USDC. For Developers: The large Solana USDC pool represents a significant user base and liquidity source. Building dApps that leverage this stablecoin liquidity on the Solana network can attract users and facilitate growth. For Investors: The growing USDC market cap on Solana is a strong indicator of the network’s fundamental strength and increasing utility. It suggests healthy ecosystem activity, which can be a positive sign for the SOL token itself. The $10 billion figure is a clear signal that Solana stablecoins are a major force to be reckoned with in the crypto market. Conclusion The achievement of a $10 billion USDC market cap on the Solana network is a landmark event. It solidifies Solana’s position as a leading blockchain for stablecoin activity, driven by its inherent speed and low costs. The rapid growth of Solana USDC is a powerful testament to the network’s increasing adoption, the health of its ecosystem, and the growing demand for efficient stablecoin transactions. While challenges remain, this milestone underscores the bright future potentially ahead for Solana stablecoins and the entire Solana network .

Gora Network isn’t your average oracle. While most oracles offer one-size-fits-all price feeds, Gora delivers something different: App-Specific Oracles (ASOs) . These oracles are custom-built for individual applications, pulling exactly the data a dApp needs - no fluff, no noise. From real-time weather for insurance claims to AI-generated credit scores for DeFi lending, Gora lets developers tailor data sources, update timing, and even apply off-chain computation. Think of it as building your own oracle from scratch - without the centralization. The result? Faster, smarter, more reliable data fueling everything from DeFi to gaming to traditional finance integrations. AI + Oracles = Web3 Intelligence Gora adds another layer of spice with its AI execution layer . Developers can build oracles that don’t just deliver data - they analyze it, model it, and make decisions based on it. That means: Smarter DeFi protocols that auto-adjust lending terms On-chain risk engines that predict market volatility NFT platforms that assign real-time value based on demand It’s the future of automated Web3 intelligence - and Gora is building the data rails to power it. Under the Hood Gora uses a hybrid consensus mechanism: VRF-based node selection to prevent manipulation Stake-weighted voting to finalize results Its SDK is already live on Algorand, with Ethereum support rolling out. The platform can handle millions of data requests per hour and is optimized for speed, security, and developer control. Why Gora Matters Web3 apps are getting more complex. They need better data. Gora is answering that call by: Giving dApps full control over the data they use Bringing AI directly into oracle logic Offering multichain support (Algorand, Ethereum, Starknet) Powering real-world use cases like lending, identity, and insurance And with the $GORA token , developers and validators can stake, govern, and pay for services across chains. What’s Next? Gora isn’t slowing down: Launching AI plug-ins to make every oracle smarter Expanding to more chains Integrating with fintechs via Secure Verify APIs Scaling the validator network and DAO structure And with its recent RociFi merger , Gora now supports on-chain credit scoring, adding even more firepower to its DeFi stack. Fun Fact Before they were building oracle infrastructure, the Gora team built a tradition: daily team dinners with geopolitical debates . Smart contracts and smart conversation? That’s spicy. From flexible oracles to real-time AI automation, Gora Network is setting a new standard for Web3 data.

43823540,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153103,1745657414,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $380M+ Boost, Signalling Robust Demand",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-spot-bitcoin-etf/,"Are you keeping an eye on the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? Recent data reveals a significant surge in demand for Bitcoin among traditional investors, primarily channelled through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Specifically, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have been experiencing a remarkable run of positive inflows, indicating growing confidence and potentially driving future price action. Why Are Bitcoin ETF Inflows Making Headlines? Understanding Bitcoin ETF inflows is crucial for anyone tracking the digital asset space. These inflows represent fresh capital entering the Bitcoin ecosystem via regulated investment products, often signalling increased interest from both retail and, more significantly, institutional investors. When ETFs see net inflows, it means more shares are being created and bought than redeemed and sold, leading the ETF issuer to buy actual Bitcoin on the open market to back those shares. This direct buying pressure can influence Bitcoin’s price. On April 25th, this trend was particularly strong. According to data shared by Trader T on X, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined net inflow of a staggering $380.06 million. This wasn’t an isolated event; it marked the sixth consecutive trading day where these funds saw more money come in than go out. This consistent positive flow is a key indicator of shifting market sentiment. Breaking Down the April 25th Inflow Data Let’s look at which specific funds contributed to this impressive daily total. The inflows weren’t evenly distributed, with some funds leading the pack: BlackRock’s IBIT: Leading the charge with a massive $240.21 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s fund has consistently been a top performer in attracting capital since its launch. Fidelity’s FBTC: Another strong contender, adding $108.04 million in net inflows on the same day. Fidelity’s offering has also proven popular among investors. Grayscale’s Mini BTC (BTC): Saw $19.87 million in net inflows. This newer, lower-fee version of Grayscale’s offering appears to be attracting some capital. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Contributed $11.39 million to the total net inflow. VanEck’s HODL: Added $8.08 million in net inflows. While most funds saw positive movement, one notable exception was Grayscale’s original fund, GBTC, which experienced a net outflow of $7.53 million on April 25th. The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day. What Does BlackRock IBIT’s Performance Tell Us? The performance of funds like BlackRock IBIT is particularly noteworthy. As one of the largest asset managers globally, BlackRock’s successful foray into the spot Bitcoin ETF market is a powerful signal of mainstream acceptance. The consistent, large-scale inflows into IBIT suggest significant investor appetite, likely including institutional players who are more comfortable accessing Bitcoin exposure through familiar, regulated investment vehicles offered by trusted names. The contrast between GBTC’s outflows and the inflows into newer funds like IBIT and FBTC highlights a trend: investors are moving capital from the older, higher-fee GBTC structure towards the newer, more competitive spot ETF products. This ‘migration’ is a natural part of the market evolving with new options becoming available. The Bigger Picture: Institutional Bitcoin Adoption and Crypto Market Trends The consistent positive flows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially the significant contributions from giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, underscore a broader narrative: increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption . Institutions like wealth managers, hedge funds, and potentially even corporate treasuries are now able to gain exposure to Bitcoin more easily and within their existing compliance frameworks through these ETFs. This influx of institutional capital is often seen as a maturation of the Bitcoin market, providing deeper liquidity and potentially reducing volatility in the long run. Monitoring these ETF flow numbers provides valuable insight into current crypto market trends . They act as a proxy for demand from a segment of the market that was previously hesitant or unable to invest directly in Bitcoin. Sustained positive inflows can be interpreted as a bullish signal, reflecting strong underlying demand despite potential short-term price fluctuations. Conversely, periods of significant outflows might suggest cooling sentiment or risk-off behaviour among ETF investors. Are There Any Challenges or Risks? While the inflows are positive, it’s important to remember that the crypto market remains volatile. ETF flows can change direction quickly based on macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, or shifts in investor sentiment. Furthermore, the performance of Bitcoin ETFs is directly tied to the price performance of Bitcoin itself, which is known for its significant price swings. Investors should consider their risk tolerance before investing in these products. Actionable Insights for Tracking Bitcoin ETFs For those interested in following this trend, here are a few actionable insights: Monitor Daily Flow Data: Resources like the one cited (Trader T on X, or financial news sites covering ETFs) provide daily updates on net inflows/outflows for individual funds and the aggregate. Watch Key Players: Pay close attention to the flows into the largest funds like IBIT and FBTC, as their movements often have the biggest impact on the overall market. Understand the Context: Don’t just look at the numbers; consider what else is happening in the broader financial markets and the crypto space. Are there regulatory updates? Major economic reports? These can influence investor behaviour. Consider the ‘Migration’: Remember that some GBTC outflows are likely moving into newer, lower-cost ETFs, which isn’t necessarily bearish for the overall market, but rather a reshuffling within the ETF landscape. Compelling Summary The $380.06 million in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on April 25th is a significant data point, highlighting robust demand and marking the sixth consecutive day of positive flows. This trend, led by strong performance from funds like BlackRock IBIT and Fidelity FBTC, underscores the increasing comfort and participation of traditional investors in the Bitcoin market. These sustained Bitcoin ETF inflows are a powerful indicator of growing institutional Bitcoin adoption and provide valuable insight into current crypto market trends . While volatility remains a factor, the consistent flow of capital into these regulated products suggests a maturing market and continued investor interest in gaining exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency.

Network hashrate hit record highs, with 1 ZH/s expected by July 2025 milestone. Miners pivot to AI and HPC as hash prices decline and hardware cycles intensify. Bitcoin miners are finding it much more expensive to operate lately, even though the network itself is stronger than ever. The latest Coinshares report really highlights this problem where it found that the average cash cost for big, publicly listed miners to produce one Bitcoin jumped dramatically to over $82,000 in the last quarter of 2024; that’s up from about $56,000 the previous quarter. And when you add in other costs like paying off equipment, the total average cost soared to around $137,000 per Bitcoin. Now, miners did manage to stay profitable during that time, but only because Bitcoin’s market price happened to be high, averaging around $82,000. This helped cover the high costs for a while.

The city formally announced that it had closed its crypto mining plans following a heavy protest by the public. According to reports, a private company in Arkansas had started plans to set up several powerful servers to mine digital assets like Bitcoin. However, residents did not take it too well as most of them cited several reasons, including inconveniences largely due to the continuous noise produced by the cooling equipment. There were also complaints about the great energy usage that would shift the burden on nearby utilities. The report mentioned that the plan was shelved after the noticeable rising tensions between crypto firms and the local population. The decision drums the need for a general conversation on the social, economic, and environmental effects of large-scale digital asset mining projects. Arkansas natives worry about the effects of mining plans According to reports , the natives were more concerned about the potential effects of the plan, showing their displeasure in several demonstrations. Most of them cited reasons like a rise in electricity costs, and environmental damage, with others noting that the disturbance could affect the quality of their life. During the town hall meetings held in Arkansas, residents frowned at how the project was being run. While the crypto mining project promised financial gains to the locals, activities, residents and activists mentioned that it lacked transparency and ignored the welfare of the community. The growing worries caught the attention of Arkansas city officials who carried out several public hearings and consultations on the issue. The project was thus halted after the city council imposed a moratorium on crypto-mining activities inside the city boundaries. According to Arkansas city officials, the need for financial benefits pales in comparison to their obligation to give the people long-term interests. “We’re not anti-technology; but, we must make sure any new development complements our infrastructure capacity and community values,” a city official said. Reports note that several small towns and localities in the United States have started showing their objection toward mining activities, especially in rural areas where land is expensive and zoning rules are technical. Environmental concerns derail crypto mining projects According to several sources, residents in states like Texas, Georgia, and now Arkansas, are asking lawmakers to initiate tougher rules and environmental impact analysis before mining activities can be permitted in the areas. This is particularly due to the heavy energy consumption and no use pollution. Environmental activists and advocacy groups have also been speaking up to this effect, urging legislators to apply national guidelines for crypto mining operations. Meanwhile, this latest development shows how difficult it has been for cryptocurrencies, especially the ones reliant on mining. While most of the assets in the mining category like Bitcoin are beneficial financially, the sector has been derailed by several concerns of unsustainable methods. In this regard, some companies have started to move towards greener substitutes, investigating less energy-intensive consensus procedures or using renewable energy sources. However, unless the sector changes quickly, local populations across the country will continue to grow more hostile towards their activities. The choice of the city of Arkansas also shows that crypto mining companies can no longer use financial incentives as a way to sway users to forget the environmental impact of their activities. Companies also need to be transparent and involve the community about their activities to ensure that residents are aware of the effects of their actions.

That’s what’s happening now with MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . Paired in headlines with major names like Solana , this new contender is quickly becoming a must-watch. While 55,000% may sound sensational, insiders know that kind of surge doesn’t come from luck—it comes from timing, narrative, and movement. And MAGACOINFINANCE is firing on all three. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Pacing Itself Like a Project That Knows Where It’s Going From the start, this token hasn’t followed the script of typical low-cap launches. MAGACOINFINANCE is executing with a clarity that’s hard to ignore—its roadmap is active, its community is multiplying, and the sentiment around it is shifting from “interesting” to “essential.” Unlike short-lived hype coins, this project is drawing real traction from early analysts. Wallet engagement is increasing, social discussions are turning bullish, and its early structure suggests long-term vision, not just a temporary pump. Now paired in headlines with Solana , it’s quickly moving into a different league. Other Movers on the Map: XRP, Chainlink, Kaspa, and Polkadot XRP continues to find strength in the institutional world. With legal clarity now part of its story, it’s back in focus as a high-utility digital asset with global reach. Chainlink is maintaining its essential role in blockchain data infrastructure. Its oracles power everything from trading protocols to insurance models, making it foundational to Web3 functionality. Kaspa is attracting attention with a unique consensus model and high transaction throughput. It’s carving out its place among newer-gen proof-of-work assets. Polkadot stands firm on its mission of blockchain interoperability. With parachains connecting disparate ecosystems, it remains a favorite among developers looking to bridge chains. All strong assets—but unlike them, MAGACOINFINANCE still has room to surprise. Final Word Talk of 55,000% gains is big—but in crypto, big shifts come from early signals. Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is flashing those signals, and analysts are taking it seriously. Solana continues to dominate headlines. But if there’s one rising name you don’t want to miss, it’s the one that’s just starting to move—and that’s MAGACOINFINANCE .

BTC Bull Token brings together Bitcoin enthusiasm and meme culture, rewarding early investors with Bitcoin through milestone airdrops — already amassing over $5 million in funding. At the same time, Solaxy, priced at $0.001704, is making headlines as the first Solana Layer 2 solution, tackling major blockchain congestion issues and boosting scalability, backed by $31.5 million raised so far. Both projects offer strong early potential, but Pepeto is stepping up with even greater promise for long-term investors.

Currently available for just $0.000000124, Pepeto presents a rare low-entry chance ahead of its exchange debut. Pepeto sets itself apart with a strong backstory and a full ecosystem in the making.

In a new interview with the host of the Forward Guidance YouTube channel, Felix Jauvin, Hayes says governments around the world will likely have to print money to offset the impacts of the trade war, which has ignited massive Bitcoin rallies in the past. “China’s not alone. It’s every major economy needs to print a bunch of money to basically cushion the effects of this attempted divorce, this decline in globalization. But at the end of the day, yeah, they’re going to print money – Bitcoin benefits. Now the reciprocal of the current account deficit in the US is our financial account surplus. And so all these dollars that got earned, the trillions of dollars that got earned selling stuff to America, got recycled into Treasury bonds and stocks and Mag 7, all the big US tech stocks. So mathematically, if [US President Donald] Trump is serious about reducing the current account to zero, then foreigners have to sell stocks – period. It’s just math. And then the question is, okay, well, can the US government survive financially if there’s a big decline in capital gains taxes because the market’s not going up? I don’t think so. Therefore, we get a printing money function and Bitcoin benefits. It finally decouples from tech because of the structural flows and what needs to happen from an affordability standpoint for the US government.” While some in the crypto space suggest the market turmoil may prompt central banks to start accumulating Bitcoin to diversify their asset holdings, Hayes believes central banks will continue to turn to gold as a hedge, not the flagship crypto asset. “I actually don’t think that they’re mentally prepared for that sort of leap. They understand gold. They’ve been trained in gold. They’ve read history books about gold.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,832 at time of writing, up 1.2% in the last 24 hours.

Peter Schiff’s sudden interest in owning Bitcoin may be one of the most bullish portents of this market cycle so far. He has worked hard to stoke a reputation for hating Bitcoin. Searching his X timeline for posts mentioning the cryptocurrency, it is replete with hundreds of posts. All of them are fiercely critical. But not his latest post soliciting BTC donations. The FOMO Is Strong With This Market Cycle Just last week, Peter Schiff said Bitcoin is a “fraud” and Strategy founder Michael Saylor will likely go “bankrupt” hoovering it up. Saylor has been on a warpath to acquire Bitcoin. He’s even been issuing stock-convertible corporate bonds for the cash to buy more. As a result, his stock has 10X’d on the Nasdaq in the past 24 months. Schiff sounded like Saylor himself when he followed up in the reply thread on his post Wednesday to say he is “never selling” the BTC in his individual “Bitcoin reserve.” I’m not making any money. I’m never selling what’s in that reserve. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) April 24, 2025 One of the top replies on Schiff’s post asked him if he would use the BTC to fund more of his wife’s music videos. He repeated that he’ll never sell his BTC. Peter Schiff’s wife’s music video dropped last September. Her band name, Laughing Cats, sounds like a meme coin.

BTC Bull Token taps into Bitcoin’s growing appeal by combining it with meme culture, offering milestone-based Bitcoin airdrops — already raising over $5 million in the process. On the other hand, Solaxy, priced at $0.001704 , is setting a new standard as the first Solana-focused Layer 2 solution , aimed at easing congestion and improving scalability, backed by a strong $31.5 million in early-stage investment.

Which one will emerge as the leader in the next bull run? ChatGPT provides an unexpected viewpoint that could shift current perceptions. These insights might just redefine what to expect from both projects. You might also like: XYZVerse: Could this sports memecoin replicate Dogecoin’s early success? XYZ achieves G.O.A.T. status, early investors set for huge returns XYZVerse (XYZ) introduces a unique twist to the memecoin landscape, blending the thrill of sports fandom with the dynamic energy of cryptocurrency. Designed specifically for passionate fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, XYZ isn’t just another meme token — it represents a vibrant community united by a love for sports and crypto. Driven by a bold “Greatest of All Time” (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is pushing beyond typical meme coins, recently earning recognition as the Best New Meme Project. What makes XYZ truly special? Its sustainable growth strategy. With a clear roadmap and a dedicated, engaged community, XYZ is positioned for long-term success. Powered by sports-inspired enthusiasm, XYZ is emerging as a top contender in the crypto arena. It aims to become a coveted symbol of pride among sports and crypto enthusiasts alike. XYZ: A strong start before market listing The XYZ token presale is currently active, offering exclusive early-bird pricing before its market debut: Launch Price: $0.0001 Current Price: $0.003333 Next Stage Price: $0.005 Final Presale Price: $0.02 After the presale concludes, XYZ tokens will debut on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, targeting an initial listing price of $0.10. If successful, early investors could realize returns of up to 1,000x their initial investment. The project has already attracted over $10 million in investments, demonstrating strong investor confidence. Purchasing tokens during the presale at lower prices positions investors for potentially significant profits. Demand for XYZ is rapidly accelerating, with presale stages filling quickly. Early adopters secure the lowest prices, maximizing potential returns. Sui Sui (SUI) has seen a significant price increase recently. Over the past week, its price jumped by 45.18%, reaching a range between $1.97 and $2.30. In the past month, the price rose by 24.37%. Looking back six months, SUI’s price surged by 70.31%. These numbers show strong momentum and growing interest in the coin. Technical indicators suggest potential for further growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 55.95, indicating that SUI is neither overbought nor oversold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is positive at 0.054, hinting at an upward trend. However, the 10-day simple moving average is $2.99, and the 100-day average is $2.49, both above the current price. This suggests that SUI may face resistance as it moves higher. The nearest resistance level is $2.49. Breaking through this could lead SUI to the second resistance at $2.82, representing potential gains of about 8% and 22% from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is at $1.83, with a second support at $1.50. Drops to these levels would mean declines of around 8% and 24%. Based on recent data, SUI has potential for continued growth if it can overcome these resistance levels. Sei Sei (SEI) has seen notable price movements recently. In the past week, the price increased by 13.97%, showing short-term bullishness. However, over the past month, the coin declined by 5.22%, and over six months, it dropped significantly by 48.51%. Currently, the price hovers between $0.16 and $0.19. Technical indicators offer a mixed outlook. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.19, slightly above the current price range, suggesting some downward pressure. The 100-day SMA is at $0.18, close to the current price, indicating consolidation. The Relative Strength Index is 50.22, which is neutral, while the MACD is slightly negative at -0.0002, showing minimal bearish momentum. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is $0.20. If the price breaks above this, it could target the second resistance at $0.22, an increase of about 15%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.15. Falling below this could lead to testing the second support at $0.12, a decline of around 25%. The coin’s next move hinges on how it interacts with these key levels. Conclusion Although SUI and SEI are strong contenders, XYZVerse stands out by uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem, aiming for remarkable growth and becoming a cultural icon.

MUTM Stands Out Below the $0.03 Mark,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/most-underrated-cryptos-today-mutm-stands-out-below-the-0-03-mark/,"In a year where many digital assets have struggled to maintain momentum, a select few cryptocurrencies are quietly gaining traction—and smart investors are paying attention. While big names continue to dominate headlines, some lower-priced projects are showing stronger fundamentals and community growth than many realize. Among them, three stand out for their long-term appeal. Yet only one remains priced under $0.03, giving it a clear edge in terms of affordability and upside potential: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Cardano (ADA) Cardano remains a steady presence in the blockchain world, backed by its focus on academically reviewed progress and research-driven development. The project has been steadily rolling out new functionality, focusing on real-world use cases like identity, governance, and education—particularly in developing economies. Though the price has cooled since its 2021 highs, network activity and developer engagement remain strong, suggesting ADA may be undervalued relative to the value being built. For long-term crypto investment, ADA still holds weight among analysts looking for steady builders. Solana (SOL) Solana, once regarded as Ethereum’s most serious challenger, has recently seen renewed interest. Despite earlier technical setbacks, its high-speed architecture and developer-friendly environment continue to attract significant project launches. Network usage is on the rise again, and with recent updates improving scalability, some early supporters have begun reallocating capital. Interestingly, several Solana investors are now exploring Mutuum Finance, drawn by its complementary approach to decentralized finance and lower entry cost. For those wondering what crypto to buy now, Solana’s ongoing relevance and ecosystem growth make it a contender. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While ADA and SOL carry strong reputations and solid fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the outlier that combines fresh DeFi utility with one of the lowest current entry points on the market. The token is still in its presale phase and has already raised more than $7 million, with over 420 million tokens sold and nearly 9,000 unique wallets participating. Unlike inflated meme coins, MUTM is attached to a purpose-built protocol designed to make decentralized lending, borrowing, and passive earning both accessible and flexible. What sets Mutuum apart is how it’s built for utility from day one. At its core, the platform features a built-in stablecoin backed by on-chain collateral. This stablecoin doesn’t rely on external pegs or centralized custodians, which increases both transparency and reliability. It allows users to unlock liquidity without exiting long-term positions—a key advantage for those managing portfolio exposure across multiple assets. The protocol is also built around a smart revenue distribution system. Instead of issuing more tokens or relying on emissions to reward early users, Mutuum allocates a portion of its income to purchase MUTM from the open market. These tokens are then distributed to users based on their participation, especially those who hold or interact with mtTokens (the deposit representation token). Several early SOL investors—known for prioritizing utility over hype—have already joined the MUTM presale. They recognize that the value here isn’t just in speculative price movement, but in the actual mechanics of how value circulates through the ecosystem. At $0.025, the current MUTM price offers one of the most attractive opportunities in the space. With the upcoming presale phase bringing a price increase to $0.03, time to enter at the current rate is running out. The full presale spans 11 phases, meaning the earlier the entry, the higher the potential ROI. As each phase closes, price increases are locked in. MUTM isn’t just trending—it’s structuring its launch to reward early belief. From the upcoming beta launch of the platform to a $100K giveaway designed to incentivize long-term holders, the protocol is already laying the groundwork for user retention and ecosystem expansion. This kind of preparation is rare among presale crypto projects, and it’s one reason analysts believe a strong breakout is likely as soon as trading goes live. While Cardano and Solana continue to build with long-term visions, Mutuum Finance offers something they don’t: an entry price under three cents and a full DeFi infrastructure still gearing up for public release. For anyone looking to add one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now to their portfolio, MUTM stands out not just as undervalued—but as one of the most strategically positioned tokens heading into mid-2025.

The price has now risen nearly 15% over the past two weeks, reversing a previous correction phase and pushing BTC closer to retesting the $100,000 price mark. Amid the price performance, recent market analysis points to diverging signals between BTC’s funding rate behavior and growing confidence among US-based investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Back In ‘Full Force’ For The Rally, Glassnode Reveals Bitcoin Funding Rates Drop Despite Rising Prices According to Nino, an analyst from CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin funding rate—typically used to gauge sentiment in the perpetual futures BTC market has again dipped into negative territory, even as whale accumulation continues on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Nino particularly identified a notable development in Bitcoin’s derivatives market. The 72-hour average of BTC funding rates, including moving average indicators (MA, EMA, WMA), has entered negative territory for the fourth time this year. Funding rates refer to periodic payments made between long and short positions on perpetual futures contracts, with negative rates meaning short positions are paying long positions. This generally reflects that the market is either positioning defensively or becoming cautious at current price levels. What makes this instance notable is that previous dips into negative funding rates occurred at lower price levels, whereas the current shift has taken place above $94,000. Nino suggests this may point to potential market exhaustion or a phase of profit-taking, where short traders are more active despite upward price movement. If volatility increases and funding rates remain suppressed, a spike in liquidations could follow, especially if open interest in leveraged positions expands rapidly. Coinbase Premium and Whale Behavior Reflect US Investor Activity In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan noted a trend reversal beginning around April 21, accompanied by renewed buying from large holders, or “whales.” Notably, these purchases were first identified on Binance and were soon followed by similar activity on Coinbase. According to Dan, this pattern may indicate rising confidence among US-based investors and growing participation from institutions or high-net-worth individuals. One supporting metric is the Coinbase premium, which tracks the price difference between BTC on Coinbase and other global exchanges. A positive premium typically reflects stronger demand from US investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Metrics on Binance Show Shift That Could Precede Market Squeeze As of now, this premium remains in positive territory, suggesting that US market participants are contributing to BTC’s recent momentum. Dan concludes that the current phase may signal more than a typical price rebound and could represent a broader shift in market structure, driven by renewed capital inflows and institutional positioning.

The analyst shared the analysis in a tweet posted on April 24, 2025, accompanied by a detailed TradingView chart. EGRAG’s model draws heavily on Elliott Wave Theory, identifying the present cycle as a possible mirror of XRP’s 2017 bull market behavior. #XRP – $27 Then $120 : I'm becoming increasingly convinced that we're mirroring the 2017 cycle, but the timing may be either delayed or accelerated. As we approach the end of Wave 3 this summer (double digits), I believe Wave 4 will unfold over the next three years, followed… pic.twitter.com/BrjqdZrnqb — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 24, 2025 Double-Digit Price Target Expected by Summer 2025 In the tweet, EGRAG stated that he is “becoming increasingly convinced” that XRP is tracking a similar path to its historical 2017 performance. However, he acknowledged the timing could be delayed or accelerated compared to the earlier cycle. Central to the chart and commentary is the claim that XRP is approaching the completion of its third wave in the Elliott Wave sequence, which he anticipates will reach double-digit prices by the summer of 2025. The chart illustrates this third wave potentially peaking near the $13 to $20 range. Following this, EGRAG expects a corrective fourth wave to unfold over three years, marking a broad consolidation phase, possibly revisiting levels between $3.40 and $5.50. This extended correction is consistent with typical Wave 4 behavior in Elliott Wave theory, as annotated in the lower-right corner of the image. EGRAG outlines standard Fibonacci retracement levels and expected proportions for Waves 2 through 5. Fifth Wave Forecast Projects $120 Long-Term High EGRAG’s model ultimately forecasts a dramatic fifth wave rise, culminating in a potential XRP valuation of $120. This projection marks a significant long-term bullish stance, implying a roughly 56x increase from current price levels, which hover slightly above $2.10 according to the chart data. The fifth wave structure uses technical ratios typically associated with final wave extensions in bullish Elliott Wave formations. Notably, EGRAG’s chart also highlights a “Measured Move” completed earlier in the cycle, along with visual reinforcements of breakout levels, structural trendlines, and color-coded resistance and support zones The chart suggests that XRP has already broken through a long-term descending wedge formation that began in 2018 and is now embarking on a potentially explosive upward trajectory. This breakout is marked in the chart as a confirmation that Wave 1 and Wave 2 have already completed, providing the foundation for the current bullish wave structure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Encouragement and Strategic Patience The tweet also includes a reference to community solidarity, encouraging the XRP community to “stay steady and strong” and asserting, “Together We Rise.” This message, paired with the highly optimistic price targets, appears to reinforce confidence among long-term holders during what the analyst expects to be a volatile but upward-trending market cycle. While the chart relies on historical analogs and technical theory, EGRAG clarifies that the analysis is not financial advice and encourages readers to conduct their own research. Nonetheless, the confidence behind the $27 and $120 price targets underscores the analyst’s belief that XRP may be entering a highly transformative market phase, with implications extending into the 2030s.

The report is the first six-month risk survey since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. The report reveals a sharp increase in concerns among market participants, with 73% of respondents citing global trade risks as their primary concern, more than double the figure reported in the previous survey conducted last November. Policy uncertainty also ranks high among financial fears, with half of respondents citing uncertain or changing economic policies as their main concern, reflecting growing concern about potential regulatory and fiscal changes under the new administration. This represents a significant increase from the same period last year. Related News: Bloomberg Analyst Mike McGlone Warns About Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies The Fed’s report also highlights growing concerns about recent market volatility. Concerns about the functioning of the U.S. Treasury market were voiced by 27% of respondents, up from 17% in the previous survey. Analysts say liquidity pressures and changing investor behavior are contributing to instability in one of the world’s most critical financial markets.

There’s been a wave of chaos! Crypto and Wall Street are colliding harder than ever. From Tether-backed Bitcoin giants making their public debut to Solana suddenly becoming a corporate obsession, billion-dollar moves are happening at full speed. Companies are changing strategies. New power players are stepping in. Old rules are getting rewritten. We’re about to break down the biggest shifts you need to know – and trust me, some of them are game-changing! Let’s dive in. #1 Bitcoin Treasuries Are Booming Move over, Michael Saylor – there’s a new player in town. Actually, make that several. Twenty One Capital is set to shake up the Bitcoin treasury game, powered by a heavyweight squad: Tether, Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, and SoftBank . The soon-to-be-public company will merge with Cantor Equity Partners (currently trading under CEP) and rebrand as XXI. It’s already penciled in to own at least 42,000 Bitcoin – worth roughly $3.9 billion – making it the third-largest Bitcoin holder behind MicroStrategy and MARA Holdings. What makes XXI different? CEO Jack Mallers isn’t playing the traditional ETF game. Instead, he’s laser-focused on two metrics: Bitcoin per share (BPS) and Bitcoin return rate (BRR). In his words: “We want our shareholders to get wealthier, get richer in Bitcoin terms.” #2 Upexi Bets Big on Solana In one of the week’s most surprising moonshots, Upexi (Nasdaq: UPXI) announced a plan to create a $100M Solana treasury , and the market responded fast. Shares skyrocketed by a staggering 335% after the news broke.The company plans to pour roughly $90M into accumulating and staking Solana (SOL), adopting a “long-only” strategy. It’s a bold pivot for Upexi, better known for selling paraxanthine-based energy supplements and mushroom products. But clearly, when it comes to Solana, bullish bets are back in style. #3 US Federal Reserve Eases Crypto Regulations Big news from the US Federal Reserve this week : they’ve officially rolled back two key supervisory guidelines that had been holding back banks from diving into crypto and stablecoins. Gone are the days when banks had to get approval before engaging in crypto-asset activities – now, they can move forward without prior notice. The Fed’s decision reflects its evolving approach to innovation and risks in the banking world. This shift aligns with the Trump administration’s more crypto-friendly stance, with efforts to simplify regulations and support digital assets. From creating a national Bitcoin reserve to backing crypto-friendly SEC policies, the message is clear: the US is warming up to the future of crypto. With these changes, we’re seeing the groundwork being laid for a more open, crypto-friendly banking system in the US. Could this be a turning point for digital assets? Time will tell! #4 Semler Scientific Doubles Down on Bitcoin If you thought the corporate Bitcoin fever was cooling, Semler Scientific just proved otherwise. The firm bumped its Bitcoin holdings to $314 million, and Chairman Eric Semler made it clear at Bitwise’s Investor Day: “You can sell or stop if you don’t like what we’ve done with Bitcoin.” Investors, clearly, have no plans to stop. Semler’s stock was up 7% by the day’s close. #5 Bitcoin ETFs Break Records as Trump Jumps In It wasn’t just treasury companies racking up headlines this week. Bitcoin ETFs pulled in a jaw-dropping $936M in a single day – marking only the fourth time ever that inflows crossed $900 million. Institutional money is flowing back in, driven by inflation fears, interest rate speculation, and a dash of global uncertainty. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s Truth.Fi announced plans for a suite of crypto-focused ETFs in collaboration with Crypto.com, slapping a “Made in America” label on them. #6 SEC Chairman Atkins Signals Crypto Regulatory Shift In his first week as SEC Chairman, Paul Atkins made a bold statement on the future of crypto regulation. Speaking at the SEC’s Crypto Task Force roundtable , Atkins criticized the previous administration’s “enforcement-first” approach and promised to tackle the ongoing issues around digital assets and blockchain. He emphasized the need for clear, pro-innovation rules that will help crypto grow in the U.S. instead of being pushed abroad. The roundtable also focused on one major challenge: securing digital assets. Industry leaders, including Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca , stressed that the current custody rules don’t fit well with the crypto world’s decentralized nature. Panelists agreed that the rules need to be more flexible, with a principles-based approach to custody regulation. As technology evolves, so must the rules. What a breath of fresh air, amirite? #5 Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade Is Finally Here Circle May 7, 2025 on your calendar. That’s when Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade will go live at epoch 364032. The update promises serious improvements in validator efficiency, security, and transaction capabilities. It’s a crucial move for Ethereum as it continues its slow march toward scaling solutions and greater decentralization. Stakers and developers alike are watching closely – and market reaction could be swift. #6 Oregon vs Coinbase Coinbase just got hit with a fresh legal headache – it just doesn’t stop, does it? The State of Oregon is suing Coinbase , ignoring the XRP-friendly ruling that many thought would set the tone for crypto regulation nationwide. Allegations? Securities violations. Here’s what that means: more legal clouds over the biggest US-based crypto exchange, even as the market rallies. #7 Global Payments, Stripe, and the Rise of Fintech Giants While crypto continues to dominate headlines, traditional finance isn’t sitting on the sidelines. Global Payments is set to acquire Worldpay for $24.25 billion, while spinning off its Issuer Solutions business to FIS. Stripe is quietly working on a stablecoin product, built on top of tech from its $1.1 billion Bridge acquisition. The world’s largest payments companies are gearing up for a crypto-infused future – and they’re willing to spend billions to get there. #8 XRP Futures: CME Jumps Into the Pool CME Group is gearing up to launch XRP futures contracts on May 19, 2025 . The new product will offer both micro contracts (2,500 XRP) and larger, full-size contracts (50,000 XRP), allowing traders more flexibility in their exposure to XRP. While Coinbase and Kraken have already launched their own XRP futures products, CME’s entry into the market is likely to have a significant impact. If history is any guide, CME’s foray into XRP futures could mirror its 2017 move with Bitcoin futures. When CME launched Bitcoin futures, it quickly captured the lion’s share of the market, outpacing the early competition from Cboe. Now, with more than $3.9 billion in XRP open interest on the table, CME’s established infrastructure, brand trust, and deep liquidity could give it the edge once again, despite the head start that other exchanges have had. But that’s not all. The first-ever XRP spot ETF, listed under ticker XRPH11, began trading on Brazil’s B3 exchange on April 25. Managed by Hashdex and tracking the Nasdaq XRP Reference Price Index, this ETF aims to give investors easy access to XRP exposure. With both CME futures and a new ETF hitting the market, XRP is entering a new phase of institutional interest and broader investor accessibility. #9 Bitcoin Outranks Google by Market Cap Hold onto your seats. In one of the week’s most mind-blowing milestones, Bitcoin officially surpassed Google (Alphabet Inc.) in market capitalization, cementing its place as the 5th most valuable asset in the world. This marks a significant moment for the cryptocurrency, which now stands behind only gold, Microsoft, Apple, and Saudi Aramco in terms of global market value. As of this week, Bitcoin’s market cap hit a staggering $570 billion, edging out Google’s $560 billion. What a bold statement about how far the digital asset has come! Despite the rollercoaster volatility and ongoing regulatory drama, Bitcoin is clearly commanding attention and respect in the financial world. What’s driving this surge? Institutional investors are starting to see Bitcoin less as a speculative gamble and more as a serious, long-term store of value – much like gold. If Bitcoin keeps this pace, we could soon see it challenging the likes of Apple and Microsoft for a top spot. But that’s a debate for another day. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! WazirX’s relaunch in the works? After months of regulatory uncertainty, Indian crypto exchange WazirX is preparing to restart its trading platform . The company is awaiting a final decision from Singapore’s High Court on its restructuring plan and customer payout process, which could pave the way for a full relaunch within the next 10 days. The exchange hopes to regain its footing in the competitive Indian crypto market, where it had previously been one of the largest players before facing legal challenges. Tether buys more Juventus Tether has increased its stake in Juventus FC , one of Italy’s biggest football clubs, to over 10%. While some have questioned the company’s increasing investments in sports, Tether sees it as a strategic way to diversify its holdings and build connections with global brands and markets. Kuwait cracks down on Bitcoin mining Kuwait has officially banned Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining , citing the significant strain on the country’s power grid. Officials also mentioned concerns over legal violations and the environmental impact of crypto mining operations. The ban is part of a broader crackdown on energy-intensive practices in the country. $Trump Meme Coin Soars After Gala Announcement The price of $Trump , the meme coin linked to President Trump, skyrocketed 70% after he promised a private gala dinner for its top investors . The event, set for May 22 at Trump National Golf Club , offers a VIP experience for the biggest holders. While the coin’s value is still far from its January highs, it’s caught attention with its promise of exclusivity. Trump’s crypto ventures continue to gain momentum, despite some industry skepticism (and a fair bit of criticism). What’s Next for Crypto? Expect an intense few weeks ahead: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade will test the market’s appetite for new staking flows, with potential for major shifts in Ethereum’s ecosystem. Bitcoin ETFs could see even bigger inflows if stablecoin legislation passes, which would push institutional participation even further. Corporate treasury moves (especially into Solana) might accelerate, as companies explore alternative assets to diversify away from Bitcoin. And if Trump’s ETFs start getting traction? Get ready for another breakout retail wave, as more retail investors flock to the space amid growing mainstream attention. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Stay skeptical. And don’t bet against Bitcoin – or Solana, apparently.

The move comes just as Nasdaq urged the SEC to treat certain cryptocurrencies as securities while leaving Bitcoin outside that framework—a shift that could accelerate broader institutional adoption. In a letter dated April 25, Nasdaq proposed a new category called “digital asset investment contracts”—a middle ground for tokens that aren’t quite stocks but still require oversight. JUST IN: @Nasdaq urges the @SECGov to establish clearer regulations for digital assets, stating that accurate classification would enable their integration into traditional markets with appropriate oversight pic.twitter.com/re2xO8Gn00 — Crypto Briefing (@Crypto_Briefing) April 25, 2025 This subtle change could clarify rules for altcoins while reinforcing Bitcoin’s unique status as a non-security reserve asset. With Paul Atkins now chairing the SEC, policy shifts are unfolding quickly. This regulatory differentiation is seen by many as bullish for Bitcoin, creating a safer path for hedge funds, pension plans, and corporate treasuries to participate without fear of regulatory blowback. Semler Buys $10M in Bitcoin, Yield Hits 23.5% Adding to the positive sentiment, Semler Scientific announced a fresh $10 million Bitcoin purchase, bringing its total holdings to over 3,300 BTC, valued near $300 million. The firm now reports a 23.5% YTD Bitcoin yield, fueled by rising BTC prices. Semler raised $125 million in stock and aims to secure $75 million through convertible notes—capital earmarked for Bitcoin accumulation. JUST IN: Public Company Semler Scientific buys another 111 #Bitcoin worth $10 million. pic.twitter.com/jZVyDreqG9 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 25, 2025 The move echoes MicroStrategy’s treasury strategy, signaling a broader trend of corporations using BTC as a hedge and long-term store of value. Key institutional figures: Corporate BTC holdings: ~$71 billion Bitcoin ETFs: Over $110 billion in AUM BTC price average for Semler: ~$90,000 This signals that companies are no longer dipping their toes in crypto—they’re going all in. Legal Heat on NFTs Reinforces Bitcoin’s Position While Bitcoin continues to enjoy regulatory momentum, legacy projects like Nike’s NFT arm RTFKT are facing legal headwinds . A new class-action lawsuit filed in Brooklyn claims Nike misled buyers of its now-defunct crypto collectibles. The suit seeks over $5 million in damages, citing deceptive practices and unclear securities status. Nike sued over closure of crypto business https://t.co/I4VT07klDj — Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) April 25, 2025 Nike shut down RTFKT in late 2024, walking back its Web3 ambitions. The legal pressure only underscores how volatile and legally murky the altcoin and NFT space remains—especially compared to Bitcoin’s now more clearly defined regulatory position. BTC Technicals: Eyes on $96K, but Momentum Slowing Technically, Bitcoin is trading around $94,360, just under key resistance at $94,750–$96,150. Price action shows stalling near the top of a rising channel. MACD momentum is weakening, and traders should watch closely for a break or breakdown. Trade Setup: Buy above: $96,150 Targets: $97,500 and $98,700 Short below: $93,130 Target: $91,720 Stop-loss: Above $94,800 For now, patience is key. This is a textbook “squeeze at resistance” setup. Breakouts could run hot—but only if confirmed with volume and structure. BTC Bull Token Nears $5M Mark as 83% Yield Drives Staking Momentum Investor participation in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to accelerate, with the Ethereum-based project approaching a key funding milestone. As of Friday, the presale has raised over $5million. The token is currently priced at $0.00248, giving prospective buyers a narrow window to enter before the next price adjustment. Yield-Driven Utility Meets Flexible Access What differentiates BTCBULL from typical meme assets is its utility-focused design. The project offers a staking mechanism that delivers a projected 83% annual yield, alongside Bitcoin-based distribution rewards. Importantly, stakers can access their tokens at any time—no fixed lockups or withdrawal delays. Latest Staking Stats: Total Tokens Staked: 1,268,011,229 BTCBULL Annual Yield: 83% APY Unstaking: Anytime access This structure appeals to both passive income seekers and users looking to capitalize on potential token appreciation—without sacrificing liquidity. Presale Snapshot and Market Positioning The presale is entering its final stretch before the token price increases. With less than $754,000 remaining until the next tier, current buyers are securing positions ahead of anticipated upward repricing.

With economic uncertainty, rising demand for tokenized utility, and growing pressure on centralized platforms, there’s a renewed appetite for affordable coins with real upside. But this time, the spotlight isn’t on hype coins—it’s on low-cost assets that bring value to the table. One standout? Qubetics ($TICS). Priced under $1, this project is punching well above its weight class, delivering interoperability and utility for both personal and professional use. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Multi-Chain Interoperability Meets Mass Adoption Most crypto platforms talk about interoperability like it’s a buzzword. Qubetics actually builds it. With its plug-and-play multi-chain toolkit, users can interact with Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and more—without needing to juggle a dozen wallets, bridges, or token swaps. Take a small business in Dallas trying to pay international suppliers in USDC across different chains, or a creator in Toronto minting NFTs across multiple blockchains—Qubetics makes it seamless. No wrapped tokens, no sketchy third-party bridges, just clean multi-chain movement backed by on-chain verification. Qubetics has been onboarding fintech developers across North America through its QubeStack SDK, which now supports Web3 login APIs, cross-chain swaps, and EVM-compatible smart contract builders. It also inked new partnerships with middleware platforms to bring cross-chain payroll, accounting tools, and invoicing to mid-sized businesses. This isn’t theoretical. Qubetics is powering real infrastructure behind small financial firms and blockchain-integrated marketplaces across the U.S. and Canada. Presale & ROI Projections: High Utility, Low Price Entry Point The Qubetics presale is now in its 31st stage. More than 509 million tokens have already been sold to over 25,200 holders, raising over $16.4 million. $TICS is currently priced at $0.1902. What’s the upside? At $1, buyers see 425% ROI. At $5 or $6, that return jumps to 2527% and 3053%. And with analysts projecting a potential price of $10–$15 post-mainnet launch, the token’s long-term ROI could land between 5155% and 7783%. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Qubetics is bridging ecosystems and making crypto more useful across borders, apps, and industries—all for under a buck. 2. Celestia (TIA): Modular Blockchain Powering Custom Chains Celestia isn’t trying to be the next Ethereum—it’s letting people build their own. Its modular blockchain architecture separates execution from consensus, so developers can create lightweight, scalable chains without managing full nodes or bloated infrastructure. Say you're launching a healthcare dApp in San Francisco or a loyalty token program for a retail chain in Montreal. With Celestia, you can build a purpose-driven chain without starting from scratch. Celestia’s latest upgrades include Rollkit, which gives developers flexible rollup deployment, and Blobstream, a data availability layer that supports Ethereum L2s. These tools are already being used by multiple DeFi and NFT projects looking for better speed and scale. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Celestia is turning the modular blockchain vision into something developers can actually use—without breaking the bank. 3. Stellar (XLM): Fast, Cheap, and Built for Cross-Border Finance Stellar has been the underdog of cross-border finance for years. With near-instant transfers, low gas fees, and robust stablecoin integrations, it’s powering payments from NGOs to remittance platforms to fintech startups. Picture a freelancer in El Paso getting paid from a UK-based client or a startup in Vancouver using Stellar for recurring stablecoin payroll. That’s happening now—and it’s faster than using banks or PayPal. Stellar is seeing a surge in USDC flows, with over $300 million in stablecoins circulating on-chain. The network also expanded wallet integrations and enabled asset tokenization for institutional partners, including fintech apps targeting Latin American markets. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Stellar is already working behind the scenes of cross-border payments—and it’s still undervalued. 4. Polkadot (DOT): Scalable Ecosystem for Interconnected Chains Polkadot's real magic is its parachain model. Each chain operates independently while still tapping into shared security and interoperability across the broader Polkadot network. That means different projects—gaming, DeFi, identity—can all talk to each other. Think of it as the interstate highway system for blockchain. Projects from Miami to Montreal are using parachains to build scalable dApps with low fees and built-in network benefits. Polkadot is now testing Elastic Scaling and its upcoming JAM (Join Accumulate Machine) upgrade. These will massively improve transaction throughput while allowing chains to collaborate on compute-intensive tasks. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Polkadot is offering scalable, secure tech—and it’s doing it while still trading under $1. Final Thoughts There’s no shortage of altcoins priced under $1. But most of them don’t do much. Qubetics, Celestia, Stellar, and Polkadot? These are different. They’re driving real adoption in finance, infrastructure, and decentralization—all while staying within reach for the average buyer. Whether you're looking to diversify your bag or start building real-world applications, these are the best cryptos to buy under $1 before they climb out of the discount zone.

Over $16.3 million across 31 stages with more than 509 million tokens sold. 3.Why is Celestia attracting developers? Its modular architecture simplifies blockchain creation and improves scalability. 4.What makes Stellar competitive in global finance? Low fees, instant transfers, and wide stablecoin adoption make it ideal for payments. 5.Is Polkadot really under $1 and still worth it?

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cardano drops 48%, DOGE down 60% as analysts spotlight Remittix as a leading PayFi presale gem ahead of the next bull run. Table of Contents Remittix: An undervalued altcoin tipped for big yields Cardano down 48% from recent highs Is Dogecoin a buy? Buy DOGE, ADA, or RTX? At the time of writing, Cardano is down over 48% from its recent highs, with DOGE crumbling by over 60% from its last year’s high of $0.48. Remittix (RTX), a new PayFi altcoin in presale, has also been picked by top analysts as one of the undervalued cryptos to pile into before the market enters the next leg up. Let’s find out why. You might also like: XRP price could fall below $1.50 in April, investors turn to hyped crypto Remittix Remittix: An undervalued altcoin tipped for big yields Remittix is a game-changing crypto-to-fiat payment protocol set to disrupt the highly valuable cross-border settlements and remittances sector with an innovative PayFi solution. This Ethereum-based dApp aims to make cross-border settlements faster, cheaper, and seamless by connecting cryptocurrencies to local banking apps across the world. By merging the speed of crypto with the convenience of everyday payment systems, Remittix eliminates the delays, high costs, and long processing times that stifle traditional cross-border banking procedures. For a flat fee, users will be able to send payments in 50+ crypto pairs and over 30 fiat currencies just by connecting their wallet to the Remittix dApp. Long story short, Remittix provides a favorable solution for retail crypto holders and small businesses to transact seamlessly across borders. At the current price of $0.0757, RTX looks highly undervalued, given its unique value proposition and growth potential in the $750 billion cross-border settlements economy. Disrupting this market will catapult RTX to a multibillion-dollar crypto asset, returning gigantic yields to early adopters. Cardano down 48% from recent highs Many investors missed the 4x Cardano (ADA) trade when the ADA price rocketed from lows of $0.4, rising to hit a new high above $1.3 in Q4 last year. Missed that jump? Don’t panic, because ADA looks undervalued again thanks to a protracted five-month correction. The prolonged market slump pushed Cardano back to the $0.6 zone. At current rates, the asset price is nearly 50% down from its recent highs, presenting another buy-low opportunity. With CoinCodex’s Cardano price prediction showing that ADA could return to the $1.3 zone this year, piling into ADA at the dip might be a smart decision. Is Dogecoin a buy? It was just in December last year when Dogecoin (DOGE) reached a new high in the $0.48 region, pushing the DOGE market cap past $50 billion. However, a five-month correction pushed DOGE down to earth, tossing it to the $0.13 zone in its recent crash. DOGE has now been consolidating in the $0.13-$0.18 zone for nearly two months, and analysts believe it might rotate back up from here. DOGE is now down over 60% from its recent highs, making it an undervalued meme coin veteran to scoop at the dip. An 88% bullish community sentiment backed by a CoinCodex-predicted 70% DOGE rally to above $0.3 means you might be staring at an incredible investment opportunity. Buy DOGE, ADA, or RTX? DOGE and ADA pass for solid portfolio anchors, but when it comes to undervalued cryptos, nothing beats the prospects of a new low-cap presale gem like Remitix. Investors have already scooped up over 529 million RTX tokens as the ICO nears $15 million. The RTX token price is already up over 400%, and analysts believe it might deliver mammoth yields once it hits the free market. Step in and grab RTX share while the price is still low!

While tokens like SHIB and PEPE continue to make headlines, one decentralized finance (DeFi) crypto is quietly positioning itself for what could be a massive breakout year. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance ’s token, MUTM, remains priced at just $0.025, giving early backers a chance to enter before its next price jump. In contrast to meme coins fueled mostly by community speculation, MUTM is supported by tangible DeFi utilities and practical use cases. The platform is building a permissionless protocol that supports decentralized lending, borrowing, and yield-generating mechanisms—all within a system that does not require users to hand over custody of their assets. The project is built around a revenue mechanism designed to return value directly to its users. Instead of pushing tokens into circulation through inflation, Mutuum channels protocol earnings into token buybacks. These tokens are then redistributed to users who actively engage with the ecosystem, such as by holding or participating in upcoming staking systems. With the token set to list at $0.06 after the presale, many are looking at the current entry point as a steep discount. Based on forecasts tied to platform growth and real utility rollouts, MUTM could realistically reach $2–3 this year alone, especially once its beta version is live and integrated features start drawing in a broader DeFi audience. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe Coin has seen fast growth in recent months, largely driven by viral community engagement and speculative trading. While the token has carved out space as a recognizable meme asset, it operates with little infrastructure or ecosystem beyond its branding. Its price trajectory tends to respond sharply to online trends—great for short-term volatility plays but less compelling for those looking to build wealth with DeFi tools or long-term functionality. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu continues to be a familiar name in the crypto space. It gained popularity for its meme appeal and has since attempted to evolve into a more ecosystem-driven token. With the introduction of features like a layer-2 network, SHIB has taken steps toward expanding its utility. However, its current value is still heavily tied to market sentiment and speculative waves, rather than consistent use or financial products. For holders who entered early, SHIB has delivered gains in the past. But looking ahead, it faces more competition—especially from platforms like Mutuum that are designed around DeFi mechanics from day one. Why MUTM Could Lead the 2025 ROI Race Mutuum’s approach is focused on sustainable value. By allowing users to interact with the protocol through overcollateralized lending, flexible interest options, and future staking tools, it creates consistent engagement rather than relying on unpredictable hype cycles. The upcoming beta launch of the platform is also expected to drive significant traction, giving users a real interface to test core features. With the presale surpassing $7 million and the holder count still under 9,000, Mutuum is clearly starting to attract significant attention. Analysts believe MUTM has the potential to reach several dollars per token, making the current price—just under $0.03—especially compelling. A $2,500 investment today would secure 100,000 tokens. When the price climbs to $3 as projected, that position would be worth $300,000. This kind of upside is why many early investors are moving quickly before the next presale phase pushes the price higher. SHIB and PEPE have their place in the conversation, but for those looking at long-term portfolio strength, MUTM offers a very different kind of opportunity. Its blend of real DeFi functionality, upcoming product rollout, and strong token mechanics make it one of the best cheap cryptocurrencies to watch in 2025. With the next presale phase around the corner and interest rising fast, MUTM isn’t likely to stay under $0.03 for long.

According to its latest statement, the company said it has been buying the stash since February 14. The statement mentioned that it bought 111 Bitcoin for $10 million, making the average price per coin $90,124. “Between February 14, 2025, and April 24, 2025, Semler Scientific acquired 111 bitcoins for $10.0 million with an average purchase price of $90,124 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses, using proceeds from its ATM offering and cash on hand,” the statement said. The company also said it now holds a little over 3,300 Bitcoin, worth around $300 million. The company prides itself in developing marketing technology products and services to help its users evaluate and treat chronic diseases. In his statement, Semler Scientific chairman Eric Semler mentioned that as a result of the purchases, stockholders have now earned a Bitcoin yield of 23.5% in the year to date. Semler Scientific makes big Bitcoin purchase According to the statement, the company uses Bitcoin yield as a key indicator to assess the performance of its strategy. “Semler Scientific uses BTC Yield as a [key performance indicator] to help assess the performance of its strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner Semler Scientific believes is accretive to stockholders,” the statement said. Bitcoin yield measures the ratio of Bitcoin holdings to outstanding shares, showing increased exposure per share for investors. The company also said that it believes that the KPI can be used to explain the company’s decision to buy additional BTC. “Semler Scientific believes this KPI can be used to supplement an investor’s understanding of Semler Scientific’s decision to fund the purchase of bitcoin by issuing additional shares of its common stock or instruments convertible to common stock,” the statement said. In its statement, the company mentioned that its Bitcoin treasury was acquired for an average price of about $89,000. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is presently trading at around $94,000 per token. The statement also added that the company partially financed its Bitcoin purchases by issuing about $125 million worth of new stock. Semler also said that the company has plans to raise $75 million through a private offering of convertible senior notes later. Corporate firms shift to Bitcoin Over the last few months, there has been a consensus for corporate firms to shift into the Bitcoin industry, especially with stakeholders calling on firms to hold a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The move was inspired by the rise in the price of Bitcoin in 2024, pushing the Michael Saylor-led Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) up by more than 350%. The move inspired many firms to start accumulating digital assets, especially Bitcoin, in a treasury. As a result of the move, public companies are now among the largest institutional Bitcoin holders. As of April 25, corporate Bitcoin holdings were worth approximately $71 billion, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET. Strategy remains the largest corporate company holding BTC, with its treasury worth more than $50 billion. During the week of April 14, Strategy bought 6,556 BTC, purchasing each coin at an average price of $84,785. However, among institutional players, corporate treasuries are still behind exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which hold about $110 billion worth of Bitcoin, according to CoinGlass data. The adoption has also spread to countries, with United States President Donald Trump leading the charge to see America become the headquarters of cryptocurrencies. The president recently signed the strategic Bitcoin reserve bill into law, adding assets like ETH, XRP, and ADA into the stockpile. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Digital Commodity Capital Reveals 103K XRP Holdings Digital Commodity Capital has disclosed that it now owns 103,000 XRP, worth about $225,570 at current prices.

Now, with Digital Commodity Capital joining in, it’s clear that XRP is getting stronger support from businesses. As more companies come forward with their XRP holdings, it shows XRP is not just another coin anymore. It’s becoming a serious choice for companies looking to invest in crypto. Ripple’s Legal Win Helping XRP This move by Digital Commodity Capital comes after Ripple made big progress in its long fight with the SEC. Ripple recently dropped its cross-appeal against the SEC, showing that a final settlement is very close. Digital Commodity Capital even praised this legal progress, saying it’s a win for the whole crypto world, not just for Ripple. With fewer fears about legal problems, more companies now feel safer to invest in XRP. XRP Gaining Interest Among Institutions Historically, Bitcoin has been the go-to cryptocurrency for institutional investors. However, XRP is now starting to catch the attention of big companies. Digital Commodity Capital’s decision to hold XRP publicly shows a growing shift in how institutions view the asset. More companies might soon follow, revealing their own holdings of XRP as they start to recognize its potential.

The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) has ordered all crypto exchanges operating in the country to update their users’ Know Your Customer (KYC) details by June 30, 2025. This move is seen as part of India’s broader efforts to strengthen crypto regulation and ensure tax compliance. Why the FIU Is Updating KYC Rules According to reports , a Financial Intelligence Unit investigation revealed that several users and exchanges were not adhering to the 1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) rules applicable to crypto transactions. To address this, the FIU-IND mandated that all crypto exchanges must reverify and update user accounts to prevent violations of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. June 30 Deadline: What Crypto Users and Exchanges Need to Do Crypto exchanges must now request users to reverify their KYC details, including submitting essential information such as their Permanent Account Number (PAN), before the June 30 deadline. Failure to comply may lead to regulatory action. Crypto Industry’s Reaction Leading global and local exchanges, including Binance, have already begun notifying users about the KYC re-verification process . Local blockchain advocacy group Bharat Web3 Association welcomed the FIU-IND’s directive, stating that it would enhance transparency and security in the sector. Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, emphasized the importance of educating users about tax obligations alongside KYC compliance, highlighting a growing focus on responsible crypto usage. India’s Broader Crypto Regulation Efforts Despite the FIU’s action, India’s overall crypto regulation framework is still under development. The Reserve Bank of India is reportedly preparing a discussion paper that will outline the government’s approach toward regulating the crypto sector. Industry leaders like Sudhakar Lakshmanaraja view the recent FIU move as a positive sign, suggesting that India is serious about creating a clear and structured crypto regulatory environment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

If you fail to update your KYC details by the deadline, your crypto account may be restricted, frozen, or even suspended by the exchange as per FIU-IND guidelines. How can I update my KYC on crypto exchanges? Most exchanges are sending direct email notifications. Generally, you’ll need to log into your account and submit updated documents like your PAN card and proof of identity/address. What penalties will crypto exchanges face if users don’t complete KYC? Exchanges that fail to comply with the FIU-IND order may face regulatory scrutiny, fines, or restrictions under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Should Indian crypto exchanges expect more regulations after this? Yes, experts believe that India’s crypto regulation framework will soon include licensing requirements, operational audits, and stricter financial reporting.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-26 10:09:55

And to top it off, BNB has listed on Kraken , making it available to thousands of US investors. While BNB is moving forward, another project is rewriting the rules of blockchain investing. Meet Ruvi AI . This forward thinking platform combines blockchain with AI to create unprecedented opportunities for innovation and profit. Not only has Ruvi AI’s presale gone crazy, but their VIP rewards system and projected ROI has got investors salivating for massive gains. Ruvi AI’s Explosive Launch Ruvi AI has quickly become a leader in AI and blockchain. During their presale they sold over 10 million tokens , raising $100,000 in just a few days. The $ RUVI token is offered at $0.01 so early adopters get huge value before the token hits the public market. What sets Ruvi AI apart from other blockchain projects is its potential. Upon listing the token will start trading at $0.07 giving 600% returns to presale participants. Looking forward analysts predict the price could go to $1 or more making this a once in a lifetime investment opportunity. VIP Tier 3 Rewards and ROI Whether you’re a seasoned crypto investor or a cautious investor Ruvi AI’s VIP rewards system is designed to maximize your returns. Here’s how an investment in VIP Tier 3 breaks down: For serious investors looking for high returns the VIP 5 tier is the ultimate reward. To qualify you need to purchase and hold 500,000 tokens during the presale, that’s a $5,000 investment at the initial price of $0.01 per token. VIP 5 participants get a 100% bonus and double their holdings to 1,000,000 tokens.The returns are huge. When $RUVI launches at the confirmed listing price of $0.07 those holding 1,000,000 tokens will see their investment grow to $70,000, that’s a 1,300% return from day one. Analysts predict even more, $RUVI could go to $1 post listing. At that point 1,000,000 tokens would be worth $1,000,000 and your investment would be 19,900% ROI. The current price of $0.01 will increase by 50% in the next phase so future investors will have to pay $0.015 per token. Early participants not only get the lowest prices but also position themselves for maximum rewards as the project progresses. Why Ruvi AI is the Future of Blockchain Ruvi AI is more than just another cryptocurrency. It combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with blockchain to unlock completely new capabilities in distributed systems. Here are a few ways Ruvi AI outshines other projects: AI-Powered Revolution: Ruvi AI’s ecosystem is designed to integrate seamless AI solutions into industries like business, healthcare and education, making it a practical and innovative asset. High-Utility Tokens: $RUVI tokens aren’t just about speculation. They provide real value by powering AI tools that companies can use to optimize operations and lower costs. Investors Come First: With structured VIP tiers and transparent returns the project prioritizes predictable and meaningful growth for contributors. BNB vs Ruvi AI While BNB’s Lorentz hard fork improves speed and efficiency and Kraken’s listing increases its market reach the token largely builds on existing blockchain infrastructure. Ruvi AI on the other hand pushes beyond conventional blockchain capabilities by smartly integrating AI to revolutionize various industries. BNB’s appeal lies in its improvements to already functional systems, but Ruvi AI’s rise comes from creating something entirely new and vital . Investors looking for exponential growth may find Ruvi AI’s structured returns and innovative approach more appealing than the market dependent gains BNB offers. Your Move Toward Tomorrow The Lorentz hard fork and Kraken listing confirms BNB’s role as a leader in blockchain improvements but history is often made by trailblazers like Ruvi AI. With its powerful combination of blockchain and AI Ruvi AI presents a unique chance to secure life changing returns.

TRUMP and SUI up over 75%,https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/26/crypto-weekly-recap-is-bitcoin-headed-for-100k-trump-and-sui-up-over-75/,"With concerns around the US-China trade wars easing, Bitcoin managed to break out of a multi-week downtrend this week. Crypto’s total market cap soared past $3 trillion once again, last seen in early March. Sentiment also turned a corner, with the Fear & Greed Index climbing to 60, its first brush with ‘greed’ since February. Altcoins wrapped up the week on a high, with most major tokens logging double-digit gains during late Asian trading hours on Friday. Why did Bitcoin rally this week? A combination of macroeconomic shifts and political developments helped set the stage for Bitcoin’s recovery. One of the key drivers was the weakening US dollar, which dropped to its lowest level since March 2022. That slide followed fresh pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, after President Donald Trump criticised Fed Chair Jerome Powell and hinted at removing him. The political interference raised concerns about central bank independence, shaking investor confidence in the dollar. This uncertainty pushed investors towards traditional safe havens like gold, which climbed to new all-time highs this week. Bitcoin, often described as “digital gold,” benefited from the same flight-to-safety sentiment, especially among younger investors who tend to favour crypto over commodities. At the same time, there were signs of easing tensions between the US and China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the current tariff environment as “unsustainable” and hinted at near-term de-escalation. Trump also added that tariffs on Chinese goods “will come down substantially,” which lifted market sentiment and encouraged a renewed appetite for risk assets, including equities and cryptocurrencies. The improving outlook saw institutional interest return to the market. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which had recorded heavy outflows over the past few weeks, pulled in over $2.6 billion in net inflows by Thursday, marking their strongest week since November 2024. That sharp turnaround in demand reinforced Bitcoin’s price action, helping the asset break out of its multi-week downtrend and regain momentum across the broader crypto market. Will Bitcoin return to $100k? Bitcoin climbed to fresh seven-week highs above $95,000 this week. The move followed a clean bounce off its yearly open at $93,500, which acted as intraday support. As short positions were flushed out, the path toward $100,000 started to look more realistic, especially with upside liquidity thinning out across exchange order books, according to CoinGlass data. Traders are now watching key technical levels. According to analyst Daan from Crypto Trades, BTC has reclaimed its Bull Market Support Band, a group of moving averages that had previously flipped to resistance. BTC/USDT 1-week chart. Source: Daan Crypto Trades A sustained weekly close above this zone could signal a continuation of the broader uptrend, potentially setting the stage for new all-time highs, the analyst noted. Analyst Alphs BTC also held a similar opinion about the $95k support level. Unless BTC can convincingly reclaim $95K, AlphaBTC expects price action to remain stuck between $93,000 and $95,000 in the short term. “The best case,” he said, “is BTC consolidating and building a base before pushing higher to take liquidity above $100K.” For now, the market seems content testing the ceiling while gathering strength for its next move. On the technical front, Bitcoin’s breakout from a textbook bull flag added fuel to the bullish narrative. According to trader Merlijn, this setup has historically marked the beginning of sharp parabolic moves. Merlijn The Trader @MerlijnTrader · Follow BITCOIN BULL FLAG BREAKOUTThe last time this happened? $BTC went parabolic.This time? $150K is on the radar.The rocket is loading. Don’t miss liftoff. 2:30 pm · 25 Apr 2025 642 Reply Copy link Read 34 replies Still, not everyone is convinced the rally has legs, at least not yet. According to market commentator Skew, Bitcoin is currently caught in a tug of war between a high-volume seller and an equally aggressive passive buyer. Without that buy-side support, he warned, prices could dip much lower. “Eventually one will throw in the towel,” he noted, adding that volatility is likely to follow once that balance breaks. Keith Alan, cofounder of Material Indicators, also urged caution. He observed that while Bitcoin’s price has pushed higher, trading volume has been declining, which is often a red flag for sustainability. Combined with repeated wicks below the yearly open and a fresh bearish signal from one of his platform’s proprietary tools, the setup looks shaky. A move above $95,000 could cancel out the signal, Alan noted, but without a strong catalyst, he believes such a breakout would likely be driven by short covering rather than genuine buying pressure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $95,124, up 12.5% this week. Altcoins bounce back Most of the top altcoins were in the green by Friday, with the sector’s total market cap up 12.15% to $1.2 trillion. Still, there was no shift in the altcoin season index, which held steady at 15, signalling that the market remains firmly in Bitcoin territory. That said, several of the top 99 altcoins still managed to close the week with double-digit gains. The biggest movers were: Official Trump Official Trump (TRUMP), the official memecoin tied to U.S. President Donald Trump, rallied 76% over the past week and was trading at $13.6, at the time of writing. Its market cap was set at $2.72 billion, although daily trading volume had dropped by 66% to $1.87 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap The rally came after Trump announced two exclusive events for top TRUMP investors. According to the coin’s official site, the 220 biggest holders are invited to a private gala dinner with the president on May 22 at Trump National Golf Club near Washington, D.C. Besides the dinner, which is described as the “most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world”, the top 25 holders will also get an exclusive VIP reception with Trump and a White House tour. Sui Over the past 7 days, Sui gained 75%, exchanging hands at $3.73 while its market soared to past $12 billion. As of press time, its daily trading volume was hovering over $3.72 billion, up 38% over the previous day. Source: CoinMarketCap SUI’s recent price rally seems to be fueled by a few major factors, with the biggest one being a rumored partnership with Pokémon, a popular Japanese media franchise. The rumors kicked off after Parasol Technologies, now owned by Sui’s parent company, was mentioned in the developer policy of the Pokémon HOME app, hinting at a potential blockchain tie-in. SUI also witnessed a spike in memecoin activity on the Sui network, along with a new partnership to launch a virtual Mastercard with xMoney. Additionally, Sui’s total value locked (TVL) has jumped nearly 47% in the past week, hitting $2.8 billion. That makes it the 9th biggest blockchain by TVL, putting it ahead of Avalanche and Sonic. Virtuals Protocol Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) was up 66% over the past 7 days, priced at $0.93 per coin, while its market cap stood at $611 million at the time of writing. Source: CoinMarketCap While no specific catalyst was pinpointed, VIRTUAL’s rally this past week came as the AI crypto market saw a strong comeback, with the sector’s total value up 24% and trading volume surging 134%. The renewed interest followed David Sacks officially taking his seat as the US “AI and Crypto Czar.” As one of the main agentic AI tokens, VIRTUAL rode that momentum, breaking out from a long accumulation phase, which likely triggered a buy signal for bulls.

Today, the Tron founder stirred the pot with a cryptic tweet hinting at an unexpected correlation between Tron’s native token, TRX, and Bitcoin (BTC). The phrase “TRX = BTC” grabbed the attention of crypto traders and enthusiasts almost immediately. But what’s behind this bold claim? Is TRX really mirroring Bitcoin’s movements? TRX=BTC https://t.co/8QpReP8SCk — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) April 26, 2025 With Sun’s track record of major announcements that shake the market, this might be one tweet you won’t want to miss. TRX and Bitcoin: The Correlation You Didn’t See Coming In a recent tweet, Sun pointed to a striking increase in the correlation between TRX and Bitcoin, calling it a “miracle.” According to on-chain data shared by Tron ambassador @0xKingsKuan, the correlation between TRX and BTC has surged to a notable 0.37 over the past 30 days. This makes TRX more closely aligned with Bitcoin than with other prominent cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Dogecoin, or Avalanche. Yes, I’m as shocked as you are. While a 0.37 correlation might seem low at first glance, it’s significant for a token that’s often overshadowed by the big players in the crypto space. This growing link between TRX and Bitcoin suggests that Tron’s ecosystem is gaining momentum – and fast. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Memecoin Skyrockets — But Are Whales Planning Their Exit? , Surging Market Activity and Bullish Sentiment Sun’s tweet may have intended to stir the pot or not, but it did either way. It coincided with a jump in TRX’s price , which saw a 3.7% increase within 24 hours, trading at $0.1592 as of April 26, 2025. What’s even more interesting? Over 1.2 billion TRX was traded during this period, marking a 28% surge in volume. Clearly, something is stirring in the Tron market. The uptick in trading wasn’t just confined to price; on-chain data paints an even clearer picture. Active addresses on the Tron network reached 2.1 million, a 15% increase from the previous week. And the TRX/BTC trading pair saw a 2.5% gain, further reinforcing the positive sentiment surrounding Tron. The Bigger Picture: What’s Next for TRX? This new correlation with Bitcoin could be a game-changer. Historically, Justin Sun’s cryptic posts have preceded major price movements for TRX. For example, a similar tweet in 2022 led to a 12% price surge in just 48 hours. As of now, with TRX’s market cap sitting at $13.8 billion, it’s clear that the token is no longer just another altcoin. Could this rising correlation be signaling more integration between TRX and Bitcoin? Or perhaps even broader blockchain developments, including AI-blockchain crossovers in 2025? .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The move could help further expand the footprint of the Dollar in global markets. The new stablecoin product will be powered by Bridge. In October 2024, after receiving regulatory approval, Stripe purchased the stablecoin payments infrastructure firm for $1.1 billion. Stripe Building New Stablecoin Product Stripe co-founder Jeff Weinstein and CEO Patrick Collison confirmed the project on X. Collison posted an invitation for companies interested in testing the solution, adding that the company had wanted to build such a product for over a decade. “We've wanted to build this product for around a decade, and it's now happening.” The project began gaining traction after Stripe acquired stablecoin payments network Bridge. The company’s acquisition of Bridge for $1.1 billion remains the largest crypto-related merger to date. Bridge focuses on using stablecoins to move money, providing APIs to businesses allowing them to accept and move stablecoin payments across the globe while minimizing complexities. Developer Jen Kim stated that the new product is ready for testing and that Stripe is actively collecting user feedback. Kim also added that users in over 90 countries have begun using stablecoins to make payments through Stripe since the launch of Bridge’s services. Bridge competes with banks and other financial institutions using the SWIFT payment system. SWIFT is a global financial messaging network facilitating international wire transfers. A New Revenue Stream Industry insiders believe the new product could unlock a significant revenue stream for Stripe through earnings on reserves held in US assets like US Treasuries. Some estimations put the figure at $40 billion. Stripe co-founders Jeff Weinstein and Patrick Collison highlighted the growing use of stablecoins from corporate treasury and remittances to savings in unstable economies. They have also gained traction as an alternative payment mode in markets with low credit card access. Bridge integrates stablecoins, including USDT and USDC, into traditional financial systems, enabling cross-border payments and currency exchanges. The firm has gained traction through several partnerships across crypto and finance. Stripe gained prominence in crypto after introducing support for Bitcoin payments in 2014. However, the feature was discontinued in 2018 due to declining demand, long transaction times, high fees, and volatility. However, the firm reintroduced crypto payments this month with USDC payments on Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that maintain stability by pegging their value to fiat currencies. Dollar-backed stablecoins have gained traction at the federal level, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell calling for dedicated legislation. According to data from DefiLlama, the stablecoin market cap sits at $237.5 billion as of April 25. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

That kind of speculation isn’t thrown around lightly. But when early metrics, community strength, and market interest align, it becomes a question worth asking—especially when the token in question is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . Bitcoin may have paved the path. But what if MAGACOINFINANCE is the one that knows how to sprint? MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Ground Without Flash—Just Fundamentals While many new tokens fight for visibility with theatrics, MAGACOINFINANCE is rising the way serious assets do: through structure. With a clear roadmap, growing wallet adoption, and active community participation, it’s setting the stage for something bigger. Analysts aren’t just watching price action—they’re tracking behavior. And what they’re seeing is a project steadily moving through early development with precision. There’s no chaos here—just traction. It’s also becoming clear that this token isn’t just riding sentiment. It’s building an ecosystem. And in crypto, that’s the foundation from which real momentum grows. Bitcoin Set the Standard—But the Market’s Still Evolving No token in history has had the impact of Bitcoin . As the first and most secure digital asset, it’s earned its status through decentralization, scarcity, and first-mover dominance. Institutional interest continues to grow, and many believe it’s still only halfway through its long-term arc. MAGACOINFINANCE may not be aiming to replace Bitcoin—but it’s clearly built to join the conversation. Elsewhere in the Market: XRP, Ethereum, Tron, and Sei XRP remains a favorite among institutional adopters. Its focus on financial systems and compliance continues to push its relevance far beyond retail speculation. Ethereum dominates as the go-to platform for decentralized application deployment. Its modular ecosystem and continued upgrades keep it central to blockchain infrastructure. Tron is one of the most widely used chains for transactional volume, thanks to its fast throughput and strong presence in global payment ecosystems. Sei is emerging as a performance-first platform for traders and applications that need high-speed execution. Though early, its architecture has drawn attention from developers and funds alike.

Think twice about your crypto PR strategy | Opinion,https://crypto.news/think-twice-about-your-crypto-pr-strategy-opinion/,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Although some believe that crypto PR and communications efforts should slow down when the markets are cooling off, it couldn’t be further from the truth. Sure, during crypto winters, product development teams huddle together to work on building their solutions—and that’s great—but these are also the ideal times for brand building. You might also like: Crypto tech projects shouldn’t settle for shallow marketing | Opinion Indeed, when the market is going through a crypto slowdown, the strategic brands are seizing the opportunity to strengthen credibility while everyone else is hibernating. And when the market inevitably heats up, this strategy will position such players ahead of the competition. Now, not all might agree with this point of view, arguing that pushing PR during a downturn is tone-deaf. Others might see slow market communications as unnecessary noise when product development should be the only priority. But visibility isn’t vanity—it’s strategy, and it’s easier to get noticed in calmer markets. Slower news, hungrier journalists As the movements in the crypto market slow down, so does everything else that relates to it, including newsrooms. In other words, journalists have more space (and patience) for stories that go beyond mere price action. There are no big stories of exploding digital assets. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is nowhere near reaching a new all-time high, and altcoins are taking the cue from the industry’s number one, sleeping it off themselves. Thus, when the hype and the noise in the crypto sphere die down, media outlets are on the lookout for stories worth telling. In such moments, true innovation and strong projects get their chance to shine and get real editorial interest, instead of getting lost among drama-driven headlines. Small news can be perceived as newsworthy in a bear market Here’s a secret—during a bull run, not even a $10 million funding round might turn heads. It’s just too common when there’s money flowing everywhere across the board. To illustrate, an insider source at a crypto media powerhouse once said that their “funding news coverage threshold is a minimum of $10 million, with exceptions.” This might sound counterintuitive at first, but in a more bearish market sentiment, that same outlet might just be interested in a mere $5 million, or even a $1.4 million seed round, like the one recently raised by crypto payment hub Lyzi to expand its Tezos-based service. In other words, Lyzi has just told the world that it’s there and constantly working on building its product. Arguably, in a period of market pessimism, it would be one hell of a smart and well-timed PR move, and the best part—the likes of CoinDesk might pick it up. Pick up the mic when no one else is talking Providing expert commentary when the industry goes silent becomes even more valuable. Journalists still seek third-party sources and insights, and this is your chance to establish yourself as an authoritative figure in the sector, to whom journalists will come back when the bull market returns. This means that when it’s all quiet on the crypto front and a journalist comes knocking at your door, be ready. Hiring a good PR firm that will lead you, shape your story, and provide the stage is certainly the right move, but it’s up to you to step up with confidence and claim the spotlight. Execution still matters With this in mind, don’t mindlessly drop news just for the sake of it. Be strategic about timing, like holidays, conferences, and other major events that might overshadow your news, as well as the tone—this isn’t the time to brag but display resilience and value. Also, use the time of market bearishness to build your reputation and flesh out your digital footprint through earned media placements in trusted crypto outlets. Potential users, partners, and investors will look you up online, so make sure they have good things to read about you—that’s your PR working in the background. The real bottom line All things considered, crypto PR in times of market stagnation and bearish sentiment is not so much about creating hype as it is about demonstrating real substance. It’s about crafting a narrative that portrays you as the crypto player who can weather the blizzard, better positioning your brand. So, the next time you’re considering staying silent during a crypto downturn, think again. You might miss out on the best PR opportunities of the cycle, as at this time, you could get more attention than usual. Don’t wait for the bull to charge—make your mark when the field is clear.

Earlier this week, long-term holders snapped up 449,000 ETH , marking the largest single-day inflow into accumulation addresses since 2018. With prices averaging $1,750 on that day, the move reflects growing investor confidence despite underwater positions—these addresses hold ETH at a realized price of $1,981, still above current market levels. $ETH ETFs Net flows = +$294.9m Highest net inflow day on record pic.twitter.com/Z0zae6yLHg — #333kByJuly2025 (@CarpeNoctom) November 12, 2024 This shift is notable. For years, Ethereum’s realized price had trailed market price, but that flipped recently, highlighting evolving market sentiment and signaling a deeper belief in ETH’s long-term potential. According to CryptoQuant, the April 22 inflow marked the most significant single-day accumulation in Ethereum’s history. Market Cap: $218.1B Circulating Supply: 120.7M ETH These numbers cement ETH’s position as the second-largest crypto asset, with accumulation trends reinforcing its “digital oil” narrative among institutions and whales. Ethereum Onchain Activity Rises, but DeFi Lags Behind Ethereum’s onchain indicators point to growing engagement with active addresses rising by 10%, climbing from 306,211 to 336,366. This uptick, combined with rising prices, shows that both retail and institutional users are becoming more active—even as broader risk sentiment remains cautious. However, Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) footprint tells a more muted story. According to DefiLlama, weekly DEX volumes remain stagnant, holding at about 1.3 million transactions. While Ethereum’s base layer remains highly active, the DeFi segment hasn’t regained the momentum it saw during prior bull runs. Until DeFi usage rebounds, Ethereum’s upside may continue to depend on broader macro catalysts and layer-2 adoption. Ethereum (ETH) Chart Eyes $1,888 Breakout: What’s Next? From a technical lens, ETH is holding above the 50 EMA ($1,755) and remains inside a well-respected rising channel. ETH currently trades at $1,811, just shy of resistance at $1,888. MACD momentum is flattening—indicating potential consolidation—but the bias remains bullish as long as price respects channel support. For traders, the next few sessions offer two potential setups: Trade Setup: Buy breakout: Above $1,888 Upside targets: $1,959 and $2,035 Support to watch: $1,755 (50 EMA) Stop-loss: Below $1,755 Bottom Line ETH’s underlying fundamentals—accelerating accumulation, healthy address growth, and solid technical support—offer a cautiously optimistic backdrop. Clearing $1,888 with volume may set the stage for a larger move. But without confirmation, ETH could remain stuck in its current range, leaving the path to $5,000 still uncertain. BTC Bull Token Nears $5M Mark as 83% Yield Drives Staking Momentum Investor participation in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to accelerate, with the Ethereum-based project approaching a key funding milestone. As of Friday, the presale has raised over $5million. The token is currently priced at $0.00248, giving prospective buyers a narrow window to enter before the next price adjustment. Yield-Driven Utility Meets Flexible Access What differentiates BTCBULL from typical meme assets is its utility-focused design. The project offers a staking mechanism that delivers a projected 83% annual yield, alongside Bitcoin-based distribution rewards. Importantly, stakers can access their tokens at any time—no fixed lockups or withdrawal delays. Latest Staking Stats: Total Tokens Staked: 1,268,011,229 BTCBULL Annual Yield: 83% APY Unstaking: Anytime access This structure appeals to both passive income seekers and users looking to capitalize on potential token appreciation—without sacrificing liquidity. Presale Snapshot and Market Positioning The presale is entering its final stretch before the token price increases. With less than $754,000 remaining until the next tier, current buyers are securing positions ahead of anticipated upward repricing. Presale Metrics (as of today): Token Price: $0.00248 USDT Raised: $5M out of $5.74M target BTCBULL blends yield-generation with upside exposure, offering a unique entry point for those navigating the evolving meme token landscape.

Reciprocal tariffs might sound like textbook trade jargon, but the idea is pretty straightforward: If one country slaps tariffs on your goods, you hit back with the same. Think of it as a tit-for-tat strategy in global trade — a way for governments to say, “If you’re charging our exporters 20%, we’re doing the same to yours.” The roots of this concept go back to the 1930s, when the US passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. The goal back then was to break down trade barriers through mutual deals, not trade wars. But fast forward to today, and the term is making a comeback — this time with a bit more edge. For example, in early 2025, in an effort to address what it perceived as unfair trade practices and a significant trade deficit, the US government, under President Donald Trump, imposed a series of escalating tariffs on Chinese imports. These tariffs began with a 10% baseline and, through successive increases, reached a staggering 145% on a wide range of Chinese goods. China responded in kind, implementing its own set of reciprocal tariffs. Initially, Beijing imposed a 34% tariff on all US imports , which was later increased to 84% and eventually to 125%, targeting various American products, including agricultural goods and machinery. So, what does this have to do with crypto? You’ll get there — but first, let’s dig into how these tariffs actually work. How do reciprocal tariffs work? While the US has recently adopted a formula based on trade imbalances to determine its tariff rates, other countries, like China, often respond with their own set of tariffs, which may not follow the same calculation method. How the US calculates its tariffs In 2025, the US implemented a tariff strategy that calculates rates based on the trade deficit with a particular country. The formula used is: Tariff rate (%) = (US trade deficit with country / US imports from country) × 100 / 2 Example: US imports from China: $438.9 billion US exports to China: $147 billion Trade deficit: $291.9 billion Deficit ratio: ($291.9 billion ÷ $438.9 billion) × 100 ≈ 66.5% Tariff rate: 66.5% ÷ 2 ≈ 33.25% This approach led to the US imposing a 34% tariff on Chinese imports in April 2025. Also, these new tariffs don’t replace old ones — they’re added on top. So, if a product already had a 20% tariff and now gets hit with a 34% reciprocal tariff, importers are suddenly paying 54%. That kind of jump can make foreign goods a lot more expensive, fast. How China responds When the US imposes tariffs, China often retaliates by targeting sectors that are politically and economically significant to the United States, particularly those that could influence key voter bases. Targeted sectors: Agriculture: China has frequently targeted US agricultural products, such as soybeans, pork and beef. For instance, in 2018, China imposed a 25% tariff on US soybeans, significantly impacting farmers in states like Iowa, where soybean farming is a major industry. Aerospace: In 2025, China suspended imports of Boeing aircraft and halted purchases of aircraft parts from US companies, affecting the US aerospace sector. Phased implementation China often implements tariffs in phases, allowing for strategic adjustments and negotiations: In early 2025, following US tariff increases, China initially imposed a 34% tariff on all US goods. This was later increased to 84% and eventually to 125% in response to escalating US tariffs. China also imposed additional tariffs of 10%-15% on various US agricultural products, including corn, soybeans and wheat, as part of its retaliatory measures. While the US uses a specific formula to calculate its tariffs, China’s approach is more about strategic retaliation, aiming to create economic and political pressure rather than directly matching tariff rates. Did you know? Policymakers sometimes choose a slightly higher number to send a stronger political message — especially if they want to appear tough on trade or take a hard line against a specific country. A flat “34%” sounds more decisive and deliberate than “33.25%.” Economic implications of reciprocal tariffs Reciprocal tariffs ripple through the global economy in very real ways. When the US and China start trading blows with import taxes, everyone else feels the aftershocks, too. Global trade slows down In early 2025, the World Trade Organization had some stark news: Global trade, which was supposed to grow by around 3%, is now barely moving at all — closer to 0.2%. The WTO pointed directly to the US’s aggressive tariff strategy and the domino effect it’s having on other economies. As countries respond with their own barriers, goods just... stop moving. Fewer exports, fewer imports and a whole lot of uncertainty. Developing countries get squeezed Smaller economies — like Cambodia, Laos and others that rely on exporting cheap goods to big markets like the US — are getting hit especially hard. When tariffs go up, American buyers pull back. That means fewer factory orders, lost jobs and shrinking income in places that can’t easily absorb the shock. Prices go up at home Meanwhile, consumers in the US are starting to notice the pinch, too. Tariffs on Chinese goods have made everything from electronics to basic household items more expensive. Even American companies that depend on imported parts are paying more — and passing those costs down the line. Inflation is already high, and this just adds fuel to the fire. Did you know? The International Monetary Fund projected that the trade war could reduce global GDP growth from 3.3% in 2024 to 2.8% in 2025. Reciprocal tariffs’ impact on crypto When governments start slapping tariffs on each other, it sends a signal that things are unstable — and financial markets hate uncertainty. Stocks, bonds and, yes, crypto all react when global trade flows get disrupted. Market volatility When the US announced a 50% tariff on Chinese imports in early April 2025, the crypto markets reacted swiftly. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price dropped to $74,500, and Ether ( ETH ) saw a decline of over 20%. This sharp downturn highlighted how sensitive cryptocurrencies are to macroeconomic shifts and investor sentiment. However, the situation began to stabilize after President Trump paused most tariffs for 90 days. By April 22, Bitcoin had rebounded above $92,000, reflecting the crypto market’s responsiveness to policy changes. Mining operations US Bitcoin miners are facing increased operational costs due to tariffs on imported mining equipment. With tariffs as high as 36% on essential hardware from countries such as China and Taiwan, miners are now grappling with higher capital expenditures. This is especially hard on smaller operations. Larger firms might be able to absorb the extra costs or renegotiate supplier deals — but smaller or mid-sized miners? They’re the ones getting squeezed. As margins shrink, some may be forced to shut down or relocate to tariff-free jurisdictions. Did you know? US Bitcoin miners faced a 22%-36% increase in equipment costs in early 2025 due to tariffs on Chinese-made mining hardware, leading some to consider relocating operations overseas. Investment trends Economic uncertainty often drives investors to look for safe havens — and crypto, increasingly, fits that bill . When traditional markets become volatile due to things like global tariff escalations, many investors turn to Bitcoin and other digital assets as a hedge against inflation, currency devaluation or geopolitical risk. There’s also been a noticeable uptick in institutional interest. With governments engaging in trade battles and inflating the costs of doing business across borders, crypto is starting to look like a more stable long-term play. In Q1 2025, for example, a number of hedge funds and sovereign wealth vehicles began allocating to digital assets in response to these global macro pressures. The establishment of a US strategic crypto reserve — reportedly holding both BTC and ETH — is a clear signal that crypto is no longer a fringe asset in the eyes of traditional finance or policymakers. Strategic considerations for crypto stakeholders For anyone in crypto — whether you’re building the infrastructure, mining the coins or managing investor portfolios — these policy shifts are very real and very relevant. Diversify If you’re a miner or a hardware-dependent startup relying on one supplier or country for equipment? That’s a liability. Tariffs can spike overnight, slashing your margins and forcing expensive workarounds. Diversifying your supply chain — whether through sourcing from neutral countries or investing in domestic alternatives — can soften the blow. Understand the regulatory landscape Crypto companies can’t afford to be blind to policy anymore. Tariffs , trade barriers, sanctions — these are market-moving forces. If you deal with mining, cross-border payments or even just hardware shipments, you need to stay plugged into both local and international trade developments. This is where having legal and trade experts on your side becomes less of a luxury and more of a survival tool. Rethink the narrative There’s a unique opportunity here to reposition crypto. When traditional economic systems are being shaken by trade wars and retaliatory tariffs, the idea of a decentralized, borderless financial alternative starts to resonate on a whole new level. Crypto has long pitched itself as a hedge against inflation and a tool for financial freedom. In the context of rising global protectionism and economic fragmentation, those messages carry more weight than ever. Smart projects and investors will lean into this narrative, growing from the rain as opposed to simply weathering the storm.",tariffs,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-26 10:45:00

The commentator presents a structured breakdown of Ripple’s development, tracing the company’s journey from its early focus on cross-border payments to its current ambition of becoming a foundational pillar in the global financial system. Early Vision: Streamlining Cross-Border Transactions According to the tweet, Ripple’s origins lie in providing a faster, cheaper alternative to traditional payment systems like SWIFT. Using XRP as a bridge asset, the company aimed to improve international money transfers through speed and efficiency. However, this phase, described as a prologue, represented only a narrow segment of the broader financial challenges Ripple set out to address. Expansion into Financial Infrastructure “All Things XRP” notes that Ripple’s strategic pivot came with its recognition that the pain points in finance extend far beyond payments. The company began building infrastructure supporting a wide range of financial services. This expansion now includes tokenization of real-world assets, securing digital asset custody, and the introduction of its own stablecoin. Tokenization and Institutional Partnerships The commentary emphasizes Ripple’s growing presence in tokenization, referencing projections of a $19 trillion tokenized asset market by 2033. Ripple is reportedly advancing this area through the XRP Ledger, which now supports tokenized financial instruments, including treasuries and real estate. One example provided is Ripple’s collaboration with Archax to tokenize money market funds—an initiative framed as laying the groundwork for a new digital financial system. Ripple Custody and RLUSD: Enabling Institutional Adoption Ripple has also launched Ripple Custody, a solution tailored for banks and institutions that require secure and compliant digital asset storage. The tweet mentions BBVA Switzerland as one of the early adopters. Ripple Custody is positioned as a bridge between traditional finance and digital asset markets, offering a product distinct from consumer-grade tools. The launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, is presented as another cornerstone of this strategy. Released in late 2024, RLUSD is designed for interoperability, real-time settlement, and enterprise-grade payouts, aligning with the company’s focus on business-to-business financial use cases. Global Alliances and Regulatory Recognition “All Things XRP” also points to Ripple’s strategic alliances with major financial entities such as Santander, SBI Holdings, and Bank of America. Ripple’s addition to the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve in 2025 is evidence of its integration into mainstream financial architecture. Exploring Advanced Technologies and Acquisitions The tweet underscores that Ripple’s ambitions extend beyond blockchain itself. The company is exploring zero-knowledge proofs and has introduced AI-driven tools such as ExoraPad. These initiatives reflect a broader commitment to programmable, real-time financial infrastructure. Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road is another move highlighted. Some observers interpret this as a step toward integrating with SWIFT, while others view it as a signal that Ripple intends to replace legacy systems entirely. The tweet stops short of confirming either scenario, but affirms that Ripple’s goal is to lead, not conform. Reframing Ripple’s Role in Finance The commentator concludes by referencing Ripple’s legal milestone in 2023 when XRP was declared not a security, followed by a more favorable regulatory environment in 2025. Combined with the rising importance of asset tokenization, Ripple’s current positioning is critical. The message is clear: Ripple is no longer just a payments company—it is positioning itself as the infrastructure backbone for a rapidly evolving financial future. The advice is to focus less on short-term price movements and more on the company’s long-term strategy. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

UK’s Reeves met U.S.’s Bessent on April 25 to discuss a prosperity trade deal, shortly after Reeves said that improving business ties with the European Union was more important. Reeves said a day before she was due to discuss the trade deal with her U.S. counterpart, that she shared some of U.S. President Donald Trump’s concerns about imbalances in the world economy. However, she also noted that the trade tariffs launched earlier this month by Trump and followed up by China benefited no one. Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director at the IMF , said that Reeves is dealing with very tough issues, reprioritizing spending, getting the regulatory environment to be more rational, and then taking on the battle to get it done, “And it’s really impressive.” However, Georgieva warmly welcomed the cooperation between the UK and the EU on Thursday, describing both sides as “divorcees” that are “now dating.” Reeves discusses ‘prosperity deal’ with Bessent in ‘upbeat and positive’ talks Chancellor Reeves discussed what she called a “prosperity deal” with the U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent in a meeting her team described as “upbeat and positive.” The U.S. has made fresh demands in recent days, including calling for tariffs on car imports to the UK to be cut. The U.S. Treasury stated in a readout that Bessent acknowledged the need for fair and reciprocal trade and that the two also held positive discussions on taxation, financial innovation, and technology partnerships. However, Reeves said on Wednesday that Britain would not rush to secure a deal with Washington and ruled out making concessions on food standards. “Today, I met with Secretary Scott Bessent to discuss the UK-U.S. economic prosperity deal and our goal of reaching an agreement that is in both our national interests.” – Rachel Reeves , Britain’s Finance Minister Reeves pointed out that the UK-U.S. relationship had delivered prosperity for businesses and working people on both sides of the Atlantic. Notably, although the UK has been negotiating hard to secure exemptions from some of Trump’s harshest tariffs, including the 25% levy on car imports, Reeves left Washington without being able to claim any tangible progress. Reeves claims that UK-EU trade is more important than U.S. Before meeting Bessent, Chancellor Reeves suggested that the UK’s trading relationship with the EU was arguably even more important than that with the United States. She said that she understood why there was so much focus on the UK-U.S. trading relationship. Still, she noted that the Eurozone trading relationship was more important because European countries are considered the UK’s close neighbors and trading partners. British and European officials recently disclosed that they are aiming for a defense agreement at a planned summit in May. This could also kick off negotiations for closer cooperation in other areas like energy, fish, food standards, and opportunities for young people. Reeves met German Finance Minister Joerg Kukies earlier on Friday in Washington to prepare for a gathering of European leaders to seek to improve ties between Britain and the bloc, strained by the 2016 Brexit vote. At the same time, Reeves and UK’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer hoped to remove some post-Brexit trade barriers with the EU. Although the U.S. was Britain’s biggest trading partner, the EU bloc bought more of the country’s exports. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

ETH price rises 1.85% to $1,806.26, showing resilience despite heavy whale shorting activity. Exchange flows and active addresses show a balanced but uncertain outlook for Ethereum’s recovery. A well-known Ethereum whale is betting against the recent ETH price recovery. On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa reported via X that this whale borrowed 4,000 ETH (worth about $7.25 million) from the DeFi lending platform Aave. The analyst noted the whale borrowed this ETH specifically to open a new short position, signaling a cautious or bearish outlook. 「04.13 以来 $ETH 波段获利 102.9 万美元巨鲸」也是头很铁啊，再空一次 ETH！这次能拿回属于他的一切吗 04.22-04.25 借币做空 ETH 亏损 38.2 万美元后，11 小时前他再次从 Aave 借出 4000 枚 ETH 并以 $1,808.62 卖空，价值 725 万美元 钱包地址 https://t.co/COpoOVctZC 本文由 #Gateio |… https://t.co/5U3CpK5FJa pic.twitter.com/hYaLCIxu1l — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) April 26, 2025 Whale’s Rocky Recent Trades: Profits Followed by Losses This isn’t the whale’s first big move… The post Ethereum Whale Borrows 4,000 ETH on Aave to Initiate New Short Position appeared first on Coin Edition .",Altcoin News|CoinMarketCap Feed|Market|Market News|News|Top Crypto News|Ethereum (ETH),EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-04-26 11:00:00

This Altcoin at $0.025 Will Skyrocket Past $2.50 in Weeks and Hit $8 By Year-End,https://timestabloid.com/looking-for-the-next-xrp-and-solana-this-altcoin-at-0-025-will-skyrocket/,"Investors who missed out on the early runs of XRP and Solana are now zeroing in on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a fast-rising altcoin. The project has already attracted over 8,400 investors, raising more than $7 million, and is offering incentives such as a $100,000 token giveaway to further boost community engagement. The clock is ticking, and early movers may never see a window like this again. MUTM is forecasted to break the $2.50 mark in a matter of weeks, with bullish projections pointing to an $8 target by year-end. Backed by a growing community and real-world utility, MUTM is quickly becoming the most talked-about underdog in the market, and it’s just getting started. The Mutuum Finance team has unveiled a new dashboard with a leaderboard that ranks the top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for staying in the top 50 positions. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off The decentralized finance (DeFi) market adopts Mutuum Finance because of its innovative crypto lending approach which has gained fast momentum. More than 8,400 investors have participated in the project’s unique approach through which they poured $7 million of capital. Phase 4 features a $0.025 token price with a brief entry period that ends when prices rise 20% because it marks the termination of early investment possibilities. Investors participating in the presale phase can get an enormous 140% ROI by purchasing the token at $0.06. The decentralized finance sector keeps expanding while Mutuum Finance emerges as the leading pioneer which brings innovative lending strategies and solid market leadership. Mutuum Finance utilizes CertiK to conduct an audit of their platform security which will receive publication on their social media channels afterward. CertiK will audit the platform after completion before the official report gets published on their social media platforms for public transparency and trust. Shaking Up Crypto Lending through a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is redefining crypto lending by interweaving two dominant models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to contribute stablecoins to liquidity pools managed by smart contracts, earning passive income with instant borrowing availability for platform players. Even interest rates are adjusted automatically by the smart contracts to maximize lenders’ returns and lower borrowing costs. The P2P model takes decentralization to the level of eliminating third parties, allowing borrowers and lenders to directly interact. This provides users with the option to negotiate individualized loan agreements, facilitating higher transparency and an intuitive borrowing experience. Through the Ethereum blockchain the platform stablecoin reaches price stability by using reserve-backed USD. The configuration works as a risk management system for algorithmic stablecoins to secure safe and reliable financial transactions. Mutuum Finance constructs the foundation of future decentralized finance by uniting emerging lending schemes with a solid infrastructure. The MUTM Giveaway As part of its community-building initiative, Mutuum Finance is running an engaging giveaway campaign, offering away $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Ten lucky users will receive $10,000 worth of tokens each. The new referral program for the platform also compensates users who bring in new investors. Users also receive access to exclusive staking pools, governance rights, and platform updates, encouraging long-term devotion and loyalty to the platform. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $7 million from more than 8,400 investors, signaling strong market confidence in its potential. The platform’s innovative dual lending model, combined with the upcoming CertiK audit and a $100,000 token giveaway, highlights its commitment to security, growth, and community engagement. A projected 140% ROI in the presale adds even more urgency as the $0.025 Phase 4 price is set to increase soon. Now is the time to join the movement, secure your MUTM tokens today and be part of what could be the next 17,100% crypto success story.

Analyst Says It Could Soar Another 28% By May,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-eth-near-a-breakout-analyst-says-it-could-soar-another-28-by-may/,"Ethereum (ETH) experienced a significant recovery over the past week after jumping over 10% to the $1,800 resistance. The cryptocurrency’s momentum has seen it reclaim key levels, which could ignite a 28% rally continuation in the following weeks. Related Reading: SUI Eyes $4 Amid 56% Weekly Surge – Here Are The Levels To Watch Ethereum Reclaims First Horizontal Level In Months Over the past week, Ethereum’s price has jumped around 14% to retest crucial support levels. Amid the market recovery, the cryptocurrency reclaimed the $1,600-$1,650 zone at the start of the week, holding a historical demand area as support. According to analyst Rekt Capital, ETH is holding the bottom of its historical demand zone, between $1,650 and $1,950, after its recent performance, “repeating history also by wicking briefly below it.” Since losing its $2,196-$39,00 Macro Range, the cryptocurrency has traded within this range, upside wicking to the region’s top and turning it into resistance, and downside wicking below the bottom to turn it into support, like in 2023. According to the analyst, “Ethereum needs to keep holding here. If this price stability here can be sustained… There is a chance” to repeat its mid-2023 performance, where the token bounced from this region and hit its early 2024 high of $4,093. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades noted that ETH has flipped a horizontal level back into support. The analyst pointed out that since closing above the $1,750 mark for the past three days, the King of Altcoins has shown a “change in market dynamics.” Notably, Ethereum has not been able to reclaim previous horizontal levels for months, getting rejected and making new lows instead. Daan asserted that the $1,750-$2,100 price range is crucial to continue ETH’s bullish momentum. ETH On The Verge Of Breaking Out Amid this performance, ETH is nearing a breakout from its multi-month downtrend. The cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend since hitting its cycle high of $4,107 in early December, retracing over 56% since then. However, Ethereum is attempting to break from the descending resistance again amid its retest of the $1,800 barrier. Analyst Crypto Caesar affirmed that ETH “is on the verge of breaking out. We really just need that higher high…” Analyst Ted Pillows considers that a 28% jump by next month could be possible if the cryptocurrency reclaims this crucial short-term resistance. He pointed out that the $1,800-$1,850 zone is the next level to break before the $2,000 barrier, noting an inverse head and shoulders pattern on ETH’s chart. Related Reading: ‘All Bets Off’ If Bitcoin Reclaims This Level, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Rejection “If ETH manages to break above it, it could rally towards $2.2K-$2.3K in May,” he concluded. Another analyst previously suggested that Ethereum won’t start a new rally until it reclaims the $2,330 barrier, where over 60 million addresses have purchased the cryptocurrency. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $1,795, a 2.1% increase in the daily timeframe.

But behind the scenes, a new token is starting to pull attention away from the giants— MAGACOINFINANCE . This project is gathering serious traction across private groups and trader circles. With exclusive access still open, it’s one of the few remaining opportunities where early positioning still matters. MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining real momentum Bonus window is still active: Early buyers are claiming extra value—but availability is narrowing. Listings are approaching: As public exchange access nears, smart capital is rushing to move in early. Interest is rising quickly: More traders are entering as MAGACOINFINANCE climbs watchlists. Strategic timing is everything: This project rewards early conviction over late speculation. Why investors see MAGACOINFINANCE as a market standout MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t following trends. It’s setting the tone for how strategic altcoin rollouts should look. The model is clean, the structure is focused, and the attention it’s receiving is well-earned. Many now describe the project as one of the rare entries with true 57x potential —not because of speculation, but because of smart setup and early traction. MAGACOINFINANCE vs. SOL, INJ, KAS, and UNI Solana (SOL) and Injective (INJ) offer utility. Kaspa (KAS) and Uniswap (UNI) bring infrastructure. But these tokens have already passed their discovery moments. MAGACOINFINANCE is still in its prime positioning phase—where gains are built quietly before the mainstream takes notice. It is now trending as a 5,700% ROI candidate among top early-stage altcoins. Final thoughts on MAGACOINFINANCE Truly great entries happen before recognition. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP all had a moment where only the few were paying attention. That’s where MAGACOINFINANCE is right now—still early, still focused, and still one of the most exclusive opportunities available. The bonus won’t wait. Act now.

This drop has raised concerns about the project’s legitimacy, liquidity, and exchange support. The suspension of Pi trading on BitMart a month ago, due to pending KYB (Know Your Business) approval for 1:1 Pi swaps, has particularly hindered its accessibility. BitMart Resumes Pi Coin Trading Pi Coin resumes trading on BitMart. Crypto expert Dr. Altcoin shared that this move could help the Pi Coin price recover and potentially reach the $1 mark. Additionally, an official KYB approval for BitMart might be on the horizon, which could further bolster investor confidence in Pi’s future. Bitmart @BitMartExchange has resumed trading Pi after suspending it for a month pending KYB approval. This suggests that an official KYB approval for Bitmart might be announced soon. @PiCoreTeam @nkokkalis @Chengdiao @BitMartExchange @BitMartResearch pic.twitter.com/gfj2usEhMe — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) April 25, 2025 Banxa suspended the Pi transaction Banxa, a major fiat on-ramp provider, recently suspended Pi Coin transactions, citing pending KYB approval. This move has reduced liquidity and created additional hurdles for users looking to buy Pi Coin with fiat. Dr. Altcoin noted that despite this setback, Banxa had previously purchased millions of Pi at a low price and could return stronger once the approval is granted. This potential rebound could also coincide with a price surge, raising optimism among Pi investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Why Is Pi Coin Dropping? , Pi Network Exchange Listing While Pi Network has garnered attention , its absence from major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken has significantly limited its exposure and demand.

A trading expert is projecting that Bitcoin ( BTC ) could spike by almost 50% by August 2025, based on the asset’s long-term bullish trend. According to an analysis by TradingShot , the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $140,000 by August is based on the fact that the digital currency has completed a critical “Triple Cluster Support” rebound on its weekly chart. In an X post on April 25, TradingShot noted that the rebound, which pushed Bitcoin toward the $95,000 resistance, occurred at three major technical levels: the 50-week moving average ( MA ), the former record high trendline, and the higher lows zone of the bull cycle. Historically, rebounds at these levels have often triggered Bitcoin’s strongest parabolic rallies. Furthermore, the analyst suggested that this move could initiate the final parabolic rally of the current cycle. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/TradingShot To this end, the expert asserted that even if Bitcoin only replicates the weakest rally pattern seen during the 2023–2025 period, the expected rise from the bottom would still be around 92%, indicating a target of around $140,000. Indeed, Bitcoin is seeing more upside momentum amid growing signs that trade tensions between the United States and China might be cooling down. Impact of trade wars on Bitcoin’s price While trade tariffs previously drove massive capital outflows from equity markets, Bitcoin largely remained stable, trading below $90,000. Now, the maiden digital currency is witnessing renewed interest after President Donald Trump announced a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss the ongoing tariff war. In the context of trade wars, an analysis by RLinda in an X post on April 26 acknowledged that Bitcoin held firm during the tensions, defying the free fall in stocks and indices. Her analysis shows that BTC is consolidating between the $90,000 support level and the $94,244 resistance level, with a base at $90,000 and a potential breakout targeting $97,914.

As reported by Finbold, banking giant Standard Chartered predicted that the asset could trade at $200,000 by the end of 2025, with a longer-term target of $500,000 by 2028. Bitcoin price analysis At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $94,248, up about 0.5% over the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the asset had rallied by more than 10%.

From a technical standpoint, the asset’s 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) are at $85,010 and $86,254, respectively, both of which are well below the current price, further confirming the bullish trend.

BTC ETFs post $3B weekly inflow,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-etfs-post-3b-weekly-inflow/,"US spot Bitcoin ETFs have clocked six straight days of inflows and a weekly influx breaching $3 billion. This turns out to be their first full winning week since March amid increased investors’ uncertainty due to tariff wars. April 25 alone saw BTC ETFs pulling in $380 million to hit the fresh landmark. The global digital assets industry remained marginally stable while riding the recovery wave. The cumulative crypto market cap is inching closer to the $3 trillion mark with a 24-hour trading volume of almost $100 billion. However, the fear and greed index signals that investors’ sentiments have now shifted into the greed category. Grayscale bleeds, BlackRock leads As per the data, the last time the market saw a five-day Bitcoin ETF inflow streak like this was back in March, which feels like ancient history in crypto years. US Bitcoin ETFs reported an inflow of $381.4 million on April 21, $936 million on April 22, $916 million on April 23 and $442 million on April 24. BlackRock’s ETF IBIT recorded the highest net inflow of $240.15 million on Friday and its total historical net inflows now stand at $41.2 billion. The second highest influx came in through Fidelity’s FBTC at $108.04 million. Its cumulative net inflow stands at $11.86 billion. Grayscale’s GBTC is the only ETF that keeps hemorrhaging value. It posted an outflow of $7.53 million with a cumulative withdrawal of $22.69 billion. Bitcoin price has surged by more than 10% over the last 7 days, during the same week that ETFs posted huge inflows. BTC is trading at an average price of $94,366 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 16% to stand at $35.7 billion. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas explained the situation as: “ETFs are on a Bitcoin bender,” and it shows. Per the analyst, flows have gone from 1st gear to 5th so fast that the possible driver behind the momentum is the return of the “basis trade,” Wall Street’s favorite arbitrage strategy involving futures and spot exposure. Institutions FOMO into Bitcoin, traders fade The volatility earlier in the month had investors sweating as nine out of April’s eighteen trading days were in the red. However, Michael Saylor at Bitwise’s Bitcoin Corporations Investor Day predicted that BlackRock’s IBIT will become the biggest ETF in the world within ten years. It might become bigger than Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which currently towers at $593.5 billion in market cap. BTC ETF inflows are sending out a very clear bullish signal that institutions are piling in and building a real momentum, not just in price. Social sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and the community is increasingly seeing ETFs as proof of Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and long-term upside. Glassnode data shows that open interest in perpetual swaps has risen to 281K BTC, and it is up by 15.6% since early March. The surge hints at the build-up of leverage in the market as prices rebound. Meanwhile, the average funding rate has dropped to -0.023% despite the rising OI, which shows a tilt towards short-side positioning. It added that BTC traders appear to be fading the rally, which might set up a possible short squeeze scenario. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

He believes India should avoid making the same mistakes the U.S. made after 9/11. Instead of going into war, Balaji suggests India should use smart economic moves and even crypto to quietly weaken Pakistan. Using Crypto for Economic Isolation According to Balaji, after 9/11, the U.S. overreacted by starting costly wars. This drained America’s power and helped countries like China rise. Now, Balaji warns that Pakistan might try to bait India into the same trap. But he believes India can play a smarter, long-term game. Balaji explains that India should first focus on protecting its borders and using special forces to handle terror threats quietly. Then, instead of fighting wars, India should work to cut off Pakistan’s financial support from the U.S. and Europe. Here’s where crypto comes in. Balaji believes that by strengthening its crypto economy, India can reduce its need for old banking systems. Crypto gives financial freedom, and India could use it to stay strong while pushing Pakistan out of global markets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : India’s Crypto Regulation Gets Stricter in 2025: Mandatory KYC Update by June 30! , Medium and Long-Term Goals In the medium run, India should convince countries like the U.S. and the U.K. to stop funding or trading with Pakistan. India, with its huge market, can offer better deals in return. By building strong economic ties and promoting crypto adoption , India can make it harder for Pakistan to survive financially. In the longer term, Balaji suggests that India, along with China and Gulf countries, could slowly support a peaceful leadership change in Pakistan. No wars needed, just smart use of money, oil, and crypto power. Balaji’s message is simple: Don’t react emotionally. Play the long game. Use crypto and economic strength to build a safer future, not just for India, but for the whole region. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The major catalyst fueling this momentum is CME Group’s upcoming launch of XRP futures on May 19. These cash-settled contracts—sized at 2,500 and 50,000 XRP—will settle against the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate. Starting May 19, trade regulated, capital-efficient futures on XRP, available in larger- and micro-sized contracts, so you can scale your exposure with greater precision and flexibility. More on XRP futures https://t.co/SzDtBmkG7r pic.twitter.com/BDJRzYSvTd — CME Group (@CMEGroup) April 24, 2025 According to Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Crypto Products at CME Group, growing demand from institutional players prompted this addition. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed the move as a “milestone” for Ripple’s adoption. Analysts forecast that the futures launch could bring new liquidity and price stability, positioning Ripple alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum within regulated markets. Key Highlights: CME XRP futures launch scheduled for May 19. Two contract sizes: 2,500 XRP and 50,000 XRP. Analysts project price targets toward $6.50 if momentum holds. Brazil’s XRP ETF Boosts Global Exposure In another bullish development, Brazil’s B3 exchange debuted XRPH11—the world’s first Ripple-focused ETF.

It offers investors outside the United States regulated access to Ripple, reinforcing Ripple’s global strategy. Key Highlights: Brazil launches XRPH11, tracking Nasdaq XRP Index. 95% of assets allocated to XRP. Expands XRP’s institutional footprint beyond the U.S. XRP Technical Setup: Breakout Eyes $2.30 and Beyond Technically, XRP is consolidating around $2.19–$2.21, respecting an ascending trendline that has underpinned its rally since mid-April. The 50 EMA at $2.18 continues to act as dynamic support, with buyers stepping in to defend pullbacks. The immediate challenge lies at $2.30—historically a major resistance zone. A confirmed breakout above this level could open the door to $2.36 and $2.42 in the short term. The MACD indicator is stabilizing, signaling consolidation rather than weakness, and setting the stage for a potential breakout. Trade Setup: Buy breakout: Above $2.30 Targets: $2.36 and $2.42 Stop-loss: Below $2.17 For beginners, the strategy is straightforward: avoid buying inside the range and wait for either a clean breakout above $2.30 or a bounce from the ascending trendline. Bottom Line With a 9% bi-weekly gain, rising institutional support, and clearer regulatory frameworks emerging, XRP appears well-positioned for a potential breakout. Watch the $2.30 level closely—confirmation there could ignite the next leg higher. Solana’s First L2? Solaxy Hits $31.77M as Presale Nears Milestone While Bitcoin continues to dominate institutional headlines, innovation in the Solana ecosystem is quietly heating up—with one Layer-2 project leading the charge. Solaxy (SOLX) is tackling Solana’s congestion problem by processing transactions off-chain and submitting them back to the mainnet. A built-in bridge with Ethereum enables multi-chain interoperability, reducing fees and boosting efficiency. By bundling transactions before submission to Solana’s mainnet, Solaxy reduces load while maintaining network security. Its cross-chain bridge with Ethereum adds flexibility, allowing users to move assets seamlessly across ecosystems—positioning Solaxy as an infrastructure layer for multi-chain applications. Presale Update The project’s presale has now surpassed $31.77 million, edging closer to its $32.59 million target. With the next price adjustment approaching, SOLX is currently priced at $0.001706—up from the previous $0.0016 round. Solaxy is audited by Coinsult and backed by over 60K followers on X and 11.5K Telegram subscribers. With momentum building, it remains one of the top-watched presale projects within the Solana ecosystem.

In this context, some well-established cryptocurrencies are being reassessed, while newer, undervalued projects are catching up fast. One such comparison that’s increasingly being made is between Cardano (ADA), a blockchain veteran, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi contender still priced under $0.03. Cardano (ADA) ADA has been widely acknowledged as a prominent player within the blockchain ecosystem. With a focus on research-driven development and academic rigor, it’s earned a loyal community and a solid infrastructure. Its ecosystem has steadily evolved, introducing features like smart contracts, governance modules, and partnerships aimed at improving digital identity and financial systems—especially in emerging markets. But while ADA continues to build, its price momentum hasn’t mirrored that progress recently. Its large market cap means that while it’s still a reliable asset, the potential for exponential returns in the short term becomes more limited. Many investors who held through previous market cycles are now looking at alternatives that combine strong fundamentals with higher upside potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has emerged as one of the most discussed small-cap cryptocurrencies in 2025—and it’s not without reason. It’s not just a token; it’s a developing DeFi ecosystem that’s being built with utility, real-world application, and long-term sustainability in mind. The protocol enables users to lend, borrow, and earn—all without giving up control of their assets. Participants receive mtTokens when depositing crypto into the system, which continuously accrue value based on yield generated by the platform. One key advantage of Mutuum is its dual lending system. Users can operate through pooled contracts or negotiate terms directly with other users. This structure opens up flexibility for different types of assets and strategies, appealing to both cautious and high-risk investors. For instance, more volatile tokens—like Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB)—can be handled in direct lending agreements without interfering with the core liquidity pools. What truly distinguishes Mutuum is its focus on long-term sustainability. Rather than flooding the market with new tokens, a portion of platform earnings is allocated to buy MUTM tokens from the market. These are then redistributed to mtToken stakers who are actively participating in the ecosystem. This approach ensures that incentives are properly aligned while reinforcing the token’s long-term potential. Mutuum is still in its presale phase, with the current token price set at $0.025. Already, the presale has brought in more than $7 million and attracted nearly 9,000 wallets. With each phase of the presale, the price edges up—next stop: $0.03. There are 11 total phases, meaning early buyers are locking in significant upside potential. Analysts watching the project closely believe that once the token hits exchanges, the price will climb quickly up to 1900% above the presale entry. That forecast is driven by several factors. First, the team is planning to roll out a beta version of the platform around the time of launch, giving immediate access to core features. Second, the protocol’s built-in stablecoin and yield strategies give it functional use from day one. Third, the project is expected to appear on several major crypto exchanges shortly after launch—adding serious fuel to its growth curve. When comparing MUTM to ADA in the context of growth potential, the argument becomes clear. ADA is mature, proven, and still valuable—but it’s unlikely to deliver outsized returns from its current price level. MUTM, on the other hand, is still early. With real DeFi infrastructure being rolled out, a well-thought-out economic model, and a quickly expanding user base, it checks the boxes for both near-term momentum and long-term strategy. For investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in—not just based on name recognition but on actual utility and future upside—Mutuum Finance presents one of the most promising plays heading into the second half of 2025.

MAGACOINFINANCE.COM Is the Next Big Thing in Crypto!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/1-2-million-gains-magacoinfinance-com-is-the-next-big-thing-in-crypto/,"Crypto’s biggest wins don’t come from following the crowd—they come from spotting momentum early. Right now, there’s one name that keeps popping up in high-conviction investor circles: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . With its steady rise in community, utility, and watchlist appearances, many believe this could be one of the most pivotal early-stage tokens of the year. While claims of $1.2 million gains always invite skepticism, the foundations behind MAGACOINFINANCE are giving serious traders a reason to look closer. This isn’t just hype—it’s structured, strategic, and unfolding fast. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Momentum Where It Counts It’s not often that a project checks all the right boxes this early—community traction, project delivery, increasing mentions across investment forums, and a roadmap that’s actually being executed. MAGACOINFINANCE has quickly moved from newcomer to real contender. Investors are calling attention to its clear communication, rising wallet count, and consistent updates that demonstrate it’s more than just another token launch. It’s beginning to take shape as an ecosystem. What’s making this project special is its timing—positioned in a window when the market is hungry for fresh opportunities but cautious about where to place trust. MAGACOINFINANCE seems to be landing right in that sweet spot. Legacy Strength Meets New Potential: Ethereum, Optimism, Aptos, and Chainlink Ethereum remains the industry’s core smart contract platform. It powers the vast majority of the blockchain economy, and with scaling improvements underway, its relevance continues to grow. Optimism is leading the charge in Layer-2 scaling. As more users move to avoid mainnet congestion and fees, Optimism is becoming a vital part of Ethereum’s growth story. Aptos is one of the newer high-performance blockchains gaining developer interest. Its unique consensus model and transaction speed make it a top Layer-1 to watch in the infrastructure race. Chainlink is foundational. From pricing data to real-world APIs, its oracle solutions are embedded across nearly every major protocol. Its continued expansion is a testament to its core role in blockchain reliability. These are proven platforms—but their explosive phases may be behind them. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, is only just beginning. Final Thoughts Speculation isn’t about randomness—it’s about recognizing structure before the crowd does. MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is showing signs that it’s not just another token. It’s building the narrative, infrastructure, and early loyalty that define the next breakout. This could be the moment. The numbers might sound big—but in crypto, the biggest wins always start small.

In a recent post on X, Farina stated that “XRP is getting ready for the next BIG movement,” igniting renewed excitement across the XRP community. His prediction comes as technical indicators, regulatory developments, and growing adoption converge to create what could be the perfect setup for a major breakout. $XRP getting ready for the next BIG movement — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) April 25, 2025 Technical Analysis Points to Imminent Breakout Over the past several weeks, XRP has been consolidating within a tight range, a classic technical setup that often precedes explosive price action. Analysts observing the charts have noted that XRP continues to hold key support levels while pressuring critical resistance zones. Momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also signal that volatility is compressing — a condition that historically has led to large moves. Farina’s commentary reinforces these observations, suggesting that the next decisive shift for XRP could happen sooner rather than later. Regulatory Clarity Strengthens the Bullish Case Beyond the technicals, XRP’s position within the regulatory landscape has dramatically improved . Following a series of legal victories, including the pivotal ruling that declared XRP is not a security, the asset enjoys a level of regulatory certainty that few other cryptocurrencies can claim. This newfound clarity has made XRP increasingly attractive to institutional investors and financial service providers. Farina’s insight underscores a broader sentiment in the market: with regulatory risk largely mitigated, XRP is well-positioned to capitalize on incoming market opportunities. Real-World Adoption on the Rise XRP’s fundamental utility is also expanding. RippleNet, which leverages XRP for real-time settlement, has grown into a global network connecting more than 300 financial institutions. At the same time, innovations on the XRP Ledger — including Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations — are boosting XRP’s use cases beyond simple payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 There are also strong indications that XRP is being considered for future adoption by governmental and corporate sectors, further enhancing its real-world value proposition. These developments suggest that XRP’s next price move could be fueled not just by speculation, but by tangible, growing demand. Sentiment Shifts as XRP Gathers Momentum Market sentiment toward XRP has been improving steadily. Engagement metrics on social platforms, especially X, show a significant uptick in XRP-related discussions and content. Influencers, traders, and analysts — Farina included — are increasingly highlighting XRP’s potential for an imminent surge. Historically, XRP has demonstrated the ability to rally sharply once momentum shifts in its favor. Given the current blend of technical compression, positive regulatory news, and strengthening fundamentals, many believe the stage is set for XRP to deliver its next major move. As always, while optimism runs high, market participants are advised to stay informed and manage risk appropriately. However, if current conditions hold, Edo Farina’s prediction of an imminent big movement for XRP might soon become a reality.

Each casino on our list promises big bonuses, speedy payouts, and a premium range of slots and tabletop games. Crypto casinos have increasingly become popular in recent years for good reasons. There are several benefits of playing in a crypto casino over a conventional online casino; these include: Cryptocurrencies offer greater security and privacy than fiat methods. Crypto transactions are decentralized, meaning they cannot be censored or interrupted by third parties. Crypto transaction speeds are growing faster, making them ideal for instant payments and payouts. Crypto transactions are much cheaper than fiat methods. More so, crypto casinos offer a wider range of games than traditional casinos, as they are not bound by the same regulations and restrictions. Overall, playing at a crypto casino can offer more advantages than traditional online casinos. Players guide – Advice for choosing the best crypto casino in Singapore Trying out different online casinos to find your best fit can be tiresome. Google searches can also lead you to sites below average, which is why we have compiled this list for you. Each site in our list has a unique feature that makes it stand out. Here are some factors to consider when choosing the best crypto casino in Singapore: Bonuses: Crypto casinos always compete to offer the best bonuses to attract more new players. The downside is that some of these bonuses have steep wagering requirements, so it is good to research their terms before signing up. Examples of common bonuses include free spins, no-deposit bonuses, loyalty programs, cashback offers, and prize pool tournaments. Game selection: While casino games and slots are standard in all casinos, you can check for extra offerings like crash games, mini-games, or live casinos. It is also good to check whether the casino offers betting options for local leagues in your country. Licensing: According to most casinos’ terms and conditions, the player must confirm whether the casino is regulated and allowed in the country. Therefore, look for a valid gaming license and research its reputation among players and online forums. Payment methods: It is critical that the casino supports the cryptocurrency you intend to play with. Also, double-check the blockchain networks supported by the casino.

BK8 stood out for its customer service agents, who were available on multiple platforms, including phone calls, emails, WeChat, live chat, and mobile-friendly Android and Apple store applications. Some other benefits I encountered at BK8 casino include no upper limit on the winnings for parlay bets, high payouts, and rescue bonuses. Specification Details Welcome Bonuses 150% welcome bonus and up to 188 free slot spins Game selection Live casino, slots, sportsbook, lottery, E-sports, Fishing games, Fast games, table games, lottery Accepted cryptocurrencies BTC, ETH, USDT Pros: You can try out most of the games in ‘demo’ mode before signing up for an account. The casino supports both fiat and crypto deposit methods. Cons: While the interface is intuitive, it does not have a ‘dark mode’ version. Limited cryptocurrency payment options. CryptoGames : Best for beginners CryptoGames Roulette I found CryptoGames to have a simple design, generous promotions, and a broad game selection that includes its original games. The casino has been around for over five years and is, therefore, more of a veteran in the space. I enjoyed playing the CryptoGames, Roulette , which offered high payouts with a low house edge. You can earn extra perks by becoming a VIP member, such as a $100 gift on your birthday in Bitcoin and a lower house edge on Dice. CryptoGames isn’t just a gambling platform; it’s a glimpse into the future of crypto gaming with its full Web3 integration. Specification Details Bonuses Daily quests and challenges with rewards for top players. Game selection Dice, Blackjack, Slots, Roulette, Video Poker, Plinko, Minesweeper, Keno, and Lottery.

The casino emphasizes fair gaming practices and responsible gambling. Competitive weekly promotions. A user-friendly interface. Cons No welcome bonus No sports betting Bets.io: Betting with elegance and sophistication Bets.io homepage Bets.io dark theme with green accents evokes a feeling of elegance, luxury, and sophistication. The casino lives up to these expectations with generous bonuses and a simple yet sophisticated interface. The casino’s market authority in the online casino space is exemplified by the SIGMA awards it has consistently won since 2023 as the best crypto casino of the year. With such a reputation, you can anticipate an above-average experience once you sign up. Another factor that I liked about Bets.io is its live chat feature. While most casinos use chatbots, which can be annoying, Bets.io connects you to a real customer service agent fast! Specification Details Welcome bonuses 100% deposit bonus, 100 free spins, and 50% free bet on sportsbook Game selection Live casino, slots, sportsbook, jackpot games, E-sports, table games, lottery Accepted cryptocurrencies BTC, DOGE, ETH, LTC, USDT, XRP, TRX, ADA, BNB, USDC, SOL Pros: Fast customer service available 24/7. Support fiat payment options. The casino games are available in demo mode, so you can try out their game offerings before signing up for an account. The casino is also available in ‘Light mode,’ for the sunny days. Dedicated mobile applications for Android and iPhones. Cons: Limited cryptocurrency payment options. Jackbit: Best rakeback terms Jackbit sportsbook Jackbit had one of the best rakeback terms in our list of top crypto casinos in Singapore. For starters, the rakebacks are awarded instantly with no waiting periods or hidden wagering requirements. Most games, including the sportsbook, are eligible for rakebacks. The model also rewards your loyalty. The higher your VIP level, the more rakeback points you earn.

Customer representative agents are available 24/7. Zero-fee transactions and deposits Cons: The games are not available in demo mode GemBet: Best tailored for players in Southeast Asia Playing Caishen Daddy on GemBet casino After logging into GemBet, I was impressed by how fast everything loaded, which played a critical role in my overall experience on GemBet. The fast customer care responses greatly complemented this. Another standout factor I noticed was that GemBet was greatly tuned for players in Southeast Asia, i.e. from the payment method and accepted fiat currencies. These made the casino a perfect selection for players in Singapore. Specification Details Welcome bonuses 250% Live Casino Welcome Bonus of up to 1,000 SGD and a zero deposit bonus Game selection Sportsbook, casinos Accepted cryptocurrencies USDT on BEP20, ERC20, and TRC20 networks Pros: Customer support on live chat is fast and available 24/7. Players are entitled to a no-deposit bonus. Cons: A limited selection of accepted cryptocurrencies New users must complete identity verification to play. MetaWin: Best for web3 gurus MetaWin homepage My experience on MetaWin was straightforward. No wagering of deposits, on-chain instant prize draws, no pesky human interactions. You can sign in with your crypto wallet and start betting immediately. I would recommend MetaWin to players conversant with crypto wallets and know how to transact with them safely. Despite lacking a welcome bonus, the casino offers a prize pool of up to $700,000 weekly and opportunities to win blue chip non-fungible tokens. While you can play immediately after connecting your wallet, the casino might trigger KYC when you make a withdrawal exceeding $10,000. Specification Details Welcome bonuses None Game selection Casino, slots, table games, crash games Accepted cryptocurrencies ETH, SOL, USDT, POL, APE, BTC Pros: Includes the option to sign in with your crypto wallet. Fast deposits and withdrawals. Accept both fiat and crypto payment options. Blue-chip NFT prizes Cons: No welcome bonuses No sportsbook TG.Casino: Best Telegram casino Playing Chaos Crew 2 on TG.Casino For the best experience on TG.Casino, I recommend accessing it through the Telegram messaging app, which also acts as a community-building tool. Their channel boasts over 23,000 members. The availability of a Telegram chat means TC Casino offers immediate access to customer support. Their website is also as impressive with a green theme and all the features and games you would expect from a classic online casino. Specification Details Welcome bonuses 200% rakeback bonus up to 10 ETH and up to 50 free spins Game selection Sportsbook, slots, game shows, crash games, table games, card games Accepted cryptocurrencies BTC, ETH, LTC, USDT, DOGE, ADA, TGC Pros: When you play with TGC, the native token, you receive 25% cash back on the week’s net losses. Supports VISA and Mastercard payments. Cons: No mobile application. MegaDice Playing Mental by Nolimit City on MegaDice The first thing I noticed about MegaDice was its seamless design and impeccable graphics. The casino promises players a premium experience. Everything screams quality, whether it’s the realistic feel of live dealer games or the animation in slots. Like TG.Casino, MegaDice offers a Telegram experience with a thriving community. Central to the casino is the $DICE token, which grants you 15% on all losses while betting with it. $DICE holders also enjoy a generous 25% revenue share through the Mega Dice Referral Program Specification Details Welcome bonuses 200% bonus of up to 1BTC and 50 free spins Game selection Live casino, slots, table games, game shows, crash games, sportsbook Accepted cryptocurrencies BTC, USDT, ETH, LTC, XRP DOGE, ADA, TRX, BCH, USDC, SHIBA, PEPE, FLOKI, BONK Pros: Daily Missions each for free rolls on the casino. Accepts VISA and Mastercard payment options You can sign up by connecting your crypto wallet. Cons: MegaDice does not have a ‘no deposit bonus.’ Players must deposit to earn bonuses. Wild.io: Best crypto-only casino Wild.io sportsbook Wild.io is a crypto-only casino with a well-organized website that makes it easy for users to deposit cryptocurrencies and access top slots, tables, and live casino games. For those committed to the Wild.io experience, the VIP program is the cherry on the top. Players can expect various exclusive benefits as part of their VIP experience. From exclusive bonuses and promotions tailored for the high rollers to level-up rewards, the perks keep coming. And if that wasn’t enough, you can transfer your VIP status from another casino to Wild.io.

Players can sign in to the casino using their Telegram accounts. Cons: Does not support fiat deposit methods. Despite being crypto-exclusive, the casino does not support signing in with crypto wallets. Conclusion Choosing the best crypto casino in Singapore is somewhat like dating—you often have to go through a few disappointing options before finding the right one. However, with the right guidance, you are set to discover your perfect match. The crypto casino industry is growing highly competitive, and platforms are competing for new players, so choose wisely and remember to play responsibly.","Deep Dive - Crypto, Web3 & Market Insights|Singapore",EN,0,0,ADA|ASIA|BTC|ETH|LTC|USDT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-26 11:40:11

Stiglitz has issued a sharp warning: Donald Trump’s policies are pushing the United States toward becoming the world’s largest tax haven . And for the crypto community, the consequences could be enormous. Trump’s Crypto Moves Raise Alarm Bells Stiglitz argues that Trump’s administration weakened financial transparency by halting the collection of company ownership data, withdrawing from global tax cooperation, easing crypto regulations , and scaling back anti-money-laundering enforcement. In particular, Trump’s executive order to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve and the appointment of a crypto advocate to lead the SEC have raised major red flags. According to Stiglitz, these actions make the U.S. an attractive destination for hidden crypto transactions. Crypto Secrecy: A Brewing Storm? Stiglitz warns that the rise of underregulated crypto exchanges, online casinos, and anonymous platforms under Trump could fuel the global illicit economy , making money laundering and tax evasion easier than ever. While crypto investors might see fewer regulations as an opportunity, Stiglitz stresses that unchecked crypto activity could seriously threaten long-term financial stability. A Bigger Financial Shift Underway Trump’s crypto policies are just part of a larger effort to dismantle financial safeguards, Stiglitz says. Cutting IRS staffing, reducing tax enforcement, and offering major corporate tax breaks could slash U.S. tax revenue by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. Meanwhile, tariffs on imports have burdened ordinary Americans while benefiting a wealthy few, further widening the wealth gap — and crypto assets, Stiglitz warns, are increasingly becoming a tool for tax avoidance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : $TRUMP Coin Dinner: Private Dinner Announcement with Trump Sparks 70% Surge , The World Moves Ahead Without the U.S. As the U.S. loosens its grip, over 50 countries are advancing a 15% global minimum corporate tax to promote fairness and accountability. Stiglitz suggests that America’s retreat could ironically strengthen global efforts for fairer taxation. Bottom Line Joseph Stiglitz’s message is clear: Trump’s crypto deregulation could transform the U.S. into a magnet for offshore wealth , but at the cost of financial stability and global trust. For crypto investors, the short-term gain of less regulation could come with long-term risks that are impossible to ignore. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal Crypto tells his 232,000 followers on the social media platform X that Solana ( SOL ) is already outperforming ETH in the latest market bounce this month, signaling the trend will likely continue. “SOL outperforming ETH in this bounce. Obvious clues as to which out-performer will be when the bull run resumes.” Source: Inmortal Crypto/X Looking at his four-hour charts comparing the performance of SOL to ETH during the month of April, the analyst shows SOL surged from its April low to high by about 65%, while ETH surged this month from its low to high by about 33%. Next up, the analyst suggests that SOL will soon soar to around $330 after retesting a key support level at around $100. “In retrospect, it will seem so obvious.” Source: Inmortal Crypto/X The analyst also says that ETH is on the verge of a breakout after retesting the $1,500 level, likely repeating a similar late 2024 pattern. “ETH: In a few months, many will look back to this chart with regret.” Source: Inmortal Crypto/X Solana is trading for $151 at time of writing, down nearly 1% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ETH is trading for $1,791 at time of writing, up 1% on the day.

BTC posted +12% gains, ETH +12%, SOL +15%, DOGE +18%, ADA +17%, and SUI an eye-catching +74% candle. So Ripple’s token may be undervalued at a long-term outlook, and the value buy this weekend for long-term holding crypto investors shopping out of the most favored assets by online and commercial telecom markets. Here are five recent developments keeping market demand rolling for the massive cross-border payments company’s signature fleet of XRP tokens: 1. XRP Flips Ethereum in Diluted Market Cap HISTORIC: $XRP FLIPS $ETH After 6 straight months of outperforming #Ethereum , #XRP has officially become the second-largest asset by fully diluted market cap. The numbers? • XRP: $208.4B • ETH: $192.5B No hype. No dreams. Just onchain facts. pic.twitter.com/FcO5p4UCEF — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) April 18, 2025 XRP’s fully diluted market cap is nearly 1/8th of Bitcoin’s in April. That is a remarkable development and a key fundamental metric in the supply/demand economics at play in the daily market price of these currencies. Bitcoin’s market cap on Friday, Apr. 25, was $1.8 trillion. Ethereum’s was $215 billion, and XRP’s was a distant third at $128 billion. But, its fully diluted market cap is the market capitalization if all the currency’s tokens were in circulation. By that metric, XRP surpassed ETH for the first time in the final stretch of April. That’s important over the long term because XRP is supposed to become a scarce digital token with a supply cap of 100 billion coins. Meanwhile, Internet and institutional demand for the asset is high, and its use case is focused yet plentiful with expansion opportunities. 2. Paul Atkins Sworn In As New SEC Chair Meanwhile , after Ripple’s lengthy and costly lawsuit with the SEC, Paul Atkins assumed office as the new agency Chair on Apr. 21, which is especially important for XRP market prices . In the private sector, Atkins helped develop best practices for cryptocurrencies for a global strategy, hedge, and regulatory consultancy he founded. This has raised hopes of a final resolution to the lagging Dec. 2020 lawsuit against Ripple Labs. There are many vast institutional conglomerates that rely on the SEC to do business and won’t invest in something the agency is suing. Only time will tell how many of them are waiting on the government with their eye on Ripple prices. Patrick Bet-David of the “Valuetainment” YouTube podcast recently said that if the lawsuit is dropped, it will have a big impact on XRP prices going forward. 3. Coinbase Launches CFTC-Regulated XRP Futures Furthermore, the Nasdaq-listed US crypto exchange Coinbase just launched a CFTC-regulated XRP futures product in April. This could be a test for demand for XRP from cautious institutional investors and a potential leading indicator for new price support when things with the SEC are finally settled, pat and dry. But it may be a big hit with leverage traders who find crypto’s volatile markets, with their frequent big double-digit daily swings, not exciting enough without multiplying the risk-reward factor. Coinbase announced the new feature on X on Apr. 3 and rolled it out on Apr. 21. Coinbase Derivatives, LLC now offers CFTC-regulated futures for $XRP . https://t.co/omSNu0aEoC — Coinbase Institutional ️ (@CoinbaseInsto) April 21, 2025 4. Whales Are Buying The XRP Dip in April “Whales are taking over!” Brett Crypto X tweeted on Apr. 21 to some 90K followers. Whales are taking over! $XRP trading volume just exceeded 20 million in a single minute. You see this? This is real utility. pic.twitter.com/YofRSjdRGW — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 21, 2025 The last time Brett Crypto X warned about XRP was in the middle of a strong upward trend channel that lasted for months until the financial industry took a haircut, starting in February, over trade jitters. In one of the threads, a replier begged Crypto X to tell them what blockchain updates software gives them that Star Trek-looking market cap monitor. Crypto whales have an affinity for trading Ripple and are supporting XRP prices in April. Addresses between 10 million and 100 million XRP moved in April to make up about 1% more of the total share of circulating tokens. Whale support means greater scarcity and higher exchange prices for a token economy, but add to its risk of future volatility if whales sell. However, many whales on the blockchain are likely conscious of its economy and other peers and seem to follow Satoshi Nakamoto’s example by waiting months or even years to trade such substantial amounts. 5. Ripple Daily Active Addresses Surge $XRP network activity jumped 67.50%, with active addresses rising from 27,352 to 40,366! pic.twitter.com/fDiERMIYiz — Ali (@ali_charts) April 21, 2025 Ripple also saw its daily active addresses surge 67% from 27K to 40K over ten days in mid-April. That’s a more fundamental analysis of the tension against the market valuation of the most recent crypto rally. Meanwhile, the XRP price chart exhibited an inverse head and shoulders pattern, usually a bullish formation indicating the beginning of a rally in the asset’s price. The combination of fundamental/market decoupling and bullish technical indicators signals that XRP prices in the last week of April may be hiding bigger green candles.

Stripe CEO Patrick Collison confirmed the initiative in a recent post on X , inviting businesses to participate in early testing of the product. The announcement follows Stripe’s regulatory approval to acquire Bridge, a stablecoin payments network designed to rival traditional banking systems and SWIFT-based transfers. Bridge was co-founded in 2022 by former Coinbase executives Zach Abrams and Sean Yu. Stripe Pioneered Crypto Payments in 2014 with Early Bitcoin Support Stripe’s involvement in crypto dates back to 2014 when it became the first major payments processor to support Bitcoin (BTC) transactions. However, due to network inefficiencies and high fees, the company halted Bitcoin support before reviving its crypto ambitions in 2021 by rebuilding its blockchain team. Since then, Stripe has accelerated its crypto push. In October 2024, the firm launched stablecoin payment options , which saw rapid adoption across 70 countries on its first day. Earlier that year, Stripe partnered with Coinbase to facilitate fiat-to-crypto conversions. Collison remarked that this latest stablecoin project is something Stripe has “wanted to build for around a decade.” We've wanted to build this product for around a decade, and it's now happening. https://t.co/zK9dADvGhG — Patrick Collison (@patrickc) April 25, 2025 Stablecoins, which are pegged to assets like fiat currencies, continue to gain traction globally as efficient tools for cross-border payments and financial stability. In the U.S., regulatory focus on USD-backed stablecoins has intensified, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell calling for clear legislation. Meanwhile, companies like PayPal have entered the space , launching their own stablecoins and offering yield incentives to holders. As of April 25, the total stablecoin market capitalization stands at $237.5 billion, according to DefiLlama, signaling robust demand for digital dollar solutions in global finance. Jack Dorsey Urges Signal to Adopt Bitcoin for P2P Payments Earlier this month, Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO and outspoken Bitcoin advocate, publicly urged Signal Messenger to integrate Bitcoin for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. Dorsey’s call was echoed by David Marcus, former president of PayPal and current CEO of Lightspark, who stated that “all non-transactional apps should connect to Bitcoin.” The comments reflect a growing sentiment among Bitcoin advocates to reposition BTC not just as a store of value, but as a practical payment tool. Venture capital firms are increasingly backing projects focused on stablecoin services and financial infrastructure. The sector’s potential was further underscored by payments giant Stripe’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion last year, signaling strong institutional interest in blockchain-based financial solutions. Aside from Stripe, other payment companies have also adopted stablecoins as a means of payment. More recently, Singapore-based payments company Triple-A announced plans to integrate PayPal’s stablecoin into its list of supported tokens for customer payments.

WLFI caused a stir when it launched ahead of the president’s inauguration. Observers have accused the project of front-running important crypto-related events, like the White House Crypto summit, and presenting a conflict of interest. Trump is in a unique position to influence outcomes that would affect his portfolio, but WLFI is not insulated from the broader market trends, which have seen crypto and stock prices drop amid significant macroeconomic concerns. The Trump administration will soon mark 100 days in office. Here’s what WLFI has been up to, and how the president’s crypto investments are shaking out. The “gold paper” for WLFI features flattering Trump imagery. Source: WLFI Founding and ownership of Trump’s crypto investment WLFI project WLFI launched on Sept. 16, with then-President-elect Donald Trump announcing the move on X. Founded under the guidance of real estate magnate Steve Witkoff and his son Zach, the co-founders also include Chase Herro, a crypto investor and self-described “dirtbag of the internet,” and Zak Folkman, a social media influencer and former pickup artist. The Trump family also features prominently. President Trump is listed as “chief crypto advocate,” while his sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron are “Web3 ambassadors.” The leadership team at WLFI. Source: WLFI WLFI token sales One of World Liberty Financial’s first moves was to sell its own token. The first token sale opened on Oct. 15, 2024 , earning the company about $300 million by selling 20 billion WLFI $WLFI for $0.015 each. On Jan. 20, 2025, the day Trump was inaugurated, WLFI announced a second token sale, citing “massive demand and overwhelming interest.” The firm offered 5 billion tokens at $0.05 each, representing a price increase of 230% from the first sale. The second sale was completed nearly two months later on March 14, having met its full target of $250 million. According to the project’s “gold paper,” the WLFI tokens will confer voter rights to holders on important matters affecting the protocol, such as upgrades. The anticipated token distribution is: 35% through token sales, 32.5% for incentives and community growth, 30% for “initial supporter” allocation, and 2.5% for “core team and advisers.” All told, WLFI walked away with $550 million in token sales. $WLFI was only available to accredited investors and cannot be transferred or traded on exchanges per the terms and conditions. There is yet to be an announced listing date for the token. WLFI’s portfolio Token sales aside, the WLFI has been acting as a type of crypto fund, accumulating a number of different tokens over the past several months. Here’s a breakdown: WLFI portfolio contains a number of different assets, with 13 making up the lion’s share at time of writing. Most of its holdings are in dollar-backed stablecoin USDC, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). The top 13 assets make up nearly $100 million of the firm’s $103 million portfolio, according to Arkham. Dozens of other small coins, some with a total dollar value of less than $100,000, make up the remaining value. WLFI’s $5 million worth of Aave Ethereum USDC (aethUSDC), means they supply USDC to a pool on Aave. WLFI’s portfolio contains eight cryptocurrencies that are non-stablecoin assets it purchased (versus received via airdrop). Wrapped BTC (WBTC) Mantle (MNT) Movement (MOVE) Sei (SEI) Avalanche (AVAX) Tron (TRX) Ondo (ONDO) Ether (ETH) Overall, WLFI’s holdings in WBTC, SEI and AVAX have been performing most successfully. The first WBTC purchase happened on Dec. 18, when WLFI exchanged 103 WBTC for 103 cbBTC. Nearly one month later, WLFI traded everything for ETH. The fund started accumulating WBTC again, mostly using USDT, and sent it to Coinbase Prime in early February. WLFI’s AVAX position was completed in one purchase on March 15, while it bought nearly $6 million worth of SEI over three separate purchases in February, March and April. Other positions haven’t been faring nearly as well. Major investments in MNT, MOVE, ONDO and ETH are all seeing losses in the double digits as of April 24. MOVE is taking a beating, with WLFI’s total investment value down over 50%, losing some $2,100,000 on the investment. Taking into account the average price of WLFI’s token purchases, along with its assets’ current prices, the fund is seeing a loss, on average, of $4,280,000. Notably, WLFI has also deposited several early purchases of tokens in December and January into Coinbase Prime. WLFI wallets slowly acquired ETH long before the main action started. WLFI began acquiring large sums worth over $1 million in late November and continued doing so every few days until Dec. 21. Then, it moved all acquired ETH (including 3,700 ETH deposited in October) to Coinbase Prime on Jan. 14. Between Jan. 19 and Jan. 21, it bought nearly 57,000 ETH and continued acquiring it until Feb. 3, when it moved most of the ETH to Coinbase Prime. Coincidentally, Eric Trump was shilling Ether on X at the same time. Source: Eric Trump Conflicts of interest and stablecoins The curious timing of WLFI moving the tokens to a crypto exchange and Eric Trump’s post raises the question of the Trump family’s ability to influence the tokens they hold. In late March, a group of Senators from that body’s banking committee wrote an open letter, pressing regulatory agencies to consider the potential conflicts of interest in WLFI, particularly with the project’s stablecoin, USD1. Related: US House committee passes stablecoin-regulating STABLE Act USD1 launched in early March, and at publishing time is trading on centralized exchanges Kinesis Money and ChangeNOW, according to CoinMarketCap. The Senators were concerned that Trump stands in a unique position to influence and offer boons to his own stablecoin project, particularly with the forthcoming stablecoin framework bill under consideration in Congress. When markets slumped following Trump’s tariff announcement on “Liberation Day,” the president posted on the right-wing social media platform Truth Social, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!” further igniting concerns about insider trading and market manipulation. Despite these concerns, the Trump administration’s ties to crypto are only strengthening. His administration has dropped several high-level enforcement cases against crypto firms, and his allies in Congress are writing favorable legislation for the industry. And crypto firms seem to believe in the project. On April 16, crypto market maker DWF Labs announced a $25 million investment in WLFI and agreed to provide liquidity for USD1.

Ethereum Whales Have Sold Into The Latest Rally As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Ethereum whales have participated in selling recently. The “whales” here refer to the ETH entities holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH. At the current exchange rate, this range converts to $1.8 million to $18 million. While these bounds don’t cover the largest of holders in the sector, they do still contain some of the key investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Realizing $139 Million In Profit Per Hour This Rally, Report Says Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the combined balance of these Ethereum whales over the over the past ten days or so: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum whales have seen their supply go through a net decline recently. During this selloff, these investors offloaded more than 63,000 ETH (about $113.5 million) inside a 48-hour window. From the chart, it’s visible that the distribution from this cohort has coincided with ETH’s recovery rally. This could indicate that these large investors have been capitalizing on the profit-taking opportunity. While the key investors of ETH may have taken profits, the same isn’t true for that of BTC. As the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed in an X post, the trend has been that of accumulation for BTC recently. In the chart, the analytics firm has attached the data related to the supply of the Bitcoin holders carrying between 10 ($946,000) and 10,000 BTC ($946 million). This range is broader than the one for ETH and includes two key investor cohorts: sharks and whales. These investors have collectively added a total of 19,255 BTC to their wallets alongside the price rally. Thus, it would appear that the key holders of the cryptocurrency are supportive of the recovery run. Related Reading: Litecoin Conviction Remains Strong: More Than 20% Of Supply Frozen Since 5+ Years Naturally, this could imply the Bitcoin rally may have more chances of being sustainable than the Ethereum one. That said, things can change quickly in the digital asset sector, so the trend related to the large entities of both might be worth keeping an eye on. Speaking of accumulation, BTC is currently witnessing high inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as Santiment has pointed out in another X post. From the chart, it’s visible that the recent ETF inflows are the largest in months. As the analytics firm notes, As Bitcoin has recovered as high as $95.8K today, we are seeing the highest week of net inflows to BTC ETF’s since the week before Trump’s inauguration in mid-January. Institutions like Blackrock have played a large part in the crypto-wide bounce traders were waiting for.

The cash came flooding in after an announcement on Wednesday that the top 220 holders of $TRUMP would win a black-tie optional dinner with him on May 22 at his private club near Washington, D.C. The event promises a special reception for the top 25 token holders, and the website also promotes a “VIP White House Tour” the following day. An active leaderboard tracks the usernames of buyers scrambling to get a seat. The $TRUMP coin, already a meme-heavy asset, saw its price rocket up more than 50% after the dinner contest announcement, pushing its total market value to $2.7 billion. The president’s political rivals slammed the move immediately. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, posted on X that the sale was “the most brazenly corrupt thing a President has ever done. Not close.” Trump’s circle controls token profits while critics demand probe The Trump Organization and its affiliates currently control about 80% of the $TRUMP token supply, based on information from the project’s website. Since the launch of the token in January, about $324.5 million in trading fees have been collected. Every time a trade happens, a slice of the transaction is sent directly to wallets managed by the people behind the token, according to the same website. Chainalysis confirmed that this setup keeps money flowing into wallets connected to the project’s creators. The majority of tokens are locked in a three-year vesting plan, meaning they’ll be released gradually to avoid a sudden dump on the market — a trick in crypto circles called a “rug pull.” Lockups like this are supposed to build trust by making sure insiders can’t immediately cash out and wreck the token’s price. Even with the lockup, the dinner contest raised alarms. Senators Adam Schiff from California and Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts called on the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to investigate whether offering dinner with Trump for buying tokens breaks anti-corruption rules. They warned that the event smells like pay-to-play corruption, blurring the line between political access and financial gain. Ethics commentators call foul as foreign ties surface among holders Delaney Marsco, who leads ethics work at the Campaign Legal Center, told NBC News that while the $TRUMP contest is a clear breach of traditional ethics, it probably won’t be ruled illegal. “Criminal conflicts of interest statutes don’t apply to the president,” Marsco said. She pointed out that modern presidents since Carter have stepped away from business interests to avoid conflicts, but Trump is using loopholes to keep financial ties alive. “The fact that he is not barred by the law from having these financial interests like this meme coin allows him to engage in a lot of seemingly corrupt activity. It has the appearance of a pay to play, so the president is apparently selling access to himself,” Marsco said. Molly White, an independent crypto researcher, explained to NBC News that the $TRUMP leaderboard hides real identities by only showing screen names. White warned that it’s impossible to know who exactly is spending on dinner access. She also said some $TRUMP buyers are tied to foreign crypto exchanges banned in the U.S., including Binance. At least one of the top holders has an active Binance account, despite the platform being closed off to American users. Schiff and Warren backed their ethics complaint with public reports showing that funds from banned crypto platforms might be tied to $TRUMP investments. They pressed the Office of Government Ethics to dig into how deep the foreign connections go. Trump’s return to the White House was backed heavily by the crypto industry, which poured tens of millions of dollars into the 2024 election. This cash beat out donations from old industries like banking and oil. Besides $TRUMP, there’s also a $MELANIA token backed by the first family. They are also tied to World Liberty Financial , a decentralized finance company that raised $550 million since October through two token sales. Buyers of those tokens are banned from reselling and don’t share in profits. Instead, a Trump-linked company claims 75% of the net revenue, including proceeds from token sales.

Attention turns to five altcoins that could be poised for significant investment. Which digital assets are likely candidates for this substantial shift in funds? The following insights explore the potential targets of this strategic move. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges PEPE: The Memecoin Making Waves in the Crypto World PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum as a tribute to the popular Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Aiming to join the ranks of viral cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE embraces its memetic roots. With a no-tax policy and honesty about its lack of utility, PEPE keeps things simple and appeals to the crypto community’s fun side. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a massive surge, with its market cap soaring to $1.6 billion. Early investors saw significant gains, and the coin attracted a strong following. This surge kicked off what some call a “memecoin season,” with many new tokens experiencing rapid rises and falls. PEPE’s potential lies in its community and the excitement it generates. Its roadmap includes getting listed on major exchanges and aiming for a “meme takeover.” While it doesn’t offer the technological innovations of other cryptocurrencies, its simplicity and viral nature are its strengths. In the current market cycle, PEPE appeals to those looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Comparing it to other memecoins, PEPE has shown remarkable growth in a short time. However, the volatility of memecoins means they can see spectacular pumps and dumps. As the crypto market anticipates the next Bitcoin halving and possible bull run, coins like PEPE capture the imagination of investors hoping for big returns. Conclusion While PEPE and other promising altcoins show potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the pioneering all-sport memecoin poised for significant growth during the bull run 2025.

While many are looking to meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) for quick gains, others are focusing on projects with real utility that promise substantial growth in the long term. Coldware (COLD) is one such project that is beginning to grab attention for all the right reasons. Coldware (COLD): The Next 10x Opportunity While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) focus on viral appeal and community-driven hype, Coldware (COLD) is building a solid foundation in the DeFi sector. Coldware (COLD) offers decentralized finance solutions that provide real-world utility, and as more investors begin to look beyond speculative tokens, Coldware (COLD) stands out as a prime candidate for long-term success. With its innovative DeFi solutions and steadily growing ecosystem, Coldware (COLD) is rapidly becoming a favorite for investors who want to diversify their portfolios with tokens that offer more than just hype. As the DeFi sector continues to expand, Coldware (COLD) is well-positioned to capture a significant share of the market. The Meme Coin Trend: Dogecoin and Pepe Coin Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have long been the face of the meme coin craze. Dogecoin (DOGE), in particular, has seen remarkable price action over the years, driven largely by Elon Musk’s endorsement and its strong community support. However, despite its historical success, Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently faced a pullback, and many investors are questioning whether the coin can continue its meteoric rise or if it is destined for stagnation. Likewise, Pepe Coin (PEPE) gained significant traction during the 2024 altcoin season but has now seen a drop in value as its meme-driven momentum begins to wane. While these coins have delivered significant short-term gains, their long-term potential remains uncertain. Investors are now looking at projects like Coldware (COLD) that have a clear roadmap for future growth and utility. XRP: The Blockchain That Keeps On Giving While meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) are subject to the volatility of community-driven movements, XRP offers something different. Known for its strong regulatory presence and institutional backing, XRPhas remained a solid choice for those looking for a more stable investment in the crypto space. Recent legal victories and increasing adoption by financial institutions suggest that XRP will continue to be a major player in the blockchain ecosystem. Why Coldware (COLD) Is Positioned for Success As Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) battle with volatility and speculative investors, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as a long-term growth opportunity. With its focus on DeFi solutions and growing ecosystem, Coldware (COLD) is poised to grab the attention of serious investors looking for stability and long-term gains. Its undervalued price, combined with strong investor backing, makes Coldware (COLD) a token that could very well deliver the next 10x opportunity. The Bottom Line: Coldware (COLD) Could Be Your Next Big Bet If you’re struggling to find the next 10x crypto, Coldware (COLD) is a strong candidate. While meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) continue to offer speculative gains, Coldware (COLD) provides real utility and long-term value. As the cryptocurrency market matures, projects like Coldware (COLD) are setting themselves up for sustained growth. Conclusion: While meme coins may provide short-term excitement, Coldware (COLD) is focused on the long game. With a growing ecosystem, real-world utility, and a clear development path, Coldware (COLD) is an investment that could bring significant returns for those seeking stability and growth in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market.

But using the company’s latest experimental model, which is based on total addressable market and projected market penetration across multiple sectors, Ark has now forecasted a bull-case price of $2.4 million by 2030. The bull-case projection figure, which is 60% more than Ark’s initial estimate, is based on a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 72% from last December through the end of 2030. Using this new model, which Puell described as more “aggressive” than Ark’s official methodology, the report estimates a BTC price of $1.2 million in the base case and $500,000 in the bear case. “Institutional investment contributes the most to our bull case,” said Puell, who estimated that Bitcoin would reach a 6.5% penetration rate into the $200 trillion financial market in a best-case scenario (that figure does not include gold). Bitcoin’s acceptance as digital gold also contributed significantly to the ambitious estimate, with the Ark Invest strategist suggesting that the apex crypto could capture up to 60% of the precious metal’s market cap by the end of 2030 in a bull scenario. Bitcoin’s use as a haven in emerging markets was another major contributor to ARK’s $2.4 million bull case forecast. Ark Invest also factored adoption for nation-state and corporate treasury holdings into its Bitcoin price predictions. “We also believe that this more experimental exercise highlights that Bitcoin’s scarcity and lost supply are not reflected in most valuation models today,” Puell added. Will Bitcoin Rocket By 2,400% By 2030? At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $95,151, according to data from CoinGecko. Reaching the $2.4 million Bitcoin price tag would represent a 2,426% increase, which would put BTC’s market cap at a whopping $49 trillion. A $49 trillion valuation would be significantly larger than the combined gross domestic products of the United States and China. It would also position Bitcoin to usurp gold as the largest asset in the world, which currently boasts a market cap of $22 trillion. While Ark’s prediction reflects their strong belief in Bitcoin, it remains to be seen whether the apex crypto can indeed reach those lofty heights.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Cathie Wood,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-26 12:56:48

Hoskinson’s comments have sparked a new debate among crypto enthusiasts, and many are beginning to wonder if Coldware (COLD) could play a pivotal role in this shift — potentially even rising to the stature of Bitcoin (BTC) in the years to come. Could Coldware (COLD) Surpass Ethereum (ETH)? As Hoskinson’s prediction gains traction, another blockchain project is quietly preparing to challenge the established giants. Coldware (COLD) , a relatively new player in the cryptocurrency space, is building a reputation for its DeFi solutions and scalable infrastructure. While Coldware (COLD) is still in the early stages of its development, its upcoming testnet launch in May 2025 could signal the start of something big. Unlike Ethereum (ETH), which has been bogged down by scalability and high fees, Coldware (COLD) is designed with a focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain scalability. The project’s unique approach to smart contract functionality and its commitment to IoT integration through blockchain make it a standout in an increasingly crowded market. With Coldware (COLD)’s mission to integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices into the blockchain ecosystem, it is tapping into a rapidly growing sector that could become a significant driver of future growth. Ethereum’s Challenges: A Looming Downfall? In an interview earlier this month, Charles Hoskinson made headlines when he boldly predicted that Ethereum (ETH) could face significant challenges over the next decade. According to Hoskinson, Ethereum’s reliance on proof-of-work (PoW) and its scalability issues will ultimately hold it back in the rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology. While Ethereum remains one of the most dominant cryptocurrencies today, Hoskinson argues that its inability to adapt to the evolving needs of the blockchain community could see it losing its top spot in the years ahead. Ethereum has indeed faced criticism for its high gas fees and slow transaction speeds, issues that have plagued its network for years. Although the transition to Ethereum 2.0 promises to address these concerns through the implementation of proof-of-stake (PoS) and other scaling solutions, the effectiveness of these changes remains to be seen. Bitcoin’s Position and Coldware’s Future Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the dominant cryptocurrency, recognized as a store of value and a safe haven during times of market uncertainty. But as Coldware (COLD) continues to grow and evolve, many are starting to ask whether Coldware (COLD) could potentially rise to Bitcoin’s (BTC) status. The project’s innovative solutions and focus on real-world use cases position it to become a major player in the crypto ecosystem. Could Coldware (COLD) one day replace Bitcoin as the preferred digital asset for investors? While it’s difficult to say with certainty, there are signs that Coldware (COLD) could emerge as a serious competitor, especially if it can prove its ability to scale, onboard new users, and maintain a high level of security and decentralization. The Rise of Coldware (COLD): A New Era for Blockchain As Coldware (COLD) prepares to launch its testnet and integrate its platform into the IoT space, the project is set to make waves in the world of blockchain. While Sui (SUI) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to dominate the DeFi space, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as a next-generation blockchain solution that could address many of the challenges that have plagued Ethereum for years. By combining PayFi, security, and tokenization, Coldware (COLD) offers a comprehensive solution for users looking to engage in blockchain-based finance and IoT applications. The ability to offer secure, scalable, and interoperable solutions could give Coldware (COLD) a significant advantage over other projects, including Ethereum (ETH) and even Bitcoin (BTC). Hoskinson’s Prediction: A Wake-Up Call for the Industry While Hoskinson’s comments about Ethereum’s (ETH) potential downfall might be seen as controversial, they highlight an important truth in the world of cryptocurrency: innovation is key to long-term survival. The blockchain space is evolving rapidly, and projects that fail to adapt will likely be left behind. As Coldware (COLD) prepares to enter the market with a focus on scalability and real-world use cases, it is positioning itself to be a major contender in the cryptocurrency space. Whether or not Coldware (COLD) can surpass Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) remains to be seen, but the project’s future looks promising. As the testnet launch approaches and the ecosystem continues to grow, Coldware (COLD) is rapidly becoming one of the most exciting projects in the blockchain world.

Cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin capture increasing market focus to lead future price surges in the market. The cryptocurrency market features three assets of note which include MAGACOIN FINANCE alongside Ethereum (ETH) and Sui (SUI). These three digital assets present promising conditions for becoming top-performing investments throughout the upcoming months based on their technical strength and growing momentum together with exclusive investment choices. Ethereum maintains its position as the second biggest cryptocurrency by market value while undergoing extensive network improvements which makes its optimistic outlook exceptionally robust. Both retail investors and institutions have started to focus on Sui since its fast rise while anticipating substantial price shifts across the spring and summer of 2025. The new crypto player MAGACOIN FINANCE builds momentum through its special token system and limited supply features and a temporary bonus which doubles the value of purchases made within its first phase of release. Early investors benefit greatly from this hard to find buying opportunity because they maximize potential market increases. This analysis explores the recent market trends of these three coins together with their future growth potential and control over the crypto market during 2025. Ethereum: A Strong Rebound Could Push ETH Above $3K Soon The Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency displays price sways that have positioned it at $1,784 per token during April 24th 2025. The total market value of Ethereum reaches $214.6 billion per day through approximately $19.9 billion worth of trading activity. During the previous 12 months the Ethereum (ETH) market experienced extensive price volatility because its value reached $4,109 at the peak while dropping to $1,383 at the lowest point. Potential investors looking for an upcoming market swing now face an appealing predicament. Ethereum traders anticipate a minor price decline towards $1,770 during the upcoming weeks that will reach its peak on April 25, 2025. The projections for April through May indicate an enthusiastic rise in the value of assets. The first quarter of 2025 predicts Ethereum to cross the $2,000 threshold before reaching or exceeding $3,000 in its mid-May price surge. During these few weeks Ethereum investors might accomplish gains exceeding 40% from their current positions. What’s going on with MAGACOIN FINANCE? Sui: 230%+ Growth Potential by Mid-2025 The crypto world has taken notice of Sui (SUI) as it demonstrates remarkable growth potential for 2025. The bullish market trends for Sui were reflected by its trading activities between $2.88 and $3.03 on April 24th 2025. Sui displayed remarkable strength during the previous week as it achieved a 38.86% rise in its value because of intensifying investor interest. The price movement of Sui has shown major volatility through its historical values which reached $0.59 in 2023 before ascending to $5.35 in early 2025. The recent market decline of Sui seems to have triggered a strong recovery as experts forecast price levels of $4.40 to $4.42 during April 2025. The ongoing market trends suggest Sui will reach a price of $9.85 during late May 2025 leading to a remarkable rise of over 230% . MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rare Opportunity for Early Buyers MAGACOIN FINANCE is a promising emerging cryptocurrency that remains below key thresholds — historically where high-return cycles begin. Despite still being in its early stages, MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a unique opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on an undervalued asset with significant growth potential. Its innovative tokenomics, built-in scarcity, and the added advantage of a limited-time 50% bonus via the MAGA50X code make it an appealing choice for those seeking to enter before the project takes off. The positioning of MAGACOIN FINANCE below these crucial thresholds makes it an attractive option for those looking to get in on the ground floor of a potential breakout success. Analysts are already drawing comparisons between MAGACOIN FINANCE and top-performing cryptocurrencies from previous bull markets, recognizing its potential to follow a similar trajectory. With increasing institutional interest, growing community support, and heightened investor excitement, MAGACOIN FINANCE is on track to become one of the standout projects of 2025. The Future of MAGACOIN FINANCE and Other Cryptos in 2025 In the broader crypto market the upcoming year 2025 indicates major expansion prospects for Ethereum, Sui and MAGACOIN FINANCE. The total cryptocurrency portfolio consists of unique features among Ethereum and Sui where short-term Ethereum recovery stands beside Sui’s strong potential for lasting growth but both assets remain in close observation. MAGACOIN FINANCE features the combination of early market position and built-in scarcity elements and strategic bonus arrangements which creates an attractive investment opportunity for substantial profitability. Conclusion: Why You Should Consider MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and Sui The recovery phase of the market presents Ethereum, Sui and MAGACOIN FINANCE as separate investment avenues that yield potential maximum returns during 2025. All three digital currencies — Ethereum alongside Sui — together with MAGACOIN FINANCE — each provide different investment potentials for the upcoming crypto rally because of their essential characteristics and market advantages.

Bitcoin’s rally past the $95,000 resistance is the highlight, with altcoins like Official Trump and Sui outperforming most others. Bitcoin’s decoupling from stock, the comeback of the digital Gold narrative, and Trump’s softening stance on tariffs supported this week’s gains. Table of Contents Bitcoin, altcoin weekly performance TRUMP, SUI outperform Institutional demand is up Santiment shows… TRUMP, SUI price forecast Why altcoins could rally soon Bitcoin, altcoin weekly performance Bitcoin ( BTC ) is currently hovering under $95,000, a key level for the most prominent cryptocurrency. At last check Saturday, BTC was down 0.45%, trading at around $94,358.49. Observers noted that it recovered from its most recent flash crash, where the asset slipped to its lowest level in nearly five months. With Bitcoin back above key support zones, traders eye the $100,000 milestone and a re-test of the all-time high in the coming weeks. Demand for crypto remains strong, and sentiment is turning positive. For the first time in several weeks, traders are “greedy”, as seen on the Fear & Greed Index at Alternative. Crypto Fear & Greed Index | Source: Alternative Altcoins followed in Bitcoin’s footsteps and recovered losses. Most cryptos posted double-digit rallies this week, erasing losses from the BTC flash crash in the second week of April 2025. TRUMP, SUI outperform The Official Trump token ( TRUMP ) and Sui ( SUI ) are two tokens that outperformed most other altcoins with their seven-day gains, 79% and 70% respectively. Technical indicators for the two tokens show likelihood for an extension of their rallies in the coming weeks. The price of President Donald Trump’s meme coin surged only after it was announced that the top 220 holders would be invited to a gala dinner with him next month, with the top 25 also attending a VIP reception and White House tour. The White House crypto office said it isn’t associated with the event, and the dinner could personally benefit the Trump family by boosting the coin’s value. Despite the rally, $TRUMP remains well below its $75 peak from January. Still, as risk appetite grows among traders, TRUMP and SUI holders stand to gain and see profit-taking opportunities if the upward momentum in the two tokens is sustained. Bitcoin and altcoins are set to close a strong week while Trump softens his stance on tariffs and maintains support for U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The digital Gold narrative is making a comeback as Bitcoin decouples from tech stocks and traders’ portfolios could benefit from adding a safe-haven asset structurally different from equities.

RSI reads 69, shy of the “overvalued” or “overbought” level at 70 and MACD flashes consecutively taller green histogram bars above the neutral line. If TRUMP’s positive momentum is sustained, the meme coin could flip resistance into support and rally 34% to test $18.22, a sticky level for the token. Two key resistances on TRUMP’s path as it breaks into a rally are $22.42 and $30.60. TRUMP/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news SUI trades at $3.5791 at the time of writing. The DeFi token could extend its rally by another 12% and test resistance at $4.0105, for the first time since February 2025. The $3.8588 level, a lower boundary of a Fair Value Gap on the daily price chart, is a hurdle in the token’s uptrend. SUI could find support in the FVG between $2.7488 and $2.8950, in the event of a correction. The MACD, one of the two key momentum indicators, supports gains in the token and implies an underlying positive momentum in SUI’s uptrend. RSI is currently in the “overbought” zone above 70, this generates a sell signal. However, unless other indicators point at a trend reversal, SUI could extend its price rally. SUI/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Why altcoins could rally soon Bitcoin’s recent gains and return above the $95,000 level could be a fleeting moment in the market cycle since on-chain data shows that BTC demand is still contracting, though not as fast as before. Bitcoin apparent demand | Source: CryptoQuant CryptoQuant data shows that momentum from new investors has dropped sharply and hit its lowest level since October 2024. While ETF flows may have steadied for now, liquidity growth is below market expectations and this is not a recipe for a sustained price rally in Bitcoin. A slowdown in Bitcoin could direct capital to altcoins, paving way for a rally, sustained gains in meme tokens and alternative cryptocurrencies until BTC demand rises.

Finance Minister Lan Fo’an said in Washington that China would roll out “more proactive and effective macro policies” to reach its target and help stabilize the global economy, according to a statement posted on the Ministry of Finance’s website on Saturday. Lan also attacked the rise of trade protectionism and called on global institutions to defend free trade rules. He said China would stay open to international markets despite growing barriers. China’s economy grew 5.4% last quarter compared to a year earlier. That boost came from consumer subsidies and a rush to export goods before more US tariffs took effect. Still, big names like UBS, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Societe Generale have cut their growth forecasts for China’s 2025 economy to around 4% or even lower. Those doubts didn’t stop Lan, who repeated that China will make sure to hit the 5% number by pushing harder on economic support policies. China slams tariffs and leans on World Bank allies People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng backed up Lan’s position at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings. Pan said the driving force behind global growth is weak and blamed the US for “wantonly imposing tariffs, seriously infringing upon the legitimate rights and interests of various countries,” in a separate statement posted on the central bank’s website. Pan added that China had a good start to 2025 with more positive economic signs and promised that macro policies would be even more proactive this year. Foreign Minister Wang Yi also spoke out against US trade moves during a China-Central Asia meeting in Kazakhstan. Wang said Beijing would stick to international rules, stand against protectionism, and push other countries to join them. He said the US showed “extreme egoism” and accused it of bullying other nations. The Foreign Ministry posted Wang’s comments, where he said China will work with others to “inject stability into the world” by standing for multilateralism. Confusion over US-China trade talks continued. US President Donald Trump claimed in an interview on Friday that negotiations were happening. But Beijing denied any such talks were underway, showing once again that the two sides aren’t even on the same page about basic facts. In Washington, Lan attended meetings where officials agreed that the World Bank should better use its resources to support private sector growth in critical sectors like infrastructure, energy, and manufacturing. They pushed the Bank to move faster with reforms, boost its financing operations, and stick to the Lima Principles while moving toward the 2025 equity review. Lan praised the World Bank’s goal of promoting jobs to help poor countries break free from poverty. He also quoted President Xi Jinping, who said China wants to invest more resources in trade and cooperation to help developing countries modernize. Xi called for fewer “small yards and high walls” and more bridges between countries to create prosperity. Lan said trade protectionism is creating huge risks for global poverty reduction and development. He asked organizations like the World Bank to keep pushing the principles of free and non-discriminatory trade. Lan stressed that China has been a major player in global economic growth, contributing around 30% over the last few years. China’s long-term plan, according to Lan, includes sticking with reforms, opening up even more, and giving zero-tariff access to all products from the world’s least developed countries that have diplomatic ties with Beijing. He said China will continue to share its massive domestic market with the world to ensure mutual benefits. Lan also joined the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, a top-level meeting where finance ministers talked about how to fix problems with debt vulnerabilities and liquidity for developing countries. Lan exchanged ideas with other countries to find ways to boost financial stability without adding more pressure on weak economies. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

It is their first back-to-back winning week in five weeks. The 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs alone received $380 million in inflows on April 25, according to Farside data. It was the previous time momentum was this high during the week ended March 21, showing a strong bounce back of investor sentiment in investment products tied to Bitcoin. Analyst: Bitcoin ETFs ‘Shift from 1st Gear to 5th Gear ETF analyst Eric Balchunas attributed the swift turnaround, describing it as a Bitcoin “bender,” in an April 24 tweet. Balchunas cited the rapid surge in inflows, noting how rapidly sentiment can turn from conservative to bold. He speculated that the “basis trade” could have been partially responsible, wherein investors arbitrage the price difference between spot Bitcoin and futures contracts. April Turns Positive Despite Earlier Volatility April has been a volatile month for Bitcoin ETFs, with nine of the first 18 trading days seeing outflows. But the recent buying rush has totally transformed the scenario. Due to this strong week, April’s total net inflows have become positive, standing at around $2.26 billion. This turn of events illustrates how spot Bitcoin ETFs can quickly bounce back even in the face of greater macroeconomic uncertainty. Institutional Optimism Boosts Bitcoin Sentiment Institutional enthusiasm continues to grow. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, speaking at the Bitwise Invest Bitcoin Corporations Investor Day, boldly predicted that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF could become the largest ETF globally within the next decade. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT was recently honored with two major accolades — “Best New ETF” and “Crypto ETP of the Year” — at the etf.com annual awards ceremony, further boosting its credibility among investors. Bitcoin Price Outlook Is Bullish Bitcoin’s price remains steady, in the $94,600 zone at this time of writing. Institutions are getting increasingly bullish about Bitcoin in the long term. ARK Invest, for instance, recently published revised Bitcoin price targets, elevating its “bull case” to $2.4 million by 2030. Even its “bear” and “base” case projections have surged significantly, underlining a widespread view that Bitcoin is solidifying its status as “digital gold” in a rapidly fluidizing financial world.",Blockchain|Sticky,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-26 13:02:32

The Nasdaq-listed firm, previously a real estate financing platform connecting commercial property lenders and buyers, announced its plans in a Form S-3 registration statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 25. The filing states that the funds will be used for general corporate purposes, including Solana ( SOL ) token acquisitions. DeFi Development Corp S-3 filing. Source: SEC According to the filing, the company may use proceeds from the offering to purchase more Solana, noting: “Solana does not pay interest, but staking rewards can be earned on Solana. The ability to generate a return on investment from the net proceeds from this offering will depend on whether there is appreciation in the value of Solana following our purchases of Solana with the net proceeds from this offering.” The company also warned that fluctuations in Solana’s price could lead to it converting the tokens into cash at a value “substantially below” the net proceeds raised. Related: Deloitte predicts $4T tokenized real estate on blockchain by 2035 Janover was a real estate financing company connecting lenders and buyers of commercial properties before a team of former Kraken exchange executives bought 728,632 shares of its common stock on April 7. Joseph Onorati, former chief strategy officer at Kraken, has since been appointed as chairman and CEO. The announcement comes shortly after the leadership of DeFi Development Corp adopted a Solana treasury reserve, “by applying a proven public-market treasury model to an asset that’s earlier in its lifecycle, structurally reflexive, and vastly underexposed as compared to Bitcoins.” The firm’s new Solana investment treasury has drawn comparisons to Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has amassed over 538,200 Bitcoin ( BTC ) as of April 20 — the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder. The firm’s board of directors approved the company’s Solana-focused treasury policy on April 4, authorizing long-term accumulation and the launch of Solana validators to enable the staking of its treasury asset. Parker White, the firm’s chief investment officer, who previously served as an engineering director at Kraken exchange, already runs a Solana validator with $75 million in delegated stake. Related: US banks are ‘free to begin supporting Bitcoin’ — Michael Saylor Regulatory concerns remain for Solana investment While the Solana-focused treasury implementation marks a significant step for altcoin adoption, the firm remains concerned by the potential effects of opaque crypto regulations, according to the filing: “We may be subject to regulatory developments related to crypto assets and crypto asset markets, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.” The firm cites unclear regulations around digital assets, which may “adversely affect the price of Solana” and, in turn, impact “the market price of our common stock.” The firm noted that Solana’s potential “reclassifying” as a security remains a particular concern, which may lead to the firm being classified as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. However, the firm’s share price has been benefiting from its Solana acquisitions. Its shares rose by over 12% when DeFi Development Corp added $11.5 million worth of Solana tokens to its treasury on April 22, Cointelegraph reported. “The decision by commercial property platform Janover to add SOL to its treasury is truly groundbreaking,” Chris Chung, founder of Solana-based swap platform Titan, told Cointelegraph. “I’m confident we will see many other businesses follow suit before long as crypto becomes increasingly adopted by traditional finance.” Magazine: Ripple says SEC lawsuit ‘over,’ Trump at DAS, and more: Hodler’s Digest, March 16 – 22",,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-26 13:02:42

The fake companies were registered under business names and even had rental properties associated with their registration. Three businesses have been identified, including Blocknovas, Softglide, and Angeloper Agency. This forms a sophisticated attack that incorporates elements of social engineering to lure potential targets into spreading crypto-stealing malware. Angeloper Agency was the one business that was not registered as a legal entity. The other two firms, Blocknovas and Softglide, were registered. The FBI seized Blocknovas’ website and stated that North Korean hackers created the site, which used fake job postings to distribute malware. The shell companies, Blocknovas, Angeloper, and Softglide, spread malware through fake job interviews. An extensive network of job postings was used to lure people into clicking on the website. Two of the companies, Blocknovas and Softglide, were registered as legal companies, thus making it easy for the fake recruiters to post job vacancies on third-party websites. The job postings targeted crypto developers. During the signup process, an error message occurred, requiring a manual fix, which then allowed the malware to be installed. Three types of Malware were used for the attack. These include BeaverTail, Invisible Ferret, and Otter Cookie. BeaverTail is used to steal information and to pave the way for further malware attacks. InvisibleFerret and OtterCookie are used to steal crypto keys and copy clipboard data. Blocknovas was the primary website for the attack. Most of the job applicants went through this website. This is why the FBI seized the Blocknovas site and warned visitors about what the site was doing. American officials claim that the hack forms a broader pattern of North Korean hackers stealing funds to raise hard currency. The hackers are stealing cryptocurrency because the proceeds can be easily anonymized. The hackers, further, need hard currencies to fund their nuclear programmes in North Korea. The strategy has been very successful, with many large-scale attacks occurring regularly. North Korea, allegedly, has dispatched thousands of IT workers to collect as much funding as possible to finance their expensive nuclear weapons research and development programme. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned North Korea for developing nuclear weapons. Any American business that works with North Korea is breaching the OFAC sanctions. Crypto investors, meanwhile, have just another security concern to contend with. Cryptocurrencies are very effective at sending funds across borders. Unfortunately, the exact mechanisms that can secure funds can also be used to secure a hacker’s stolen funds. There may be a greater demand for security experts in the crypto field to address the growing number of security breaches occurring.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|North Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-26 13:07:58

Deloitte predicts $4 trillion tokenized real estate on blockchain by 2035 Over $4 trillion worth of real estate could be tokenized on blockchain networks during the next decade, potentially offering investors greater access to property ownership opportunities, according to a new report. The Deloitte Center for Financial Services predicts that over $4 trillion worth of real estate may be tokenized by 2035, up from less than $300 billion in 2024. The report, published April 24, estimates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 27%. The $4 trillion of tokenized property is predicted to stem from the benefits of blockchain-based assets, as well as a structural shift across real estate and property ownership. Global tokenized real estate value, growth predictions. Source: Deloitte “Real estate itself is undergoing transformation. Post-pandemic work-from-home trends, climate risk, and digitization have reshaped property fundamentals,” according to Chris Yin, co-founder of Plume Network, a blockchain built for real-world assets (RWAs) . “Office buildings are being repurposed into AI data centers, logistics hubs and energy-efficient residential communities,” Yin told Cointelegraph. “Investors want targeted access to these modern use cases, and tokenization enables programmable, customizable exposure to such evolving asset profiles,” he said. Crypto banking rule withdrawal by Fed “not real progress” — Senator Lummis United States Senator Cynthia Lummis says the crypto industry may be celebrating too soon over the US Federal Reserve softening its crypto guidance for banks. “The Fed withdrawing crypto guidance is just noise, not real progress,” Lummis said in an April 25 X post. Lummis called the Fed’s April 24 announcement — withdrawing its 2022 supervisory letter that had discouraged banks from engaging with crypto and stablecoin activities — “just lip service.” Lummis, a pro-crypto advocate known for introducing the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill in July 2024, pointed out several flaws in the Fed’s announcement, even as Strategy founder Michael Saylor and crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano suggested it was a step forward for banks and crypto. She argued that the Fed continues to “illegally flout the law on master accounts” and still relies on reputational risk in its bank supervision practices. Lummis also highlighted the Fed’s policy statement in Section 9(13), which hasn’t been withdrawn, stating that Bitcoin and digital assets are considered “unsafe and unsound.” SEC chair suggests “huge benefits” in agency’s third crypto roundtable In one of his first appearances as the recently sworn-in chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Paul Atkins delivered remarks to the agency’s third roundtable discussion of crypto regulation. In the “Know Your Custodian” roundtable event on April 25, Atkins said he expected “huge benefits” from blockchain technology through efficiency, risk mitigation, transparency, and cutting costs. He reiterated that among his goals at the SEC would be to facilitate “clear regulatory rules of the road” for digital assets, hinting that the agency under former chair Gary Gensler had contributed to market and regulatory uncertainty. “I look forward to engaging with market participants and working with colleagues in President Trump’s administration and Congress to establish a rational fit-for-purpose framework for crypto assets,” said Atkins.

Schlegel concedes that Bitcoin can have a high level of liquidity at times, but during crises, this liquidity can become less stable. Schlegel further states that Bitcoin is well known for its volatility, experiencing wild swings in market prices, which prevents the digital asset from being used to preserve long-term value. Schlegel concluded that Bitcoin is not an appropriate asset for the SNB’s reserve at this time. The Bitcoin Initiative, a group advocating for an SNB reserve, argued that SNB investments grew by about 10% since 2015. Using a back-of-the-envelope analysis, if the SNB added 1% of Bitcoin to its reserve, it would have nearly doubled its returns. Moreover, the volatility of the SNB portfolio would have only increased slightly. The Bitcoin Initiative concluded that Bitcoin’s volatility should not be analyzed in isolation, but rather considered in conjunction with the other assets in the current portfolio. The Bitcoin Initiative further noted that Bitcoin was resilient to market stress, highly liquid even with large sums of capital, and remained available even on bank holidays. Schlegel, however, disagreed with the Bitcoin Initiative and said a reserve needs a high level of liquidity to buy and sell foreign currencies at a rapid rate. He also reiterates that Bitcoin has very high volatility, making it difficult for the SNB to include it in its portfolio. Schlegel states that SNB needs to maintain control over the reliability of the bank’s reserves. The extremely high volatility of Bitcoin makes the currency a risky asset for the bank. SNB, therefore, maintains a conservative stance regarding cryptocurrencies, despite many advocates pushing for a Bitcoin reserve. There is a lot of interest in adopting a Bitcoin reserve in Switzerland. Yet, at this point, SNB’s Schlegel is not convinced about the suitability of Bitcoin for the Swiss bank. The Bitcoin Initiative, meanwhile, believes that the SNB should urgently consider a Bitcoin reserve to offset the risks caused by Trump’s tariffs. They believe that the bank should consider diversifying its reserves and include a currency that has been referred to as digital gold. A referendum campaign has started to change the constitution and force the SNB to hold both Bitcoin and gold reserves. Schlegel, however, remains firm with his strategy, saying that liquidity and volatility are factors that discount Bitcoin. He claims that the bank should be able to buy and sell currencies at any time. Schlegel has opposed the idea of a Bitcoin reserve in the past. Last month, he stated that the SNB has no plans to buy cryptocurrencies. He argued that foreign exchange reserves are strictly for implementing monetary policy. Schlegel mentioned that crypto proves difficult to preserve value over time due to its significant price fluctuations. He also pointed out that crypto was software and could be prone to security risks such as data breaches and software bugs. Time will tell whether the SNB will change its strategy or maintain a conservative approach focused on implementing monetary policy.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|swiss,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-26 13:20:59

BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Accounts For Nearly 3% Of Entire BTC Supply It might be pocket change when considering BlackRock currently boasts trillions of dollars in assets under management, but it hasn’t gone unnoticed that the asset management giant’s Bitcoin ETF stash is closing in on 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. “BlackRock is accumulating. They now hold 2.77% of the entire Bitcoin supply,” Arkham Intelligence wrote to X on Friday, noting the Wall Street behemoth had added a staggering $1.2 billion in BTC this week alone. As of April 26, BlackRock held approximately 582,000 BTC via IBIT, worth around $54 billion. That makes it the 33rd biggest exchange-traded fund by assets under management. In comparison, the largest ETF by market cap, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), boasts a market capitalization of $593.5 billion, more than ten times that of IBIT. However, speaking at the Bitcoin Standard Corporation’s Investor Day, Strategy’s Michael Saylor forecasted that “IBIT will be the biggest ETF in the world in ten years.” NEW: @saylor predicts that @BlackRock ’s $IBIT will be “the biggest ETF in the world in ten years.” pic.twitter.com/cyDDFf47FV — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 24, 2025 Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas concurred with Saylor that IBIT could potentially become the world’s biggest ETF, though he stressed that it would be extraordinary. “It’s possible, especially if IBIT starts taking in more cash than VOO, but that would require inflows well north of $1 billion a day — more likely in the range of $3 to $4 billion daily, to gain ground. In short, some extraordinary things would have to happen, but it’s possible,” Balchunas said. It’s pertinent to note that this is not Saylor’s first insanely optimistic Bitcoin-related prediction. As ZyCrypto reported previously, the tech entrepreneur said he thinks the crypto will rocket to a price of $13 million per coin over a 21-year period. Saylor’s company currently holds 538,200 BTC , worth roughly $51 billion. Bitcoin recently changed hands at $94,969, up 1.5% over the past 24 hours.

While big names like Solana keep dominating the headlines, a new contender is starting to emerge—and it’s quickly becoming impossible to ignore. That project is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM , and it’s capturing attention with the kind of early-stage momentum investors dream about. While million-dollar transformations are rare, they all start with one factor: early positioning. And right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is where that positioning begins. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Ground as a Top Discovery Token Not every new crypto launch can hold the spotlight. MAGACOINFINANCE , however, isn’t just holding it—it’s expanding it. With a steadily growing user base, transparent updates, and a roadmap that’s being executed with real precision, it’s separating itself from the flood of noise in the early-stage market. This isn’t a typical short-term pump. It’s a calculated project rollout supported by community engagement, wallet growth, and increasing visibility across analyst platforms. The best part? It’s still early—and early is where real opportunity lives. For seasoned traders, MAGACOINFINANCE is looking like one of the few new names that could actually make a long-term impact. Other Movers in Focus: Polkadot, Kaspa, and Aptos Polkadot remains one of the most innovative networks in interoperability. Its parachain model allows developers to build specialized blockchains, all while staying connected to a broader ecosystem. Kaspa is being talked about more and more for its speed and its unique take on consensus. It offers something rare—a scalable proof-of-work system that doesn’t compromise on decentralization or performance. Aptos continues to shine in the Layer-1 race. With a new approach to transaction execution and a developer-first mindset, it’s drawing a steady wave of projects onto its platform. Each of these assets is building toward a bigger footprint. But right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is the one still wide open for discovery. Final Word From $1,200 to millions? That’s the kind of vision that built this industry.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 244,900 followers on the social media platform X that Pepe ( PEPE ) memecoin is primed to go up by around 100% after undergoing consolidation and accumulation in a manner similar to 2024. “PEPE also went through a three-month accumulation/consolidation cycle in the late third quarter of 2024 and then had another run in December. It’s currently in the same exact region in the same consolidation. I expect PEPE to do a 2x or something from the bottom at a minimum.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X PEPE is trading at $0.00000884 at time of writing, up by around 23% over the past seven days. On what has replaced the altcoin seasons, the widely followed analyst says, “There are no more altcoin seasons, get that framing out of your head for now. Instead, you have one to three months of good times and then two to six months of bad times/chop.” Over the near term, the pseudonymous analyst says that Bitcoin staying above a key psychological support level represents bullish opportunities for altcoins. “These are dip-buying opportunities in my opinion. BTC is above $90,000 and the entire environment’s looking a lot better; don’t s**t yourself when altcoins take that first 20% dip.

This suggests that an end to the tariff wars which began in January 2025 could be drawing to an end. Taking this as a sign, Bitcoin whales have begun to make moves once again. So far, they have bought almost 20,000 BTC, with BTC exchange outflows rising to levels not seen in over two years. Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Reach February 2023 Levels According to the on-chain data tracking platform CryptoQuant, more BTC has been flowing out of exchanges at levels that have not been seen in two years. This data was taken on a 100-day moving average basis and shows netflows are down significantly from not only 2025 and 2024, but dating as far back as 2023. Related Reading: Is The XRP Price Rally Over At $2.22? New Developments Suggest Major Pump Is Coming CryptoQuant’s data shows that Bitcoin net flows from all exchanges have crashed by more than 50% in the last year. Currently, it is sitting so low that the last time it was this low was back in January 2023, when the crypto market was just coming out of the impact of the FTX crypto exchange collapse. When net flows are this low, it suggests that Bitcoin investors are choosing to accumulate rather than sell. It points to withdrawals from exchanges into private storage, with investors holding onto their BTC in anticipation of higher prices before they begin to sell. “This essentially indicates the highest Bitcoin outflow from exchanges since that date,” CryptoQuant explained in the post. “A review of historical patterns suggests that this could imply re-accumulation of assets by investors.” BTC Whales Are Turning Bullish Again The recent Bitcoin price rise seems to be driven by bulls who had taken the reduced price to accumulate large amounts of BTC in a very short time. Santiment reported on this development, showing how the 11% Bitcoin price rise could have been driven by the buying activities of these large investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Recovery At Stake If This Level Doesn’t Hold, Crash Could Erase Gains The post shows that investors holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC had gone on a buying spree in the last week. In total, they added 19,255 more BTC to their balances in only seven days. This shows that whales had realized how undervalued the BTC price was and had seized the opportunity to secure profits quickly. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was trending around $94,578, showing strong staying power from the bulls.

The flagship cryptocurrency went past $95,000 on Friday, rising to $95,620, but lost momentum and declined to its current level of $94,285. Analysts predict BTC could reclaim $100,000 and potentially rally to a new all-time high if bullish momentum picks up. Bitcoin (BTC) Poised For Strongest Weekly Gain Bitcoin’s 11% jump to crack the $95,000 ceiling is on track to become its strongest weekly performance since November 2024. The flagship cryptocurrency pushed above $95,000 Friday before registering a marginal decline. BTC is marginally up over the past 24 hours as it looks to build momentum and reclaim $95,000. The broader crypto market also continued its positive momentum, with most cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL) trading upwards. The gains indicate that the markets have overcome the early-April turmoil created by economic uncertainty and Trump’s tariffs. ETFs have also bounced back, recording $2.68 billion in net inflows this week, the highest since December, according to data from SoSoValue. The flagship cryptocurrency’s resilience highlights its decoupling from traditional macro assets. David Duong, Global Head of Research at Coinbase Institutional, stated, “It’s rare to witness market inflection points in real-time, as we only tend to recognize major regime shifts with the benefit of time and reflection. This week’s decoupling of Bitcoin’s performance from that of traditional macro assets may be as close as we come to such a moment. In our view, this divergence highlights bitcoin’s maturing role as a store-of-value asset—one that is increasingly being viewed by institutional and retail investors alike as resilient against the macroeconomic forces affecting risk assets more broadly.” Swiss National Bank Dismisses Bitcoin Reserve An official from the Swiss National Bank has dismissed calls for adding Bitcoin to its reserves as a hedge against the ongoing macroeconomic turmoil. According to a report by Reuters, Swiss National Bank Chairman Martin Schlegel stated that cryptocurrency cannot fulfill the requirements of Switzerland’s currency reserves. The comments come amid growing pressure from the crypto industry to add BTC to the bank’s reserves. Luzius Meisser, a board member of cryptocurrency broker Bitcoin Suisse, stated, “Holding Bitcoin makes more sense as the world shifts towards a multipolar order. The need is even more dire now that the dollar and the euro are weakening.” This is not the first time the Swiss National Bank under Schlegel has pushed back against the idea of adding Bitcoin to its reserves. Schlegel had earlier stated he did not want to create a Bitcoin reserve in Switzerland due to the asset’s volatility. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a marginal decline during the ongoing session as selling pressure around $95,000 prevents a push higher. The flagship cryptocurrency has had a bullish week, rising over 11%, and is on track to post its highest weekly gain since November 2024. One analyst believes BTC is gearing up for a massive price surge that could take it to $150,000 or beyond. The analyst pointed out that $89,000-$90,000 were key levels for BTC , stating that if the price fell below this level, it would have to wait for momentum to return. Additionally, Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) has formed a Golden Cross with its 365-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). BTC has also reported a significant rise in its Apparent Demand. The indicator returned to positive territory after spending several weeks in the red. Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand measures the cumulative net demand for BTC over the past 30 days, tracking wallet accumulation and exchange outflows. An increase in this metric suggests strong buying pressure and bullish sentiment, leading to a potential rally. This is the first time since February that the Apparent Demand has turned positive, aligning with growing spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and accumulation by long-term holders. According to John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lender Ledn, markets will remain choppy over the next week, but the flagship cryptocurrency should reclaim $100,000. “My expectations continue to be for a rally to $133-$136k into the end of this year, beginning of next.” BTC crossed the 50-day SMA on Thursday, rising 1.10% and settling at $84,956. The price lost momentum on Friday, registering a marginal drop and settling at $84,518. Sentiment changed over the weekend as BTC registered an increase of 0.61% to reclaim $85,000 and settle at $85,033. The price continued to push higher on Sunday despite selling pressure, registering a marginal increase and settling at $85,224. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price surged past $87,000 and settled at $87,508. BTC rallied on Tuesday, rising almost 7% to surge past $90,000 and settle at $93,373. Source: TradingView However, the rally lost momentum Wednesday as BTC encountered volatility and selling pressure. Despite this, the price rose 0.40% and settled at $93,749. Sellers drove BTC to a low of $91,693 on Thursday. However, buyers did not cede ground to the bears, and the price rebounded from this level to cross $94,000 and settle at $94,009. Buyers retained control on Friday as BTC registered an increase of almost 1% and $84,776, but not before reaching an intraday high of $95,865. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally down during the current session as it attempts to overwhelm the overhead resistance. If BTC breaks above this level, it could reclaim $100,000 and push toward its all-time high. However, if the price dips below $90,000, it could signal buyer exhaustion.

Gold’s Drop Could Trigger Massive XRP Rally!,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-set-for-1000-rally-golds-drop-could-trigger-massive-xrp-rally/,"The post XRP Set for 1000% Rally? Gold’s Drop Could Trigger Massive XRP Rally! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While the crypto market has been moving sideways for months, something interesting is happening with XRP. In the past, when gold slowed down after a strong run, XRP went on a huge 1,000% rally. Now, with gold cooling off and the Ripple vs SEC case nearly over, many are wondering — is it finally XRP’s time to shine again? XRP Could Be Ready For Breakout Over the past few months, gold has been performing extremely well, climbing nearly 89% from October 2023 to April 2025. While gold kept breaking records, the crypto market, including Bitcoin and XRP, has seen a modest increase, not as much as of gold surge. However, things are starting to change now. Gold has pulled back slightly from its peak, dropping about 6% and is now trading around $3,318 . At the same time, Bitcoin is bouncing back, this week, it climbed to $95,000 with an 11% gain, showing that the crypto market might be waking up again. Meanwhile, XRP has been trying to stay strong above the $2 mark, but hasn’t shown much of a jump over the period yet. History Could Repeat for XRP Interestingly, this pattern looks very similar to what happened in 2020. Back then, gold had a strong run while crypto stayed weak. But when gold started slowing down, XRP and the rest of the crypto market shot up. In 2020, XRP rose from just $0.17 to around $1.96, a gain of over 1,000% even though Ripple was still fighting a major lawsuit with the SEC at the time. Although now the SEC case against Ripple is also close to ending, which could remove a big risk for XRP and give it more room to fly higher. Could XRP Do It Again? However popular crypto analyst named Cryptarch on TradingView believes XRP could soon go higher. He expects the price to move up step-by-step, first testing important levels like $2.49, $3.00, and $3.39. He even thinks XRP might even jump to $6.50 soon, which would be almost a 200% increase from where it is now. Giving an even more hopeful prediction, crypto supporter Davinci Jeremie says XRP could reach $24 this year. As of now, XRP is trading at around $2.20 , reflecting a slight rise seen in the last 24 hours with a market cap hitting $128 billion.",News,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-26 13:37:17

People across Ukraine said they couldn’t swipe cards at retail stores, hop on public transport, or pay for taxi rides. Mobile payment apps like Apple Pay were also dead, leaving thousands stuck without ways to pay for basic goods and services. Serhiy Naumov, the CEO of Oshchadbank, Ukraine’s government-run savings bank, said on Telegram that a large data center used by the bank had gone down. Naumov confirmed the crash caused widespread banking disruptions. Meanwhile, Nova Poshta, the country’s biggest private post office and a company that now operates outside the country, posted on Facebook that its services had been taken offline due to “technical problems.” Diia, Ukraine’s national digital services platform, also stopped working. The Ministry of Digital Transformation said a technical update at one of its major data centers triggered the collapse. U.S. funding cuts strip Ukraine’s cyber defenses Even though nobody has officially blamed cyberattacks yet, Ukraine has been under nonstop cyber pressure ever since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. As Cryptopolitan reported on Friday, American efforts to help the European nation defend itself have been gutted by Donald Trump’s new White House policies. After Trump was sworn in this January, the administration moved fast to slash budgets across U.S. agencies. Ukraine felt the cuts harder than almost anyone else. Cybersecurity support, military shipments, and even intelligence cooperation all dried up. Critics say Trump’s White House is pushing Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to accept a peace deal that leans heavily toward Russia’s interests. Over the last five years, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) poured more than $200 million into Ukraine’s cybersecurity efforts. The National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command also pitched in with technical support, equipment, and training. Their help kept Ukraine’s government ministries, national bank, telecommunications companies, and power providers running even under heavy Russian cyberattacks. Those lifelines have been yanked. USAID , once Ukraine’s biggest cybersecurity backer, was gutted by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) starting in February. Musk said on X that USAID was “interfering with governments worldwide” and “pushing radical left politics,” but he didn’t show any evidence for his claims. Cybersecurity contracts collapse after White House cuts Dozens of cybersecurity contractors working in Ukraine and the United States have had their deals canceled or frozen, according to eight people familiar with the matter who allegedly spoke to Bloomberg. These were the people helping Ukraine stop Russian hackers from crashing power plants and infiltrating the Cabinet of Ministers, the country’s executive leadership body. American grants had funded cybersecurity at government offices, election infrastructure, gas and energy companies, and even nuclear sites. Some programs were greenlit during Trump’s first term, but the second Trump administration cut them off without warning. The situation got even worse after Russia’s February 2022 invasion, when USAID sharply increased cybersecurity funding to help Ukraine survive the flood of new attacks. Now, with Musk leading the drive to dismantle foreign aid programs, even that backup is gone. This week, Vice President JD Vance warned that if the warring European nations don’t accept the Trump-backed peace deal, the United States might ditch the peace process altogether. That move could slam the door on any future cybersecurity assistance. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Risk appetite appeared to return among crypto investors this week after US President Donald Trump adopted a softer tone, saying that import tariffs on Chinese goods may “come down substantially.” However, the improved investor sentiment “does not guarantee that Bitcoin will avoid volatility over the weekend,” analysts from Bitfinex exchange told Cointelegraph: “Sentiment improvements reduce fragility, but they do not eliminate structural risks like thin weekend liquidity.” “Historically, weekends remain vulnerable to sharp moves — especially when open interest is high and market depth is low,” the analysts said, adding that unexpected macroeconomic news can still increase volatility during low liquidity periods.

BTC/USD, 1-year chart. Source: Cointelegraph Bitcoin fell below $75,000 on Sunday, April 6, despite initially decoupling from the US stock market’s $3.5 trillion drop on April 4 after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that Trump’s tariffs may affect the economy and raise inflation. The correction was exacerbated by the lack of weekend liquidity and the fact that Bitcoin was the only large liquid asset available for de-risking, industry watchers told Cointelegraph. Related: US banks are ‘free to begin supporting Bitcoin’ — Michael Saylor “While improved sentiment creates a more stable foundation, cryptocurrency markets are still susceptible to rapid movements during periods of reduced trading volume,” according to Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and chief operating officer of RedStone blockchain oracle firm. “The sentiment recovery provides some cushioning, but traders should remain cautious as weekend liquidity constraints can still amplify price movements regardless of the current market mood,” he told Cointelegraph. Crypto investors may have “maxed out on tariff-related fears” Cryptocurrency markets may have priced in the full extent of tariff-related concerns, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen. “It feels like we’ve maxed out on tariff-related fear,” she told Cointelegraph, adding: “While many remain uncertain about where things are headed over the next month or so, it also seems like markets were just waiting for the slightest signal that we’re back in the game.” “Whether the rally is sustainable depends on whether we can break through previous resistance levels, at least in isolation. It could have legs, as markets now seem to believe there’s a ‘Trump put’ under equities, the US dollar and US Treasurys,” Barthere added, warning of more potential volatility amid the upcoming negotiations. Nansen previously predicted a 70% chance that crypto markets will bottom and start a recovery by June, but highlighted that the timing will depend on the outcome of tariff negotiations.

This exciting move could bring more investors into XRP and open the door for bigger developments in the United States. With experts predicting that billions of dollars could soon flow into XRP products. However, this could pump the XRP price by 1000%. First XRP ETF Goes Live in Brazil In a big win for the XRP community, Brazil’s B3 stock exchange has launched the world’s first XRP ETF. The fund, called XRPH11, is managed by Hashdex and Genial Investimentos. It will track the Nasdaq XRP Reference Price Index, making it easier for investors to gain safe and regulated exposure to XRP. According to Hashdex, the ETF will invest at least 95% of its assets directly in XRP or in other products like futures contracts that copy XRP’s price movements. This setup allows both regular and big investors to invest in XRP without needing to own or store the cryptocurrency themselves. Brazil Moves Ahead, US Still Waiting Interestingly, this major step happened in Brazil, not in the United States, where Ripple is based. In the US, companies like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton have already filed for XRP ETFs, but they are still waiting for approval from the SEC. Meanwhile, the demand for XRP-related investment products is growing fast. As of April 18, XRP-focused ETPs had about $950 million in assets under management, according to CoinShares . Just last week, XRP funds saw $37.7 million in new money, leading all other crypto funds. Even bigger things could be on the horizon. JPMorgan predicted earlier this year that XRP products could pull in up to $8 billion — almost eight times more than today. XRP Price Outlook Even after this big news, XRP’s price hasn’t moved much. It is still trading around $2.20, with only a small 0.8% rise in the last 24 hours. But many believe that if an XRP ETF gets approved in the US, the price could shoot up. Although XRP has been moving slowly for some time, signs are starting to look more exciting. In the past, when gold slowed down after a strong rally, XRP went up by 1,000% . Now, with gold pulling back again, some experts think XRP could rise sharply and even reach $24 this year.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-26 14:00:36

According to the company’s analysis, as investors’ risk appetite increases, the likelihood of increased volatility in the market is also increasing. According to Glassnode data, open interest in futures markets has increased significantly recently. Since the beginning of March, open interest has accumulated to a total of 281 thousand BTC, up 15.6%. This suggests that investors are starting to use more leverage and price movements may become more abrupt. In particular, the probability of sudden price changes liquidating investors or triggering stop-loss orders increases. Despite this, the average funding rate has fallen to -0.023%, indicating that the market is predominantly short. The funding rate can be defined as an interest rate paid to balance the price difference between futures contracts and the spot market. Negative funding implies that more investors are positioning for Bitcoin to fall. Related News: Bloomberg Analyst Mike McGlone Warns About Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies According to the analyst firm, this could pave the way for a short squeeze scenario in which these investors may be forced to close their positions if the bullish momentum continues. In addition, the report stated that the 7-day average of premiums paid for long positions has fallen to $88,000 per hour and this trend continues. This reveals that investors' interest in positions that Bitcoin will rise has decreased, and the general trend of the market is currently short-heavy. *This is not investment advice.

The news was shared by prominent crypto figure Xaif, who highlighted the achievement as a major milestone for Ripple’s growing presence in the tokenized asset space. RLUSD Minted on Ledger #95,702,263 According to Edo Farina, the minting event occurred on ledger #95,702,263 of the XRPL. The creation of 11.5 million RLUSD tokens marks a tangible advancement in Ripple’s broader strategy of bringing real-world assets (RWAs) onto decentralized infrastructure. BREAKING 11.5 Million RLUSD Successfully Minted in Ledger #95,702,263 on XRPL #XRP BULLISH FOR $XRP pic.twitter.com/WXmfuCoZZQ — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) April 26, 2025 RLUSD, often referred to as Ripple’s stablecoin initiative, is pegged to the U.S. dollar and is designed to deliver liquidity, speed, and compliance across global financial networks. The XRPL’s trusted infrastructure, known for its efficiency and minimal transaction costs, serves as the ideal platform for hosting such stable assets. A Key Piece in Ripple’s Broader Vision Ripple has long been a champion of integrating traditional finance with blockchain technology, and the minting of RLUSD on the XRPL is an embodiment of that vision. By introducing a stable, dollar-pegged asset on one of the most established and scalable decentralized networks, Ripple aims to bridge the gap between fiat and digital value transfers. The RLUSD token offers enterprises and financial institutions a reliable mechanism for settling transactions, supporting liquidity pools, and facilitating cross-border payments with greater security and transparency. This milestone also signals Ripple’s commitment to making the XRPL a central hub for stablecoin innovation and tokenized finance. Unlike many other blockchains that struggle with high fees and network congestion, the XRPL continues to offer a high-performance environment that is particularly well-suited for stablecoins and enterprise-grade financial applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strengthening the XRP Ledger’s Utility The successful minting of RLUSD on the XRPL enhances the utility and value proposition of the network itself. XRP Ledger has steadily evolved into a robust platform capable of hosting various tokenized assets, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and payment solutions. The introduction of RLUSD not only adds a stable asset to its growing list of features but also further positions the XRPL as a serious contender in the evolving stablecoin and RWA tokenization markets. Moreover, the event underscores Ripple’s emphasis on regulatory compliance, with RLUSD designed to meet stringent standards for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. This compliance-first approach is likely to attract more institutional players who require secure and regulated pathways into the blockchain space. What This Means for the Broader Crypto Landscape Ripple’s move to mint RLUSD on the XRPL arrives at a crucial time when the demand for trusted, blockchain-based stablecoins is growing globally. As traditional financial institutions increasingly explore blockchain solutions, assets like RLUSD could become key instruments in facilitating mainstream adoption. With Ripple leading the charge, the integration of real-world assets on decentralized platforms appears closer than ever. The successful minting of 11.5 million RLUSD not only demonstrates Ripple’s execution capabilities but also sends a strong message to the crypto community and traditional markets alike: real-world financial systems are gradually merging with decentralized technology, and Ripple, along with the XRP Ledger, is firmly at the forefront of this transformation.

Crypto is back in the limelight, and the market’s buzzing with new presales, token launches, and wild predictions. But here’s the kicker—sometimes, it’s easy to miss out on the next big thing. Remember Chainlink? Back when it was just a small project in its presale stages, many thought it was too risky. Fast forward to now, and it’s one of the most successful tokens in the market. So, what if I told you that you might be looking at another opportunity right now? Meet Qubetics, the rising star in the crypto world that’s set to blow up. With its presale in full swing, Qubetics ($TICS) is offering one of the best opportunities in the market today. But here’s the thing—this is your chance to get in on the ground floor. In just a short time, the price of $TICS could shoot up, offering huge returns to those who act quickly. Don’t make the same mistake of missing out like so many did with Chainlink. Read on to find out why Qubetics could be the best crypto presale to join in 2025 and why it’s a real game-changer. Chainlink: The Missed Opportunity of a Lifetime Chainlink’s rise is legendary. At the time of its presale, Chainlink was just another altcoin, and many people didn’t see its potential. But those who jumped in early? They’re sitting pretty now. Fast forward to today, and Chainlink is a titan in the crypto space. Why? Because it filled a massive gap in the market: secure, decentralized oracles for smart contracts. It solved a major problem that many other blockchain projects couldn’t. Now, Chainlink is seen as one of the most reliable and valuable tokens in the ecosystem. But here’s the hard truth—many missed out on Chainlink when it was affordable. It went from under $1 to a whopping $50+ during its peak. And by the time the masses caught on, the price was already sky-high. Chainlink’s rise teaches us a critical lesson: timing is everything. If you missed that train, don’t let Qubetics be the next missed opportunity. Right now, $TICS is still in presale and priced at an affordable $0.1902 per token. This could be your last chance to buy in before the price skyrockets after the mainnet launch. Analysts are predicting returns of up to 7,600%, making it one of the best crypto presales to join in 2025. Qubetics: The New Rising Star Qubetics is different from Chainlink. It’s addressing issues that were left unsolved by previous projects, with a keen focus on usability and integration. But what exactly makes Qubetics stand out? It’s all about the technology behind $TICS and its practical applications across various industries. Unlike some projects that promise the moon but fall short, Qubetics is already delivering real value with its innovative tools. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, designed to serve individuals, professionals, and businesses. This wallet isn’t just about storing crypto—it’s about creating a seamless experience across different blockchains. Users can manage multiple assets on various chains all within one platform, reducing the hassle of juggling different wallets for different tokens. For people who are tired of dealing with clunky, inefficient wallets, Qubetics is a breath of fresh air. But that’s not all. Qubetics is also bringing the QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to the table. This is a game-changer for developers, businesses, and anyone working with blockchain tech. QubeQode simplifies the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, making it easier to build and deploy solutions. For businesses, this opens up a world of possibilities to integrate blockchain technology into their existing systems without needing a dedicated team of developers. The real-world application of this tool alone makes Qubetics a must-watch. With Qubetics crypto presale in its 31st stage and over $16.4 million raised so far, it’s clear that this project is gaining traction. The $TICS token is priced at just $0.1902, but analysts are predicting that it could reach $1, $5, or even $15 after the mainnet launch, offering massive returns. Don’t let this opportunity slip away like Chainlink did. The time to act is now. Why Qubetics is a Game-Changer for Businesses Qubetics’ impact isn’t limited to individual users. It has massive potential for businesses, too. In today’s digital age, companies are looking for ways to streamline their operations and make the most of blockchain technology. Qubetics offers a solution that cuts through the complexity of crypto and blockchain management. For example, let’s say you’re a business owner who wants to incorporate blockchain into your operations, but you’re not a tech expert. Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE makes it easy for your team to develop and deploy blockchain-based solutions without needing deep coding knowledge. Imagine having the power of blockchain at your fingertips, with an intuitive interface that guides you every step of the way. Additionally, Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet simplifies crypto management for businesses that deal with multiple currencies. This means no more wasting time and energy on managing different wallets for different tokens. With Qubetics, everything is integrated into one platform, making transactions faster and more secure. The Presale: Why Now is the Time to Act Qubetics’ presale is in full swing, and it’s one of the best crypto presales to join right now. The $TICS token is currently priced at just $0.1902 in the 31st stage, but with analysts predicting that the token could hit as high as $15 after the mainnet launch, the potential for returns is staggering. If you’ve been waiting for the right time to jump into crypto, this is it. Here are some key points to consider about Qubetics’ presale: Stage 31: Over 509 million $TICS tokens sold. $16.4 million raised: A clear sign that Qubetics is gaining momentum. Affordable entry: $0.1902 per token right now. Massive ROI potential: Predictions of 425% ROI at $1, 2527% at $5, and 7783% at $15 after the mainnet launch. Now is the time to secure your place in Qubetics before the price jumps. With a rapidly growing community of over 25,200 holders, the buzz is real—and it’s only going to get louder. Qubetics’ Potential Price Surge After Mainnet Launch The big question on everyone’s mind is: how high will $TICS go after the mainnet launch? Analysts are predicting a significant price surge, with estimates ranging from $10 to $15 per token. If these predictions hold true, early buyers could see returns upwards of 7,600%. Compare that to Chainlink’s early days, and you’ll see just how incredible this opportunity really is. The future looks bright for Qubetics, and if you’re looking for the best crypto presale to join in 2025, this is it. The time to act is now—don’t let the chance slip away like so many missed opportunities before it.

Mallers wrote in a letter to the platform’s investors that he was not leaving the firm and that the new development was, in fact, “an extension of that commitment.” Maller continued to say he expects “8-9 figures in net profit in 2025” for Strike despite only having 75 workers. Mallers emphasizes Bitcoin-centric philosophy in a strategic shift to Twenty-One Capital Mallers had previously stated that he was a big supporter of Bitcoin. He claimed that if BTC won, humanity would win. In addition, before he made any business decisions, he said the first thing he asked himself was: Is this good for Bitcoin? Therefore, based on his argument following his announcement as CEO of Twenty-One Capital, the firm existed because it benefited Bitcoin and, hence, was good for the world. Mallers’ appointment at the company signifies a strategic alignment between the two entities focused on advancing Bitcoin adoption. According to Mallers, Twenty-One Capital was created to serve Bitcoin’s interests and to contribute positively to the world. Mallers differentiated Strike , a Bitcoin payments platform, from Twenty-One Capital and said the two companies had different purposes. Strike, he continued, focused on putting Bitcoin everywhere, and Twenty-One sought to increase Bitcoin ownership per share (BPS) and develop Bitcoin-native financial tools. Still, Mallers realized that the companies embraced a similar philosophy despite their various distinctions. He now emphasizes this philosophy: “If Bitcoin wins, we win.” Moreover, for the first time, Mallers disclosed Strike’s key performance indicators to the public. The company reported over $6 billion in revenue in 2024, 600% year-over-year growth, an 85% gross profit margin, and no expenses for acquiring new customers. Mallers takes the helm at Twenty-One Capital to drive Bitcoin-centric ventures The announcement that Jack Mallers will be the new Twenty-One Capital, Inc. CEO comes after the new company revealed a business venture involving Cantor Equity Partners, a special-purpose acquisition company by a Cantor Fitzgerald affiliate. Backed by stablecoin issuer Tether and Japanese investment powerhouse SoftBank Group, Twenty One will launch with more than 42,000 Bitcoins under management. The company aims to maximize BTC ownership per share for its investors and will explore opportunities in BTC-native financial products. Twenty-One Capital is expected to offer investors a centralized platform for Bitcoin exposure, champion Bitcoin advocacy, and provide media and content focused on BTC. The firm also plans to explore future growth opportunities, including developing financial products native to Bitcoin. Furthermore, the company aims to overtake Michael Saylor’s Strategy as the primary option for investors looking to expose themselves to Bitcoin in a capital-efficient manner. Mallers’ new position causes controversy among cryptocurrency investors On social media, several cryptocurrency enthusiasts had inquired about Mallers’ logistics as the CEO of Strike and Twenty-One Capital. In an April 25 X post , cryptocurrency commentator Alex asked, “What will happen to Strike? New incoming CEO? Or will he pull an Elon Musk?” Similarly, Domingo Guerra also questioned , “Who will be running Strike!?” In the meantime, many people involved in cryptocurrency have openly anticipated that Twenty-One Capital might eventually acquire Strike. To an extent, Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, speculated that it was probably safe to assume that Twenty-One Capital would acquire Strike . “How long before Twenty-One Capital acquires Strike?” asked Daniel Sempere Pico. Still, neither Mallers nor Strike has expressed any intention of pursuing such a move. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Sharing a detailed chart and analysis, Brett drew attention to the possibility of XRP reaching between $33 and $50 by 2027. Other experts have set similar targets for XRP, and the post emphasized a potential 1,500% to 2,500% price rally for the altcoin, generating significant interest among supporters. $XRP TO $55 According to Sistine Research, the altcoin could hit $33-$50 by 2027 — a potential 1500%-2500% price rally. ARE YOU READY FOR THIS XRPIANS pic.twitter.com/hlWqsqUbEj — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 25, 2025 The chart Brett posted, originally from Sistine Research, illustrates historical consolidation patterns and previous price expansions. By focusing on this technical structure, Brett showcased how the digital asset’s current formation could mirror past cycles that led to substantial gains. His endorsement of Sistine Research’s findings has brought renewed attention to XRP’s long-term prospects. Sistine Research’s Perspective on XRP’s Potential Sistine Research’s analysis forms the foundation of the optimistic projection. Its analysts argue that XRP’s historical behavior supports the idea of another major rally. Referring to XRP’s previous bull run in 2017, they point out that XRP achieved a $330 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV) when it reached its all-time high after a significant consolidation period. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The question is why a similar outcome is so readily dismissed today, given the comparable conditions. Sistine Research called out market participants who saw the asset FDV rise to $330 billion in early 2018, but doubt that the asset can achieve this today, despite similar circumstances. Sistine Research believes the structural similarities between past and present could pave the way for another major price expansion. Sistine Research further defended the asset’s resilience by noting that it has maintained its relevance. “It’s literally the 2nd largest cryptocurrency in the world,” they stated, pushing back against narratives that its prominence has faded. XRP’s FDV is already larger than Ethereum’s . XRP remains a significant player in the crypto market, retaining its position as one of the top ten cryptocurrencies despite years of legal turmoil. It also experienced some notable surges during this period, suggesting it still holds the potential for swift and massive price rallies. Is XRP Going to $50? Some experts are convinced that XRP will soon take Ethereum’s place , and a breakout to the $33 to $50 range predicted by Sistine Research would help the asset achieve this goal. The chart shows that XRP has already broken out of the extended consolidation phase and completed the first phase of its climb. Sistine Research emphasizes historical precedent as a rational basis for expecting significant growth, rather than dismissing the possibility outright, and the asset’s past proves that it can easily reach these targets.

A lawsuit initiated last year claims that during the Covid-19 era, Wells Fargo issued mortgage forbearances to its customers when they didn’t want them, causing unnecessary hardship while also negatively affecting credit scores due to halted payments. Plaintiffs alleged that the bank decided to provide mortgage forbearances to certain clients who had made an inquiry or expressed hardship but didn’t explicitly request a forbearance. While Wells Fargo did not admit to any wrongdoing, the bank has agreed to pay $185 million to affected customers. According to Top Class Actions, Wells Fargo customers who had a mortgage placed into COVID mortgage forbearance without informed consent between March 1, 2020, and Dec. 31, 2021 are eligible for compensation. Some customers have reportedly already received letters from Wells Fargo in the mail in regards to the payout. In an emailed statement to marketplace.org , a Wells Fargo spokesperson said, “During the early stages of the pandemic, Wells Fargo worked hard to help customers who expressed concern about financial hardship and their ability to make their next mortgage payments… We support this settlement because we believe it is in the best interests of our customers.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Bitcoin’s price surged ahead of the stock market in April. After testing $74,500 on “Black Monday,” Apr. 7, it rebounded to $94,300 by Friday, Apr. 25. That was a 20.6% market gain for crypto traders who bought the dip in BTC tokens on Apr. 7. However, one larger-cap altcoin sits above the rest. Why Is SUI Going Up in April? The weekly candle for BTC on Apr. 25 was +10%. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) was up more than +12%. Ripple (XRP) posted +7% gains. And Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) posted 18% each. But Sui network tokens (SUI) lead weekly gains among all Top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The Layer-1 smart contract blockchain currency appreciated 70% in trading against the dollar. At one point, SUI skyrocketed by 28% in under 24 hours. One analyst points to DEEP market penetration in April as a factor. Route 2 FI, a popular Crypto X commentator with 326K followers, wrote on Apr. 23 that a main factor in SUI’s growth is its ecosystem: “$DEEP up 67% in the past week after tier 1 exchange listings and $WAL is in the top 100.” $SUI is one of the strongest coins out there. Up 30% today to $2.90 — nearly 50% since the local bottom earlier this month. What’s driving the bullish sentiment for @SuiNetwork : -Shaping up to be the trade of the cycle.

Route 2 FI remarked that SUI is “Shaping up to be the trade of the cycle. Many want another L1 winner alongside Solana. Sui is leading the trend.” O’Leary Knows How to Pick His Altcoins As we reported on CryptoPotato earlier in the month, ABC “Shark Tank” judge and business mogul Kevin O’Leary pumped SUI in the first week of April. He nailed this hot altcoin pick. Speaking on a podcast, O’Leary said, “I think the hottest ticket right now is Sui. It’s Mysten. That’s a hot new project.” The technical signals on SUI’s price chart were also favorable at the time. In a speed test last year, CoinGecko found that SUI was the fastest major smart contract blockchain network other than Solana.

According to the UN, these criminals have continued to grow, expanding their operations using digital assets and custom blockchain services. The report mentioned that criminals are expanding their exploits and they are doing it through the use of digital assets. Even though authorities have been increasing efforts to arrest them, they have been spreading their networks globally, moving from Myanmar to Mexico, the report mentioned. United Nations warns about the rising activities of scammers in Southeast Asia According to the data revealed by the United Nations, most of these criminal gangs are located in Southeast Asia, where most of their activities have been largely successful. The report mentioned that regional fraud has replaced other types of crimes as these criminals can easily reach their victims online. The report mentioned that victims lost about $37 billion to cyber fraud in East and Southeast Asia in 2023, with most of the losses linked to crypto scams. Benedikt Hofmann, the United Nation’s acting regional representative for Southeast Asia, mentioned to Reuters that the operations are spreading like a cancer. The expansion, largely helped by the anonymous quality of digital assets, has made it hard for global governments to contain the issue. As law enforcement continues to combat these crimes in known areas, the criminals are relocating their base of operation, with others moving their operations online. Most of these scammers are also known to use technologies like Starlink satellites to bypass government restrictions. This [scale of Southeast Asia’s scam network] has extended far beyond the construction and management of physical scam centers to include online gambling platforms and software services, unlicensed payment processors and cryptocurrency exchanges, encrypted communications platforms, and, most recently, stablecoins , blockchain, networks, and illicit online marketplaces, often controlled by the same criminal networks,” the report said. UN report highlights the rise of illegal exchanges The United Nations report also discussed the rise in illegal exchanges, noting that they help these scammers with their operations. Huione Guarantee, a platform that has now changed its name to Haowang, is known to offer several services that help scammers carry out their activities. The platform has links to several countries and has processed billions of crypto transactions since 2021. The platform provides services to help these scammers, including launching US dollar-backed stablecoins that help them escape government controls. The platform has also grown, boasting about 970,000 users. Most of these users are involved in one illegal activity or another. The United Nations report notes that traders on Huione have received about $24 billion in the last four years. The report mentioned that the rise in crime rate recorded in Southeast Asia results from corruption and weak governance in some areas. This has led to criminals setting up shop in some countries and recruiting people to work for them under forced conditions. The UN report mentioned that there were victims from more than 55 countries, including Africa, with the scammers using them to trick victims into sending money, usually through digital assets.

BNB price analysis on a 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Binance Coin confirmed a bullish trend for the currency. The BNB/USD value has improved up to $603.07 in the past few hours. The receding volatility is suggestive of a low chance of reversal in the market trends. The Bollinger Bands are converging, leading to a decline in volatility.

The BNB/USD value has sought recovery up to $603.2 high in the last 24 hours. From an overall analysis, the currency has gained 0.76% of its value today. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to showcase a bullish market scenario. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,710.66 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB’s price increased over the last 24 hours towards the resistance at $603.2. Buyers stepped in to buy the assets; moreover, the support floor at that level seems stable because the Bulls secured the level this week. In addition, the coin is now trading above the psychological mark of $600. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,710.66 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. In March 2025, BNB was trading near the psychological mark of $600, which it still continues to do so in April.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-26 14:37:14

According to Kevin Miller, a vice president at Amazon, “there’s been no significant change” in the company’s plans of setting up new AI data centres. Miller talked of “very strong demand” at a Hamm Institute conference this week, adding the “numbers are seen going up” not just in 2025 but over the longer term as well. Evidently, Amazon’s update bodes well for AI-focused investments, including stocks as well as crypto tokens like PepeX . How does PepeX use AI to its benefit? PepeX distinguishes itself from an ocean of meme coins with an integration of a unique AI angle. The up-and-coming crypto platform uses artificial intelligence to enable easier and efficient launch and marketing of new memes. How PepeX automates major parts of that process with the use of artificial intelligence is quite rare and inspiring. So, when Nvidia – the AI darling itself says “we haven’t seen a pullback” in the demand for artificial intelligence solutions, investors will likely regain some confidence in returning to AI-focused assets. And when they do, some of their capital could land in PepeX as it offers pocket-friendly means of gaining exposure to artificial intelligence, and that too with the possibility of explosive gains over time. If you’re interested in learning more about the native PepeX meme coin, you should click here to visit the crypto project’s website now. Why is PepeX attractive as an AI investment? PepeX meme coin appears attractive as an AI-focused investment for two reasons. One, it doesn’t require a huge amount of capital. Look at it this way: if you had just $100 to invest in artificial intelligence, and you picked Nvidia or Amazon, you won’t even be able to buy one of their shares. But PepeX is going for $0.024 only, which means the same amount of money could build you a massive position in PepeX. Secondly, the likes of Nvidia or Amazon could offer you 50% even 100% return in a year? In comparison, meme coins like PepeX are known for explosive growth in their initial phases. In fact, there have been instances of 10x growth within months in the world of meme coins. All in all, attractive initial pricing will likely sustain demand for PepeX meme coin moving forward, potentially contributing to a continued increase in its price in the coming months.

Extreme negative funding rates and whale manipulation hint at more potential volatility ahead. Despite the rally, ALPACA remains highly risky with strong resistance near $0.21 and crucial support around $0.15. Alpaca Finance (ALPACA) stunned the crypto market with an unexpected surge, when the token price skyrocketed from $0.03 to a peak of $0.217 in just two days, a jaw-dropping 7x rally.

The exciting announcement , shared by prominent crypto commentator Amelie on X, marks a significant leap forward for both XRP and the broader digital asset ecosystem. A Historic Moment for XRP and Crypto Innovation The introduction of XRPH11 as a spot XRP ETF places Brazil at the forefront of global crypto financial products. Unlike futures-based ETFs that track derivatives contracts, spot ETFs are directly backed by the underlying asset — in this case, XRP itself. This critical difference offers investors exposure to actual XRP holdings, not just speculative contracts, providing greater transparency and reducing the risks associated with futures-based instruments. By launching XRPH11, Brazil has demonstrated a proactive stance in embracing blockchain-based financial innovation, while offering traditional investors a regulated and accessible pathway into the XRP market. This move reflects an increasing global demand for straightforward and secure investment vehicles tied directly to prominent cryptocurrencies. Why the XRPH11 Launch Matters The significance of XRPH11 extends far beyond Brazil’s borders. For years, the crypto community has been pushing for the approval of spot ETFs, especially for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. While the United States and several other jurisdictions have hesitated over regulatory concerns, Brazil’s bold step in approving and launching XRPH11 underscores its progressive regulatory framework and willingness to embrace the future of finance. The launch of the XRP spot ETF is expected to have ripple effects throughout the financial world. Offering investors direct exposure to XRP through a familiar and regulated financial product may drive increased liquidity, broader adoption, and institutional interest in XRP. It also paves the way for potential spot ETF products in other major markets, including the United States, Europe, and Asia. What This Means for XRP’s Global Adoption The debut of XRPH11 not only validates XRP’s growing stature as a legitimate and scalable digital asset but also aligns with ongoing trends toward integrating blockchain technology into mainstream finance. XRP, known for its speed, efficiency, and enterprise-grade utility, has long been viewed as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies for real-world financial applications. Now, with XRPH11 live, XRP stands to benefit from heightened visibility and credibility among institutional investors and traditional asset managers. Greater accessibility to XRP through conventional investment platforms could catalyze a new wave of adoption, bringing XRP closer to achieving its goal of becoming a foundational pillar of the global payment system. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Potential Catalyst for Future ETF Approvals Brazil’s move may also serve as a critical catalyst for other countries considering similar initiatives. As XRPH11 gains traction and demonstrates operational success, it will provide a concrete example of how spot cryptocurrency ETFs can coexist within regulated financial markets without introducing excessive systemic risk. If XRPH11 proves successful — attracting strong inflows and maintaining operational stability — it could bolster the case for spot XRP ETFs elsewhere. This development could also exert additional pressure on regulators in markets like the United States to reconsider their current stances on cryptocurrency-based financial products. The launch of XRPH11, the world’s first spot XRP ETF, represents a watershed moment not just for XRP but for the future of crypto-based financial products globally. Thanks to Brazil’s leadership and the momentum created by announcements from influencers like Amelie, the world is witnessing a major step toward greater integration between traditional finance and the digital economy. As XRPH11 begins trading and the market responds, all eyes will be on how this pioneering ETF reshapes investment dynamics and influences regulatory discussions around the world. One thing is certain — XRP’s journey into mainstream finance has taken a bold, historic leap forward. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

As anticipation continues to build, some smaller tokens are in line for price rises. This article looks into five altcoins that could see gains in the coming months. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a new concept to the meme coin market, bringing the excitement of sports with the energy of the crypto sector.

It also has a growing community that is built around the passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.AT.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming to be better than the average meme coin. People are now noticing that, earning the project the title of Best New Meme Project. What makes $XYZ different? It is not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a community that is focusing on its long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, $XYZ has emerged as the undefeated contender that is ready to crush its competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become the badge for those that are passionate about sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market Early traders who want to take advantage of the price of $XYZ before it lists can still gain access to it. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.003333 Next Stage: $0.005 Final Presale Price: $0.02 The $XYZ token is also expected to be listed on exchanges after the presale, with the developers targeting a listing price of $0.10. Early Investors that purchased the token during the presale could see rewards of over 1,000x provided the project raises the needed capital. So far, over $10 million has been invested, showing the strong interest in the market. Notably, buying the token at a lower presale price allows investors to get higher ROI when the project launches. Demand for $XYZ is also on the rise, pushing the presale through the various stages on time. Early buyers purchase at the lowest prices, increasing their returns when the project eventually lists. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Sui: Revolutionizing Blockchain with User-Friendly Innovations Sui is a new blockchain platform that was created to change the way we interact with Web3. The platform was built as a layer-1 blockchain and focuses on being secure, powerful, and its ability to grow. The platform uses a special data model and the Move programming language to fix problems on other blockchains. This means that Sui can handle more transactions quickly and safely, making it ready for use by global users. What makes Sui different is its focus on user experience. It removes the common challenges that make blockchain hard to use. It uses features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions to make it easy for people to use the application without any hard steps. Programmable transaction blocks make it easy for developers to create apps that are friendly and easy to use. In a market that has many tokens, Sui stands out because it focuses on its technology and users. This makes it attractive to the users, especially the ones looking for platforms that are powerful and easy to use. Sei: The Lightning-Fast Blockchain Aiming to Transform Trading Sei is a blockchain that was designed for just trading, with the platform having speed and security as its major positives. The platform was built specially for exchanges, giving them an advantage over competition. Sei can handle a large number of orders every second, finalizing transactions in 380 milliseconds. That is faster than most blockchains in the market. The project is also backed by big institutions, ensuring it is secure and reliable. Sei has caught the attention of most investors in the market due to a forecast that says it has what it takes to grow by 323% by 2030. In the market of today where users chase speed and efficiency, Sei stands out. While other tokens struggle with slow transaction times, Sei provides a fast and secure method to carry out transactions. If you are in the decentralized market and want to follow the current trends of quick trades in demand, Sei is the best option. It is tailored to serve the trading world, and that specialization could give it an advantage in the market. Hyperliquid: The Future of Fast and Fee-Free Decentralized Trading Hyperliquid is a new blockchain platform designed to make decentralized finance (DeFi) faster and efficient. It uses its layer 1 blockchain that has been built from the scratch to be quick and scalable. One of its best features is the HyperBFT, a system that confirms transactions quickly while keeping them secure. Another exciting fact is that Hyperliquid allows decentralized perpetual futures trading on its platform. Users can carry out trades without paying gas fees, something that is not common among other blockchains. Hyperliquid also uses an on-chain order book, which means all traders can be seen and verified on the blockchain, increasing trust and transparency. In the crypto market today, users are looking for platforms that offers users low costs and transparency. Hyperliquid’s approach still sets it apart from other decentralized exchanges with high fees and slow transactions. The team behind the platform are from top universities and industry leaders, showing that a lot of expertise has gone into its building. While the market will always change, Hyperliquid’s focus on solving real problems will make it the best option for traders looking for cheap and efficient solutions. As more users seek better platforms for trading, Hyperliquid might be a strong player in the industry. HBAR: The Green Coin Aiming to Outshine Bitcoin and Ethereum Hedera Hashgraph is a new kind of network that wants to change the way we use digital money. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum that use blockchain, Hedera uses hashgraph technology. This makes it faster and efficient. With no mining involved, the project is better for the environment. The network uses HBAR for its transactions. People use the token to pay for transactions and keep the network secure using Proof of Stake. With its fast transactions and low fees, HBAR hopes to make digital payment easy for people, aiming to be used in different areas of finance. But can HBAR compete in the big world of cryptocurrencies? One weak point is that its technology is patented, which discourages some developers that prefer open-source projects. However, the network has seen support from big companies, which could help it grow. In the current market, where traders look for faster and cheaper tokens to rival Bitcoin and Ethereum, HBAR stands out. It focuses on speed, security, and efficiency, making it the best option for investors and users. Only time will tell, but HBAR has what it takes to change the market. Conclusion While SUI, SEI, HYPE, and HBAR show promise for big growth, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the leading meme coin that will outperform all of them.

Worldcoin ( WLD ) hit $1.19 on Saturday and is currently trading at around $1.08 . This recovery happened as Bitcoin ( BTC ), most altcoins, and American stocks rebounded. See below. Source: CoinGecko Worldcoin, founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, surged after a whale purchased tokens worth over $1.5 million. Whale accumulation is typically a positive sign, as these investors are perceived as more sophisticated than retail investors. You might also like: Bitcoin, gold rise while stocks fall: is decoupling here to stay? The Worldcoin token also gained steam after the team pointed to increased momentum in Asian countries. Singapore registrations and verifications jumped by 15,800 to reach 100,000. South Korea had over 10,000 verifications in the first three weeks of the month, while Japan has crossed the 100,000 verification milestones. South Korea’s growth accelerated after the network partnered with SuperWalk, a move-to-earn network. In Japan, it integrated with popular companies like Hakuhodo, SARAH, Tokyo Beast, and YAY!. Worldcoin has also jumped as its weighted funding rate has remained positive for ten consecutive days. A positive funding rate is a crucial concept in perpetual futures, meaning that long traders are paying a fee to short positions to maintain their trades. WLD funding rate | Source: CoinGlass Worldcoin price technical analysis The daily chart indicates that the Worldcoin price has rebounded over the past few days. It has jumped from a low of $0.5833 to a high of $1.20. WLD price chart | Source: crypto.news It has recently jumped above the key resistance level at $0.98, the highest swing on March 26. It has also surpassed the 50-day moving average, while the Relative Strength Index has risen to 76. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the psychological point at $2, which is 77% above the current level. What is Worldcoin? Launched in 2019 by Altman, Alex Blania, and Max Novendstern under their company Tools for Humanity, Worldcoin aims to build a global decentralized identity network by distinguishing real humans from AI — a rising concern in an era of increasingly sophisticated bots and deepfakes. At the heart of the project is the so-called “World ID,” a unique digital passport created by scanning a person’s iris using a proprietary device called the Orb. The initiative offers verified users the native WLD token, an Ethereum ( ETH )-based token intended for utility and governance within the network. Participants can manage their assets through the World App, a self-custodial crypto wallet. At the same time, the project’s new blockchain, World Chain, promises to scale the platform as part of the Optimism Superchain. Altman envisions Worldcoin as a foundation for financial inclusion and digital identity verification in an AI-driven internet. However, the project has not launched without controversy. Worldcoin’s reliance on collecting sensitive biometric data has triggered alarm among privacy advocates and regulators worldwide. Authorities in countries such as Kenya , Brazil , Spain , and Germany have either suspended Worldcoin’s operations or cited concerns over consent, data security, and the targeting of vulnerable populations. Critics have, in particular, accused Worldcoin of rolling out iris scans in low-income communities, where residents may have little recourse if their data is misused. Despite these hurdles, the project draws substantial interest from venture capitalists, with backing from firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures. Worldcoin is essentially at the heart of a growing debate over whether proving one’s humanity in an artificial intelligence-driven world requires sacrificing one’s personal privacy.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) DeFi Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) established a dual-lending ecosystem through its combination of peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer systems. Between smart contract pools lenders earn yields while borrowers secure loans with assets that exceed the requested value. The system architecture provides stability by avoiding the price fluctuations which other tokens suffer from. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token distribution works through the platform’s buy-and-distribute operation which uses profit to repurchase tokens before distributing them to stakers for demand creation. The functional nature of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows users to create passive income through interest-bearing mtTokens while avoiding speculative coin behavior. The planned stablecoin launch with collateralized support will deepen Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ecosystem as it emerges as a leading DeFi platform. Solana’s Slow Climb Solana (SOL) demonstrates stable growth as its value rises 6% through the week to reach $139.14. RSI metrics combined with the golden crossover indicator indicate SOL will reach $169.81 first before potentially hitting $227.95 within extended timeframes. Solana’s future price growth faces limitations because its performance depends heavily on Bitcoin market stability as well as broader conditions within the crypto market. The project faces obstacles from network congestion and competition from emerging new projects which limit its market influence. Solana’s developer attraction through scalability fails to match the explosive growth of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during its presale phase along with predictable profits which questions if Solana can keep its competitive position through 2025. Outpacing Giants in 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a dominant force through a combination of active presale sales and its DeFi capabilities while Solana maintains a stable yet constrained trajectory. MUTM offers investors the most promising value proposition through 140% listing growth combined with projected $3 post-launch progress. The quick sell-out pace in phase four indicates that investors need to move now before reaching the $0.03 mark.

With President Donald Trump’s recent executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) and a US Digital Asset Stockpile (DAS), the conversation around digital assets in government reserves is gaining momentum. Countries like Czechia have also followed suit with their sovereign digital asset reserve plans. While Bitcoin ( BTC ) and select altcoins are being considered, the discussion remains incomplete without including decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) tokens. DePIN represents a new paradigm in infrastructure development, where communities, not corporations, build and operate essential networks like telecommunications that self-govern and distribute rewards to their individual contributors. If it were to include DePIN tokens in its DAS, the US could use blockchain technology to create a self-sustaining infrastructure economy that strengthens technological leadership. This would also encourage DePIN projects to build and scale physical infrastructure (such as WiFi, environmental monitoring and transportation) for US citizens by sharing bandwidth from their everyday devices. This eliminates the need for companies and governments to incur heavy capital expenditures. Moreover, if proven successful in the US, it would set an example for other countries to set up their own sovereign crypto reserves for the benefit of their own citizens. A supranational network of DePIN token reserves would also potentially unite different types of infrastructure and grids in other countries, reducing the cost and friction between them. A new asset class for sovereign investment DePIN changes the way infrastructure is built. Instead of relying on governments or private companies to maintain critical infrastructure, DePIN uses blockchain and token incentives to enable community-driven bandwidth sharing. DePIN networks, like those powering WiFi or movement sensors, prove that this model can be more efficient and cost-effective than traditional approaches. For the US government, investing in DePIN tokens through its DAS would serve multiple strategic objectives. Regarding economic resilience, DePIN networks create a self-sustaining gig around infrastructure, reducing the country’s reliance on large corporations and enabling communities to earn revenue by contributing to infrastructure needs. Traditional infrastructure is prone to geopolitical risks and monopolistic inefficiencies. Meanwhile, DePIN offers a decentralized alternative that is censorship-resistant. The US has long been at the forefront of technological revolutions. Including DePIN in its sovereign investment strategy would reinforce its position as a leader in Web3 and blockchain. Many DePIN projects optimize resource utilization using token incentives to align infrastructure deployment with demand. This approach enables more sustainable, scalable solutions for Internet-of-Things sectors. While Bitcoin is a simple store of value, DePIN tokens represent ownership and operational stakes in decentralized infrastructure and possess tangible value just as equities or bonds. If countries were to include DePIN tokens in their digital asset reserves, they could use blockchain technology to create self-sustaining, interconnected infrastructure economies. Imagine being able to distribute electricity between two countries when there is an excess demand in one and an oversupply in another. Distributed ledgers’ decentralized and cross-border nature can allow such mechanisms to happen. A true strategic hedge Historically, sovereign wealth funds have been used to preserve national wealth by diversifying investments. These models are, however, increasingly vulnerable to inflationary pressures. The US inflation rate averaged 8.0% in 2022, and the price of all assets, whether stocks or Bitcoin, sold off heavily during the year in an overall market rout. No one was immune. Recent: DePIN needs thoughtful regulation — not lawsuits On the other hand, DePIN offers a true hedge against these risks because the prices of core infrastructure services are, by definition, part of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), enabling users holding DePIN assets to directly profit from inflation increases or at least preserve their asset value. DePIN networks also use token incentives to align infrastructure deployment with economic shifts. This is particularly relevant given that global electricity prices surged by over 20% in 2022 due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions. In response to increased energy costs, decentralized energy grids operating on blockchain-based token economies could dynamically adjust rewards for energy producers. Coupled with the rise in underlying CPI prices, DePIN networks have the potential to deliver compounded returns (rise in CPI + additional token issuance) in opposition to such market sell-offs. Including DePIN tokens in a sovereign wealth portfolio exposes the US to next-generation economic models. DePIN networks are built on transparent principles that align incentives between users, infrastructure providers and investors. All nations that have historically led technological revolutions should seize the opportunity to embrace DePIN, reinforcing their status as pioneers. The future is decentralized Integrating DePIN tokens into the US DAS or any other sovereign digital asset stockpile would not simply be a financial decision — it is a strategic imperative. With the world shifting toward decentralized economies, the US and other tech powerhouses must position themselves at the forefront of this transformation. Countries that recognize and embrace this shift today will be best positioned to lead in the next era of global innovation. After all, infrastructure research has been stunted by decades of either monopoly or large-scale government ownership. If millions of individuals and communities became directly involved in their daily infrastructure through DePIN, it would increase the likelihood of infrastructure innovation due to the sheer volume of crowd involvement and offset research and development expenses from the government for the money to be allocated elsewhere. Decentralization is a win-win for all. Investing in DePIN will also ensure that national infrastructure remains affordable and not subject to national-level deployments requiring massive tax hikes to fund, enabling a future where physical infrastructure assets are affordably maintained. Specifically, if US policymakers act now, they can secure America’s leadership in the next great infrastructure revolution that prioritizes decentralized ownership.

In a statement released on April 25 , Semler confirmed the acquisition of 111 BTC since February 14 at an average price of $90,000 per coin. The latest purchase brings the company’s total Bitcoin treasury to over 3,300 BTC, valued at approximately $300 million based on current market prices. Semler Reports 23.5% Bitcoin Yield Semler said that its Bitcoin strategy has delivered a 23.5% Bitcoin yield year-to-date, a key performance indicator (KPI) the company uses to measure shareholder value through BTC accumulation. The Bitcoin yield reflects the ratio of Bitcoin holdings relative to outstanding shares, effectively increasing each shareholder’s exposure to the asset. “Semler Scientific uses BTC Yield as a KPI to assess the performance of its strategy of acquiring Bitcoin in a manner it believes is accretive to stockholders,” the company noted. Semler, traditionally focused on developing diagnostic tools for chronic disease detection, has partially financed its Bitcoin purchases by issuing $125 million in new stock.

The company’s pivot follows a broader trend sparked by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) , whose aggressive Bitcoin accumulation has driven its stock price up over 350% in 2024. Inspired by Strategy’s success, several firms, including Semler, have adopted Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. As of April 25, public companies collectively hold around $71 billion in Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. Strategy remains the largest corporate holder, with a stash exceeding $50 billion, including a recent purchase of 6,556 BTC at an average price of $84,785 per coin. Public Companies Boost Bitcoin Holdings by 16% in Q1 2025 Publicly traded companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1% in the first quarter of 2025, signaling continued institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency despite market volatility. According to crypto asset manager Bitwise, total corporate Bitcoin holdings climbed to approximately 688,000 BTC by the end of Q1, with companies adding 95,431 BTC over the three-month period. Bitwise reported the combined value of these holdings reached $56.7 billion, based on a Q1 closing price of $82,445 per Bitcoin—representing a 2.2% increase in value. The adoption of Bitcoin has also found momentum statewide in the U.S. According to data from Bitcoin Law, 47 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced across 26 states, with 41 currently active. Just recently, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear officially signed House Bill 701 , known as the “Bitcoin Rights” bill, into law—making the state one of the latest to enact legislation protecting digital asset users and operations.

In this model, token holders can delegate their governance authority to Delegated Representatives (DReps) while retaining full control of their funds. The voting power of such representatives is proportionate to the amount of ADA they are assigned. ADA holders are not tied down to their decisions either—they can sell voting rights whenever they want, thus maintaining continuous control over who acts on their behalf. DReps vote on all kinds of network-wide proposals, ranging from technical hard forks to treasury fund allocation decisions. Recent Hard Fork Enabled Full Governance Features The governance functionality exhibited in this ballot came into full effect after the Plomin hard fork finished in January 2025. This network update enabled core functionality of Cardano’s governance system, such as treasury withdrawals, and made DReps’ role official in the ecosystem.

They were able to vote directly on proposals, delegate their voting power to a DRep of their choice, abstain entirely, or cast a formal vote of no confidence. One such design consideration highlighted by developers included the aspect of preserving unchanged staking rewards for ADA holders that did not engage in governance activities. This practice reflects pre-hard fork operations, enabling smooth transition to the new governance system. The large turnout for this initial significant vote indicates that the community has accepted Cardano’s governance model, which combines representative voting with freedom of action for individual token holders. At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.72, up 15% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.

Following the launch of the first spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ), two artificial intelligence ( AI ) models are predicting the asset could surpass $5 by the end of 2025. Brazil introduced the world’s first spot XRP product, XRPH11, which began trading on April 25 on B3, the country’s main stock exchange. Created by Hashdex and administered by Genial Investimentos, Genial Bank provides XRPH11’s custody services. After an extensive pre-operational phase, Hashdex secured approval from Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) earlier this year. The launch of XRPH11 is expected to impact XRP’s price trajectory in 2025, generally. Historically, spot ETFs have provided strong long-term support for cryptocurrencies by expanding access to institutional investors. Although Brazil’s financial market is smaller than those in the U.S. or Europe, being first to market could attract significant international attention to XRP. To determine how the product might impact the price of XRP, Finbold turned to ChatGPT and xAI’s Grok AI model for price prediction. AI predicts XRP price ChatGPT projects that XRP could reach $3.50 to $4.50 by the end of 2025 under normal bullish conditions. In a stronger scenario, with more countries launching XRP ETFs and rising global crypto demand, the asset could hit $6 to $8. However, the AI model noted that if macroeconomic conditions worsen or new regulatory hurdles arise, the price could fall back to a range between $1.5 and $2. ChatGPT views $4 as a realistic target, nearly 80% above current levels. On the other hand, Grok AI offered a similar outlook with more detailed probabilities. In its bullish scenario, XRP could reach $8, driven by strong inflows into XRPH11, U.S. ETF approvals, Ripple’s expanding partnerships, and Bitcoin surpassing $120,000. Grok’s base case sees XRP at $4.50, assuming moderate success in Brazil, U.S. ETF approvals by late 2025, and Bitcoin reaching $100,000. In its bearish scenario, XRP could dip to $2.00 if the ETF launch underperforms and macroeconomic pressures persist, although Brazil’s ETF launch and Ripple’s legal wins could offer some price support. Grok XRP price prediction. Source: Grok From a technical perspective, cryptocurrency trading analyst Alek’s analysis shows that XRP is currently trading between a major support zone of $1.95 to $2.08. It shows resilience as it moves within a descending channel pattern, often recognized as a bull flag. This pattern typically signals a potential continuation of the broader bullish trend.

Now, ProShares is turning its attention to XRP, a move that reflects growing institutional interest in the digital asset as regulatory clarity continues to unfold. JUST IN: ProShares Trust are OFFERING an $XRP ETF public offering slated for April 30, 2025! U Are Not Bullish Enough, pic.twitter.com/Zal30W6ItC — Amonyx (@amonbuy) April 26, 2025 By announcing a public offering for an XRP ETF , ProShares is signaling confidence in the long-term potential of XRP and its underlying technology. The move aligns with broader market trends that see cryptocurrencies increasingly integrated into mainstream portfolios through regulated, easy-to-access investment products. What the XRP ETF Means for Investors The upcoming ProShares XRP ETF will provide investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to XRP without the complexities of direct asset custody. As traditional finance continues to bridge the gap with blockchain technology, ETFs like this are becoming key tools for both retail and institutional investors seeking diversified crypto exposure within familiar investment frameworks. Unlike spot purchasing or self-custody of XRP, an ETF structure simplifies the process, potentially attracting a new wave of market participants who prefer the security and oversight that come with regulated financial products. This could drive substantial new liquidity into the XRP market, reinforcing its position as a leading asset in the crypto ecosystem. Broader Implications for XRP and Crypto Markets The ProShares XRP ETF launch arrives at a critical moment for the digital asset sector. Following significant milestones such as Brazil’s recent introduction of the first spot XRP ETF (XRPH11), the interest in structured XRP investment products has never been higher. The ProShares offering could catalyze further XRP adoption, especially among U.S.-based investors who have so far had limited access to XRP-focused ETFs. Moreover, this announcement signals a broader shift in the regulatory environment. In the past, uncertainty surrounding the legal classification of XRP in the U.S. created hurdles for major institutional investment. However, with regulatory clarity improving after key court decisions and ongoing dialogue between blockchain companies and regulators, the launch of such products indicates that the tide is turning in favor of broader crypto acceptance.

The ProShares XRP ETF could represent a pivotal moment not just for XRP but for the broader market’s maturation. A successful launch would demonstrate the viability of regulated cryptocurrency ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, setting a precedent for future offerings tied to other high-utility digital assets. It also suggests that investors are increasingly seeking exposure to assets like XRP, which offer real-world use cases in cross-border payments and enterprise financial solutions — areas that continue to gain prominence as blockchain technology reshapes the global economy. With ProShares Trust preparing to offer an XRP ETF to the public on April 30, 2025, the crypto industry is witnessing yet another breakthrough toward mainstream acceptance . Thanks to updates from crypto influencers like Amonyx, the community remains informed and energized about these unfolding milestones. As the world’s financial infrastructure steadily integrates digital assets, initiatives like the ProShares XRP ETF will play a crucial role in bridging traditional finance with the decentralized future. Investors and market watchers alike will be keenly observing how this historic offering unfolds and what it signals for the next chapter of cryptocurrency adoption.

The fund tracks the Nasdaq XRP Index and invests at least 95% of its assets directly in XRP. It targets institutional and advanced investors seeking regulated exposure to the crypto market within Brazil’s capital markets. The world’s first XRP spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), issued by Hashdex and managed by Genial Investimentos, began trading on April 25 on Brazil’s B3 stock exchange. Listed under the ticker XRPH11, the ETF tracks the Nasdaq XRP Reference Price Index and, according to Hashdex, will allocate at least 95% of its net assets to XRP. The introduction of the fund marked Hashdex’s ninth ETF launch on the Brazilian exchange. The launch expanded Hashdex’s single-asset ETF offerings on B3, which also includes products based on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). The asset manager might use direct or indirect investment in futures contracts aimed at replicating the Nasdaq XRP Reference Price Index’s performance or other financial instruments that reflect the price of XRP as defined by Nasdaq’s benchmark to give exposure. Hashdex launches the XRPH11 spot ETF on Brazil’s B3 🚀 XRPH11 – The world's first XRP ETF. Another crypto milestone on the Brazilian stock exchange! 🇧🇷 Hashdex just launched XRPH11, giving investors secure and regulated access to $XRP — one of the leading #crypto assets focused on fast, low-cost international payments. pic.twitter.com/kpokQP5NM4 — Hashdex (@hashdex) April 25, 2025 Hashdex launched the world’s first spot XRP ETF managed by Genial Investimentos, marking a pioneering development in Brazil’s crypto investment products. The asset manager tapped Genial Bank SA as the ETF’s custodian. Samir Kerbage, CIO of Hashdex, disclosed that this was the ninth ETF the asset manager had launched on B3. It expanded the possibilities of diversification and exposure to digital assets with security, transparency, and alignment with regulatory guidelines. According to Kerbage, the fund aims to attract sophisticated investors, including institutions looking to build crypto portfolios on Brazil’s equity market infrastructure. Brazil represents only 0.9% of the global AUM of crypto ETPs, although Hashdex secured a head start in conquering this market. XRPH11 must find global appeal to reach a notable AUM that will grant Hashdex a spot in the global crypto space. However, JPMorgan’s prediction in January suggested that these products could attract up to $8 billion in net flows, which was over eight times their current AUM size. XRP funds reportedly registered the strongest weekly inflows among other crypto-related ETPs last week, with about $37.7 million allocated. Brazil previously launched a Solana ETF in 2024, which failed to garner significant attention or trading volume. In this case, XRPH11’s success may not be guaranteed. Still, XRPH11’s underperformance could disappoint investors and affect XRP’s price in the short term. XRP ETFs are yet to launch in the U.S. despite several U.S. SEC applications Large asset managers such as Grayscale and Bitwise have applied to launch XRP ETFs registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Polymarket prediction platform shows a 74% probability that the U.S. will approve a spot XRP ETF sometime in 2025. On March 26, Polymarket gave an 86% chance that an XRP-based ETF product would be approved this year. However, users only have a 42% chance that an XRP ETF will be approved before July 31. Nate Geraci, the president at ETF Store, said that the approval of an XRP ETF was next. He added that it was ‘obvious’ and only a matter of time before the U.S. SEC approved an XRP ETF. The executive also predicted that asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity would be involved in offering the asset. Former U.S. SEC Chair Gary Gensler repeatedly cited the absence of a regulated futures market as a red flag for market manipulation when denying previous altcoin ETF applications. However, introducing the agency’s new pro-crypto Chair, Paul Atkins, means that the U.S. SEC’s go-to excuse for denying altcoin ETFs, at least for XRP, might just have gotten ‘body-checked.’ Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

MAGACOINFINANCE.COM and SOLANA Are Leading the Pack!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cryptos-next-555k-star-magacoinfinance-com-and-solana-are-leading-the-pack/,"In a market where fortunes are built on early entry and smart conviction, two names are setting themselves apart from the crowd: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM and Solana . With momentum building fast, both projects are now at the center of investor speculation—and many are asking the same question: could one of them become crypto’s next $555K breakout? While Solana continues to expand its dominance, MAGACOINFINANCE is stepping into the spotlight with all the signs of an early-stage giant in the making. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quickly Becoming the Most Watched Early-Stage Contender There’s a moment when a project shifts from being “just another token” to something that investors can’t stop talking about. That’s where MAGACOINFINANCE is right now. With consistent community growth, real engagement, and a roadmap that’s not just theoretical—it’s being delivered—this token is gaining recognition the right way. It’s not noise. It’s structure. And structure is exactly what separates lasting tokens from temporary trends. Whether you’re looking at wallet adoption, user activity, or sentiment across trusted crypto spaces, the trend is clear: MAGACOINFINANCE is no longer a secret. Rising Contenders: Optimism, Arbitrum, Sei, and Litecoin Optimism continues to thrive as Ethereum’s go-to Layer-2 scaling solution. Its rapid adoption and reduced fees make it a developer favorite. Arbitrum stands alongside it with even deeper dApp activity and increasing traction among power users who demand speed and low friction. Sei is positioning itself as a high-performance infrastructure layer focused on trading and speed-sensitive applications. It’s early, but its architecture is drawing attention. Litecoin remains a steady performer. Simple, fast, and battle-tested—it continues to offer utility where stability matters most. While each of these projects is making its mark, only MAGACOINFINANCE still has the full weight of early-stage potential—and the upside that comes with it. Final Word $555K might sound ambitious—but crypto has shown time and again that well-timed conviction can turn small stakes into market legends. Solana is proving its leadership.

Investors closely watch these coins as they rebound from recent lows. This article delves into the factors driving this upward momentum and explores what could be next for these digital assets. Shiba Inu Market Pulse: Rally, Resistance, and Trading Opportunities SHIB 's past month performance shows a gain of around 3.74% following a strong weekly rise of 19.77%. The six-month view reflects a decline of about 14.47%. Price action in recent weeks has been lively yet mixed, with a short burst of growth occurring amid broader downtrends over the half-year period. The current trading range lies between $0.00001 and $0.00002, with support at $0.00001 and resistance at $0.00002. Bulls are active near the upper boundary, while the high RSI of 70.41 hints at short-term overbought conditions. Traders might consider buying on dips if prices hold support, keeping caution near resistance levels for potential pullbacks. Pepe Coin: Volatile Growth Amid Strategic Price Levels Last month witnessed a 12.37% rise in Pepe , while the past six months indicated a milder 4.58% gain. A recent one-week surge of 30.70% reflected rapid momentum and temporary spikes in investor interest. The coin experienced noticeable price swings over these periods, suggesting high volatility and dynamic market sentiment. Current trading sees prices oscillating between $0.00000522 and $0.00000921 dollars, with a first resistance at $0.00001122 dollars and strong support at $0.00000324 dollars. RSI is at 71.55, hinting at bullish activity despite some overextension. Traders might explore short-term buys near support and consider cautious exits near resistance, as price action remains choppy with no clear, sustained trend. Conclusion SHIB and PEPE have shown significant recovery from their recent drops. Both coins are on the verge of a breakout. If they continue this upward trend, it could lead to new highs. Investors will be closely watching for sustained momentum. The performance of these coins will be critical in the coming days. Potential growth could attract more attention and capital. The resilience shown by SHIB and PEPE could signal stronger market positions ahead. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $23.59 level by 2027 and above $48.41 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a decreasing phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are losing value, and so is UNI. The cryptocurrency lost more than 0.68 percent of its value over the last 24 hours, and its price has decreased to $5.804. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $11.17, while the average price is expected to be around $9.31. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading near the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.8 and $8.3; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $48.41 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

LendingTree dropped new numbers on Friday, showing that more people are using BNPL for groceries and that a growing chunk of people are falling behind on their bills. Inflation won’t let up, interest rates are choking budgets, and talk about new tariffs is scaring the heck out of everyone. People are doing what they can, but in 2025, it’s looking ugly out there, and America is feeling it. In a survey run by LendingTree on April 2-3, 2,000 Americans between 18 and 79 were asked about their money habits. Half said they had used BNPL services. Out of those users, 25% said they had used BNPL loans to pay for groceries. That number was just 21% in 2023 and only 14% in 2024. The cracks are showing everywhere. Around 41% of BNPL users said they missed at least one payment in the last year, a nasty jump from 34% a year before. Americans load up on BNPL debt as late payments surge Matt Schulz, who is LendingTree’s chief consumer finance analyst, said late payers usually miss by just a week or so. But still, the number of people falling behind keeps getting worse. “A lot of people are struggling and looking for ways to extend their budget,” Matt said. “Inflation is still a problem. Interest rates are still really high. There’s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs and other economic issues, and it’s all going to add up to a lot of people looking for ways to extend their budget however they can.” Matt said that for many people across America, leaning on BNPL loans isn’t about convenience anymore; it’s survival. “For an awful lot of people, that’s going to mean leaning on buy now, pay later loans, for better or for worse,” he said. Matt made it clear he didn’t want to label the data as a recession warning, but he didn’t sound hopeful either. “I do think it’s going to get worse, at least in the short term,” he said . “I don’t know that there’s a whole lot of reason to expect these numbers to get better in the near term.” BNPL loans let people split a payment into smaller pieces without interest, but only if they pay on time. Late fees can tear through wallets fast, and juggling too many loans can turn into a nightmare. The LendingTree survey found that 60% of BNPL users had multiple loans at once. Nearly 25% said they had three or more going at the same time. Matt said that while BNPL can help when used carefully, it’s easy to lose control. Debt piles up even on concerts, deliveries, and cheeseburgers LendingTree’s report follows a bomb from Billboard, which showed that 60% of Coachella’s general admission crowd this year used BNPL to buy their concert tickets. The news triggered a fresh debate about Americans going into debt just to keep up appearances. Then came DoorDash, announcing it would let people use BNPL through Klarna to pay for food deliveries. The internet wasted no time dragging it, throwing out jokes about Americans needing loans for cheeseburgers and burritos. For a while, America looked like it could handle inflation and crazy high interest rates because the job market was strong, and wages were rising. But the story is flipping fast. Big companies like Walmart and Delta Airlines warned earlier this year that they were already seeing weaker demand and dropping sales. Meanwhile, Google searches are pointing at a rising fear of recession. Searches for “Global Financial Crisis” are about to hit their highest point since 2010. People are also googling “Great Recession” more than they have since the early Covid days. The fear is thick. Even the music charts are catching the vibe. “Recession pop,” the name for the flashy pop music that blew up during the 2008 crash, is back again. Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, and Katy Perry — the faces of pop from back then — are dropping new music in 2025. Miley and Gaga already put out new tracks this year, and Katy actually kicked off a world tour earlier this week, right when more Americans are stressing about another crash.

Once the darlings of viral rallies and Twitter-fueled pumps, these tokens now move more like market mascots than wealth-makers. But beneath the radar, a lesser-known DeFi player, Mutuum Finance, is stirring up whale interest and bullish forecasts. The presale is currently in Phase 4, and it’s generating investor enthusiasm. With over $7.2 million raised and 9,100 holders already onboard, investors are taking advantage of the current price of $0.025 per MUTM token, knowing that Phase 5 will see the price increase to $0.03. Participants in Phase 4 have the potential to earn a 140% return on investment before the token hits the official launch price of $0.06. MUTM is hinting that the biggest surprise of 2025 may not come with a dog or a frog, but from a disruptor ready to chart its own path. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges with Growing Investor Interest Mutuum Finance has established rapid growth as a decentralized lending platform because of its groundbreaking dual lending model. The presale data shows that more than 9,100 investors are participating and collectively contributed $7.2 million funds. Investors expect a 20% increase in MUTM value because the price tier of $0.025 in Phase 4 will transition to $0.03 in Phase 5. The official launch of Mutuum Finance will cause analysts to predict substantial growth that may surpass a market capitalization of $5. The stability of MUTM token contrasts with meme coin volatility since it provides suitable investments for DeFi sector participants. The platform gives employees rewards through a dynamic top-50 leader ranking system in addition to their unique lending models. A Game-Changing Shift in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance disrupts the decentralized finance (DeFi) market through the unification of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending mechanisms. Through P2C model users provide liquidity to smart contract-based pools using USDT to obtain passive income. Users can eliminate intermediaries under the P2P model because transactions directly connect P2P. Mutuum Finance connects P2C and P2P lending models which results in a smooth secure and efficient DeFi solution for users who want to earn returns through their investments. Building Stability and Security in DeFi Mutuum Finance implements a USD-backed stablecoin that operates on Ethereum blockchain as a measure to boost security alongside trust levels. The platform decreases risk by using over-collateralization to satisfy its process. Open-source smart contracts in combination with regular audits help the project stay secure because they prevent security vulnerabilities that affected previous DeFi projects. Growth Opportunities with Reward Programs Mutuum Finance will boost community development through their $100,000 giveaway that grants ten participants $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance integrates a referral mechanism which gives rewards to members who encourage new investors to join the system. The project allows its initial participants to receive special access benefits like staking options along with governance permissions and priority information updates which maintains their deep involvement through the project transformation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to position itself quietly among DeFi market applications as the emerging powerful coin despite the declining popularity of PEPE and Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. The presale of MUTM has received tremendous success from 9,100 investors who contributed $7.2 million thus far while Phase 4 introduces a price point of $0.025 that will jump to $0.03 in Phase 5. This demonstrates strong potential for growth through both phases. The upcoming market value anticipates the token price will reach $0.06 then surge beyond $5 by this year’s conclusion. As a result Mutuum provides investors with powerful dual-lending capabilities together with security features which makes its platform stand out from unstable meme coins. Sign up for the presale right now because you have the opportunity to become part of this shining DeFi firm which is on track to lead the DeFi movement.

These vigilantes are investors who often keep the government in check by selling bonds when there is a significant policy change. By selling their bond holdings, these investors typically push yields high and make it expensive for the government to borrow. The rally mirrored the stock market’s performance. US stock indices, such as the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq 100 , have all jumped by over 10% from their monthly lows. International indices like the German DAX and French CAC 40 have also jumped. You might also like: Bitcoin, gold rise while stocks fall: is decoupling here to stay? Earlier this month, President Donald Trump delivered his Liberation Day speech. The highest levies were applied to China, but a baseline 10% tariff was applied across the board with additional reciprocal tariffs that vary by nation. But Trump blinked after so-called “bond vigilantes” sprung into action. Investors essentially sold off bonds to pressure the government to reverse course. “The Bond Vigilantes have struck again,” wrote Yardeni. “As far as we can tell, at least with respect to U.S. financial markets, they are the only 1.000 hitters in history.” US bond yields went higher, with the 10-year Treasuries hitting 4.585% and the 30-year retesting 5% for the first time since January. The rising bond yields meant that the US public debt servicing would go up. Also, they meant that the president would likely fail in his plan for massive tax cuts. Significant unfunded tax cuts would have pushed bond yields higher. Trump commented on the bond market bluntly: “The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it.” Crypto rallies Bitcoin ( BTC ) price rose and retested the important resistance at $95,000 for the first time in over a month. Brett ( BRETT ), the biggest meme coin on the Base blockchain, jumped by 95% in the last seven days. Other top coins, such as Virtual Protocol ( VIRTUAL ), Official Trump ( TRUMP ), Sui ( SUI ), and Dogwifhat ( WIF ), have all jumped by over 50% in the last seven days. As a result, the market cap of all coins jumped to $3 trillion. Top crypto performers | Source: CoinMarketCap Bond vigilantes also contributed to Trump’s decision to abandon firing Jerome Powell from the Federal Reserve. The U.S. president cannot legally remove the Fed chair without cause. If the Supreme Court allowed such a move to stand, it would have led to a lack of confidence in U.S. bonds and the greenback. It would have also likely pushed bond vigilantes to dump Treasuries again. Trump also hinted that he was ready to strike a deal with China, even though China denied talks were taking place. Therefore, crypto prices may continue to rise in the coming weeks as tariff risks ease, and the odds of Federal Reserve cuts increase.

After months of flaunting his so-called friendship with the Russian president, Trump says he’s hurt now and doesn’t think Putin had any real interest in stopping the war despite their talks, so Moscow might need to be punished through “Banking” or “Secondary Sanctions.” In a long rant on Truth Social, Trump said , “No matter what deal I make with respect to Russia/Ukraine, no matter how good it is, even if it’s the greatest deal ever made, The Failing New York Times will speak BADLY of it.” Trump then dragged Peter Baker, calling him “the very biased and untalented writer for The Times,” and accused him of writing that Ukraine should get back all its territory, “including, I suppose, Crimea, and other ridiculous requests.” The US president said the violence happening now was “worse than anything since World War II.” Trump also took aim at Barack Obama for letting Russia take Crimea “without even a shot being fired.” He asked why Baker never criticized Obama’s handling of Crimea but keeps attacking Trump instead. He reminded everyone, “I’ve had nothing to do with this stupid war, other than early on, when I gave Ukraine Javelins, and Obama gave them sheets.” He made it clear this is “Sleepy Joe Biden’s War,” not his, calling the war “a loser from day one” and saying, “It should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened if I were President at the time.” Trump didn’t let up, saying, “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days.” He finished by saying, “Too many people are dying!!!” Trump and Zelenskyy push for a peace deal after tense Rome meeting The warning came just hours after Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met face-to-face in Rome, right before the funeral of Pope Francis. It was their first meeting since a heated Oval Office clash years ago that ended in a shouting match. This time, things were calmer. The White House said the two had a “very productive discussion,” but gave no details about what was agreed. Zelenskyy called the meeting “good” and said, “Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results.” Even though he kept it vague, the meeting showed both sides were trying to move forward. Earlier in the week, Trump had pushed a plan to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. His proposal reportedly included recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, something Zelenskyy has called a red line. Talking to TIME earlier this month, Trump said, “Crimea will stay with Russia,” adding, “Zelenskyy understands that, and everybody understands that it’s been with them for a long time. It’s been with them long before Trump came along.” After those comments, Zelenskyy quickly pushed back, saying again that Crimea belongs to Ukraine. Despite the obvious tension, Trump posted Friday that Russia and Ukraine are “very close to a deal,” and said the two sides should meet “at very high levels, to ‘finish it off.’” He wrote on Truth Social that “most of the major points are agreed to.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

He said at a shareholders' meeting in Bern that ”cryptocurrencies do not currently meet the requirements of foreign exchange reserves.” However, many local cryptocurrency companies expect that digital assets will still receive the necessary recognition from officials. Bitcoin as a reserve asset in Switzerland This is not the first time Schlegel has spoken out against the radical adoption of crypto. In March, he said he did not want to make Bitcoin a Swiss reserve asset, citing lack of stability, liquidity issues and security risks. The Swiss Federal Chancellery has initiated a proposal to constitutionally enshrine the National Bank's obligation to hold Bitcoin at the end of 2024. To launch the referendum, the initiators need to collect 100,000 signatures. The proposal is to change the third paragraph of Article 99 of the constitution. It currently reads as follows “The Swiss National Bank shall create sufficient currency reserves from its revenues; part of these reserves shall be held in gold.” If successful, the phrase ”and in Bitcoin” will be added to the text. The Swiss non-profit project 2B4CH participated in the development of the initiative and prepared and filed the necessary documents. 2B4CH is backed by some big names in the industry. In particular, we are talking about Jeev Zangana, vice president of Tether, which is the issuer of the largest stablecoin USDT. 2B4CH founder and chairman Yves Bennaim commented on the initiative. Here is the relevant comment on the matter. “We are not saying — go all in with bitcoin, but if you have nearly 1 trillion francs in reserves, like the SNB does, then it makes sense to have 1–2% of that in an asset that is increasing in value, becoming more secure, and that everyone wants to own.” If successful, the phrase ”and in Bitcoin” will be added to the text. The Swiss non-profit project 2B4CH participated in the development of the initiative and prepared and filed the necessary documents. Bitcoin Suisse board member Lusius Meisser noted that ”holding bitcoins makes more and more sense as the world transitions to a multipolar arrangement.” He added that the need is especially great now that ”the dollar and euro are weakening.” Maser argues that holding Bitcoin would spare the central bank from political influence from foreign currencies, most of whose reserves are denominated in dollars and euros. The rejoinder was as follows. Politicians are eventually tempted to print money to fund their agendas, and Bitcoin is a currency that cannot be diluted because of its scarcity nature. Switzerland remains one of the world centers of the crypto industry. For example, it was in the Swiss city of Zug that the history of Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of capitalization, began. And the country continues to generate crypto initiatives even now. In particular, international chain Spar started accepting bitcoin payments in a city in Switzerland this month, as we reported earlier. How real assets are tokenized According to RWA.xyz , a platform that tracks tokenized real assets, just six institutions control 88 percent of all tokenized U.S. Treasuries. This information points to the concentration of the sphere in the hands of a few funds as it evolves. BlackRock remains the largest issuer of tokenized bonds. The company's tokenized Treasury bond fund called BUIDL has a market capitalization of $2.5 billion, 360 percent more than its nearest competitor. Meanwhile, BlackRock reported $11.6 trillion in assets under management in the first quarter of 2025. The top six also includes Franklin Templeton's BENJI with a capitalization of $707 million, Superstate's USTB with $661 million, Ondo's USDY with $586 million, Circle's USYC with $487 million and Ondo's OUSG fund with $424 million in assets. Together, these six funds account for 88 percent of all tokenized bonds issued. The largest tokenized funds have been undergoing consolidation since the start of 2025. According to analyst data , of the six leading funds, only Circle's USYC has shown a decline in market capitalization in recent months. Most notably, BUIDL's capitalization rose 291 percent from Jan. 1 to April 24. It now occupies 41.1 percent of the total capitalization of the tokenized U.S. Treasury bond industry. MEXC Chief Operating Officer Tracey Jin noted that centralizing the tokenized asset sphere carries notable risks: Most tokenized assets will be issued on semi-centralized blockchains. This gives authorities the ability to impose restrictions or confiscate assets. Tokenization of real estate or bonds is still closely tied to the national legal system. The market for tokenized real assets is expected to experience rapid growth in 2025. The trend is supported by regulatory clarity, increased interoperability, liquidity solutions, identity transition from physical to digital, and development of fractional ownership. On April 21, the total capitalization of the sector reached a record $21.3 billion. The bottom line Although Switzerland is not yet ready to add Bitcoin to its reserves, the very fact that this idea is being discussed at the state level shows that the crypto industry is maturing. Against the backdrop of the development of tokenization of real assets, it is clear: digital technologies are penetrating deeper and deeper into the traditional financial system.

In addition, the SEC postponed the decision on Bitwise's Bitcoin and Ethereum-ETF to June 10. Reasons for the postponement and current context ”The Commission believes it is appropriate to designate a longer period for action on the proposed rule change, subject to Amendment No. 1, to allow sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues it raises,” the HBAR filing said. Applications for the Grayscale Polkadot Trust and Canary HBAR ETFs were filed in February as the companies sought to launch various cryptocurrency ETFs in an environment that was expected and appeared to be more crypto-industry friendly by the SEC. Since Trump took office as president in January, the SEC has shown openness to the crypto industry through public roundtables, while also halting several lawsuits against crypto companies. The next roundtable is scheduled for Friday and will focus on crypto asset custody. Under former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, the agency approved the listing of spot bitcoin-ETFs in January 2024 and spot Ethereum-ETFs later in July, following a decisive court ruling initiated by Grayscale. What this means for the market Another delay in crypto-ETF decisions underscores the regulator's cautious approach despite the new political climate. An expanded lineup of cryptocurrency ETFs could open up additional opportunities for institutional investors and potentially lead to an influx of new capital into altcoins. Many analysts note that the emergence of the Polkadot and Hedera ETFs will be an important precedent that could pave the way for ETFs based on other altcoins. However, the application process remains unpredictable as the SEC balances incentivizing innovation and protecting investors. The ultimate decision on these applications will largely depend on what approach to regulating cryptoassets the Trump administration takes in the coming months.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOT|REGULATION|HBAR,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-26 16:14:01

Key Technical Formation Indicates Upward Potential,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/sei-pyth-on-track-for-additional-rally-key-technical-formation-indicates-upward-potential,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts may be in for an exciting ride as SEI and PYTH show signs of a potential surge. A critical technical pattern suggests these digital assets could be poised for impressive gains. Readers eager to discover coins with promising growth prospects will find valuable insights in this analysis. Sei Price Dynamics: Rebound Week Amid Long-Term Setbacks A 23.85% gain in one week and a modest one-month increase of 1.11% contrast with a 43.90% drop over six months. The price movement signals a short-term recovery following a prolonged downturn. Recovery attempts have been volatile, showing brief moments of strong momentum, while long-term pressures continue to weigh on the market. Price currently oscillates between a low of $0.1347 and a high of $0.2423. Immediate resistance is near $0.31, with a second barrier at $0.42, while close support lies around $0.10. Bulls have driven the recent surge, but no clear trend is established. Traders may consider buying near support or waiting for a breakout above resistance to confirm further upward momentum. Pyth Network Price Update: Short-Term Rally and Long-Term Setbacks In the last month, PYTH experienced a slight decline of almost 2%, while over the past six months, it fell by roughly 54%. Price action highlights a period of significant losses after earlier highs, where short-term gains failed to maintain long-term interest. The market has shown volatility with swift reversals, reflecting caution among traders and setting a mixed backdrop for current activity. At present, Pyth Network trades between $0.10 and $0.20. Immediate resistance is observed at $0.26, with a second hurdle at $0.36, while support holds near $0.07 with an extreme low at $0.01. Despite a recent surge of nearly 23%, the trend remains unclear. Bulls are testing support levels while bears exert pressure near resistance, creating opportunities for buyers to enter within these key price bounds. Conclusion The analysis highlights a potential rally for SEI and PYTH . Key technical indicators show promising upward trends. Investor interest remains strong, suggesting continued growth. The market conditions appear favorable for further gains. Positive momentum in these coins could attract more attention. SEI and PYTH are likely to see significant appreciation if current trends persist. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

(JNVR), formerly known as Janover, is doubling down on its plan to buy more Solana for its treasury as it looks to offer up to $1 billion worth of securities. The firm, formerly a commercial real estate lending tech platform, revealed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that it plans on using the funds for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Solana.” The offering will include common and preferred stock, debt instruments, warrants, and units. DeFi Development has already acquired approximately $48.2 million of SOL and plans to operate validators on the Solana blockchain to earn staking rewards. Taking a playbook out of Michael Saylor's bitcoin buying strategy, corporations have been increasingly buying SOL for their balance sheets to provide TradFi investors with exposure to the token. SOL Strategies, the publicly traded company helmed by CEO Leah Wald—former co-founder of digital asset manager Valkyrie Investments—spearheaded the movement. Recently, the firm announced that it had secured an up to $500 million convertible note facility to ramp up its investments in the Solana network. DeFi Development's new offering comes after a significant leadership shakeup earlier this month. Former Kraken executive Joseph Onorati took over as CEO and chairman, and Parker White, another ex-Kraken engineer, was named chief operating officer and chief investment officer. The company also brought on John Han, a former Binance and Kraken executive, as CFO. DeFi Development adopted a treasury strategy centered around Solana as part of its new direction. In addition to the $1 billion shelf registration, DeFi Development also filed to register 1.24 million shares on behalf of early investors, including Pantera Capital, Payward (parent company of Kraken), and Arrington Capital. Shares of DeFi Development Corp surged more than 970% following the leadership shakeup and moved up roughly 4% in after-hours trading on Friday to now stand at $54 per share.

Bitcoin was once dismissed as niche, unscalable, and too early to matter. And yet, it became the most valuable asset of an entire generation. Now, a new name is starting to attract those same early-stage whispers: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . No one’s claiming it’s a sure thing. But the structure, the momentum, and the attention it’s commanding have made one thing clear—it deserves to be watched closely. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Credibility Fast—And It’s Not by Accident What makes MAGACOINFINANCE stand out isn’t just speculation—it’s strategy. From the ground up, this project has approached the market differently: clear timelines, organic wallet growth, transparent team communication, and rising community engagement. It’s not trying to go viral—it’s trying to last. This token is building its own narrative, and that narrative is beginning to resemble the earliest days of Bitcoin: quietly traded, talked about in closed investor groups, and gaining steam without relying on marketing tricks. In crypto, that’s a pattern worth watching. Bitcoin Paved the Way—But New Projects Are Following the Blueprint When Bitcoin first launched, the idea of a decentralized currency seemed radical. Today, it’s a global asset class. But for all its strength, its biggest price movement came from early adopters—those who saw the structure before the headlines. That same structure is now forming around MAGACOINFINANCE . It’s not a copy—it’s a new opportunity cut from the same cloth: early-stage vision, strong delivery, and growing conviction from those who understand timing. Competitive Projects Also in Focus: Polygon, Solana, Sei, and Aptos Polygon continues to lead Ethereum scaling with fast, cost-effective transactions. It’s an essential piece of Web3 infrastructure, and more platforms are integrating every day. Solana remains unmatched for speed and developer volume. With real-time applications, gaming, and financial dApps all thriving, Solana is back on every serious trader’s radar. Sei is built for trading—fast, precise, and focused. It’s becoming a go-to chain for high-frequency apps and performance-driven use cases. Aptos is still gaining momentum with its Layer-1 design and developer-centric tools. Its fast transactions and flexible architecture make it a real contender in the smart contract space. These are all strong platforms—but they’ve moved past their discovery phase. MAGACOINFINANCE is still in it—and that’s where the biggest growth potential lies. Final Word Will MAGACOINFINANCE.COM follow Bitcoin’s path to $1 million? No one can say for sure. But it’s asking the right questions, moving at the right pace, and capturing the right kind of attention. That’s how the biggest runs always begin.

Since Monday, SUI has gained more than 79% in value, reflecting a surge in bullish sentiment and positioning itself as one of the standout performers in the current market environment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Lacks On-Chain Support – Analyst Warns Of Vanishing Network Activity However, risks remain elevated as tensions between the US and China continue to escalate, creating uncertainty across financial markets. Trade conflicts and geopolitical friction could still weigh heavily on risk assets if conditions worsen. Top analyst Kaleo shared an analysis highlighting that SUI is gaining strength against Bitcoin, marking one of the first times in recent months that an altcoin shows significant relative performance compared to BTC. This strength is notable as most altcoins have struggled to outperform Bitcoin in a market dominated by caution and defensive positioning. The next few days will be critical in determining whether SUI can sustain its breakout or if a period of consolidation will follow. SUI Leads Layer-1 Blockchains as Momentum Builds SUI has positioned itself as one of the leading Layer-1 (L1) blockchains during the recent market rally. A Layer-1 blockchain refers to a base blockchain network, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, that processes and finalizes transactions without relying on another external chain. These networks operate independently with their own security protocols, native tokens, and decentralized validators, forming the backbone of the broader crypto ecosystem. Over the past two weeks, SUI has shown remarkable strength, significantly outperforming many other assets. If the market enters a sustained bullish phase for altcoins, SUI is likely to continue leading the pack, thanks to its recent resilience and strong relative performance. However, the environment remains extremely high risk. Some analysts are warning that current levels across crypto and equities could trigger a sharp market-wide retrace if sentiment shifts. Kaleo’s recent analysis on X suggests that SUI’s strength against Bitcoin is a particularly encouraging sign. He notes that SUI might be one of the first major L1s to hit new all-time highs during this bounce, reflecting strong underlying demand. The next week will be critical; US equities are now testing major resistance zones, and uncertainty around the ongoing US-China trade conflict continues to weigh heavily on global markets. How financial markets react over the coming days will likely influence whether SUI can extend its rally or enters a period of consolidation alongside broader risk assets. Related Reading: Ethereum Attempts First Major Horizontal Reclaim In Months – Can Bulls Hold the Line? SUI Battles Key Levels As Bulls Push Forward SUI is currently trading at $3.53 after several days of aggressive buying pressure that has propelled the price higher. The bullish momentum has been impressive, positioning SUI as one of the strongest-performing Layer-1 blockchains in the market. However, for this momentum to sustain, bulls must defend critical levels. The most important short-term level is $3.20, which aligns closely with the 200-day moving average (MA). Maintaining price action above this zone would confirm a bullish market structure and offer a solid foundation for further gains. If SUI manages to hold above the 200-day MA, it would signal strong underlying demand and reinforce bullish sentiment around the asset.

There is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense.” Senator Ossoff said he “strongly” supports impeachment proceedings during a town hall in the state of Georgia, where he is running for reelection to the Senate. The Senator added that an impeachment is unlikely unless the Democratic Party gains control of Congress during the US midterm elections in 2026. Trump’s own Republican Party currently has a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. TRUMP holders can register to dine with the US President. Source: gettrumpmemes.com Related: US lawmaker says TRUMP coin could risk national security Conflicts of interest On April 23, the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) memecoin’s website announced plans for Trump to host an exclusive dinner at his Washington, DC golf club with the top 220 TRUMP holders. The website subsequently posted a leaderboard tracking top TRUMP wallets and a link to register for the event. The TRUMP token’s price has gained more than 50% since the announcement, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The specific guest list is unclear , but the memecoin’s website states that applicants must pass a background check, “can not be from a [Know Your Customer] watchlist country,” and cannot bring any additional guests. On April 25, the team behind TRUMP denied social media rumors that TRUMP holders need at least $300,000 to participate in an upcoming dinner with the president. “People have been incorrectly quoting #220 on the block explorer as the cutoff. That’s wrong because it includes things like locked tokens, exchanges, market makers, and those who are not participating. Instead, you should only be going off the leaderboard,” they wrote. The TRUMP token jumped on news of the private dinner plans. Source: CoinMarketCap Legal experts told Cointelegraph that Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures, including the TRUMP memecoin and Trump-affiliated decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol World Liberty Financial, raise significant concerns about potential conflicts of interest . “Within just a couple of days of him taking office, he’s signed a number of executive orders that are significantly going to affect the way that our crypto and digital assets industry works,” Charlyn Ho of law firm Rikka told Cointelegraph in February. “So if he has a personal pecuniary benefit arising from his own policies, that’s a conflict of interest.” Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-26 16:40:41

Renowned asset manager Hashdex launched the first spot XRP ETF on B3, the country’s largest stock exchange, which doubles as the biggest in Latin America. Hashdex Debuts First Spot XRP ETF in Brazil According to the report , the spot XRP ETF, which has the ticker XRPH11, mirrors the Nasdaq XRP Reference Price Index. The fund will provide investors not interested in owning XRP directly with exposure to the coin. Genial Investimentos will oversee the management of the Hashdex fund. Meanwhile, XRPH11 will see at least 95% of its assets committed to XRP investment. XRP, with a market capitalization of $128.1 billion, is the fourth-ranked crypto asset. The asset manager has decided to adopt both direct and indirect purchases of the crypto asset. This method will allow institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to XRP without holding the coin themselves. Growing Optimism for a U.S. XRP ETF Approval At the start of 2025, users on Polymarket , a popular prediction platform, had placed the odds of XRP approval in the U.S at 70%. The initial poll anticipated an approval before July 31, 2025. Interestingly, despite Ripple’s headquarters in the United States, XRP has not gained regulatory approval. However, several applications have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and await review. According to a recent analysis, despite the regulatory delays in the U.S., XRP still stands a good chance of becoming the next crypto asset for an ETF . XRP’s strong market liquidity and high trading volume give it an edge over other applicants. Additionally, the asset has the most ETF filings from different asset managers. This signals the level of interest XRP has generated in the crypto space. Some notable names in the XRP ETF race in the U.S. include Bitwise , Canary Capital, and 21Shares. Nine companies have indicated interest. XRP Market Reaction and Future Outlook According to CoinMarketCap , as of this writing, XRP has risen slightly by 0.09% to $2.19 in the last 24 hours. The news of the XRP ETF launch is yet to significantly impact the market, as trading volume has declined by 16.84% to $3.01 billion. Notably, many believe that an approval in the U.S. would have a stronger impact on XRP’s price outlook. Market watchers are, however, looking for a shift in the coming days.

Aleah McPherson says she received a phone call from someone posing as a Wells Fargo employee and warning of fraudulent activity, reports Fox 5 Atlanta. The caller instructed her to transfer funds via Zelle and a Chase Bank digital wallet for “safekeeping.” After complying, McPherson realized scammers had taken her money. “That was my savings.

In a recent article, the firm’s Vice President of Legal, Paul VanGrack, called on the states with pending lawsuits against Coinbase’s staking program to drop them. The Securities and Exchange Commission, along with ten other states, had sued the exchange over its staking program in June 2023, describing it as unregistered securities. Although Coinbase contested the legal action at the time, some of the states issued cease and desist orders, forcing Coinbase to end the program in their states. As the US regulatory policy towards the crypto industry has shifted, the SEC has dismissed its lawsuit with prejudice. Five other states, including Illinois, South Carolina, Alabama, Vermont, and Kentucky, also dropped their own lawsuits. However, five other states, including California, Maryland, Wisconsin, New Jersey, and Washington, still have pending litigation. Coinbase believes they should also withdraw their cases. VanGrack said: “It’s time for these states to catch up with the SEC—and nearly every other state—and drop their unfounded cases.” According to Coinbase, it knew from the outset that the lawsuit was wrong and has fought to defend itself while educating policymakers. The exchange believes that the SEC and other states have dismissed their own lawsuits as a result of its efforts. However, it described the remaining lawsuits as generating regulatory uncertainty at a time when the US is making moves to establish a framework for crypto. Thus, a Coinbase executive argued that the decision of some states to hold out and not drop their lawsuits has become indefensible, and the exchange will continue its fight against the lawsuits. Over $90 million in staking rewards have been lost due to the staking ban Meanwhile, VanGrack focused on the states that still have pending cease and desist orders against Coinbase’s staking, noting that they are only harming consumers. Four states, California, Maryland, Wisconsin, and New Jersey, currently have that. He wrote: “All but one (Washington) are enforcing cease-and-desist orders that have already cost residents tens of millions of dollars in missed staking rewards, while limiting consumer choice and increasing regulatory uncertainty.” The executive noted that a strict order such as this is usually used only for emergency cases, such as Ponzi schemes, and not for normal products, such as Coinbase staking. He further highlighted what makes Coinbase a top staking service provider, including its safety and compliance records. Interestingly, the exchange said that the war on staking is costing US residents. VanGrack claimed that an estimated $90 million in staking rewards have been lost by residents in the four states due to the ban, and it will continue to increase if the states do not drop their cases. He added that the ban also singles out Coinbase among all staking service providers, which means that the state is picking winners and losers. This move could force consumers to use staking platforms with less regulatory oversight and put them at higher risk, he argued. Coinbase pressures regulators to become pro-crypto Meanwhile, the Coinbase article is just one of the many advocacy efforts that the exchange has made over the past few months. The exchange has grown bolder and stronger in its push for regulatory clarity since President Trump was elected. It is currently involved in a lawsuit against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) over the impact of its crypto debanking efforts, and recently wrote to the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to allow SEC users to hold and use crypto, so they can better understand what they are regulating. The exchange is also reportedly launching a campaign against the four states that have banned staking, with plans to emphasize the losses due to the ban and lawsuits. Coinbase’s pro-crypto advocacy is unsurprising, given that it is one of the biggest beneficiaries of regulatory clarity. Although its COIN stock is down 15.57% this year, the firm continues to see increased adoption as the crypto market grows stronger. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Jennifer Lee, a product manager for Stripe Crypto, announced the news on Friday, asking companies outside the US to reach out if they were “interested in dollar access.” Lee says the asset will be powered by Bridge, a stablecoin startup Stripe acquired in February. Patrick Collison, Stripe’s chief executive, says his firm has “wanted to build this product for around a decade.” Earlier this year, he and his brother John Collison, the Stripe co-founders, wrote in the firm’s annual letter that stablecoins represent the future of money. “Improvements to the basic usability of money make economies more prosperous. Consider the transitions from coins to banknotes, from the gold standard to fiat currency, and from paper instruments to electronic payments. Stablecoins are a new branch of the money tree. Such transitions occur with some regularity over the centuries, and the effects tend to be large.” Stripe reemerged in the crypto sector last October when it rolled out support for USDC settlements on the Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Polygon ( POL ) blockchains. The payments giant previously enabled payments made using Bitcoin ( BTC ) until 2018, when the firm discontinued its support, citing BTC’s lack of utility as a payments rail. The stablecoin development materializes as Stripe continues to grow, with the firm’s total payment volume surging to $1.4 trillion in 2024, a 38% increase year-on-year. That total represents 1.3% of the world’s total gross domestic product (GDP), per a press release from the company.

After a prolonged period of volatility and consolidation, altcoins appear poised for explosive rallies. Current macro patterns, technical indicators, and shifts in investor behavior are aligning to suggest that a full-scale altcoin bull run could arrive sooner than expected. The crypto space may soon witness historic momentum building over the coming months. Macro Charts Hint at Major Upside for Altcoins According to top trader Moustache , the macro chart of the altcoin market cap excluding Bitcoin has reached a critical setup.

Aptos is defending critical levels, holding steady at $5.53 and avoiding deeper breakdowns. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is showing aggressive burn activity, with its burn rate rising by more than 1300% over the last twenty-four hours. Together, these shifts are setting the stage for higher engagement among investors. At the same time, Web3 ai is emerging as a serious contender for breakout status. With a structured 1747% ROI built directly into its presale cycle and a real product suite under development, Web3 ai is not simply another speculative presale but a rising platform in the making. It is now increasingly being viewed as a top breakout crypto opportunity for forward-looking investors. Aptos (APT) Price Today Shows Resilience at $5.53 The Aptos (APT) price today is demonstrating notable resilience, holding steady around $5.53 after a test of lower support zones earlier in the month. Aptos continues to resist major breakdowns despite broader volatility across altcoins, and this relative strength is drawing renewed interest from market participants. Technical analysis of the Aptos (APT) price today shows the coin maintaining structure above its recent lows and forming a potential base pattern on the daily chart. If Aptos can continue defending the $5.30 to $5.50 zone, the next upside targets around $6.10 to $6.30 could come into play over the coming weeks. Volume remains relatively muted, but the stabilization is notable given the external market pressures. The Aptos (APT) price today benefits from strong ecosystem development and growing Layer-1 infrastructure integrations, including partnerships across DeFi and gaming sectors. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burn Rate Surges and Supports Bullish Sentiment The Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate has exploded over the last twenty-four hours, jumping by more than 1300% and reducing circulating supply by more than twenty-seven million SHIB tokens. This burn surge has reignited bullish sentiment around Shiba Inu and is being closely monitored by traders and analysts alike. Technical indicators following the Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate event suggest that SHIB is preparing for a push toward the $0.00001392 level. The rally in burn metrics is often seen as a catalyst for positive price movement, particularly when aligned with consolidation patterns like the one SHIB is currently forming. Despite the momentum, Shiba Inu’s moves remain tied to broader meme culture sentiment. While the Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate offers meaningful supply-side dynamics, investors looking for more direct platform-based growth opportunities are increasingly positioning into structured breakout crypto projects like Web3 ai where growth is tied to product utility rather than social media cycles. Web3 ai Projects 1747% ROI and Leads the Breakout Crypto Conversation While Aptos maintains key supports and Shiba Inu sees burn-driven excitement, Web3 ai is quietly establishing itself as a leader in the next breakout crypto phase. Priced at $0.0003 during its first presale stage and heading toward a listing price of $0.005242, Web3 ai delivers a built-in 1747% ROI window for early buyers. Web3 ai is developing twelve AI-driven tools aimed at crypto investors and DeFi participants. These tools include real-time portfolio optimizers, on-chain risk analyzers, trading signal generators, and scam detection systems. The full platform will integrate these services into a unified dashboard powered by the $WAI token. Unlike speculative meme coins, Web3 ai ties token value directly to functional usage. Access to platform services, governance participation, and staking incentives are all linked to $WAI, ensuring real demand cycles that scale with user adoption. The structured approach to both product deployment and tokenomics is why Web3 ai is increasingly viewed as a breakout crypto candidate. It combines early entry price access with real-world problem-solving tools that are needed by active crypto participants. Aptos Holds Steady, SHIB Burn Rate Ignites, Web3 ai Leads the Breakout Phase The Aptos (APT) price today is proving resilient, holding the $5.53 support and maintaining daily structure despite broader market turbulence. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate surge has reignited positive sentiment, with technical setups pointing toward further upside if resistance levels break. Yet when it comes to identifying the next breakout crypto with both high ROI and real utility, Web3 ai leads clearly. With a 1747% ROI opportunity already built into its token structure and a growing suite of AI-powered investor tools nearing release, Web3 ai offers one of the strongest setups for 2025 and beyond.

Historic Meeting with Pakistan’s Top Leaders WLF’s leadership recently met with Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Army Chief, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and other senior officials to discuss an ambitious collaboration plan. Sources reveal that the Pakistani government is on the verge of announcing full-scale crypto legalization, setting the stage for the country to emerge as one of the fastest-growing crypto markets worldwide. This proactive approach signals Pakistan’s intent to leap into the future of finance — a move that could place it at the forefront of the Web3 revolution. Strategic Partnership to Unlock DeFi, Stablecoins, and Blockchain Testing The partnership between WLF and PCC is set to focus on several critical areas: Launching regulatory sandboxes to test blockchain products safely. Driving responsible DeFi growth and innovation. Exploring real-world asset tokenization opportunities. Expanding stablecoin adoption for remittances and international trade. Offering strategic regulatory advice on global blockchain policies. World Liberty Financial praised Pakistan’s bold vision, calling it an “exciting hub for decentralized finance innovation.” Pakistan’s Young Population Set to Lead Global Web3 Adoption With over 64% of Pakistan’s population under 30 and a rapidly growing freelance economy, the country is perfectly positioned to become a powerhouse in the digital economy. Pakistan already boasts $300 billion in annual crypto transactions and 25 million active crypto users — numbers that are expected to skyrocket with government support. “Pakistan’s youth and technology sector are our greatest assets,” said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb. “Through partnerships like this, we are opening new doors for investment, innovation, and global leadership in the blockchain economy.” The CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council echoed this optimism, emphasizing that empowering young Pakistanis through blockchain technology will accelerate the nation’s rise on the global financial stage. Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, was recently appointed as a strategic adviser to Pakistan’s Crypto Council. Zhao’s role involves helping Pakistan build blockchain infrastructure, shape crypto rules, and support projects like digital money, mining, and teaching youth about blockchain. With strong mobile phone penetration, increasing crypto adoption, and official moves toward regulation, Pakistan’s youth are poised to lead the next massive wave of Web3 innovation.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-26 17:00:47

Near Protocol faces renewed uncertainty, with analysts forecasting a potential drop to $0.50 by the end of 2025, despite hints of a short-term rebound. Meanwhile, Solana continues to draw attention from institutions, lifting its price from $95 to $132, though future projections remain split between cautious and optimistic. In contrast, BlockDAG is turning heads for a different reason. By rolling back its presale batch 27 price to just $0.0025, far below its earlier high of $0.0248, BlockDAG is offering investors a rare opportunity few anticipated this late in presale. NEAR Protocol’s 2025 Price Outlook Near Protocol (NEAR) has experienced significant price fluctuations in recent times. After peaking at $9 in March 2024, the token’s value declined, reaching approximately $2.12 by April 15, 2025. Currently, analysts anticipate further downward movement, with projections suggesting a potential low of $0.50 by the end of 2025, based on wave count methodologies. Nevertheless, despite the bearish trend, there are indications of a possible short-term rebound. Technical patterns, such as a descending wedge formation, hint at a potential breakout towards $3.50. However, the overall sentiment remains cautious, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 35, indicating bearish momentum. Looking ahead, the Near Protocol (NEAR) price forecast varies among analysts. While some predict a modest recovery, others foresee continued volatility. Investors should remain vigilant, considering both technical indicators and broader market trends when evaluating NEAR’s potential trajectory. Solana’s Institutional Momentum: A 2025 Snapshot Solana (SOL) is capturing significant attention in April 2025, with its price rebounding from a recent low of $95 to approximately $132, driven by heightened institutional interest and the launch of Canada’s first spot Solana ETFs. As a result, these developments have spurred increased trading volumes, signaling renewed investor confidence. Moreover, major financial entities are making substantial investments in Solana. Galaxy Digital has reportedly acquired $95 million worth of SOL, while DeFi Development Corporation has expanded its holdings to over 317,000 SOL, valued at around $47.6 million. Additionally, asset manager Ark Invest plans to incorporate Canada’s 3iQ Solana Staking ETF into its crypto-focused funds, reflecting growing institutional confidence. When it comes to future predictions, analysts present varied forecasts for Solana’s price by the end of 2025. Some anticipate a rise to $380 or even $500, citing factors like increased institutional adoption and technological advancements. On the other hand, others adopt a more cautious stance, projecting the price to remain between $130 and $150, contingent on broader market conditions. BlockDAG Rewinds Presale Price and Sparks Buyer Battles as Investors Rush In BlockDAG has set the crypto community abuzz by rewinding its presale batch 27 token price to $0.0025, a sharp rollback from its earlier $0.0248 peak. Consequently, this move has created a fresh window for investors to access BDAG at highly attractive early-stage pricing just ahead of the project’s anticipated launch. Adding to the excitement, BlockDAG unveiled its Buyer Battles feature, where 25 million BDAG are made available daily. If any tokens remain unsold within 24 hours, they are awarded to the top buyer of the day, injecting a layer of excitement and reward-driven competition. Presale stats further highlight the momentum: BlockDAG has already raised an impressive $218.5 million, sold over 19.3 billion coins, and sits at batch 27 with a 2,380% ROI from batch 1 pricing. This blend of a strategic price rollback and gamified incentives is positioning BlockDAG among the top crypto coins , catching serious attention. As time runs short, excitement across Telegram and X continues to grow, with investors keen to maximize their allocations before the next major milestone. Shifting Opportunities The months ahead are shaping up to be a test of resilience and timing. Near Protocol faces technical challenges that could pressure its price even further if key support levels give way. Solana’s institutional momentum offers promise, but price targets remain uncertain as broader market factors continue to influence sentiment. BlockDAG, however, stands out for its tactical approach. The decision to roll back its presale price to $0.0025 just before launch introduces a window of opportunity that few projects offer at this stage. As competition tightens, investors are weighing both timing and strategy more carefully than ever.

According to Alphractal’s risk analysis, while Solana’s price has dropped below $100 at one point in the past month, it has not reached extreme levels in metrics such as Sharpe Ratio and Normalized Risk Metric (NMR). This suggests that long-term risk analysis could present better opportunities at lower levels after Solana’s strong rally into 2024. However, in bull cycles, many of these opportunities may never materialize. Alphractal says Solana needs to hold the $100 support level to prove its strength. If that support is lost, a new wave of pessimism could be triggered, he warned.

The SHIB token was trading at $0.00001430, up by 40% from its lowest level this year. This article provides a SHIB price forecast as the daily burn rate jumped by over 926% and its Shibarium network gains momentum. Shiba Inu price rises as risk-on sentiment returned The SHIB token has done well in the past few weeks. This recovery occurred as investors shifted back to riskier assets this week. Popular stock market indices like the Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, DAX Index, and CAC 40 have jumped in the past few weeks. These assets soared as investors reacted to Donald Trump’s statement that he was not considering firing Jerome Powell , the Chair of the Federal Reserve. Such a move would have been unprecedented and would have led to heightened volatility in the crypto and stock market. They also soared as investors cheered to his openness to having a trade deal with other countries, especially with China. The Wall Street Journal reported that he was considering dropping tariffs on Chinese goods from the current 145% to 50% as his opening salvo. These actions led to a surge in risky assets and an outflow from safe-haven assets. Indeed, US bond yields have pointed downwards, while the US dollar index has jumped to $100 after falling to $98 earlier this month. At the same time, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has moved from the extreme fear zone earlier this month to the neutral point at 55. SHIB burn rate gains steam Meanwhile, Shiba Inu’s burn rate has jumped sharply in the past few days. Its daily rate jumped by 926% to 15.19 million SHIB coins on Saturday, bringing the total number of tokens burned to over 410 trillion coins. A token burn is a common practice that cryptocurrencies do to boost their valuation. It achieves this by reducing the number of tokens in circulation and creating a sense of scarcity. It differs from token unlocks, which add more tokens into circulation. The Shiba Inu price has also surged as the total value locked (TVL) in the Shibarium network increased to nearly $3 million. All players like ShibaSwap, WoofSwap, K9 Finance DAO, ChewySwap, and DogSwap have all added assets in the past seven days. Shibarium’s success is a good thing for Shiba Inu price because its transactions leads to more transactions and fees. Some of the BONE fees generated in the network are converted into SHIB and burned. More data shows that the network has handled over 1,09 billion transactions, while the number of addresses is nearing 200 million. The other bullish catalyst for the SHIB price is that the funding rate has remained in the positive zone in the past few days. Shiba Inu price technical analysis SHIB price chart | Source: TradingView The three-day chart shows that the SHIB price bottomed at $0.00001065 earlier this month. This is a notable level since it was the lowest swing in August last year. It is also a sign that the coin has formed a double-bottom pattern whose neckline is at $0.000033. The coin also formed a small double-bottom with a neckline at $0.0000156. These patterns are highly bullish. Oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the token is likely to experience a strong bullish breakout, with the initial target to watch being the psychological point at $0.000020, representing a 40% increase from the current level. A drop below the support at $0.000010 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

It also soared as its stablecoin market cap jumped to a record high. Solana ( SOL ) rose to $153 on Saturday, its highest level since March 3, and 60% above the lowest level this year. This recovery has pushed its market cap to almost $80 billion. Solana’s rally occurred as investors returned to meme coins within its ecosystem, boosting their market capitalization to $10 billion, a $4 billion rise from this month’s lowest level. Most Solana meme coins have soared, with Official Trump ( TRUMP ), Bonk ( BONK ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), and Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) jumping by over 60% in the last seven days. Three of its meme coins – TRUMP, Bonk, and Fartcoin — have accumulated a market cap of over $1 billion. Most of these meme coins were inspired by Fartcoin, a popular meme coin that jumped by almost 500% from its monthly lows. The rally also accelerated after Trump invited the top investors of his meme coin for dinner in May.

It has also moved above the 50-day moving average. Additionally, oscillators such as the Relative Strength Index and the MACD have continued to rise.

Between May 2024 and April 2025, the average drop in value from over-the-counter (OTC) valuations to current spot prices recorded was around 50%. Locked Tokens Underperform Amid Market Decline Sabharwal’s analysis highlighted that many investors missed opportunities to exit at double today’s prices in 2024, as market conditions led to widespread devaluations across major tokens. Unreleased token deals are often made early with long-term expectations, but over the past year, market changes and project-specific issues have led to heavy losses. Almost all the tracked projects have seen large drops in value. Scroll (SCR) and Blast (BLAST) were hit the worst, falling by 85% and 88% respectively. Eigenlayer (EIGEN) followed with a 75% drop. Other projects like ZKsync (ZK) at -64%, Wormhole (W) at -50%, and io.net (IO) at -48% also saw sharp declines. Jito was the only project to post gains, rising 75% over the same period. Overall, these early-stage token investors who committed to locked positions faced greater losses than the general crypto market. Data from Artemis shows the broader market declined by an average of 40.7% during the same timeframe, about 20% less than the average loss for locked tokens. Investors Are Facing More Losses Further, when factoring in liquidity value over the past 12 months, such holders lost another 31% in opportunity cost when compared to Bitcoin (BTC), which gained 45% during the same period. On top of that, with over $40 billion in locked altcoins set to be released soon, sellers are now facing another 50% discount when exiting through OTC markets. Based on this data, $1 invested a year ago would now be worth $1.45 in BTC. On the other hand, that same $1 held in an unreleased coin is now worth $0.50. Further, with the current OTC discount, it would sell for only $0.25. This results in a total value loss of approximately 82.8% compared to BTC, and 75% compared to the USD. The analyst also noted that since most cryptocurrencies are reaching the end of their cliff periods in 2025, discounts are slightly lower now due to shorter vesting durations. Locked tokens usually come with vesting schedules or restrictions that delay when they can be sold. This leaves holders exposed to price changes during the lock-up period, as they cannot immediately liquidate their holdings.

Vitalik Buterin Proposes RISC-V : Ethereum’s co-founder has suggested replacing the EVM bytecode with the RISC-V instruction set, making Ethereum more adaptable, efficient, and future-ready. Base Layer Activity Drops: Despite innovations, Ethereum collected just 3.18 ETH in blob fees, with average gas fees at $0.16 in April, the lowest since 2020. This has raised sustainability concerns but is also making the network more accessible. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 If Ethereum manages to stay above this support, it could gradually rise towards $2,400 or more by the end of 2025, especially if the market becomes more positive. However, Ethereum will face resistance around $2,500, so it may take time to break through this level. The Ethereum price is expected to maintain its upward trajectory and form higher highs. Furthermore, with increased adoption, newer upgrades, and network growth, the ETH coin price can smash the $5k mark and hit a new all-time high of $5,925. Conversely, rising uncertainty or any unfavorable global economic events could pull the ETH price toward its annual low of $2,917. Considering the market sentiments, the average price could settle at around $3,392.

The cryptocurrency PEPE has shown a 15% daily price gain that creates an opportunity for a possible jump above $0.00001 while whale money drives its ascent. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to attract investors because it collected $7.2 million during its active presale stage while selling 425 million tokens to more than 9,100 token holders. These crypto tokens attract market attention because they follow different strategic paths in the bustling crypto market space. The market rush for returns has taken over as investors speed up their deals before the prices surge too much higher. Multiple factors explain why these projects gain industry focus. Pepe (PEPE) Surges with Breakout Potential PEPE experiences market enthusiasm at this time because it gained 30% within a week while trading at $0.000009. A recently formed technical pattern which broke through a descending channel implies PEPE could rise toward $0.00001. The growth of whale wallets crosses 41 trillion tokens to reach 172 trillion tokens because investors believe in the potential for a market breakout. The trading volume soared to $650 million while futures interest crossed $348 million following a jump of 32.67%. The price holds resistance at $0.00000890 while recent market capital gains of $8 million risk slowing down its upward movement. PEPE maintains success through community enthusiasm yet its wild price swings require careful investment because investors show interest in MUTM for its stabilizing characteristics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Ignites Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in its fourth presale phase due to $0.025 pricing of its tokens. The project has collected $7.2 million from the token sale which 9,100 investors purchased a total of 425 million of them. The Phase 4 sale demonstrates quick momentum whereas investors who buy before the price increase to $0.03 will gain an instant profit. The project tokenomics show 140% surpluses starting from $0.06 listing price while market projection indicate $2.50 value in 2025 for a total elevation of 9,900%. The team has initiated a CertiK audit on its smart contracts which will soon publish its assessment results through social networks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends innovation with investor appeal. Leaderboard Rewards Boost Engagement The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform will introduce a leaderboard display for its top 50 holders who obtain bonus tokens by sustaining their positions on the leaderboard. The gamified process creates an environment which generates loyal users who plan to stay long-term. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launches a practical lending system that provides tangible use which differs from Pepe (PEPE) that depends heavily on speculative hype. Early investors can secure the most affordable prices in the presale process since a future price increase is planned for phase 5. The project gains traction from investors who want to purchase tokens since it provides both an established plan and DeFi-centered strategy. The calculated entry by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges successfully from the crowded market. Shifting Tides in Crypto Investors who left Shiba Inu (SHIB) behind are now allocating their funds between short-term focused Pepe (PEPE) and the long-term appealing Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Pepe (PEPE) depends heavily on market speculation to grow even though it needs to overcome several critical barriers before its price can rise. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gained widespread success during its presale phase and projects it will reach $2.50 in 2025. The fourth phase at $0.025 is a fleeting chance to join 9,100 holders reaping potential 9,900% returns. Visit Mutuum Finance to explore this DeFi project before phase 5 begins.

33767162,[object Object],1745688627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Bounces From Key Fib Support Level: Sign Of Structual Strength?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bounces-from-key-fib-support-level-sign-of-structual-strength/,"Bitcoin is now trading above the $93,000 level, showing strong momentum as bulls continue to push prices higher. After weeks of uncertainty and heavy volatility, the trend appears to be shifting toward recovery. The main target now is reclaiming the critical $100,000 mark, which would confirm a sustainable rally into uncharted territory and set the stage for the next major bullish phase. However, risks remain elevated. Tensions between the US and China persist, and the ongoing trade conflict continues to create an unstable backdrop for global markets. Investors are navigating a fragile environment where any negative developments could trigger sharp reactions across risk assets, including Bitcoin. Top crypto analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting that BTC is currently experiencing a strong bounce and continuation from the 0.382 Fibonacci Retracement level. Historically, this Fibonacci zone acts as a classic support area during healthy uptrends, providing a strong foundation for price continuation if defended successfully. Bitcoin Faces Critical Phase As Bulls Fight For Higher Ground Bitcoin is now entering a crucial phase as price action over the coming weeks could define the short-term and even medium-term trend. After reclaiming the $93,000 level, bulls have regained short-term control. However, investors remain cautious, knowing that any major negative catalyst could quickly reverse momentum across risk assets, including Bitcoin. Analysts are split on the next big move. Some believe Bitcoin could rally above its all-time highs (ATH) in the coming weeks, driven by growing institutional flows and a shift in risk appetite. Others caution that the macroeconomic backdrop remains too fragile, warning that we have not yet seen the full extent of downside risks. Daan’s optimistic view highlights that Bitcoin’s current trend structure is far more mature than in previous cycles. He notes that while the trend has become steadier and slower, it is also more reliable, offering fewer extreme swings and better long-term positioning for investors. Daan points to the recent strong bounce and continuation from the 0.382 Fibonacci Retracement level as confirmation of this maturity. Historically, holding this key Fibonacci zone in an uptrend signals strong underlying demand and market resilience. The coming days will be critical for Bitcoin to maintain momentum and push above the $95,000–$96,000 resistance range to continue toward uncharted territory. Technical Details: Key Indicator Hovers Around $89K Bitcoin is trading at $94,700 after briefly pushing above the $95,800 mark earlier today. Bulls continue to show strength, but the real test remains the psychological $100,000 level. Breaking and sustaining above $100K would confirm a major rally into new all-time highs (ATH) and likely spark another wave of bullish momentum across the market. However, several analysts caution that a healthy retrace from current levels is still possible before Bitcoin can make a serious push into six figures. After a strong multi-week rally, some profit-taking and cooling off would be natural, helping to reset funding rates and sentiment before the next major leg higher. The key level to watch on the downside is $89,000. The 200-day moving average (MA), a crucial trend indicator, currently lies around that zone. As long as Bitcoin holds above the 200-day MA, the broader uptrend remains intact, and any pullbacks would likely be viewed as buying opportunities by investors.

SOLANA and XRP Investors Are Betting on MAGACOINFINANCE.COM!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/500k-from-just-500-solana-and-xrp-investors-are-betting-on-magacoinfinance-com/,"Every bull market has its legend. The story of someone who saw something early, took a small bet, and watched it grow into a life-changing opportunity. With fresh capital flowing back into the market, many are now looking for that next big move. And right now, that move could be MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . Backed by growing speculation from Solana and XRP investors, this project is being picked up on radar screens across Telegram channels, private groups, and trader dashboards—and for good reason. The mechanics, momentum, and community growth are starting to align in a way that feels unmistakably early. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Positioning Itself for Something Bigger Most new tokens fade into the noise within weeks. MAGACOINFINANCE is defying that pattern. With structured rollouts, transparent leadership, and increasingly active wallet metrics, it’s drawing the attention of traders who know how to spot staying power. The real story? It’s not being driven by marketing stunts—it’s being built on trust and traction. The team is delivering. The roadmap is being followed. And the early believers are doubling down, not cashing out. This is the kind of project that doesn’t shout—it shows. What’s Drawing Solana and XRP Holders? Solana investors are drawn to speed, execution, and scalable tech. They’re used to backing platforms with explosive potential and measurable development. MAGACOINFINANCE is delivering those same signals—just at a much earlier stage. XRP holders, who’ve weathered years of regulation and stuck to their thesis, recognize structural discipline when they see it. With MAGACOINFINANCE , they’re seeing the same clarity, community strength, and long-term vision they bet on with XRP. Heavyweights Still Leading: Ethereum, Chainlink, Sei, and Bitcoin Ethereum remains the bedrock of blockchain development. With the continued rise of Layer-2s and on-chain innovation, it’s as important as ever to the crypto economy. Chainlink is the unseen force behind much of crypto’s functionality. From price feeds to data bridges, its oracles are everywhere—and essential. Sei is being talked about more frequently as an emerging, performance-first chain. Its design around high-frequency trading is gaining traction among technical builders. Bitcoin , as always, is the anchor. Whether you’re a maximalist or not, there’s no denying its place as the foundation of every major market cycle. But when it comes to early-stage upside? That spotlight’s swinging toward MAGACOINFINANCE . Final Word Can $500 really become $500K? In crypto, that kind of leap has happened before—and it always starts with conviction in the early phase. Solana and XRP investors are making that call now with MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . If the past is any guide, the next big story begins exactly like this.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped 0.17% in 24 hours to $2.20. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Talking about the XRP price, it is down by 0.17% to $2.20. If the bullish momentum kicks in, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.31. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $2.10. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” and “Will XRP go up?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. What is the XRP price prediction for today? According to the XRP price analysis done by our expert panel, the XRP crypto price today could go as high as $2.31. XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.20110564 0.47% Market cap $ 128,531,731,717.84 Circulating Supply 58,394,167,593.00 Trading Volume $ 2,636,382,145.8573 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction April 2025 XRP shows bullish momentum, recently bouncing from a local bottom and crossing above the 9-day SMA. The RSI at 58.6 signals strengthening upside without overbought risk. Price structure suggests a potential breakout if the neckline resistance near $2.40–$2.50 is cleared. Consolidation post-downtrend adds credibility to reversal signals. XRP Price Prediction April 2025 High Price : $2.40 (key resistance level) Low Price : $1.85 (recent low before breakout) Average Price : $2.0 (current consolidation level) XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, JP Morgan Chase has approved XRP for use within its banking payment framework. If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain in a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the long-term XRP price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

In fact, data from SoSoValue shows that they were the worst-performing crypto basket over the last 12-month period, enduring a 62% drop in the period, compared to a 174% rise on PayFi tokens. However, under the Trump administration's crypto-friendly stance, it might be changing. Gala Games—a blockchain-based gaming platform—says it became the first crypto gaming company to partner with the White House, bringing a Web3 game Easter Egg Hunt to the 2025 Easter Egg Roll. White House official X's account also mentioned on the social media platform about the tie-up amid a plethora of other collaborations with tech giants. The GALA token has risen roughly 18% since the announcement, GameFi tokens went up 13%, and the broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index, rose 8%. User engagement The effort aimed to introduce blockchain to families without overwhelming them. The game, hosted at easter.gala.games, offered a ""free and simple"" experience where players collected virtual eggs to win unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) stored on GalaChain, Gala's proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, the company said in an announcement shared with CoinDesk. Players were able to log in, explore, and collect eggs without needing a crypto wallet experience, Gala Games said. Every NFT reward was stored on GalaChain, hinting at future use across Gala’s entertainment projects, including Gala Music and Gala Film. The Web3 gaming firm told CoinDesk that over 300,000 games have been played since the event launched, with about 100,000 new accounts created. Roughly 17% of participants went on to explore Gala's other projects, suggesting real user engagement beyond the Easter event. The project, founded in 2019 by Zynga co-founder Eric Schiermeyer, has been laying the groundwork for broader adoption through partnerships with DreamWorks Animation, NBCUniversal, and collaborations with artists like Snoop Dogg. Earlier this month, Gala Film announced a partnership with LG Electronics to bring Web3 entertainment to TVs, and the company hinted it is working with a government agency on transparency efforts. Industry reaction The Easter game marks a real-world test for the project and the broader GameFi sector. When asked about the lead-up to the event, Schiermeyer shared that the project has been focusing on the high-level tie-up. ""We have a team dedicated to government outreach,"" they said. ""I also spent time at Mar-a-Lago and spoke with the President. But mainly we wanted to help make the event more fun, and I think that sentiment was well received."" Industry reactions were mixed. Some praised the visibility, while others pointed out that more work is needed for the mass adoption of the GameFi industry. Jack O'Holleran, CEO of SKALE Labs, told CoinDesk that GameFi has never stopped expanding, but its issue has been visibility instead. The technology, on top of that, has matured. ""In the past, you needed to manage your own crypto wallets and pay high gas fees just to play,"" he said. ""Now, gas-free blockchains and seamless onboarding remove those barriers."" “Functional values and utility that blockchain brings to gaming cannot be suppressed for much longer,"" he added. Still, a broader adoption of the GameFi sector will require further meaningful collaboration with mainstream gaming outlets. This could potentially open the “floodgates,"" O’Holleran added, as player bases for the traditional gaming sector are far beyond the crypto sector’s user count. If so, the “floodgates will be open.” Meanwhile, Mitja Goroshevsky, co-founder of Gosh, praised the visibility of Gala Games and the GameFi sector via the White House tie-up but warned that the industry must still solve its identity crisis. ""It’s caught between being about gaming and being about trading,"" he said. ""Until blockchain games introduce fundamentally new experiences, government partnerships alone won't drive mass adoption.""",Web3|GameFi|Gala games|White House|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|GALA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-26 17:43:34

In a new filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the Georgia-based family healthcare firm Virtuvian Health says 88,848 clients are affected by a data breach involving Nationwide Recovery Service (NRS), a third-party collection agency used by the company to recover unpaid debts. Vitruvian Health says NRS discovered the cybersecurity incident in July of 2024 when an unauthorized entity illegally accessed the firm’s database, siphoning customer data including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, financial account details, and medical records. “The NRS investigation revealed that an unauthorized individual accessed NRS Systems from July 5, 2024 to July 11, 2024 and removed data from the system. Vitruvian Health was notified by NRS on February 24, 2025, that our patients’ information was amongst the data affected by this incident. Since that time, Vitruvian Health has been working with NRS to confirm specific records affected so as to provide notification to those involved.” Virtuvian Health, formerly known as Hamilton Health Care System, is a multi-specialty medical practice that offers primary, emergency and behavioral care services as well as various interventions for pain management. The firm says it immediately sent letters to impacted customers to notify them about the security incident while offering identity theft protection services that come with a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy. Vitruvian Health also highlights that its systems were “in no way affected by the security incident,” and that the data breach was limited to NRS’s network. For now, the firm is asking affected users to remain vigilant and immediately report any suspicious activities related to their personal, financial or medical records.

SNB Upholds its Cautions on Bitcoin (BTC) In a recent event, SNB President Martin Schlegel clarified that Bitcoin would not be added to the bank’s list of reserve assets. He pointed out that although sometimes liquid, Bitcoin can quickly lose that liquidity during financial crises. The president stressed that the bank’s reserves must always be reliable and ready for use, especially when buying and selling foreign currencies. Furthermore, the national bank president explained that Bitcoin’s well-known price swings made it unsuitable for the bank’s needs. Schlegel stated that stability is critical for any asset to be worthy of national reserve inclusion. However, Bitcoin’s extreme volatility could put the strength of the SNB’s reserve position at risk. He also highlighted the security concerns tied to cryptocurrencies, including risks from software bugs and data breaches. Despite growing public interest in Bitcoin (BTC), the SNB intends to keep its traditional, low-risk strategy for now. Unlike the Swiss National Bank, the United States recently established a national crypto reserve , placing Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, at the center of this innovation. Bitcoin Initiative Argues for National Reserve Reacting to the update, the Bitcoin Initiative, a group pushing for the SNB’s adoption of Bitcoin, argued that Bitcoin could have greatly boosted the bank’s returns. According to the initiative’s rough estimate, adding 1% Bitcoin to the Swiss national bank reserve could have nearly doubled gains since 2015, with only a slight increase in risk. The group emphasized that BTC remained available for transactions even during public holidays and market stress. They also mentioned that Bitcoin’s behavior should be judged alongside other assets in the portfolio, not on its own. Still, the group opined that adding Bitcoin to the national reserve could help overcome the uncertainty caused by Trump’s tariffs. Referendum Push for Bitcoin Inclusion It is worth stating that despite the growing movement, Schlegel remains unmoved. He remains keen on the fact that Bitcoin’s volatile nature is the main reason it can not be included in the reserve. Facing opposition from the SNB leadership, the Bitcoin Initiative has moved to launch a referendum campaign. The aim is to change the Swiss Constitution to require the SNB to hold reserves in both Bitcoin and gold. However, Schlegel remains firm, insisting that the SNB’s priority must be liquidity, security, and stability. In related news, Arizona is on the brink of establishing one of the first state-backed crypto reserve funds in the U.S. The post Swiss National Bank Shuns Bitcoin Amid Ongoing Debate appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-04-26 17:50:17

In a post shared on X, a pseudonymous analyst has outlined the many factors that validate a buildup to the highly anticipated altcoin season. Although the previous altcoin season was expected to kick off in December 2024 and run into January 2025, onlookers may need to prepare for this week and the one ahead. “We’re deep into 2025, still awaiting that long-anticipated altcoin season. Hopes were high after Donald Trump’s inauguration last December and the 2024 Bitcoin halving.” He wrote , after noting that the shakeout phase—a period when investors exit the market- has come to an end. While the broader crypto market is critical of President Donald Trump’s tariff hike and its negative impact on the crypto market, the analyst is taking an interesting stance. Using economic pressure to influence the Feds, the President is likely staging “one last shakeout,” which could, in turn, result in record-breaking market highs for digital currencies and the traditional finance market. Altcoins sustain bullish momentum, weekly gains are intact Historically, BTC dominance typically reaches a key 70% zone before peaking for every market cycle. However, with the macro bearish waves persisting, the analyst observed that Bitcoin still has room to run before passing the torch to altcoins—a move that could kick off any moment now. Capitals are later expected to rotate to altcoins, thereby fueling an altcoin bull rally. The weekend has kicked off with the crypto market successfully shedding off weekly losses. Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin sits above the $95,292 price levels—a critical position that places the asset on the path to $100,000. Meanwhile, leading altcoins XRP, ETH, and SOL, which have experienced a decent week, are closing with weekly gains of 6.87%, 13.67%, and 14.46%, respectively.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|ADA|Cardano|Ripple|SHIB|SHIBA INU|SOL|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|MARKET|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-26 17:55:37

Cardano is holding above critical support at $0.71 while Chainlink has broken through the $15 level after announcing new strategic developments. Both assets are reinforcing their positions as leaders within the Layer-1 and DeFi spaces respectively. However, as attention returns to major names, early stage investors are also looking toward new breakout opportunities. Web3 ai is quickly gaining traction with a structured 1747% ROI built into its presale and a platform that is delivering real world utility. As momentum builds, Web3 ai is increasingly being viewed as a strong contender among top crypto gem 2025 candidates. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Shows Strength Above $0.71 The Cardano (ADA) price analysis confirms a bullish trend continuation after ADA successfully defended the $0.67 support zone. Buyers have stepped in consistently at higher levels, and ADA is now holding steady above $0.71 as it consolidates gains. Technical analysts tracking Cardano (ADA) price analysis point to a potential breakout toward $0.76 if current support holds through the next few sessions. Daily moving averages remain bullish, with the 50-day and 100-day averages stacking positively. The Relative Strength Index is also maintaining a healthy neutral reading, giving ADA room for expansion without immediate overbought risk. While ADA remains a dominant player within smart contract ecosystems, the rate of growth is becoming more measured compared to smaller cap opportunities. For investors seeking exponential ROI potential, emerging platforms like Web3 ai are becoming more attractive among best crypto gem 2025 strategies. Chainlink (LINK) Price News Boosts Cross-Chain DeFi Optimism Chainlink (LINK) price news has become increasingly positive after a new partnership announcement with Monad. The collaboration aims to enhance cross-chain DeFi access, a critical component for the next phase of decentralized finance adoption. Following the announcement, Chainlink (LINK) broke through the $15 resistance level for the first time in weeks. Market analysts note that the LINK price is benefiting not only from the partnership news but also from broader DeFi recovery trends that are re-accelerating cross-chain liquidity initiatives. Chainlink (LINK) price news around Monad has reinforced LINK’s dominance in providing oracle solutions across multiple blockchain platforms. Technical setups suggest that if LINK can hold above the $15.20 zone, the next resistance area near $16.80 could be challenged within the next two weeks. Web3 ai Builds Toward 1747% ROI and Strengthens as a Crypto Gem for 2025 While Cardano and Chainlink reinforce their leadership, Web3 ai is rapidly building momentum within the presale markets. Priced at $0.0003 in its first stage and moving toward a listing price of $0.005242, Web3 ai delivers a structured 1747% ROI window for early participants. The Web3 ai platform is centered around twelve AI-driven tools designed to optimize crypto investment strategies. These include real-time trade analytics, portfolio risk management engines, automated DeFi optimization tools, and blockchain security monitors. All tools will be unified into an intuitive dashboard powered by the $WAI token. The $WAI token plays a central role in the platform economy. It is used to access premium services, participate in platform governance, and stake for ecosystem rewards. As usage grows, the demand for $WAI is expected to increase organically, creating steady upward pressure on token value. What sets Web3 ai apart from typical speculative presales is its clear product delivery roadmap and utility-driven ecosystem design. The project offers not just price speculation upside but actual user adoption metrics to support long-term value creation. This combination makes Web3 ai a rising force within the crypto gem 2025 category. ADA Holds, LINK Breaks Out, Web3 ai Leads Among Crypto Gem 2025 Picks The Cardano (ADA) price analysis shows clear bullish momentum with $0.76 targets now firmly in sight. The Chainlink (LINK) price news confirms renewed DeFi sector leadership with LINK moving above $15 following strategic cross-chain partnerships. Yet when it comes to structured ROI potential, ecosystem scalability, and early-stage adoption curves, Web3 ai is setting itself apart. With a 1747% ROI built into presale entry and a platform that solves actual crypto market pain points, Web3 ai offers a unique combination of growth, utility, and timing.

Bittensor (TAO) and XRP both present promising trajectories, TAO through its AI-aligned utility and incentive structure, and XRP via growing institutional interest and futures market backing. Yet while both show potential, Cold Wallet coin takes a different route: it’s not just predicting the future, it’s building it. With zero-knowledge infrastructure already in place, a Q3 2025 MVP rollout, and a team with a record of delivery, Cold Wallet is proving that functional progress matters. For those searching for the top crypto to buy 2025, it offers something rare in the space, real momentum. Can Bittensor (TAO) Defy the Cycle? 2025 Prediction Unveiled The Bittensor (TAO) prediction for 2025 presents a compelling look into how AI-driven networks could maintain relevance even if market enthusiasm wanes. According to current modeling, TAO’s price is estimated to land between $287 and $407 by year-end 2025, assuming the bull market has truly lost steam. Notably, this forecast underscores TAO’s ability to hold value thanks to its fundamental architecture, which rewards network contributors through a proof-of-intelligence mechanism. At the same time, while short-term volatility remains in play, Bittensor’s consistent incentive model and demand for machine learning tasks give it unique staying power. Furthermore, analysts suggest that if TAO maintains network activity and miner interest, price consolidation in the $300–$350 range could become a new baseline. Ultimately, the outlook suggests less dependence on market hype and more on real participation and utility, making TAO one of the few tokens possibly capable of sustaining growth even in cooler cycles. XRP Sets Sights on $3 Amid Growing Institutional Interest XRP has recently climbed to $2.11, showing a 1.54% daily increase, as buyers continue to support the token above the $2.00 level. Meanwhile, the anticipated launch of XRP futures trading by Coinbase Derivatives is expected to enhance institutional adoption and trading volume. In addition, technical indicators, such as the MACD and RSI, are signaling bullish momentum, suggesting a potential breakout targeting $3.00. Nevertheless, downside risks remain at $2.00, with possible extensions to $1.96 or $1.62 if volatility increases. On the positive side, the increase in open interest to $3.24 billion indicates growing trader confidence, while declining liquidations suggest reduced short-term volatility. Taken together, these factors contribute to a stable environment for traders, potentially paving the way for further price action in the same direction. Cold Wallet Isn’t Just an Idea In a space crowded with lofty roadmaps and vaporware, Cold Wallet stands apart as one of the few crypto projects with real traction, real timelines, and a real team behind it. Whereas countless projects stall at the concept phase, Cold Wallet is actively executing, with its zero-knowledge infrastructure already in place and a fully functional MVP scheduled for Q3 2025. From the outset, Cold Wallet has prioritized delivery over hype. Its architecture is already hardened, its brand refresh is complete, and the foundation is set for a multi-phase expansion. Importantly, with ZK-powered features like private balances and anonymous transactions integrated from the ground up, this is not theory, it’s working code. Moreover, $CWT, the ecosystem’s native token, isn’t just speculative. It powers governance, unlocks feature access, and aligns growth incentives across users and institutions. Currently, in presale stage 1, $CWT is priced at just $0.007 per token, a sharp contrast to its projected launch price of $0.3571. For investors hunting the top crypto to buy in 2025 , Cold Wallet offers more than upside, it offers proof of work. This isn’t a moonshot based on sentiment. It’s a calculated entry into a privacy-first infrastructure play with scheduled CEX listings, ecosystem rollouts, and a team that has built, scaled, and shipped before. Early adopters aren’t betting on potential, they’re positioning ahead of what’s already in motion. Cold Wallet: Built for What Comes Next Speculation may drive attention, but execution builds conviction. Bittensor continues to push boundaries in AI-integrated blockchain models, and XRP gains traction through institutional momentum and technical indicators. However, Cold Wallet separates itself by turning roadmap into reality. With its presale priced at just $0.007 and a launch target of $0.3571, the project offers a clear path from product to platform. Privacy, utility, and infrastructure are already in motion, not just planned. For those weighing the top crypto to buy 2025, Cold Wallet stands out not for what it promises, but for what it’s already putting in place.

He explained how the technicals and fundamentals support this bullish prediction and currently align for this BTC rally to the $106,000 target. Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Breakout To $106,000 In a TradingView post, Daniel stated that the Bitcoin price now appears poised to reach the next significant resistance zone around $106,000, which also aligns with a big resistance level. The analyst noted that the market is now following through with a solid bullish impulse, pushing past intermediate resistance and confirming the continuation of the ascending channel structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bullish Confirmation: What Needs To Happen For Next Leg Up To $130,000 He further remarked that the Bitcoin price could reach this $106,000 target with buyers stepping in aggressively and the price respecting the bullish market structure. The flagship crypto has already displayed strong bullish momentum, having broken above $90,000 earlier this week and rallying to $95,000 for the first time in two months. Daniel noted that this breakout occurred after a well-defined double bottom formed around the major support zone near $74,000. He added that the inability to create a new low and the sharp rejection from that zone confirmed strong buyer presence and marked a clear exhaustion of sellers. Fundamentals Also Support This BTC Rally Daniel also explained that the fundamentals support this Bitcoin price rally to $106,000. He remarked that BTC is gaining strength due to several key macroeconomic shifts. These macro shifts include Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have brought about market uncertainty and led investors to seek alternatives outside the stock and bond markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Recovery At Stake If This Level Doesn’t Hold, Crash Could Erase Gains The analyst highlighted the fact that the Bitcoin price has thrived during such periods of instability, with investors viewing it as a hedge against the dollar’s instability. He added that global central banks continue tightening monetary policy, increasing fears of a recession. With inflation and recession fears on the rise, investors look poised to diversify their assets into assets like BTC with limited supply. Daniel also affirmed that the deepening institutional interest is providing a strong foundation for the sustained Bitcoin price movement toward $106,000. He remarked that institutional adoption continues to climb, with spot market activity increasing and institutional funds seeing massive inflows. The analyst reiterated that the convergence of powerful technical patterns, particularly the confirmed breakout and continuation within the ascending channel, suggests a likely continuation of the upward momentum for the Bitcoin price. The strong macro and institutional adoption also supports a sustained bullish momentum for BTC. Daniel urged market participants to closely monitor confirmation signals, such as bullish volume surges, strong candle closures above the $90,000 breakout level, and continuation patterns forming on lower timeframes to validate the $106,000 target. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $94,660, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

SUI has delivered an impressive 60 percent price surge in just seven days, bolstered by a major rise in ecosystem metrics like total value locked and stablecoin growth. Meanwhile, Solana is showing strong bullish intent after flipping key structures and reacting precisely from important liquidity zones, setting up for potential continuation toward new highs. In a market where established players are gaining momentum, Unstaked is positioning itself as a new opportunity, offering sub-cent access at $0.0065 with mapped product rollouts for 2025. For investors scouting the next wave of opportunity in layer 1 blockchain projects, these developments offer valuable insight into upcoming strength. SUI Price Surge Supported by Rising DeFi Metrics Sui’s native token, $SUI, has gained 60 percent over the past week, fueled by a surge in network activity and rising investor interest. According to data from Lookonchain, one of the primary drivers behind the SUI price surge is a sharp increase in the network’s total value locked (TVL). Over just seven days, TVL jumped by 38 percent to reach $1.645 billion, highlighting growing confidence in the Sui DeFi ecosystem. Decentralized exchange (DEX) activity has also exploded on Sui, with 24-hour trading volume climbing to $599 million, a 177 percent spike compared to the previous week. This liquidity boost suggests that users are actively participating in trading and locking protocols on the network. Furthermore, the stablecoin market cap on Sui increased by 82 percent in the past two months, rising from $482 million to $879 million. These figures indicate that Sui is gaining serious traction as a layer 1 blockchain, expanding its footprint in the DeFi sector at an accelerated pace. Analysts note that consistent TVL growth combined with strong DEX volumes often foreshadow sustainable price action. With Sui’s ecosystem efforts underway, many are watching closely to see if the SUI price surge can sustain into the next quarter. Solana Price Prediction Points to Potential Dip Before Higher Move Solana is another layer 1 blockchain catching serious attention. The latest Solana (SOL) price prediction outlines a bullish yet cautious outlook. After successfully breaking a daily bearish structure and grabbing key liquidity above, SOL has confirmed a bullish shift. However, technical analysts believe there could be one more dip before Solana continues its upward movement. Solana previously reacted off a critical hourly demand zone, launching sharply upward and sweeping liquidity sitting above recent highs. Following this move, analysts highlight that a new liquidity pocket has formed just below the current price. Historically, such liquidity gaps are often filled before continuation. If Solana briefly dips to collect lower liquidity, this could set up a stronger base for a healthy rally higher. Traders are watching closely for a move back into fresh demand zones, which could ignite the next major push. Nonetheless, analysts stress that macro volatility remains a factor, and flexibility is key when interpreting any Solana (SOL) price prediction. For now, structure remains bullish, and the path toward higher prices remains open, provided the market environment stays supportive. Unstaked at $0.0065 Builds Momentum Among Layer 1 Blockchain Watchlists While Sui and Solana show strength among existing giants, Unstaked is building quietly but steadily into a strong early-stage play. Currently priced at just $0.0065, Unstaked is capturing attention as a layer 1 blockchain project offering mapped product delivery rather than pure speculation. With Q2 2025 rollout milestones underway, including dApp launches and AI agent deployments, Unstaked is offering investors an entry point before major catalysts materialize. Performance-based reward systems, social integrations with platforms like Discord and Instagram, and NFT-based customization tools are also part of the upcoming roadmap. Given the historical success of early entries into projects with functioning ecosystems, Unstaked is gaining attention among those looking for the next high-upside opportunity in the highest-growth sector. While the SUI price surge and Solana (SOL) price prediction command headlines today, Unstaked is quietly positioning itself for the next wave of growth as a future layer 1 blockchain project. Closing Note The past week shows that momentum is returning to top-tier and rising layer 1 blockchain projects. The SUI price surge to new highs reflects rising DeFi adoption, stronger liquidity, and surging stablecoin usage. Meanwhile, the Solana (SOL) price prediction hints at strategic liquidity grabs before potential continuation, offering tactical entries for those watching key zones. At the same time, Unstaked’s $0.0065 presale positioning offers a compelling asymmetric opportunity for early-stage capital seeking to tap into the next expansion wave. For those searching for smart positioning ahead of broader market runs, paying close attention to these projects could prove valuable. In a market where shifts happen fast, the ability to spot rising strength across the layer 1 blockchain sector remains one of the keys to outperforming in the cycles ahead.

Analysts at bond giant Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) say in an investment note that President Trump’s trade war has triggered uncertainty about the status of the dollar and US Treasuries as safe-haven assets, reports Reuters. The PIMCO market strategists say that investors are now questioning whether US assets will remain the anchor of the global financial system amid Trump’s abrupt policy shift that his administration claims will bring manufacturing jobs back to America. “The US has long enjoyed a privileged position, with the dollar serving as the global reserve currency and Treasuries as the go-to reserve asset. However, this status is not guaranteed. If global capital flows into US assets dwindle, it could point toward a more multipolar world with a diminished reliance on a singular reserve currency. “ With investors beginning to doubt the long-standing trend of US exceptionalism, PIMCO warns that the door is now open for investors to move their capital away from the US dollar and Treasuries into bonds issued by Europe, Japan, the UK and emerging economies. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order that imposed a 10% tariff on all imported goods entering the US, with the stated aim of safeguarding domestic manufacturing. The president also issued a proclamation that slapped reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries. The move has triggered a steep decline in the US dollar index (DXY), which measures the strength of the USD against a basket of other major foreign currencies weighted by volume. The DXY dropped as much as 6% this month, from an April open of 104.18 to as low as 97.92. The last time the DXY slid by about 6% was in May of 2009, when the US economy collapsed due to the 2008 financial crisis. The DXY has bounced since and is trading at 99.58 as of Friday’s close.

Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a significant upward trend over the last decade and is expected to continue rising due to heightened demand. These positive signals, alongside on-chain data, have fueled a new exodus from centralized exchanges. Public-Company Accumulations Behind Massive Outflows Crypto custodian Fidelity Digital Assets released a new report on centralized exchange Bitcoin reserves. The total supply on exchanges has dropped to a seven-year low, signaling potential long-term growth. Recent outflows to other custodians are at their lowest point since 2018. Traditionally, these outflows indicate bullish pressure on the market, as holders are less likely to sell in the short term. Currently, Bitcoin exchange reserves stand at 2.6 million assets after fresh outflows were recorded this week. While exits increased over the last seven years, movements from Q4 2024 are key to the current trader’s leaning due to U.S. macro trends. According to the report, over 425,000 BTC have been transferred since November 2024. The effects of President Trump’s win in the November polls affirmed upward projections due to his positive pledge to the sector. Several crypto executives and investors backed a return to the White House by Trump to usher in clear regulation, a shift from the Biden administration. It was argued that Trump’s return would reignite innovation in digital assets in the country. After the elections, publicly listed companies have amassed over 350,000 BTC, which has helped support a price rally. Meanwhile, public companies have been scooping up approximately 30,000 BTC each month this year. “ We have seen bitcoin supply on exchanges dropping due to public company purchases—something we anticipate accelerating in the near future,” Fidelity wrote. Simultaneously, altcoin reserves also declined due to the effects of the Bitcoin bull run. Institutional investors are calling for possible spot ETF approvals, drawing lines with BTC products. Bitcoin Bulls Press For Price Swing The last seven days have seen a significant surge in Bitcoin prices after recent exchange outflows. In a nutshell, whale sentiments spiked over the roof, taking the price above $90K. Furthermore, Strategy and other publicly listed companies increased accumulations , hinting at major leaps later this year. BTC price soared 10% this week while altcoins saw similar gains. In crypto spaces, bulls believe the asset could reclaim its all-time high on the heels of rising institutional demand.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. However, with the ongoing volatility amid the cryptocurrency market crash, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 49.27% from its ATH of $ 294.33.

The RSI is cooling off from near-overbought levels, suggesting a potential minor pullback before continuation. A bullish ascending channel pattern has been visible since mid-March. If SOL holds above $144 support, it may target $160 and $181 next. However, a break below $144 could trigger a deeper correction. Potential High: $181 Average Price Range: $150–$160 Potential Low: $144 Solana Price Prediction 2025 Solana’s weekly transaction fees have plunged to 92.35% from the January peak of $0.0327, hitting a six-month low of $0.0025. This marks the lowest level since September 2024. Consistency in this could open the doors for more projects being built on the Solana network. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

The price faces a decisive resistance range at $1.8K, expected to enter a short-term consolidation before breaking above it. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart After a period of muted price action and market inactivity around the decisive $1.5K long-term support region, Ethereum eventually experienced a surge in buying pressure, triggering a bullish rebound. This wave of demand has pushed the price toward the significant $1.8K resistance zone. This area coincides with an important order block, where smart money typically places orders, reinforcing its significance. The price action at this level is critical; a successful breakout above $1.8K would likely confirm a bullish reversal scenario, opening the path toward the $2.1K target. However, short-term consolidation around this resistance is probable before a decisive move unfolds. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, ETH’s previous tight-range consolidation was broken by a notable influx of buyers, resulting in an impulsive breakout above the descending channel. This breakout was accompanied by strong bullish momentum, driving the price toward the key $1.8K resistance zone. This region aligns with Ethereum’s prior swing lows, making it a robust supply area. As a result, short-term consolidation is expected at this level until demand or supply pressure determines the next move. A bullish breakout above $1.8K would set the $2.1K range as the next likely target for buyers. Sentiment Analysis By Shayan The funding rates metric is a crucial indicator of sentiment in the futures markets. Analysing its recent behaviour provides important insights into Ethereum’s latest surge. Typically, healthy and sustainable bullish trends are accompanied by rising funding rates, signalling an influx of buyers in both the perpetual futures and spot markets. Currently, however, funding rates are consolidating and showing no significant increase. This suggests that Ethereum’s recent price surge has primarily been driven by spot market buying rather than futures market speculation. For this bullish trend to be validated and gain persistence, the funding rates metric needs to start rising, reflecting growing confidence and aggressive buying in the futures market as well.

Buyers Claim Nike’s RTFKT Shutdown Caused NFT Losses A group of buyers, led by Australian resident Jagdee Cheema, filed a class action lawsuit in New York, claiming that when Nike suddenly shut down its RTFKT unit in December 2024, the value and demand for their NFTs collapsed, according to Reuters. The unit had created Nike-themed NFTs and crypto assets. The legal status of NFTs is still unclear, with ongoing debates about whether they are considered securities. The lawsuit, filed on Friday, seeks over $5 million in damages for violations of consumer protection laws in New York, California, Florida, and Oregon.

In letters dated April 22, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wrote to both SEC Chair Paul Atkins and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and argued that the current policy hampers regulators’ ability to effectively oversee the cryptocurrency industry. Current policy undermines effective regulation, Coinbase argues In the letters, Grewal points out that the prohibition comes at a particularly problematic time. President Trump has directed the SEC and other agencies to submit recommendations for regulatory proposals to advance American digital financial leadership within 180 days via executive order. I never understood why @SECGov employees are barred from holding or using digital assets. Any potential conflicts can easily be managed. So I wrote to ask that @OfficeGovEthics rescind and update Legal Advisory 22-04 and for the Crypto Task Force to issue waivers—now. pic.twitter.com/vdG9veuqPY — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) April 25, 2025 You might also like: Crypto VC funding: Bitdeer raises $179m, Upexi bags $100m The Coinbase CLO notes that nearly half of this timeframe has already passed, yet staff members still cannot use the technology they are tasked with regulating. Grewal argues that understanding technology requires using it and wrote that the current situation impedes the SEC Crypto Task Force’s ability to help pave the path for regulatory clarity. The company calls for the Office of Government Ethics to rescind and update Legal Advisory 22-04. This prohibits commission staff from buying, selling, or otherwise using crypto assets. The letter to SEC Chair Atkins suggests practical solutions. One option is to issue waivers to Crypto Task Force members and other staff actively working on cryptocurrency matters. According to Grewal, this approach would be consistent with measures already taken in “commensurate advisory situations.” It would also allow Commission staff directly responsible for implementing cryptocurrency regulations to properly understand and evaluate the underlying technology. Coinbase proposes a more nuanced approach to potential conflicts of interest. The exchange suggested that SEC staff could own cryptocurrencies under certain conditions. Grewal contends that the current blanket prohibition is particularly problematic given that most crypto asset activity does not involve securities. As an alternative, Coinbase suggests the Commission could clarify that certain cryptocurrency holdings would not have a direct and predictable effect on the value of those assets. Grewal notes that providing such relief would align with views expressed by the Office of the Inspector General. It stated that the commission’s ability to remain an effective regulator needs continuous monitoring of the market environment and appropriate adaptation of expertise, rules, regulations, and oversight tools.

Shiba Inu’s price shows signs of recovery Shiba Inu has seen a 10.22% increase over the past week. The current price ranges between $0.00001169 and $0.00001277. This recent rise suggests growing interest in the token after a period of decline. Over the past month, SHIB’s price fell by 3.62%, and over six months, it dropped by 21.11%. Despite these long-term decreases, the weekly gain indicates potential for a rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.29, approaching oversold territory, which might lead to increased buying pressure. The nearest resistance level is $0.00001320. If SHIB breaks through this point, it could see an increase of about 3% to 5% from its current price. The nearest support is at $0.00001104. If the price falls below this level, it might decrease by around 5% to 7%. Traders are watching these levels closely. The recent price movements suggest that SHIB could continue to rise if momentum holds. However, it needs to surpass the resistance to confirm an upward trend. Pepe coin nears support as RSI hints at potential rebound Pepe (PEPE) is currently trading between $0.0000070477 and $0.0000078807. The coin has been experiencing a downward trend, approaching its nearest support level. The nearest support sits at $0.0000065573. If the price reaches this level and holds, it could signal a potential rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.30, indicating that the coin is nearing oversold territory, which may attract buyers. On the upside, the nearest resistance is at $0.0000082233. A move above this level could signal a bullish trend. Breaking through resistance could see the price rise by approximately 10% from the current upper price of $0.0000078807. Given the current RSI and proximity to support, Pepe coin may be poised for a reversal. Traders will be watching the support and resistance levels closely to gauge the next move.
