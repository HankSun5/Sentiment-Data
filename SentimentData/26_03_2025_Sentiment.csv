This Altcoin Tops Toncoin, Chainlink, BNB, and Tron on Investor Watchlists",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/best-crypto-to-buy-before-april-this-altcoin-tops-toncoin-chainlink-bnb-and-tron-on-investor-watchlists,"While investors are keeping a close eye on tokens like Toncoin, Chainlink, BNB, and Tron, another altcoin leads the pack. While volatility struck these headline-grabbing assets in recent months, one token— Remittix —is quietly marching ahead without fanfare due to its stable, payment-oriented use case. While crypto markets are reeling from scandals and price swings, investors are increasingly looking towards projects that offer stability and real-world applications. And that's why Remittixis now the top pick as the best cryptocurrency to invest in before April. Toncoin (TON) Stumbles Amid Misinformation Saga, Investors Look to Remittix Toncoin recently surged by 8% after false reports spread claiming the TON Foundation had raised $400 million . The excitement was short-lived, as the foundation quickly clarified that the $400 million represented existing holdings by U.S.-based VCs, not fresh capital. Investors reacted negatively when the truth dawned, and most blamed insiders for manipulating sentiment. The scandal added to Toncoin's current troubles, particularly in the wake of legal troubles facing Telegram founder Pavel Durov. The issues marred the future of Toncoin. Source: Tradingview Chainlink's Volatility Limits Gains, Remittix Offers Stability Chainlink (LINK) recently saw an impressive 6.7% increase, breaking the $15 mark with high investor interest. Despite the trend, LINK is encountering resistance to break through $18.12. Even technical indicators indicate a correction overdue, as the RSI is nearing overbought levels. In addition, recent liquidations of $1.06 million indicate Chainlink's built-in volatility. While LINK remains attractive to speculative traders, its price volatility scares off long-term investors. Remittix, on the other hand, offers stability in its PayFi model, specifically addressing transaction inefficiencies globally. Investors who want consistent and substantial growth prefer the actual application of Remittix to speculative tokens like LINK. Source: Tradingview Binance (BNB) Insider Trading Controversy Hurts Confidence, Benefiting Remittix Binance (BNB) is currently navigating a major scandal involving alleged insider trading. An employee was recently suspended for front-running trades using privileged information from BNB Chain’s operations . Although Binance acted swiftly, the damage to its reputation raises serious questions about internal governance. Regulatory scrutiny will likely intensify, further complicating BNB’s short-term price outlook and dampening investor enthusiasm. By comparison, Remittix’s transparent operations and clear regulatory strategy position it as a trustworthy alternative. Source: Tradingview Tron (TRX) Struggles at Resistance Levels, Remittix Gains Momentum Tron (TRX) faces persistent challenges in surpassing the $0.25 resistance level. This repeated failure to break upward has sparked concerns over TRX’s future market standing. Mixed technical indicators further weaken investor sentiment. With on-balance volume data showing limited buying activity, traders are turning skeptical. If Tron can't regain bullish momentum, investors may begin looking elsewhere.

Odds of approval are rising fast, and some analysts think that could be the rocket fuel XRP’s been waiting for. Stellar (XLM) is also getting swept up in optimism, riding the wave thanks to its shared focus on cross-border transactions. But while the old-school payment coins battle it out for a comeback, a newer name is quietly stealing the show— Remittix (RTX) . It’s already pulled in over $14 million in presale, and with its built-in PayFi functionality for investors, businesses, and individuals, some are calling it the next-gen solution Ripple was supposed to be. If you’re betting on the future of payments, RTX is looking like a seriously promising move. Remittix (RTX) Levels Up The Global Payments Space Crypto has spent more than a decade promising to replace legacy finance—but for most users, actually spending digital assets is still a slow, expensive, and often frustrating experience. Exchange withdrawals can take days, conversion fees are excessive, and banks routinely block or delay crypto-related transactions. This is exactly the problem Remittix (RTX) is built to solve. The platform allows users to instantly convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT, sending funds directly to any bank account globally. Whether you're cashing out stablecoins, moving crypto earnings to a local bank, or making international transfers, Remittix removes the friction without compromising control. For example, a freelancer in Kenya can accept payment in USDT and receive Kenyan Shillings in their local bank account that same day. Or a business owner in Colombia can settle supplier invoices using Ethereum, without touching an exchange or dealing with FX fees. Remittix is also turning heads with its focus on privacy. As global banking becomes more invasive—tracking transactions, flagging crypto activity, and limiting financial autonomy—users are demanding tools that give them privacy without breaking the rules. Remittix provides that balance. Transactions initiated through the platform result in a traditional bank deposit on the other end, without exposing the crypto origin. That means freedom to move funds on your terms, while still interacting with the existing financial system. Ripple (XRP): ETF Hype Building, But Is It Priced In Already? XRP’s been grinding for months, but now things might finally be picking up. The odds of an XRP ETF getting the green light are climbing , and traders are already speculating on a big price breakout. If approved, it could pull in serious institutional interest—something XRP has been waiting on for years. But let’s be honest—some of that hype might already be baked into the price. XRP’s still sitting way below its ATH, and while ETF approval would be a massive headline, execution matters more than hype. Ripple’s working on real-world integrations with CBDC s and payment networks, but until those roll out at scale, XRP’s stuck playing catch-up. The ETF could be the boost it needs—but new players like Remittix are already doing what XRP aims to. Monero (XMR): Still the Privacy King, But Facing Headwinds Monero’s always been that quiet, shadowy player in the crypto space—the go-to for privacy-maxis. It still offers unmatched anonymity, but regulators aren’t too fond of that, and it’s starting to weigh on adoption. Many exchanges have either de-listed XMR or added more hurdles to buy it, which is limiting its upside. The tech behind Monero is solid—private transactions, stealth addresses, ring signatures—it’s all there. But it hasn’t evolved much in terms of broader utility. With more payment coins entering the space and projects like Remittix offering regulatory-friendly privacy options with lightning-fast settlement, Monero’s looking more like a niche tool than a mass-market solution. It’ll always have a cult following—but it may have already peaked. Remittix Presale Gains Momentum—Early Backers Move Fast With $14 million already raised, and tokens available at $0.0734, Remittix is attracting serious attention from early-stage investors who see beyond the hype. This is a project with clear utility, a growing user base, and real-world demand. Industry analysts are calling for an 800% increase in token price before the presale ends, with even more upside projected post-launch as adoption accelerates. For anyone seeking exposure to the next generation of blockchain utility—not speculation, but real financial infrastructure—Remittix is standing out as a breakout player in 2025’s crypto landscape. And right now, it’s still early enough to get in before the rest of the market catches on.

MARA Backing: Supported by MARA, a significant player in the Bitcoin mining industry, adding credibility and potential for widespread adoption. Why Hydro-Cooling? The Edge in Efficiency and Performance In the world of Bitcoin mining , heat is the enemy. Traditional air-cooled miners can generate immense heat, leading to performance throttling, increased energy consumption for cooling, and even hardware degradation over time. This is where hydro-cooled Bitcoin miners like the Terraflux AH3880 shine. Hydro-cooling, or liquid cooling, offers several key advantages: Superior Heat Dissipation: Liquid cooling is significantly more effective at removing heat compared to air cooling. This allows miners to operate at optimal temperatures, maintaining consistent performance. Enhanced Efficiency: By keeping temperatures down, hydro-cooling contributes to better energy efficiency. Cooler components operate more efficiently, reducing energy waste. Potential for Overclocking: The improved thermal management of hydro-cooling can potentially allow for overclocking, pushing the miner to perform beyond its standard specifications (though Auradine hasn’t explicitly mentioned this for the AH3880). Quieter Operation: Hydro-cooled systems can often operate more quietly than air-cooled systems, reducing noise pollution in mining facilities. Increased Lifespan: Lower operating temperatures can contribute to a longer lifespan for the mining hardware by reducing thermal stress on components. For large-scale Bitcoin mining operations , these benefits translate to significant cost savings in the long run, both in terms of energy consumption and hardware maintenance. The Terraflux AH3880’s adoption of hydro-cooling is a clear indicator of Auradine’s focus on efficiency and long-term sustainability in mining operations. Terraflux AH3880 vs. The Competition: Setting a New Benchmark Auradine claims that the Terraflux AH3880 outperforms leading models from industry giants like Antminer and Whatsminer. Let’s put this into perspective. While specific models from Antminer and Whatsminer weren’t named in the initial reports, we can compare the Terraflux AH3880 against some of their top-tier offerings based on publicly available data: Miner Model Hash Rate (TH/s) Efficiency (J/TH) Cooling System Auradine Terraflux AH3880 600 14.5 Hydro-Cooled Antminer S21 335 ~17.5 Air-Cooled Whatsminer M50S++ ~140 ~26 Air-Cooled Whatsminer M60 ~170 ~17 Air-Cooled *Note: Performance data for competitor models may vary and is based on publicly available specifications. As you can see from the table, the Terraflux AH3880 boasts a significantly higher hash rate and superior energy efficiency compared to some of the leading air-cooled models currently available. The energy-efficient Bitcoin miner market is fiercely competitive, and Auradine is clearly aiming to take the lead with this new offering. The hydro-cooling system is a key differentiator, enabling this performance edge. Addressing Critical Challenges: Energy Costs, Computing Demands, and U.S. Reliance Auradine highlights that the Terraflux AH3880 is designed to address several critical challenges facing the Bitcoin mining industry and the broader tech landscape: Rising Energy Costs: The exceptional energy efficiency of 14.5 J/TH directly tackles the issue of escalating energy costs, which are a major operational expense for miners. By consuming less energy per unit of hash rate, the Terraflux AH3880 can significantly reduce energy bills and improve profitability, especially in regions with high electricity prices. Growing Computing Demands: The Bitcoin network’s hashrate continues to climb, increasing mining difficulty and demanding more powerful hardware. The Terraflux AH3880’s high hash rate of 600 TH/s ensures that miners can remain competitive in this increasingly demanding environment. It provides the computational muscle needed to secure block rewards and maintain profitability. U.S. Reliance on Overseas Hardware: The fact that the Terraflux AH3880 is U.S.-engineered is a strategic move to reduce reliance on overseas hardware manufacturers. This is particularly relevant in the current geopolitical climate, where supply chain security and domestic technological capabilities are increasingly prioritized. Auradine is positioning itself as a champion of American innovation in the Bitcoin mining hardware sector. The MARA Connection: A Strong Endorsement The backing of MARA (Marathon Digital Holdings), a prominent publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, lends significant weight to Auradine’s claims and the potential of the Terraflux AH3880. MARA’s involvement suggests that they have vetted and validated the performance and efficiency of the miner, and see it as a valuable asset for their operations. This endorsement could pave the way for wider adoption of the Terraflux AH3880 across the industry, as other mining companies may follow MARA’s lead. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin Mining? The launch of the Auradine Terraflux AH3880 signals a significant step forward in Bitcoin mining technology . It underscores several key trends shaping the industry: Focus on Efficiency: Energy efficiency is no longer a secondary consideration; it’s a primary driver of innovation. Miners are increasingly seeking solutions that minimize energy consumption and maximize output. Advancements in Cooling: Hydro-cooling is likely to become more prevalent as miners seek to push performance boundaries and manage the thermal challenges of high-density mining operations. Geopolitical Considerations: The emphasis on U.S. engineering highlights the growing importance of domestic manufacturing and supply chain resilience in the technology sector, including cryptocurrency mining. Increased Competition: The entry of Auradine and the launch of the Terraflux AH3880 injects fresh competition into the Bitcoin miner market, which is ultimately beneficial for the industry as it drives innovation and potentially lowers costs for miners. Conclusion: A Powerful New Player Emerges The Auradine Terraflux AH3880 is more than just a new Bitcoin miner ; it’s a symbol of innovation, efficiency, and a shift towards greater domestic involvement in the cryptocurrency hardware sector. With its impressive hash rate, superior energy efficiency, and advanced hydro-cooling system, backed by the endorsement of MARA, the Terraflux AH3880 is poised to make a significant impact on the Bitcoin mining landscape.

Recent analyses from experts suggest that Ethereum price behavior is showing both bullish short-term structure and macro-level cyclical patterns, which could support an upward continuation if key levels hold. Ethereum Price Could Surge Past $2100 on Liquidity Grab Analyst Crypto Patel shared insight on the X platform, identifying a bullish price setup on the ETH/USDT chart. According to Patel, the top altcoin has shown a strong displacement move to the upside, which has led to a shift in market structure. This move followed a reaction from a previously identified bullish Point of Interest (POI). Ethereum price is reacting positively from a key mitigation block near $2064.60, indicating strong institutional demand. The mitigation block represents a zone where the top altcoin price retraced after a breakout, often used by institutional traders to mitigate prior orders before continuing the trend. This setup places the entry for a long position within the upper mitigation zone, aligning with smart money principles. Source: X The price target of $2128.12 aligns with a swing high liquidity zone, suggesting a likely smart money-driven move upward. These zones often hold clustered stop-loss orders and pending buy positions. A move into this area could allow investors to capture liquidity before a reversal. Patel sets a stop-loss at $2027.20, just below the mitigation block, providing a defined risk level if the altcoin price structure fails. Current ETH Cycle Compared to 2018–2020 Pattern Another analyst, TimeFreedomROB, posted a chart on X comparing Ethereum price weekly structure to its 2018–2020 cycle. The analysis shows ETH breaking below an ascending triangle, mirroring its past breakdown below a descending triangle before its major 2020 recovery. In that prior cycle, ETH price formed a macro bottom and rallied from under $100 to nearly $4800. According to the chart, Ethereum price is currently trading near $2060. It recently broke below the $2300 psychological level and tested the lower diagonal trendline around $1800. This area corresponds with horizontal demand levels from previous years. The chart implies this could represent a final shakeout phase before a strong upward move, similar to historical cycles. Source: X The support zone between $1800 and $2000 has acted as a long-term base in earlier market periods. A reclaim of the $2200–$2400 range is important for Ethereum price to confirm a shift back into bullish momentum on the weekly timeframe. Altcoin Price Prediction Additionally, the macro view provided by TimeFreedomROB outlines possible reversal targets if the price continues to follow historical patterns. In 2020, ETH saw a 40x increase following structure reclaim. While current conditions differ, the projected path includes potential resistance levels at $3600, $4870, and an extended range of $6000–$7500. Supporting the bullish projections, analyst MAXPAIN noted that ETH price could retrace to the $1,900 zone before a potential rally to $3,000. His analysis, based on the TPO chart, identifies the $1,874–$1,924 range as a key support and accumulation area. The top altcoin is currently trading at $2,064.98, showing an 8.10% gain over the past 7 days. Its market cap stands at $249.12 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $11.71 billion.

Year to date, Pump.fun has deposited over 1.57M SOL, valued at over $293M. Overall, Pump.fun has already produced 3,232,101 SOL in total fees, valued at close to $500M. Of those, the platform probably cashed out over $250M, with the bulk during the 2024 bull market. Following the latest sale, SOL traded at $145.56. The asset got a boost from a series of ETF applications, pointing to future demand. Pump.fun is back in the top 10 of apps, with $1.53M in fees for the last day. On more successful days, the platform reaches over $3M in fees, though still far from peak results of over $7M daily. Currently, Pump.fun once again produces more fees compared to Solana, and has far surpassed even the entire Ethereum chain. Meanwhile, Pump.fun sees a lower number of new tokens, falling to around 20K to 25K daily. On weaker days, under 2,000 new tokens are minted. Token shifts to Raydium go to zero The effect of PumpSwap is already visible, as almost no tokens are moving to Raydium. The integrated DEX now lists all tokens that have finished the bonding curve. Graduated tokens were already rare, with around 200 new tickers daily moving to Raydium. PumpSwap is just building up its list of tokens, initially starting with 26 coins. The DEX has added some of the more liquid Solana assets like Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and Jupiter (JUP). Pump.fun itself is also showing slower graduations, as the community only trades new launches, but rarely raises enough liquidity for graduation to a DEX. The DEX also added USDT and USDC liquidity, as well as older blue chip memes. However, PumpSwap achieved $1.23B in trading volumes for the first week, producing an estimated $1M in fees as part of the Pump.fun ecosystem. PumpSwap is competing with other DEX, taking between 7% and 15% of Solana DEX activity. | Source: Dune Analytics Pump.fun makes up around 7% of all Solana DEX volumes. March 24 was the first peak day, with over $890M in total daily activity. Pump.fun has also surpassed Meteora in daily token trades, peaking at over 14% of all Solana DEX on Monday. The new exchange is yet to prove its ability to replace the ‘trenches’ with new token mints and unexpected success stories. The growing DEX activity may add to more fee liquidation, as the Pump.fun ecosystem has not yet introduced its profit-sharing mechanism. Most of the SOL fees generated are either partially used for staking or sold on the open market. In the coming months, PumpSwap will start sharing its revenues with token creators. In the very first days of its operation, the new DEX almost reached Pump.fun’s in terms of fees. If trading volumes keep their levels, PumpSwap may replace the lost revenues from the slower meme token casino. The DEX has achieved up to $2.8M in daily revenues on the more successful days, both from trade fees of 0.25%, and from liquidity provider services. Most of the fees will flow back to the main token developer, once again with no plans for rewarding communities. The new model rebuilds the Moonshot launchpad and DEX combination, which, however, could not differentiate between legitimate projects and rug pulls. Most Pump.fun wallets break even or lose $500 The highly competitive PvP trading of meme tokens means the majority of players end up with losses. Since traders only make small bets on new memes, the most common loss is up to $500. Around 1M wallets break even, and 1.3M wallets lose up to $500. Only 33 whale wallets have achieved earnings of over $1M, and just four whales have lost over $1M on the platform. The Pump.fun trading format shows a shift of retail bets into whale wallets, where the top 500 traders make most of the earnings. Only two tokens, FARTCOIN and WOULD, have broken above $500M valuations. Solana memes remain active, with a total valuation for top tokens at $8.4B . The meme space has recovered, though remaining far from its peak valuations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

What Will Happen If He Fires?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-us-president-donald-trump-fire-fed-chairman-jerome-powell-what-will-happen-if-he-fires/,"US President Donald Trump has increased pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates, arguing that falling food and energy prices justify such a move. However, sources suggest that if the central bank does not meet his demands, Trump may take an even harsher step and dismiss Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump has long expressed frustration with the Fed, but tensions have escalated following its decision last week to keep interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%. The president has appeared on Truth Social and in public to press for lower interest rates, saying lower borrowing costs would stimulate economic growth and prevent any slowdowns from trade policies. Despite Trump’s calls, Powell signaled caution by emphasizing the potential inflationary impact of Trump’s upcoming tariff measures. The Fed’s new economic forecasts suggest there will be no further decline in inflation this year, largely due to the expected effects of additional tariffs. “I think further progress may be delayed once tariff-induced inflation arrives,” Powell warned last week. Trump will impose new reciprocal tariffs on April 2, which he calls “Liberation Day.” The move is aimed at countering foreign tariffs on American goods, but economists warn that such policies could further complicate the Fed’s ability to maintain economic stability. Amid the rising tensions, speculation has mounted over whether Trump could attempt to fire Powell, a move that would likely roil financial markets. Powell, whose term expires in 2026, has previously said he would not resign early even if the president asked him to. Related News: ‘Whales Entered Bitcoin Short at $88,000,’ Analysis Company Says, Explains Its Meaning Ian Katz, a director at research firm Capital Alpha Partners in Washington, said he did not expect Trump to fire Powell given the potential market turmoil. “Given how aggressively Trump has asserted his authority, you can’t rule anything out,” Katz warned. “A decision that clearly gives the president more authority over monetary policy would be extremely unsettling to the market.” Trump’s willingness to remove independent agency officials has already been demonstrated with the removal of two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Legal experts point to a 1935 Supreme Court decision, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, that protects independent agency members from being removed without cause. If Trump were to defy that precedent, it could lead to a Supreme Court showdown that would resonate across financial markets. *This is not investment advice.

42343763,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143206,1742944845,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlock Effortless Kubernetes Management: Plural’s AI Platform Revolutionizes Enterprise Operations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unlock-kubernetes-management-plural-platform/,"In the fast-evolving world of enterprise infrastructure, managing Kubernetes clusters has become a critical yet complex task. As businesses scale and adopt cloud-native architectures, the challenge of handling sprawling Kubernetes deployments intensifies. Plural emerges as a powerful solution, offering a centralized platform designed to simplify Kubernetes operations and revolutionize how enterprises manage their clusters. Imagine a world where Kubernetes management is no longer a headache but a streamlined, efficient process. Plural is making that vision a reality. The Kubernetes Sprawl Challenge: Why Centralized Management Matters For many enterprises, the Kubernetes journey began with a single cluster. However, as needs grew, so did the number of clusters, leading to a phenomenon known as Kubernetes sprawl. Sam Weaver, co-founder of Plural, experienced this firsthand at Unqork. Faced with the daunting task of managing a growing network of Kubernetes clusters, Unqork embarked on a costly, two-year project to build an in-house solution. The result? A platform that was merely ‘okay’. This experience highlighted a crucial gap in the market: the need for a comprehensive, user-friendly Kubernetes management platform . The traditional approach of managing Kubernetes clusters individually using disparate open-source tools is no longer sustainable for large organizations. This decentralized approach leads to: Increased Operational Overhead: Managing each cluster separately demands significant time and resources from DevOps teams. Inconsistency and Errors: Lack of standardization across clusters can lead to configuration drift and increased risk of errors. Slower Deployments and Updates: Rolling out updates and new applications across multiple clusters becomes a time-consuming and complex process. Visibility Gaps: Gaining a holistic view of cluster health, performance, and resource utilization across the entire infrastructure becomes challenging. Plural: Your Centralized Command Center for Kubernetes Plural addresses these challenges head-on by providing a centralized Kubernetes management platform. Born from the frustrations of Kubernetes sprawl, Plural consolidates all your enterprise Kubernetes clusters into a single, intuitive dashboard. This unified view empowers teams to streamline operations, efficiently manage clusters, and deploy updates from one central location. Imagine the time and resources saved by having all your Kubernetes infrastructure at your fingertips. The genesis of Plural is a compelling story of identifying a problem and crafting an elegant solution. After his experience at Unqork, Weaver partnered with Michael Guarino, a seasoned engineer from tech giants like Amazon and Twitter. Guarino’s swift development of a superior system in just weeks laid the foundation for Plural. This rapid innovation underscores the platform’s core value proposition: efficiency and speed in Kubernetes management. AI-Powered Kubernetes: Smart Optimization and Proactive Problem Solving Plural goes beyond basic cluster management by integrating AI-powered Kubernetes capabilities. The platform’s AI engine offers intelligent suggestions for: Cluster Optimization: AI algorithms analyze cluster performance and identify areas for optimization, improving resource utilization and reducing costs. Scaling Issue Diagnosis: Plural’s AI proactively detects and diagnoses scaling bottlenecks, enabling teams to address issues before they impact application performance. Proactive Insights: The platform provides actionable insights based on AI-driven analysis, helping teams anticipate potential problems and optimize their Kubernetes deployments proactively. This AI-driven approach transforms Kubernetes management from a reactive task to a proactive and strategic function. By leveraging AI, Plural empowers enterprises to not just manage their clusters but to optimize them for peak performance and efficiency. Benefits of Plural: Streamlining Enterprise Kubernetes Clusters The benefits of adopting Plural’s platform are substantial, particularly for organizations grappling with complex enterprise Kubernetes clusters . Plural promises to: Reduce Operational Overhead by 90%: By centralizing management and automating key tasks, Plural dramatically reduces the time and effort required to manage Kubernetes infrastructure. Accelerate Update Cycles: Deploy updates in hours instead of weeks, ensuring faster time-to-market for new features and applications. Boost Developer Productivity: Free developers from the complexities of Kubernetes management, allowing them to focus on building and innovating. Enhance Control and Security: Plural’s self-hosted, GitOps-based architecture provides enterprises with full control over their data and deployments, enhancing security and compliance. Weaver emphasizes that Plural is designed to be cloud and LLM agnostic, offering flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in. This commitment to openness and control is a key differentiator in the Kubernetes management landscape. Why Now? The Perfect Timing for Plural’s Solution The rise of AI and the increasing adoption of cloud-native architectures have converged to create the perfect storm for Kubernetes sprawl. Enterprises are no longer managing just one or two clusters; they are dealing with dozens, even hundreds. This exponential growth necessitates a more sophisticated and simplified Kubernetes operations approach. Plural’s emergence at this juncture is not accidental. The company recognized the growing pain points associated with Kubernetes management and developed a solution precisely tailored to address these challenges. The recent $6 million seed funding round, led by Primary Venture Partners with participation from Capital One Ventures and Company Ventures, underscores investor confidence in Plural’s vision and potential. Plural vs. Competitors: Architecture as a Differentiator While Plural is not alone in the Kubernetes management space, Weaver highlights key architectural differentiators that set Plural apart from competitors like Loft Labs and Rancher Labs. These include: GitOps Model: Plural operates on a GitOps model, ensuring infrastructure-as-code principles for consistent and auditable deployments. Self-Hosted Architecture: Unlike SaaS solutions, Plural is self-hosted by each customer, providing maximum control and data privacy. AI Agents per Cluster: Each Kubernetes cluster has its own dedicated AI agent, enabling localized optimization and intelligent management. These architectural choices reflect Plural’s commitment to enterprise-grade security, control, and customization. The ‘no data sent home’ approach resonates strongly with organizations in regulated industries like financial services, where data privacy and compliance are paramount. Conclusion: Empowering Enterprises in the Kubernetes Era Plural is poised to become a game-changer in the Kubernetes management landscape. By offering a centralized, AI-powered platform, Plural empowers enterprises to unlock effortless Kubernetes management , streamline operations, and accelerate innovation. As Kubernetes continues to be the orchestration engine of choice for modern applications, solutions like Plural will be instrumental in enabling organizations to harness the full potential of this powerful technology without being bogged down by complexity.

Per a Coincheck press release , the new service is named Coincheck Prime and is “specifically targeted” at “corporate and institutional” crypto investors. Coincheck: Responding to Growing Demand from Corporate Sector? The firm said its new service will cater to “corporate clients” with deposit balances worth “10 million yen ($66,763) or more.” Trading volumes on the Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) It will also cater to big-spending firms and investors who are prepared to spend similar amounts on one-off or continuous crypto purchases. Coincheck said its service will also provide trading and management support from “specialized” experts. Until very recently, the majority of Japanese corporate players dealing with crypto were web3 and blockchain players. But since late last year, there has been a rise in the number of corporations looking to raise funds through crypto investment. Some companies have also gone on the record as stating that they think crypto can help them protect their liquid assets against fiat inflation. A recent and dramatic spike in Japanese bond yields is a stark reminder that the decades-long experiment in ultralow rates is well and truly coming to an end. https://t.co/c4M4qos1up — The Japan Times (@japantimes) March 25, 2025 Coincheck also suggested it could use its Prime services to help institutional investors who might require custody services should the government approve crypto spot ETFs at a future date.

(Source: Google Finance) OTC Options The new platform will also allow users to make large over-the-counter (OTC) trades “at preferential rates.” It also promises to provide users with “robust security” for cryptoassets in the exchange’s custody. The company suggested its NASDAQ listing could help it build trust in its new services. It also pointed out that its owner, the securities giant Monex Group, is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s Prime Market. Coincheck claimed: “We adhere to global standards for internal controls, risk management, and security levels as required by [stock market-]listed financial group companies. We also provide services with a high level of transparency.” Oki Matsumoto, the Executive Director of the Coincheck operator and securities firm Monex Group. (Source: Monex on Demand/YouTube/Screenshot) Coincheck claims that its total customer assets were worth 1.29 trillion yen (over $8.6 billion) as of the end of January 2025. It also said that it was “the number one exchange in Japan in terms of Bitcoin (BTC) spot trading volume in the second half of 2024.” Japanese Companies Flocking to BTC, Altcoin Markets Corporate crypto investment is increasing rapidly in Japan, with companies now scrambling to use their balance sheets to buy Bitcoin and altcoins. Earlier this month, the Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed real estate and digital transformation firm Value Creation announced it had recently spent $667,000 on Bitcoin . Other notable Japanese firms buying BTC or unveiling plans to do so in recent months include the bullish investment player Metaplanet , as well as the SBC Medical Group and the auto trading firm Remixpoint . Japan named Kazuto Uchida as the head of the Government Pension Investment Fund https://t.co/s5Q46WTWBi — Bloomberg (@business) March 25, 2025 Remixpoint spent around $3.2 million on BTC in January this year, and has earmarked another $16 million for Bitcoin and altcoin buys. The company has also bought smaller amounts of Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , XRP , Avalanche (AVAX), and Dogecoin (DOGE) . Metaplanet, meanwhile, has publicly claimed it wants to cement its position as “Asia’s leading Bitcoin treasury company.” It has also spoken of a wider “goal” to “expand” the size of its Bitcoin holdings to BTC 10,000 by the end of this year.

According to data from Onchain Lens, a total of 54,113 SOL worth approximately $7.81 million were moved to the trading platform. The PumpFun Large Solana Transfer Continues It is worth mentioning that this transaction is part of a pattern in which the launchpad has offloaded 1,573,313 SOL this year alone. On January 2, CoinGape reported that the launchpad moved 120,000 SOL worth approximately $22.88 million to Kraken. 2 hours ago, PumpFun ( @pumpdotfun ) deposited 54,113 $SOL valued at $7.81M, into #Kraken . In 2025, they sent a total of 1,573,313 $SOL worth $293.26M. Overall, they have earned 3,232,101 $SOL currently valued at $469.1M. pic.twitter.com/YMhtxRKF4Z — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) March 25, 2025 In addition, last month, it transferred another 148,759 SOL valued at $28.22 million, adding to the ongoing trend. According to the Onchain Lens data, over 1.5 million SOL moved this year, valued at $293.26 million. These frequent transactions often place Solana under intense selling pressure. Despite the initial projections of whether PumpFun was selling its Solana stash, some still argue the platform might have another reason for moving the coins. This latest transfer comes with potential debate on whether it could derail the mild consolidation Solana price has picked from earlier in the week. PumpFun and the PumpSwap Move In a bid to repair its ecosystem reputation, PumpFun has launched PumpSwap . This new platform is a decentralized exchange DEX designed to give traders and investors using the launchpad a more direct and efficient way to trade meme coins. Per the update, the platform intends to use the newly launched product to reduce dependence on centralized exchanges like Kraken. With it, it hopes to improve liquidity within the Solana ecosystem. While PumpSwap presents itself as a positive step, it remains unclear whether it can fully restore confidence in PumpFun’s activities, especially as large SOL transfers persist. Some investors see it as an attempt to shift focus away from ongoing selloff and other ethical concerns. Solana Price Outlook Amid Growing Consolidation Despite PumpFun’s frequent transactions, Solana’s price has remained relatively stable. After the February 13 transfer of 148,759 SOL, CoinGape reported that SOL price dropped by 1.2% before recovering. Furthermore, many analysts have mixed opinions on whether the market will continue consolidating or if Solana will record a breakout soon. Some stakeholders, like VanEck, see the coin soaring to $520 in the long term should market conditions be favorable. However, repeated large-scale transfers like those from PumpFun could serve as a headwind for the coin. As of this publication, CoinMarketCap data shows that SOL price was trading at $143.99, up 1.60% in the last 24 hours.

However, crypto analyst Ali Martinez warns that strong resistance may lie ahead. Bitcoin Finally Breaks Daily RSI Downtrend In a recent X post, crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC has broken through a multi-month RSI downtrend. The analyst shared a Bitcoin daily chart, showing how the leading cryptocurrency’s RSI has broken free from a prolonged downtrend that began at the start of the year. For the uninitiated, the RSI is a momentum indicator that suggests when the underlying asset – in this case, BTC – may be overbought or oversold. A rising RSI after sustained downtrend can indicate growing bullish momentum and a possible trend reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Hit $112,000, But Only If It Holds Above This Key Level – Analyst Explains Fellow crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader echoed Rekt Capital’s analysis, stating that the RSI breakout confirms bullish momentum and could pave the way for a significant price rally. Another key indicator turned bullish this week – the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons. In an X post, crypto analyst Robert Mercer noted: One of the most accurate mid-term indicator is bullish now. Expecting BTC to go back above $100,000 in Q2 of 2025! To explain, the Hash Ribbons indicator turning bullish signals that Bitcoin miners – after a period of capitulation – are returning to the network, suggesting mining recovery and reduced selling pressure. This often marks a strong buy signal, and has historically aligned with the end of bear markets and the start of new uptrends. Analyst Warns Of Stiff Resistance Ahead Despite BTC’s more than 15% surge from its March 10 low, seasoned analyst Ali Martinez cautions that the top digital asset is likely to encounter strong resistance around the $89,000 level. Martinez explained: Bitcoin $BTC faces a key resistance cluster at $89,000, where the 50-day moving average and the descending trendline from the all-time high converge. That said, several positive macroeconomic factors could support BTC’s bullish momentum. In a recent analysis, crypto analyst The M2 Guy emphasized that the expanding M2 money supply is likely to benefit risk-on assets like BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Probably’ Hit Its Bottom At $77,000, Arthur Hayes Says However, other cryptocurrency analysts – such as Maartunn – argued that BTC must decisively clear the $87,000 price level to have a shot at sustained upward price movement.

42344232,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143208,1742945455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionizing Finance: CME Group and Google Cloud Pioneer Asset Tokenization,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cme-group-asset-tokenization-google/,"Get ready for a seismic shift in the financial world! Imagine a future where assets, from stocks to real estate, are traded with unprecedented ease and efficiency, all thanks to the power of blockchain. This future is rapidly approaching, and leading the charge are industry giants like CME Group and Google Cloud. Let’s dive into their exciting collaboration and explore how they are set to revolutionize finance through asset tokenization . What is Asset Tokenization and Why is CME Group Exploring It? Asset tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets – anything from company shares and commodities to art and real estate – as digital tokens on a blockchain. Think of it as creating a digital twin of a physical or intangible asset. These tokens can then be easily traded, managed, and fractionalized, opening up a world of new possibilities. Why is CME Group, a global leader in derivatives trading, so interested in this space? The answer lies in the transformative potential of asset tokenization . Here’s why it’s a game-changer: Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenization can unlock liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets. For example, real estate, which can be slow and cumbersome to trade, can become far more liquid when fractionalized into tokens. Increased Accessibility: Asset tokenization democratizes investment opportunities. It allows smaller investors to participate in markets that were previously only accessible to large institutions. Imagine owning a fraction of a blue-chip artwork or a prime piece of real estate with just a few clicks. Operational Efficiency: Blockchain technology streamlines many processes associated with traditional asset management, such as settlement, custody, and compliance. This can lead to significant cost reductions and faster transaction times. Transparency and Security: Blockchain’s inherent transparency and security features provide a robust and auditable record of asset ownership and transactions, reducing fraud and increasing trust. For CME Group, embracing asset tokenization is a strategic move to stay ahead of the curve and cater to the evolving needs of the financial market. By exploring this technology, they are positioning themselves to offer innovative services and maintain their leadership in the global trading landscape. Google Cloud’s Universal Ledger: The Key to CME’s Tokenization Ambitions? The partnership between CME Group and Google Cloud is particularly intriguing because it leverages Google’s cutting-edge technology, specifically their new Universal Ledger. But what exactly is Universal Ledger, and why is it crucial for asset tokenization ? Google Cloud’s Universal Ledger is a blockchain-based infrastructure designed to provide a secure, scalable, and auditable platform for businesses to build and deploy decentralized applications. It stands out due to several key features: Scalability: Built on Google Cloud’s robust infrastructure, Universal Ledger is designed to handle high transaction volumes, crucial for the demands of mainstream financial markets. Interoperability: While details are still emerging, the “Universal” aspect suggests a focus on interoperability, meaning it could potentially connect with different blockchain networks, fostering a more unified and efficient ecosystem for asset tokenization . Security and Compliance: Google Cloud’s reputation for security and compliance is a major advantage. Universal Ledger is expected to offer enterprise-grade security features and tools to meet regulatory requirements, vital for the adoption of asset tokenization in regulated industries. Integration with Google Cloud Services: Leveraging the broader Google Cloud ecosystem provides access to powerful tools for data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, which can further enhance the capabilities of asset tokenization platforms. By choosing Google Cloud’s Universal Ledger, CME Group is opting for a technology partner that can provide the infrastructure, scalability, and security needed to realize the full potential of asset tokenization in the financial markets. Benefits of CME Group’s Asset Tokenization Initiative The collaboration between CME Group and Google Cloud to test asset tokenization is not just about technological innovation; it’s about unlocking tangible benefits for market participants. Let’s explore some of the key advantages: Benefit Description Reduced Transaction Costs Blockchain-based systems can automate many manual processes, reducing intermediaries and lowering transaction fees associated with traditional asset trading. Faster Settlement Times Traditional asset settlement can take days. Asset tokenization on a blockchain can enable near-instantaneous settlement, improving efficiency and reducing counterparty risk. Fractional Ownership Opportunities High-value assets can be fractionalized into smaller tokens, making them accessible to a wider range of investors and democratizing investment. 24/7 Trading Blockchain-based markets can operate 24/7, unlike traditional exchanges with limited trading hours, providing greater flexibility for global investors.

Rowe Price—the firm that handles over $1 trillion in assets—said that now is a good time to have exposure to bitcoin. He likened the price of bitcoin to a commodity and how investors should think about investing in it. “Bitcoin itself has traded very close to its average cost of mine. So if you think about it like a traditional commodity, that's actually historically a really good time to have exposure to it when it's close to its cost of mine,” he said. In traditional commodity investing, when the cost of mining or extracting a commodity is close to the spot price, it often signals that the commodity's price might have found the floor or has a limited downside. This is something contrarian investors look for when investing in commodities, as the bearish sentiment could be priced in when such an event occurs. Rizzo seems to be alluding to such a dynamic in play for bitcoin as well if one compares commodity cycles to bitcoin price. According to MacroMicro blog, the current average price of mining bitcoin is around $84,770, while the spot price is hovering near $87,000. How to play blockchain and AI revolution Rizzo also said that he sees blockchain and digital payments as an integral part of fintech and artificial intelligence (AI). “The world is getting more global, we're moving from cash to digital payments … so, I think digital payments is really at the nexus of moving money cheaply and taking a software-driven approach to areas that have historically been not software-driven,” according to Rizzo. He said part of this movement is blockchain, which he believes every investor should have some exposure to, whether through holding stocks of companies like Coinbase (COIN) or Robinhood (HOOD) or those of crypto miners profiting from the evolution of AI.",Finance|Bitcoin|commodity,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-25 23:30:57

Given the telecom’s underlying business fundamental s, strategic growth drivers, and defensive characteristics in a challenging overall economic backdrop, Goldman Sachs rates the stock as Buys and expects high upside ability in the next few years. Meanwhile, a nalyst James Schneider has a near-term price target of $29, nearly 8% higher than Monday’s close of $26.96. AT&T’s strong profits and generous dividend make it appealing to investors AT&T’s stock has done well lately: it’s up 21% YTD and better than 60% YTD (dividends excluded). When combined with the telecommunications company’s dividend yield of 4.1%, that’s a recipe for a strong income investment. Another big plus for AT&T is that it is less volatile than the market, at a beta of only 0.64. This indicates that the share price tends to be less sensitive to broad market moves, which is very attractive in uncertain economic times and makes stock perceived as a safe-haven investment. AT&T’s wireless business is still a hit. The company has continued to add new cell phone subscribers as demand for its network services is strong. At the same time, it is moving customers to more expensive premium plans, which boosts average revenue per user (ARPU) for its services and supports hometown revenue growth. Goldman Sachs then contends that such forces will quietly but inexorably raise earning estimates, which are the basis for the sustained revenue growth that the company has realized thus far. AT&T, as the most aggressive fiber builder in the U.S., is expected to see a significant boost in broadband profitability over the next five years. The company has also aggressively pursued fibre assets to replace their DSL/U-verse copper-based networks, increasing future capacity upgrades relative to other forms of access volume and a potentially cheaper model all-in for the company. Analysts also anticipate AT&T’s broadband revenue growth accelerating through the end of the decade as more residential customers migrate to fiber. Such focus will strengthen the firm’s broadband marketplace presence and balance sheet. The FCC is streamlining regulations to accelerate fibre transitions and drive cost savings for telecom companies Another major tailwind supporting AT&T’s fibre transition is regulatory tailwinds. The FCC is working on policies that will allow for faster decommissioning of legacy copper plants. Should these regulatory changes take off, AT&T has the potential to accelerate its fibre transition, ramp up its capacity, and realize its $6 billion savings targets. The transition from copper to fibre improves network efficiency and cuts maintenance and operating costs, both of which bode well for AT&T’s long-term fundamentals. Goldman Sachs attributes its positive outlook on AT&T, first and foremost, to the company’s strong market position, high dividend yield, and solid business fundamentals.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) space has been rocked by another exploit. This time, it’s Abracadabra, a popular DeFi platform known for its MIM stablecoin, that’s in the spotlight. In a startling turn of events, Abracadabra confirmed via X (formerly Twitter) that its gmCauldrons lending contracts were targeted in a sophisticated attack. Let’s break down what we know about this urgent situation and how Abracadabra is responding. What Happened? Unpacking the Abracadabra Exploit The alarm bells started ringing when unusual transactions were detected targeting Abracadabra’s gmCauldrons. These cauldrons are essentially lending contracts within the DeFi platform, allowing users to borrow assets. According to Abracadabra’s official statement, the exploit was identified after several malicious transactions had already taken place. In response, and to prevent further damage, borrowing has been immediately halted across all gmCauldrons. This proactive measure aims to contain the fallout and assess the full extent of the damage from this crypto hack . Here’s a quick rundown of the key details we know so far: Platform Targeted: Abracadabra DeFi platform Vulnerable Contracts: gmCauldrons lending contracts Issue: Exploit leading to unauthorized borrowing Response: Borrowing halted across all cauldrons Confirmation: Announced via Abracadabra’s official X account The Devastating Toll: $13 Million Crypto Hack The financial implications of this crypto hack are substantial. Blockchain security firm Peckshield, a trusted name in the industry, estimates the damage to be around 6,260 ETH. At current Ethereum prices, this translates to a staggering $13 million loss. This figure underscores the severity of the exploit and the significant financial hit Abracadabra has endured. The sheer scale of the stolen funds highlights the ongoing challenges in securing DeFi platforms against increasingly sophisticated attacks. It’s a stark reminder of the risks involved in the decentralized finance ecosystem, even for established platforms like Abracadabra. A Bold Move: 20% Bug Bounty Offered In a rather unconventional and perhaps desperate move, Abracadabra has offered a 20% bug bounty to the attacker. This means they are willing to pay 20% of the stolen funds – approximately $2.6 million based on the $13 million loss – for the return of the remaining 80%. Offering a bug bounty , especially of this magnitude, is a clear indication of Abracadabra’s urgency to recover the stolen assets and mitigate further damage. It’s a high-stakes gamble, hoping to incentivize the attacker to return the majority of the funds while potentially identifying vulnerabilities that led to the exploit. Whether the attacker will accept this offer remains to be seen, but it’s certainly a dramatic development in this unfolding situation. Let’s consider the implications of offering such a large bug bounty : Incentive for Return: A significant financial reward could entice the attacker to return funds. Reputation Management: Shows Abracadabra is taking proactive steps to resolve the issue. Vulnerability Insight: May lead to information about the exploit’s mechanics, helping prevent future attacks. Ethical Dilemma: Some may question rewarding malicious activity, even for fund recovery. Uncertain Outcome: No guarantee the attacker will accept or be identifiable. DeFi Platform Security: A Constant Battle This latest Abracadabra exploit serves as another stark reminder of the ongoing security challenges within the DeFi space. While DeFi platforms offer incredible innovation and financial opportunities, they are also prime targets for hackers. The decentralized and often open-source nature of these platforms can, paradoxically, create vulnerabilities if not rigorously audited and secured. The DeFi platform ecosystem is in a constant state of evolution, with new protocols and smart contracts being deployed regularly. This rapid pace of development can sometimes outstrip security measures, leaving gaps that malicious actors can exploit. For users, this underscores the importance of due diligence, understanding the risks involved, and choosing platforms with robust security track records. Here are some key takeaways regarding DeFi platform security: Aspect Consideration Smart Contract Audits Essential to identify vulnerabilities before deployment. Security Practices Rigorous testing, monitoring, and incident response plans are crucial. Community Vigilance Active community monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity can be invaluable. User Education Users need to understand risks and best practices for interacting with DeFi platforms. The Future of Abracadabra and MIM Stablecoin The immediate aftermath of this Abracadabra exploit raises questions about the future of the platform and its MIM stablecoin. While Abracadabra has acted swiftly to halt borrowing and offer a bug bounty , the incident will undoubtedly impact user confidence. The price of SPELL, Abracadabra’s native token, and the stability of MIM could face increased scrutiny in the short term. How Abracadabra handles this crisis, communicates with its community, and implements stronger security measures will be critical in determining its long-term viability. The resilience and transparency displayed in the coming days will be crucial for regaining trust and ensuring the continued operation of this prominent DeFi platform . In conclusion, the Abracadabra exploit is a significant event in the DeFi world, highlighting both the potential and the perils of decentralized finance. The $13 million crypto hack and the unprecedented bug bounty offer underscore the high stakes and fast-paced nature of this innovative yet risky space. As the situation unfolds, the crypto community will be watching closely to see how Abracadabra recovers and what lessons can be learned to bolster security across the entire DeFi ecosystem.

42344889,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143216,1742946631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Paid Startup: Manny Medina Unveils Lucrative AI Agent Billing Solution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/paid-startup-ai-agent-billing/,"The world of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, and 2024 is shaping up to be the year of the AI agent . As businesses increasingly explore the potential of these autonomous digital workers, a critical infrastructure is needed to support their growth and, crucially, their compensation. Enter Paid, a groundbreaking new venture from Manny Medina, the visionary founder of Outreach. Paid isn’t building AI agents themselves; instead, they are providing the essential financial rails – the picks and shovels, if you will – to ensure these digital entities, and the companies deploying them, thrive in this new era. Bitcoin World had the exclusive scoop on this exciting development. Decoding the Challenge of AI Agent Pricing Manny Medina, fresh off his success at sales automation giant Outreach (valued at a staggering $4.4 billion), recognized a significant gap in the burgeoning AI agents landscape. After extensive conversations with numerous agentic platform startups, a recurring pain point emerged: how do you effectively and profitably charge for the work of AI agents ? The traditional software pricing models simply don’t translate to this paradigm shift. Forget per-user or per-seat licenses – the very essence of AI agents is their ability to operate autonomously and at scale. One human employee might oversee dozens, or even hundreds, of agents. Similarly, usage-based pricing, reminiscent of the SaaS revolution, also falls short. If AI agents are truly effective, they are designed to take over entire roles, not just perform discrete tasks. Medina astutely points out, “An agent’s customer doesn’t want to pay for all the discrete tasks an agent does – if it even knows them all. They want to pay for its results, like an employee.” Imagine an AI agent deployed in insurance, tasked with policy renewals. The client isn’t concerned with the number of emails sent or actions taken; they care about the successful policy renewals generated. This outcome-based expectation clashes with the variable costs associated with running AI agents , primarily driven by the consumption of LLM tokens during training and task execution. This complexity creates a significant hurdle for startups in the AI agent space. “So how do you help them price for the job that they’re delivering?” Medina questioned, highlighting the core problem Paid aims to solve. These startups need the flexibility to experiment with different AI pricing strategies and, crucially, to accurately measure their profit margins. Paid: Bridging Billing and HR for the AI Agent Era The novelty of AI agents means that fundamental business processes, like profitable billing and renewals, are still largely uncharted territory. Paid steps in to provide this crucial framework. The platform empowers agentic startups to craft sophisticated AI pricing models – whether fixed or variable – with a laser focus on achieving profitable margins. Beyond just billing, Paid also incorporates agent output tracking. This dual functionality allows startups to not only optimize their agent billing strategies but also to rigorously validate the return on investment (ROI) generated by their AI agents . Think of it as the next-generation evolution of SaaS business tools: Zuora (the leader in SaaS renewal billing) converging with SuccessFactors (a powerhouse in SaaS HR management), specifically tailored for the age of AI agents . Paid’s initial target market is startups, rather than established enterprise giants like Salesforce or Microsoft, which are also venturing into agentic platforms. However, by focusing on the startups building the next wave of AI innovation, Paid is positioning itself at the very heart of the AI agent revolution. Already, Paid boasts an impressive roster of beta customers, including Logic.app, 11x, Vidlab7, Artisan, and HappyRobot, showcasing the immediate need and appeal of their platform. The Power of AI in Building Paid Medina emphasizes the transformative impact of AI not just on the solutions Paid enables, but also on the very process of building the company itself. “Agents are replacing roles, human roles, not the entire job, but entire roles,” Medina stated, underscoring the profound shift underway. He’s putting this philosophy into practice by leveraging AI tools to accelerate Paid’s development. The initial product demos for Paid were “vibe coded” by their engineers using cutting-edge AI -powered tools like V0, Replit, and Lovable. Medina is clearly excited about this new paradigm of company building. “This is what is so much fun about building a company right now. We have two engineers, and we have built the entirety of the building platform in a month. Why? Because we build everything on AI,” he revealed, highlighting the unprecedented speed and efficiency AI brings to software development. Manny Medina: From Outreach to Paid – A Serial Entrepreneur’s Journey Manny Medina’s track record speaks for itself. His journey with Outreach is a testament to his entrepreneurial prowess. From its humble beginnings in 2011, he steered Outreach to become a dominant force in sales automation, scaling it to 800 employees and $250 million in annual recurring revenue by the time he stepped down as CEO in September. While he later relinquished his executive chairman role in March (remaining on the board), Medina’s entrepreneurial spirit remains as vibrant as ever. Now based in London, he is channeling his experience and vision into Paid, ready to tackle the next frontier of business in the AI agent era. Paid’s successful €10 million (approximately $11 million) pre-seed funding round, led by European powerhouse EQT Ventures, alongside Sequoia and GTMFund, is a strong validation of Medina’s vision and the critical need for a platform like Paid. As AI agents become increasingly integral to the business landscape, Paid is poised to become the indispensable infrastructure that ensures their economic viability and fuels the continued growth of this transformative technology.

To fund this initiative, a total of 10 million DOGE tokens worth approximately $1.8 million were bought. House of Doge has been tasked with promoting the cryptocurrency’s appeal as a payment method to corporate partners – e.g. merchants. “The Official @Dogecoin Reserve” … sooner than Powered By : @houseofdoge & @DogecoinFdn $DOGE #dogecoin Dogecoin is Money! pic.twitter.com/xGuRKIei7o — House of Doge (@houseofdoge) March 14, 2025 “By maintaining a reserve, we can bridge the gap between transaction processing times and real-world usability, making Dogecoin extremely practical for everyday purchases,” commented Michael Galloro, Member of the Board-Elect of House of Doge in a press release published on Monday. The announcement has sparked enthusiasm among market participants, with Dogecoin (DOGE) outperforming its meme coin peers today. While Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have posted modest 24-hour gains of 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively, FLOKI and WIF have slipped by 0.2% and 1.1%. DOGE trading volume has surged by 41% in the past day as investors rushed to gain exposure following the news. This momentum highlights a growing trend of meme coins gaining utility beyond their origins as internet culture icons or speculative assets. If more merchants begin accepting Dogecoin for payments, the token’s real-world use case could drive increased demand and help cement its status as the leading meme coin. DOGE Climbs for a Third Consecutive Day – Is the Sell-Off Over? DOGE’s daily chart shows that the token found a temporary floor at the $0.1400 level during the early March sell-off. The token has been rising for three days in a row as positive momentum seems to be picking up its pace. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above the signal line and has distanced itself from it by nearly 31% already, which is bullish. Meanwhile, the MACD’s histogram shows steadily rising positive momentum readings. DOGE is also breaking a bearish descending triangle today. This is another early sign that the token could be about to reverse its downtrend. However, a reversal would only be confirmed if DOGE rises above its most recent lower high at $0.2410. If that happens, we could witness a full-blown recovery over the next few months for DOGE as market sentiment continues to improve. Identifying which meme coins will outperform the market can be a difficult task. Meme Index ($MEMEX) is becoming one of the best crypto presales of the year as it makes it easier for investors to get diversified exposure to this sector. Meme Index ($MEMEX) Raises $4M to Launch its Decentralized Meme Coin Investing Platform Meme Index ($MEMEX) is a decentralized investment platform designed to simplify and diversify exposure to the meme coin market. It offers four tailored index baskets—Titan, Moonshot, Midcap, and Meme Frenzy—allowing investors to choose based on their individual risk profiles. $MEMEX serves as the utility token and gateway to the platform. As adoption grows among meme coin investors, demand for $MEMEX is expected to rise significantly. Currently priced at a discounted $0.0166883 during its presale, $MEMEX presents a compelling opportunity for early buyers. Many analysts anticipate a sharp price increase once the token is listed on major exchanges. To buy $MEMEX, simply head to the Meme Index website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can swap ETH or USDT for this token or use a bank card to make your investment.

According to Dune Analytics data, most of that volume has come within the last 24 hours, during which time the protocol generated over $500 million in volume. Over the last 24 hours, the massive trading volume has continued a positive trend for the newly launched DEX, which started operating on March 20. Since its launch, PumpSwap has recorded 12.58 million total swaps from over 401,000 active traders. PumpSwap volume has been on rapid rise (Source: Dune Analytics) With PumpSwap, people who launch tokens on Pump.fun can move their tokens directly to the DEX as soon as they complete the bonding curve. A bonding curve is a mathematical model that determines a token’s price based on its supply, with the price increasing as more tokens are bought. The launch of PumpSwap finally allows memecoin creators to migrate to DEX without paying the 6 SOL migration fee and with plans to enable creators’ revenue sharing later on. Unsurprisingly, the increase in DEX trading volume also means revenue is rising. Per Dune Analytics, the total protocol fees generated so far are $2.4 million, while liquidity providers have received over $600,000 in fees. PumpSwap charges 0.25% in fees, of which 0.2% is for the liquidity providers and 0.005% is for the protocol. Despite the relatively positive performance, an in-depth analysis of its performance metrics shows that most of the protocol’s trades are small transactions. According to Flipside data, 65.22% of its trades, when last updated, were for transactions less than $10, while 21.40% were between $10 and $100. Over 86% of PumpSwap transactions in the last 24 hours is between $1 to $100 (Source: Flipside) This shows that most of its users are still testing out its abilities and do not trust it with their big transactions yet. It could also signify that they want to engage the protocol with the hope of a future airdrop. Nevertheless, many people have already tried out the network, with a total number of unique users now at 3.57 million, with 823 tokens graduated Is PumpSwap coming for Raydium throne? Meanwhile, the rising transaction volume and massive influx of unique addresses interacting with the DEX have led many observers to note that it could challenge Raydium. Raydium is Solana’s leading DEX, with $2.53 billion in volume over the past week, according to Defillama . The protocol also accounts for 27.94% of the DEX volume on Solan, while PumpSwap comes fifth, behind Orca, Meteora, and Linfinity. However, Raydium is now sitting content while watching PumpSwap rise. The DEX also recently unveiled LaunchLab, its own token issuance platform that seems to target Pump.fun. While Pump.fun has established itself as the memecoin deployer, Raydium is positioning LaunchLab as the platform for issuing all kinds of projects and providing permissionless and neutral infrastructure for Solana-based projects to launch their tokens. So far, PumpSwap’s arrival has had little impact on Raydium, as the protocol continues to command significant volume. Its token, RAY, is also performing well. According to CoinMarketCap, RAY has been up 22% in the last seven days and has seen a gain of around 1% in the last 24 hours. The biggest beneficiary of this competition in the Solana ecosystem appears to be the network itself. SOL is now on a rebound, rising 2% in the last 24 hours and 17% in the past seven days.

The trio used spoofed phone numbers and fake support calls to impersonate Google and Gemini representatives, manipulating the victim into transferring funds and resetting their two-factor authentication. The largest transaction happened at 4:05 am UTC when they transferred 4064 BTC, valued at $238 million, in a single transaction.

The indictment revealed both were arrested sometime in September 2024 and charged with conspiring to steal and launder cryptocurrency. They were set to appear in separate federal courts in California and Florida on Thursday, September 19, 2024 according to the Justice Department. According to Zach’s investigation, a cluster of the stolen funds was allegedly used to purchase luxury goods including cars, watches, jewelry and designer clothes. Unlike the other two, Malone had not revealed his identity during the heist but his flashy lifestyle gave him away. With his loot, Lam allegedly purchased a fleet of luxury vehicles, including a Pagani Huayra worth $3.8 million, a Lamborghini Revuelto worth $1 million, and custom Porsches and Ferraris. Authorities have reported that 22 luxury vehicles belonging to Lam are still missing, including a white Lamborghini with his name on it. Aside from the luxury cars, Malone also rented multiple mansions and acquired luxury watches, purchasing one of the watches for about $1.8 million. Within the short period of time that he got the loot, Malone quickly built himself a reputation in the Los Angeles nightlife scenes because of how he spent. He would give out handbags to strangers, including influencers, many of whom would recount their experience in Instagram videos. Malone was linked to the loot after accidentally sharing an address used to purchase luxury clothing. Greavys was the first to be arrested. He was located via OSINT in LA/Miami because his friends kept posting his location on social media every night. He also had an Instagram account where he shared photos of himself using his name in 2024. Greavys’ partner tried to warn Malone of the trouble headed his way after her boyfriend’s arrest, and he tried to flee but was apprehended in the process. Box and Wiz converted most of the funds to XMR, but they slipped up by accidentally linking the laundered funds with the dirty funds in multiple instances. 11/ While most of the funds were converted to XMR both Box and Wiz accidentally linked the laundered funds with the dirty funds on multiple instances. a) Wiz during screenshare showed an address he sent funds to for designer clothes which had millions in exposure to the cluster… pic.twitter.com/L0e2zzguyG — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) September 19, 2024 CFInvestigators, zeroshadow, ZachXBT and Binance Security were able to use this information to freeze over $9 million, with $500,000 returned to the victim. Lam is currently facing two counts of indictment in the District of Columbia for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. Each charge he’s accused of carries a maximum term of 20 years. He is presently being held in Virginia, with his lawyer Scott Armstrong noting that his trial will occur in October 2025. The lawyer also said Lam wants to file other legal attacks, with most of them being suppressive motions that require the US government to provide meaningful discovery in the case against him. The crypto fraudster, who is considered a flight risk, is also reportedly calling for the search warrant affidavits and reports relevant to the searches that were carried out in his case. According to prosecutors, Lam could be looking at between 168 and 210 months in jail due to the gravity of the crime, with about $100 million in stolen Bitcoin still missing.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 542,00 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s current bull market cycle has yet to reach a peak. “BTC bull market progress: 82.5%. (Progress will speed up on parabolic advances and slow down on deeper retraces).” Source: Rekt Capital/X The analyst also tells his 107,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin’s latest correction to $76,000 is not the sign of a beginning bear market based on historical precedence. “Many people have been talking about this being a bear market, but it does look like it is a downside deviation period very similar to what we’ve seen back in the past. Obviously, these downside deviation periods are changing across time, but it’s really important to look at the charts in a level-headed manner and try and look at it in an unbiased way and not scream bear market whenever we see a pullback that is actually very similar to the one we saw here [in 2024]. This was a 32% pullback [in 2024]. This is a 30% pullback [when Bitcoin corrected to the $76,000 range this month], so very similar downside deviation in that regard, but really important to keep level-headed and look at the data, look at the chart, and zoom out when in doubt.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube In technical analysis, a downside deviation is a setup where an asset breaks its immediate support to print a false breakdown before igniting a recovery and rallying to new highs.

The Bitcoin market is buzzing with exciting news. Fidelity’s FBTC Bitcoin ETF has just witnessed a massive $60 million inflow, according to data from Arkham Intelligence on X. This significant surge is not just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure. Are we on the cusp of another major wave of adoption? Let’s dive deep into what this means for Bitcoin and the broader crypto landscape. Why is the Fidelity FBTC Bitcoin ETF attracting such massive inflows? The recent $60 million injection into Fidelity’s FBTC Bitcoin ETF is a noteworthy event for several reasons. It underscores a continued and, perhaps, accelerating trend of institutional investors seeking regulated and convenient pathways to gain exposure to Bitcoin. But what makes the Fidelity FBTC ETF so appealing? Let’s break it down: Reputable Provider: Fidelity is a globally recognized and trusted financial institution with decades of experience in asset management. This established reputation provides a sense of security and reliability for investors, especially larger institutional players who prioritize counterparty risk. Ease of Access: For institutions and even retail investors, investing in a Bitcoin ETF is significantly simpler than directly purchasing and storing Bitcoin. ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them accessible through brokerage accounts that many institutions already utilize. Regulatory Compliance: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a layer of compliance and investor protection that is often lacking in the direct purchase of cryptocurrencies. This regulatory clarity is particularly attractive to institutional investors who must adhere to strict compliance standards. Diversification Benefits: For portfolio managers, adding a Bitcoin ETF can offer diversification benefits, potentially enhancing risk-adjusted returns. Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds makes it an attractive diversifier. The inflow into Fidelity FBTC isn’t happening in isolation. It’s part of a larger narrative of increasing institutional acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into mainstream finance. This latest influx suggests that the narrative is gaining momentum. Institutional Investment in Bitcoin ETFs: What does it really signify? Institutional investment is often considered the holy grail for Bitcoin and the crypto market in general. Why? Because it represents a substantial influx of capital, validation of Bitcoin as an asset class, and a move towards broader mainstream adoption. Here’s what this increasing institutional interest, exemplified by the Fidelity FBTC inflow, really signifies: Increased Market Liquidity: Larger institutional players bring significant capital to the market, which can lead to increased liquidity. This, in turn, can reduce volatility and make the market more efficient. Price Appreciation Potential: As demand for Bitcoin increases through institutional investment in ETFs and other avenues, basic economics suggests that the price of Bitcoin could appreciate. Limited supply coupled with rising demand is a classic recipe for price increases. Mainstream Validation: When established institutions like Fidelity allocate capital to Bitcoin ETFs, it sends a powerful signal to the broader market. It validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, moving it further away from the fringes and closer to the mainstream. Long-Term Investment Horizon: Institutional investors typically have a longer-term investment horizon compared to retail traders. This can contribute to greater stability in the Bitcoin market, reducing the impact of short-term speculative trading. The $60 million inflow into Fidelity FBTC is a tangible manifestation of this growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Decoding Bitcoin Inflows: Is there a direct link to price action? The crypto world is always trying to decipher patterns and predict price movements. Naturally, a significant event like a $60 million Bitcoin inflow into an ETF raises the question: Does this directly translate to positive price action for Bitcoin? While there’s no guaranteed one-to-one correlation, there are strong reasons to believe that Bitcoin inflows into ETFs can be a positive catalyst. Let’s consider the dynamics: Increased Demand: ETF inflows represent actual buying pressure in the Bitcoin market. To fulfill the ETF demand, fund providers like Fidelity need to purchase Bitcoin, directly increasing demand for the asset. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins. Increased demand from ETFs and other sources, against a limited supply, can create upward pressure on prices. Market Sentiment: Positive news like significant ETF inflows can boost market sentiment. Positive sentiment can attract more investors, both institutional and retail, further fueling demand and potentially price appreciation. However, it’s crucial to remember that the Bitcoin market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. While Bitcoin inflows into ETFs are a positive indicator, they are just one piece of the puzzle. External factors can sometimes overshadow even strong positive inflows. Therefore, while these inflows are encouraging, a holistic view of the market is always necessary. The Broader Crypto ETF Landscape: Are other Crypto ETFs seeing similar traction? While the spotlight is currently on Fidelity FBTC due to the $60 million inflow, it’s important to look at the broader Crypto ETF landscape. Are other ETFs experiencing similar positive trends? The answer, to some extent, is yes. The launch and growth of various Bitcoin ETFs, particularly in regions like North America, have collectively contributed to increased institutional and retail access to Bitcoin. Here’s a glimpse into the broader landscape: Crypto ETF Focus Cryptocurrency Key Features Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) Bitcoin One of the earliest and largest Bitcoin investment vehicles, transitioning to an ETF. iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) Bitcoin Offered by BlackRock, a global leader in asset management, providing broad market access. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) Bitcoin Futures First U.S. Bitcoin-linked ETF, offering exposure through futures contracts. Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BTF) Bitcoin Futures Another Bitcoin futures ETF, providing an alternative exposure route. Various Spot Bitcoin ETFs in Canada Bitcoin Canada has been ahead in approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, offering diverse options. The success of Fidelity FBTC and other Crypto ETFs is paving the way for further innovation and product development in the crypto investment space. We may see ETFs focused on other cryptocurrencies, thematic crypto ETFs, and more sophisticated investment products emerging in the future. This expanding landscape offers investors more choices and further legitimizes crypto as a viable investment category. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Adoption? The $60 million inflow into Fidelity FBTC is more than just a single data point; it’s a signpost pointing towards a future where Bitcoin ETFs play an increasingly central role in institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Looking ahead, here are some key aspects to watch: Continued Inflow Momentum: Will the inflow into Bitcoin ETFs , including Fidelity FBTC , continue at this pace or even accelerate? Sustained inflows would further strengthen the bullish case for Bitcoin. Regulatory Developments: Regulatory clarity and support for crypto ETFs in various jurisdictions will be crucial for broader institutional participation. Positive regulatory signals could unlock even larger pools of capital. Performance of Bitcoin ETFs: The performance of existing Bitcoin ETFs will influence investor sentiment and future allocation decisions. Strong performance could attract more investors and further validate the ETF structure. Expansion to Other Cryptocurrencies: Will the success of Bitcoin ETFs pave the way for ETFs based on other leading cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, or even baskets of cryptocurrencies? This expansion would broaden the crypto investment universe accessible through traditional financial channels. The journey of institutional adoption of Bitcoin through ETFs is still in its early stages, but the recent $60 million inflow into Fidelity FBTC is a powerful indication of the direction of travel. It suggests that institutional investors are becoming increasingly comfortable with Bitcoin as an asset class and are utilizing ETFs as a preferred vehicle for gaining exposure. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal for Bitcoin’s Future The $60 million inflow into Fidelity’s FBTC Bitcoin ETF is undoubtedly a stunning development. It’s a clear signal that institutional interest in Bitcoin is not just a fleeting trend but a growing conviction. This influx of capital into a reputable Bitcoin ETF like Fidelity FBTC validates Bitcoin’s position in the evolving financial landscape and suggests a bright future for crypto adoption. As Bitcoin inflows into ETFs continue and the Crypto ETF market matures, we can expect to see further integration of digital assets into mainstream investment portfolios, potentially driving significant growth and stability in the crypto market.

This bold initiative, detailed in a formal correspondence to the SEC’s crypto task force, signals a proactive approach towards fostering innovation while ensuring regulatory clarity in the burgeoning Web3 space. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development and explore what it could mean for the future of digital assets and Web3. What is Tokenization and Why is it Crucial for Web3? Before we delve into the specifics of the Asia Web3 Alliance’s proposal, it’s essential to understand the core concept of tokenization . In simple terms, tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets or rights as digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens can represent anything from traditional securities and commodities to intellectual property, real estate, and even loyalty points. The importance of tokenization for Web3 is multifaceted: Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenizing assets makes them more easily divisible and tradable, unlocking liquidity in previously illiquid markets. Fractional Ownership: It allows for fractional ownership of high-value assets, democratizing investment opportunities and making them accessible to a wider range of participants. Increased Efficiency and Transparency: Blockchain-based tokenization streamlines processes, reduces intermediaries, and enhances transparency in transactions. New Business Models: Tokenization paves the way for innovative business models and decentralized applications (dApps) in the Web3 ecosystem. As Web3 continues to evolve, tokenization is poised to become a cornerstone of the new digital economy, bridging the gap between the traditional financial world and the decentralized future. Asia Web3 Alliance’s Bold Proposal: Bridging the Regulatory Gap The Asia Web3 Alliance, a prominent organization based in Japan, is taking a proactive stance to address the regulatory complexities surrounding tokenization and Web3. Their proposal to the U.S. SEC outlines a framework for joint cooperation aimed at promoting both innovation and responsible regulation. The alliance envisions a collaborative effort involving key regulatory bodies from both regions, specifically suggesting the participation of: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan Bank of Japan (BoJ) This multi-agency approach underscores the comprehensive nature of the proposal, recognizing that effective Web3 regulation requires a coordinated effort across different sectors and jurisdictions. The core objectives of this proposed collaboration are ambitious and forward-thinking, designed to lay a solid foundation for the future of tokenization and Web3. Why Tokenization Regulation Matters for Cross-Border Web3 Growth? One of the biggest hurdles for the widespread adoption of tokenization and Web3 technologies is the lack of clear and consistent regulatory frameworks globally. The current regulatory landscape is fragmented, with different jurisdictions adopting varying approaches to digital assets and blockchain-based innovations. This creates uncertainty, hinders cross-border transactions, and stifles innovation. The Asia Web3 Alliance recognizes this challenge and emphasizes the critical need for regulatory interoperability. Their proposal specifically aims to address this issue by focusing on: Developing a Token Classification Framework: Creating a clear and harmonized framework to distinguish between tokenized securities and utility tokens is paramount. This will provide much-needed clarity for businesses and investors, reducing ambiguity and fostering compliance. Supporting Cross-Border Token Issuance: Facilitating the seamless issuance of tokens across different jurisdictions is crucial for promoting global Web3 growth. This requires establishing mutual recognition and compliance standards. Establishing Cross-Border Token Trading and Custody Standards: Developing standardized protocols for the trading and custody of tokens across borders will enhance security, efficiency, and investor protection in the global Web3 marketplace. By tackling these key areas, the proposed collaboration seeks to create a more unified and predictable regulatory environment, paving the way for accelerated growth in the global Web3 ecosystem . Key Benefits of the Proposed Collaboration for Web3 Innovation The potential benefits of a successful collaboration between the U.S. SEC and Asian regulatory bodies on Web3 regulation are substantial and far-reaching. This initiative could act as a catalyst for innovation, fostering a more robust and globally interconnected Web3 ecosystem. Some of the key advantages include: Benefit Description Regulatory Clarity and Certainty Harmonized regulations will provide businesses and investors with greater clarity and predictability, encouraging investment and participation in the Web3 space. Reduced Compliance Burden Interoperable regulations will simplify compliance for companies operating across borders, reducing costs and administrative hurdles. Accelerated Innovation A more favorable regulatory environment will foster innovation and experimentation in tokenization and Web3 technologies. Enhanced Investor Protection Jointly developed standards for trading and custody will strengthen investor protection in the evolving digital asset market. Global Web3 Growth By promoting cross-border collaboration and interoperability, this initiative can contribute to the overall growth and maturation of the global Web3 ecosystem. Moreover, the proposal includes the establishment of a “safe harbor mechanism” for early-stage token projects and learning sandbox test models from the U.S. This demonstrates a commitment to nurturing innovation from the ground up, providing a supportive environment for startups and emerging Web3 ventures. What are the Challenges in Tokenization and Cross-Border Regulation? While the Asia Web3 Alliance’s proposal is undoubtedly a positive step, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent challenges in achieving effective tokenization regulation and cross-border collaboration. Navigating these complexities will be crucial for the success of this initiative. Some of the key challenges include: Divergent Regulatory Philosophies: The U.S. and Asian countries may have different regulatory philosophies and priorities, making it challenging to reach a consensus on unified standards. Technological Complexity: Web3 technologies are rapidly evolving, making it difficult for regulators to keep pace and develop future-proof regulations. Enforcement Challenges: Enforcing cross-border regulations in a decentralized and global Web3 environment presents significant logistical and legal hurdles. Data Privacy and Security Concerns: Balancing innovation with data privacy and security requirements is a critical consideration in Web3 regulation . Political and Economic Factors: Geopolitical dynamics and economic competition between nations could also influence the progress and outcomes of regulatory collaboration. Overcoming these challenges will require sustained dialogue, compromise, and a shared commitment to fostering responsible innovation in the Web3 space. Examples of Successful Tokenization Initiatives Globally Despite the regulatory hurdles, tokenization is already gaining traction across various sectors globally, showcasing its transformative potential. Examining successful examples can provide valuable insights and inspire further innovation. Here are a few notable examples: Real Estate Tokenization: Platforms like RealT are tokenizing real estate properties, allowing investors to purchase fractions of properties with cryptocurrency, increasing accessibility and liquidity in the real estate market. Security Token Offerings (STOs): Companies are utilizing STOs to raise capital by issuing tokenized securities, offering a regulated alternative to traditional Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and expanding access to investment opportunities. Supply Chain Tokenization: Blockchain-based tokenization is being used to track and manage supply chains, enhancing transparency, efficiency, and traceability of goods. Digital Collectibles (NFTs): Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized the digital art and collectibles market, demonstrating the power of tokenization in creating unique and verifiable digital assets. Tokenized Carbon Credits: Initiatives are emerging to tokenize carbon credits, creating a more transparent and efficient market for carbon offsetting and promoting environmental sustainability. These examples highlight the diverse applications of tokenization and its potential to disrupt and improve various industries. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Future of Web3 Regulation The Asia Web3 Alliance’s proposal offers valuable insights for stakeholders navigating the evolving landscape of Web3 regulation . Here are some actionable takeaways: Proactive Engagement is Key: Industry players should proactively engage with regulators to shape the regulatory framework and ensure it is conducive to innovation.

This comes as Americans continue to view the U.S. economy negatively due to rising prices and uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s policies. The economic outlook’s uncertainty is seriously affecting consumers’ predictions of their future well-being By March, the Conference Board consumer confidence index had reached 92.9, the lowest level in four years and down from February’s 98.3. The expectations index, which examines consumers’ short-term expectations for business, labour market, and income conditions, also declined in February and March. At 65.2% in March, the expectations index was far below the 80-point mark, which, according to the Conference Board, normally indicates an impending recession. February also saw a decline, with the index falling to 72.9—the first time it had dipped below 80 since June 2024. Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior U.S. economist at the Conference Board, said one of their most striking findings was how consumers’ expectations concerning their financial circumstances had deteriorated. “So that does seem to indicate that all this uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook is really beginning to weigh on consumers’ (view) of how they will do going forward,” she added. In addition, consumer expectations for the economy have weakened, according to multiple readings, including Tuesday’s. The market is increasingly concerned that consumers could pull back on spending if they grow more pessimistic about the economy. The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and economists disagree on whether “soft” survey data, such as the consumer confidence index, will make “hard” economic data, like real consumer spending, worse. “There’ve been lots of times when people are saying downbeat stuff about the economy, and they go out and buy a new car,” Powell said. However, we can’t assume that that will be the case here. We will be watching closely for weakness in the real data.” For now, however, most economists have insisted that there remains no clear sign of a sharp slowdown, even if the overall growth trajectory for the U.S. economy is likely weaker than expected going into the year. On Sunday, Morgan Stanley’s chief global economist wrote in a research note to clients that all recession-related crises are probably overstated. He pointed to the worrying collapse of retail sales in January before rebounding in February. U.S. consumers express low confidence through growing financial pessimism According to the February edition of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, which was made public on Monday, March 10, consumers were less confident about their future financial circumstances even though their medium- and long-term inflation expectations remained constant. Furthermore, the bank’s Centre for Macroeconomic Data revealed notable drops in expectations regarding credit accessibility, delinquency, and unemployment. Based on credit accessibility, a greater percentage of households believed it was harder to obtain credit, whereas a smaller percentage believed it was simpler. Additionally, three banking regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released data on Monday that indicated weakening credit quality among borrowers with balances exceeding $100 million. The regulators explained that the reasons for the negative trends in credit quality were the pressure of high interest rates on leveraged borrowers and the compressed operating margins in certain industry sectors.

42346074,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143220,1742949035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Victory for Crypto: FDIC Kills ‘Reputational Risk’ in Bank Supervision,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fdic-kills-reputational-risk/,"In a move hailed as a significant win for the cryptocurrency industry, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has officially removed ‘reputational risk’ as a criterion for bank supervision. This decision, celebrated by figures like David Sacks, a former Trump administration official, marks a pivotal shift away from subjective standards that have previously hindered crypto businesses’ access to traditional banking services. For years, the specter of ‘reputational risk’ has loomed large, often used as a vague justification to deny banking to legitimate crypto enterprises. Is this the end of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and a new era of fairness for the digital asset space? Why is Removing ‘Reputational Risk’ from Bank Supervision a Big Deal? The removal of ‘reputational risk’ from the FDIC’s supervisory framework is not just bureaucratic jargon; it’s a fundamental change with real-world implications. Previously, banks could cite ‘reputational risk’ – a nebulous and often subjective concept – to justify severing ties with or refusing service to businesses deemed undesirable. In practice, this vague standard became a tool to target lawful cryptocurrency firms, a phenomenon critics dubbed ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’. Think of it this way: Subjectivity vs. Objectivity: ‘Reputational risk’ is inherently subjective. What one regulator deems risky, another might not. This lack of clarity created uncertainty and stifled innovation in the crypto sector. Chilling Effect: The mere threat of being labeled ‘reputationally risky’ could deter banks from working with crypto companies, even those operating within legal boundaries. Lack of Transparency: Decisions based on ‘reputational risk’ were often opaque, leaving crypto businesses in the dark about the specific concerns and with limited recourse. By eliminating this criterion, the FDIC is signaling a move towards objective, data-driven assessments of risk. Banks will now be expected to rely on concrete factors like financial stability, compliance with regulations, and actual, demonstrable risks, rather than vague notions of ‘reputational risk’. David Sacks and the Echoes of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 David Sacks, a prominent voice in the tech and crypto space, didn’t mince words in his praise for the FDIC’s decision. As the former Director of Cryptocurrency and AI in the Trump administration, Sacks has been a vocal critic of what he perceives as regulatory overreach targeting the crypto industry. His reference to ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’ is particularly telling. Operation Chokepoint, initiated by the Obama administration, aimed to combat fraud by pressuring banks to cut ties with businesses deemed ‘high-risk’. While the original intent might have been laudable, critics argue that it was misused to target legitimate industries. ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0′, as coined by some, suggests a similar pattern – a perceived effort to stifle the cryptocurrency industry by leveraging banking regulations. Sacks’ endorsement underscores the significance of the FDIC’s move in the context of these past regulatory challenges. His statement on X (formerly Twitter) highlights the relief felt by many in the crypto community who believe that ‘reputational risk’ was weaponized to unfairly target their businesses. Senator Tim Scott and the FIRM Act: Legislative Muscle Behind Fair Bank Supervision While the FDIC’s action is a regulatory shift, it’s also intertwined with broader legislative efforts to bring clarity and fairness to bank supervision. David Sacks specifically credited Senator Tim Scott’s leadership through the FIRM Act. But what is the FIRM Act, and how does it connect to this FDIC decision? The FIRM Act (Financial Innovation and Regulatory Modernization Act) , championed by Senator Tim Scott, aims to modernize the regulatory framework for financial technology and digital assets. A key objective of the FIRM Act is to promote innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. It seeks to achieve this by: Establishing Clear Regulatory Boundaries: The FIRM Act aims to provide clearer guidelines for how existing financial regulations apply to new technologies like cryptocurrencies. Encouraging Innovation: By reducing regulatory uncertainty, the Act intends to foster innovation and growth in the fintech and digital asset sectors. Promoting Competition: A more level playing field, as envisioned by the FIRM Act, could encourage competition and benefit consumers. The FDIC’s decision to drop ‘reputational risk’ aligns perfectly with the spirit of the FIRM Act. It signals a move towards a more objective, less discriminatory approach to bank supervision, which is crucial for the healthy development of the cryptocurrency industry within the regulated financial system. Benefits of Objective Bank Supervision for Crypto Firms The shift towards objective, data-driven bank supervision, spurred by the FDIC’s action and supported by legislative efforts like the FIRM Act, unlocks a range of benefits for cryptocurrency firms. Let’s explore some key advantages: Benefit Description Improved Access to Banking Services Crypto firms, especially smaller businesses and startups, will find it easier to open and maintain bank accounts, access loans, and utilize other essential financial services. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty Clearer, objective criteria for bank supervision reduces the ambiguity and fear associated with ‘reputational risk’, fostering a more predictable regulatory environment. Fairer Competitive Landscape By eliminating subjective barriers, the FDIC’s move promotes a fairer playing field where crypto firms are judged on their actual risk profile, not on perceived reputational issues. Encouraged Innovation and Growth With better access to banking and reduced regulatory hurdles, the cryptocurrency industry can focus on innovation and growth, driving economic activity and job creation. Enhanced Investor Confidence A more stable and predictable regulatory environment can boost investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market, attracting further investment and development. Are There Challenges Ahead? Navigating the New Landscape of Bank Supervision While the FDIC’s decision is undoubtedly a positive step, it’s crucial to acknowledge that challenges may still lie ahead. The removal of ‘reputational risk’ doesn’t automatically guarantee smooth sailing for crypto firms. What potential hurdles remain? Implementation and Enforcement: The true impact of this policy change will depend on how effectively it is implemented and enforced by bank supervisors. Consistent and fair application across all banks is essential. Residual Subjectivity: Even with ‘reputational risk’ removed, some degree of subjectivity might still creep into bank supervision. Regulators must remain vigilant against implicit biases and ensure truly objective assessments. Ongoing Regulatory Scrutiny: The cryptocurrency industry remains under significant regulatory scrutiny globally. Firms must continue to prioritize compliance and risk management to maintain positive relationships with banks and regulators. Education and Awareness: Banks and regulators need to be further educated about the nuances of the cryptocurrency industry to make informed decisions based on facts, not misconceptions. Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses: Seizing the Opportunity For cryptocurrency businesses, the FDIC’s decision and the broader shift towards objective bank supervision present a valuable opportunity. Here are some actionable steps crypto firms can take: Strengthen Compliance Frameworks: Robust KYC/AML procedures, transparent operations, and adherence to all applicable regulations are more critical than ever. Demonstrate a commitment to compliance to build trust with banks. Proactively Engage with Banks: Don’t wait for banks to reach out. Initiate conversations, showcase your compliance measures, and clearly articulate your business model and risk mitigation strategies. Document Everything: Maintain meticulous records of your operations, compliance efforts, and financial transactions. Transparency and documentation are key to building credibility. Seek Legal and Regulatory Counsel: Stay informed about evolving regulations and seek expert legal and regulatory advice to ensure you are navigating the landscape effectively. Advocate for Fair Policies: Engage with industry associations and participate in advocacy efforts to promote fair and balanced regulatory frameworks that support innovation. A Welcome Shift Towards Fairness in Crypto Banking The FDIC’s decision to drop ‘reputational risk’ from bank supervision is more than just a policy tweak; it’s a symbolic victory for the cryptocurrency industry. It signals a move away from subjective biases and towards a more objective, data-driven approach to regulating this burgeoning sector. While challenges remain, this development, coupled with legislative efforts like the FIRM Act, offers a glimmer of hope for a fairer and more inclusive financial future for crypto. This welcome shift can pave the way for greater innovation, broader adoption, and a more level playing field for crypto businesses seeking to operate within the traditional financial system. The era of ‘reputational risk’ as a blunt instrument against crypto appears to be waning, replaced by a more nuanced and hopefully, more equitable approach.

In November 2024, the SEC issued a Wells notice to the Web3 gaming company alleging that it was in potential violation of securities laws. In a report , Immutable called the notice the latest in the agency’s policy of regulation by enforcement, which was targeting leading Web3 companies, such as Ripple, OpenSea, and Coinbase. While the SEC did not state it in its notice, Immutable believes the inquiry targeted the listing and sales of its tokens IMX in 2021 and expressed confidence that its assets and services were not in violation of any laws. “We are confident in the legality of our assets and services, in the value digital ownership can bring to 3.1 billion gamers across the world, and in the power of blockchain to create a better internet. If required, we will fight for these rights, and those of our industry, vigorously,” the report said. SEC ends all investigations into Web3 gaming company Immutable Last year, the SEC issued Immutable a Wells Notice. That inquiry is now officially closed, with zero findings of wrongdoing, and the SEC is taking no action. This is a huge win – not just for web3 gaming, but everyone who believes in digital ownership rights. Let's build. — Immutable (@Immutable) March 25, 2025 On March 25, 2025, the Web3 gaming company announced that the SEC has decided to formally end all investigations into Immutable, the IMX Ecosystem Foundation, and its CEO. Also, the regulator would not be taking any further enforcement actions. “The SEC’s decision to end its investigation is a win for all builders, creators and gamers fighting for true digital ownership in gaming,” the Web3 gaming firm shared in a news release, adding that it is vindicated in its longstanding focus on legal and regulatory compliance. The SEC dropping its inquiry into Immutable aligns with the broader shift of the regulatory landscape under President Trump. In January 2025, the SEC established a crypto task force led by Hester Peirce , charged with creating comprehensive and clear regulatory frameworks governing digital assets. The SEC also dropped its case against Ripple, with more settlements and agreements agreed earlier today. Immutable says it welcomes the U.S. government’s commitment to creating clear frameworks for digital assets, adding that, “Constructive regulation provides certainty for builders, and helps foster the innovative potential of blockchain technology.” SEC resolution has implications for the Web3 gaming industry Immutable recorded about $80 million in NFT sales volume in Q4 2024, according to a Messari report . The conclusion of the SEC’s inquiry would have significant effects on the Web3 gaming industry. Regulatory clarity will help unlock investments and help Immutable to tokenize the in-game purchase market , which is worth over $100 billion. After the SEC closed the Inquiry, Immutable co-founder Robbie Ferguson, in a post on X, said it was a huge win not just for Web3 gaming but also digital asset ownership rights, saying the threats to digital asset ownership have been removed. The company, throughout the SEC investigation, was working on its vision to bring digital ownership to the 3.1 billion gamers worldwide. Ferguson believes overcoming the investigation brings Immutable closer to onboarding gamers on-chain. The closure of the SEC’s investigation follows a trend of reevaluating enforcement actions against Web3 and digital asset firms under the Trump administration.

The world of digital assets is buzzing with excitement as traditional finance giant Fidelity Investments makes a bold leap into the Solana ecosystem. In a potentially game-changing development, Fidelity has officially filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Solana ETF . This news, first spotted by the keen eyes at @solidintel_x on X, signals a major step forward for Solana and the broader crypto market. But what does this mean for you, the crypto investor? Let’s dive into the details of this thrilling announcement and unpack its potential impact. Why a Spot Solana ETF is a Big Deal For those unfamiliar, an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. A spot Solana ETF , if approved, would directly hold Solana tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to Solana’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This is a significant departure from futures-based ETFs and opens up a new avenue for traditional investors to access the crypto market. Here’s why this is generating so much buzz: Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. This makes Solana investment available to a wider range of investors who may be hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. Familiarity and Regulation: ETFs operate within a well-established regulatory framework. This provides a sense of security and familiarity for institutional and retail investors accustomed to traditional financial products. Diversification: A Solana ETF can be a valuable tool for portfolio diversification. It allows investors to add crypto exposure without the need to manage individual digital assets directly. Institutional Adoption Signal: Fidelity, a major player in asset management, filing for a Solana ETF sends a powerful signal of institutional confidence in Solana and the long-term potential of crypto. Fidelity’s Foray into Crypto ETFs: A Sign of the Times? Fidelity Investments is no stranger to the crypto space. They have been gradually increasing their involvement, offering crypto trading services and even including Bitcoin in some retirement plans. However, a Fidelity ETF specifically focused on Solana represents a significant escalation in their crypto strategy. This move suggests that Fidelity sees substantial growth potential in Solana and believes there is strong investor demand for a regulated investment product linked to SOL. Consider Fidelity’s track record in the ETF market. They are a well-respected and experienced ETF issuer. Their entry into the crypto ETF arena, particularly with a focus on Solana, could pave the way for wider acceptance and adoption of crypto ETFs by other major financial institutions. The Current Crypto ETF Landscape: Where Does Solana Fit In? The crypto ETF market is still relatively nascent, but it’s rapidly evolving. Currently, spot Bitcoin ETFs have gained significant traction after their approval in the US. Ethereum ETFs are also anticipated, and now, a spot Solana ETF application from Fidelity adds another layer of excitement and potential diversification to the market. Here’s a quick comparison: Cryptocurrency Existing ETFs (Spot/Futures) Fidelity’s Move Bitcoin (BTC) Spot ETFs Approved Already offers Bitcoin products Ethereum (ETH) Futures ETFs, Spot ETFs Anticipated Likely to follow with ETH ETF Solana (SOL) No Spot ETF yet Fidelity files for spot Solana ETF The introduction of a Solana ETF could broaden the appeal of crypto investments beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially attracting investors who are interested in Solana’s unique technology and ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations for a Solana ETF While the spot Solana ETF application is a positive development, it’s important to acknowledge the potential hurdles: SEC Approval: The SEC’s stance on crypto ETFs has been cautious. Approval is not guaranteed, and the review process can be lengthy and rigorous. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their price volatility. This inherent risk needs to be carefully considered by investors. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and changes in regulations could impact crypto ETFs. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of the underlying Solana assets is crucial for a spot ETF. Despite these challenges, Fidelity’s decision to file for a Solana ETF suggests they are confident in navigating these complexities and see a viable path to bringing this product to market. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Investors? So, what should you do with this news? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the progress of Fidelity’s Solana ETF application and any updates from the SEC. Research Solana: If you’re unfamiliar with Solana, now is a good time to research its technology, ecosystem, and potential use cases. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals before investing in any crypto-related product, including ETFs. Diversify Wisely: If a Solana ETF becomes available, consider it as a potential diversification tool within a broader investment portfolio. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Future of Crypto Investment Fidelity’s filing for a spot Solana ETF is undoubtedly a groundbreaking moment for the crypto industry. It signifies a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions and opens up exciting new avenues for investors to participate in the digital asset revolution. While the path to approval may have its bumps, this move underscores the increasing maturity of the crypto market and the enduring appeal of innovative blockchain technologies like Solana. The potential launch of a Fidelity ETF for Solana could mark a new era of accessibility and mainstream adoption for Solana investment and the broader crypto space.

Originally slated for September 2024, the Cerebras IPO delay is now extending further into the future as the national security review process drags on. This delay raises questions about the IPO market and the increasing scrutiny faced by tech companies, especially those in sensitive sectors like artificial intelligence. Why is the Cerebras IPO Delay Happening? Several factors are contributing to the Cerebras IPO delay, primarily centered around a rigorous national security review. Here’s a breakdown: National Security Review: The IPO triggered a national security review due to a significant $335 million investment from G42, an AI holding company based in Abu Dhabi. G42’s past connections with Chinese tech giant Huawei have amplified concerns, leading to intense scrutiny from U.S. authorities. Government Vacancies: Adding to the complexity, key positions within the U.S. government that oversee such reviews remain unfilled. Notably, the assistant Treasury secretary for investment security, who leads the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), is yet to be appointed. This vacancy has slowed down the review process significantly. Geopolitical Tensions: The current geopolitical climate, marked by heightened tensions and a focus on national security, especially concerning technology and AI, is playing a crucial role. Investments from foreign entities, particularly those with potential links to adversarial nations, are under increased examination. Impact on the AI Chips IPO Landscape The Cerebras IPO delay sends ripples through the AI chips IPO landscape. Cerebras is a significant player in the AI hardware space, known for its innovative Wafer Scale Engine. A successful IPO was expected to boost investor confidence in the sector and pave the way for other AI-focused companies to go public. However, this delay introduces uncertainty. What are the potential consequences? Investor Hesitation: The drawn-out review process might make investors wary of investing in AI chip companies, especially those with international funding. It highlights the potential regulatory hurdles and delays associated with IPOs in sensitive tech sectors. Valuation Concerns: Prolonged delays can impact a company’s valuation. Market conditions can change, and investor sentiment can shift, potentially affecting the IPO’s success even after the security review is cleared. Precedent Setting: The Cerebras case could set a precedent for future AI chips IPOs. Companies in similar situations might face even more stringent and time-consuming national security reviews. Cerebras’ Innovative AI Investment and Future Prospects Despite the IPO setbacks, Cerebras remains a formidable force in the AI industry. Their groundbreaking Wafer Scale Engine, a massive chip designed specifically for AI workloads, positions them at the forefront of AI hardware innovation. The AI investment they have attracted, even with the current scrutiny, underscores the potential of their technology. Key highlights of Cerebras’ technology and market position: Wafer Scale Engine (WSE): Cerebras’ WSE is significantly larger and more powerful than traditional GPUs, offering unparalleled performance for complex AI models and computations. Target Market: They cater to high-performance computing needs in areas like scientific research, drug discovery, and large-scale AI model training. Competitive Edge: While facing competition from established players like NVIDIA and AMD, Cerebras carves a niche with its unique architecture optimized for specific AI workloads. Navigating the National Security Review Maze The national security review process is becoming an increasingly critical aspect of IPOs, especially for companies operating in sensitive technology sectors. For Cerebras and other startups seeking to go public, understanding and navigating this maze is crucial. Actionable insights for companies facing similar reviews: Early Engagement: Proactively engage with regulatory bodies and seek guidance early in the IPO process. Transparency: Maintain full transparency regarding funding sources and international partnerships. Risk Assessment: Conduct thorough risk assessments to identify potential national security concerns and address them proactively. Legal Counsel: Seek expert legal counsel specializing in national security reviews and IPO regulations. The Road Ahead for Cerebras and the IPO Market The Cerebras IPO delay is a stark reminder of the complexities and challenges in the current IPO market, particularly for technology companies operating at the intersection of AI and national security. While the delay is undoubtedly a setback, it doesn’t diminish Cerebras’ technological achievements or long-term potential. The company’s ability to navigate the regulatory hurdles and eventually proceed with its IPO will be closely watched by the industry. The outcome of Cerebras’ IPO journey will not only impact the company itself but also shape investor sentiment and the regulatory landscape for future AI and tech IPOs. It underscores the increasing importance of national security considerations in the global technology race.

It has been negotiating with Morocco, Bangladesh, and Turkey. Progress has also been made in other huge markets like India. However, Musk’s political connections have started to complicate Starlink’s global rollout. Musk’s relations with Trump have helped Starlink secure critical government contracts in the United States. Trump-era officials showed fewer concerns about monopolies, clearing a path for SpaceX to land lucrative federal deals. Thanks to that environment, Starlink was recently installed at the White House, and Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, has urged officials to consider the service under the $42 billion US rural Broadband Equity. Regulators in other countries must now decide whether Musk’s political reputation and unpredictable comments on his social media platform create too much risk. This debate has already surfaced in Canada, Europe, and other regions that initially embraced Starlink but are now hesitant to deepen their dependence on Musk’s company. In a recent example, a Canadian province canceled a $100 million agreement with Starlink as a protest against American tariffs, signaling that Musk’s image in the U.S. could affect cross-border deals. He also stirred opposition from European politicians after criticizing their approach to Ukraine’s conflict with Russia. Industry experts say these issues might spark a shift in the satellite communications arena, suggesting that Starlink, while still the largest player, may not remain the only major force if governments decide to diversify. Edison Yu, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, noted, “There appears to be a potentially tectonic shift occurring in the satellite communications landscape ignited by geopolitics. Starlink is still clearly number one, but not the only one.” Musk has a huge financial stake in Starlink Meanwhile, Musk’s financial stake is enormous. Starlink is a key part of SpaceX, which was valued at $350 billion in a private tender offer. Roughly half of Musk’s $314 billion net worth is now tied to SpaceX, while his 20 percent stake in Tesla has dwindled in value to around $100 billion. According to Morgan Stanley, Starlink could generate $16.3 billion in revenue this year, a 74 percent increase from $9.3 billion in 2024. The subscriber base, reported at 4.65 million in January, may nearly double to 7.8 million in the near term. By comparison, SpaceX’s rocket launch business is projected to make $5.8 billion in revenue in 2025, rising from $4.9 billion in the prior year. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said, “While it all began with market-leading launch capability, we believe Starlink will be the primary driver of SpaceX’s growth and profitability.” Starlink claims that it has a network of around 7,000 low-orbit satellites that connect distant corners of the world. Niger, for example, became the latest nation to gain access just last week. However, company insiders report that the bigger developments lie in negotiations with Turkey and Morocco, with the latter exploring an expansion of service into Western Sahara, a disputed territory. In Bangladesh, officials say Musk personally spoke with the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, in hopes of finalizing an operating license. These efforts build on Starlink’s progress in India , where deals were recently made with tycoons Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Mittal. Such partnerships are especially appealing in regions that are geographically difficult to serve. Airlines and maritime companies have also adopted Starlink, including Qatar Airways and Air France. However, Musk’s foray into political matters has presented drawbacks. Musk’s controversial statements and relations with Trump are proving to be a hurdle Musk’s labeling of certain South African Black economic empowerment rules as “openly racist” has caused friction over Starlink’s entry into his home country. Brazil saw a similar controversy over false information shared on Musk’s social media site, X, causing leaders there to consider a ban on Starlink at one point. The global tension grew more visible when Musk requested an urgent meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella to salvage a $1.5 billion deal with Italy’s government. The deal hit a snag after Trump suspended certain military aid and intelligence-sharing arrangements with Ukraine. Italy’s presidential palace refused a direct meeting, instead directing Starlink to work with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose administration holds the real authority in such matters. Around 40,000 terminals are operating in Ukraine’s military, hospital, business, and relief settings. SpaceX originally covered those costs, but they are now handled by Poland and the US Department of Defense. The Pentagon holds a $537 million contract with SpaceX through 2027 under the Proliferated Low Earth Orbit program, ensuring Ukraine’s forces keep receiving satellite coverage. Poland also chips in about $50 million annually to supply Starlink terminals, according to its digitization ministry. Musk’s remarks on X have at times sparked anxiety among Ukraine’s partners. He boasted that Starlink is the “backbone of the Ukrainian army,” adding that the front line would “collapse” without it. In response, Poland’s foreign minister Radosław Sikorski warned that relying so heavily on a single supplier might require Poland to find another provider if Starlink proved unreliable. I literally challenged Putin to one on one physical combat over Ukraine and my Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off. What I am sickened by is years of slaughter in a stalemate that Ukraine will… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 9, 2025 Musk fired back at Sikorski on X, telling him to “be quiet” and insisting that Poland pays only a fraction of Starlink’s overall cost. He then clarified that SpaceX would never disconnect Ukraine’s access or use the service as leverage. Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 9, 2025 Defense experts note that Europe may try to develop alternatives in light of Musk’s unpredictable statements. Still, no nation has banned Starlink outright. Analysts who follow the satellite industry see no slowdown for Starlink in the immediate future. Chris Quilty of Quilty Space says, “If a country banned access to Starlink, people would be at politicians with pitchforks.” Even in markets that have blocked government contracts or threatened to pull support, private citizens and businesses often find ways to use Starlink equipment bought elsewhere. Given the scarcity of reliable alternatives in rural or conflict-affected zones, local populations may pressure politicians to allow Starlink services, even if officials dislike Musk’s political connections.

According to analysts, those tokens won’t cost anything as the mutm’s tokenomics back a 200% return for the exchange listing at $0.06, with an end of phase prediction of a post launch token price of $1.50, giving a total 7,400% increase to the raise. Momentum On Mutuum Finance presale Meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and DogeCoin (DOGE) have been hot in recent months, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers utility that has shown signs of trouncing all of the other meme coins. Instead of focusing on social media hype like SHIB and DOGE do, MUTM offers a decentralized lending platform that allows users to lend, borrow and earn interest on mtTokens, and converts deposits to an interest-bearing asset. Such real-world utility stands in stark contrast to the speculative nature of meme coins, drawing in investors looking for sustainable returns. Urgency has been created for the presale’s phased structure, which rises in price incrementally, with third phase now filling very quickly in advance of an upcoming price rise. Phase four will yield a 25% profit for early participants who purchase tokens at $0.02 — in addition to the 200% baseline return at launch. Prospects for ROI and the Tokenomics Strategy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides One of the Most Calculable ROIs in the Crypto Market Tokens purchased during the current $0.02 presale will effectively be worth 200% more once they hit exchanges at $0.06. Analysts also predict the price could soar to $1.50 in the months after listing, boosted by the platform’s buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of platform revenue goes toward repurchasing MUTM tokens to be distributed to stakers, creating a continuous buy pressure and reducing sell-offs. For perspective, Investing $1,000 at phase three prices would reap you $3,000 at launch and over $75,000 if the token touches $1.50 and retains it. Safety and Forward Progress Mutuum Finance is concluding a smart contract audit with industry leader CertiK, the biggest blockchain security company, to confirm protocol integrity. Final results will be announced through official channels once completed, providing further reassurance to the investor base. Alongside the $100,000 presale giveaway — a campaign in which the ten selected participants will receive $10,000 each — the project is establishing itself as a serious competitor in the often cut-throat world of DeFi. With the crypto market’s evolution, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is acting as a bridge between speculative trading and real financial utility. Its presale success combined with predictable yields and a deflationary token model contrasts sharply with the fluctuations affecting Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). There is limited time left to get tokens as phase three is nearly a wrap and closing time fast. Investors are flocking to MUTM’s structured, utility-first approach, looking to replicate past meme coin gains, but without the risk. Time To Act Before Phase Three Ends Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the rare case of accessibility and high-growth potential. Not only do early participants register immediate benefits as presale phases progress, but they also enable themselves for blockbuster returns following the launch of the tokens. With more demand than supply, especially as the project approaches listings. Which is why, if you want to get in on the next giant DeFi breakout, your best bet may be to lock phase three down now and not wait.

42346588,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=718129,1742950813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42346588.jpeg,"Ethereum Forms Complex iH&S Structure, Why $18,000 Is The Possible Target",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-complex-ihs-structure/,"Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of a bullish breakout, forming a complex Inverse Head and Shoulder (iH&S) pattern on the weekly timeframe. This key technical formation suggests that the Ethereum price is on track for a massive rally toward a bullish target of $18,000. Ethereum Forms Inverse Head & Shoulder Pattern The Ethereum price has been in a long consolidation period, experiencing a crash amid the ongoing market turmoil. Despite recording massive declines that have pushed its value significantly below all-time highs, crypto analyst Gert van Lagen on X (formerly Twitter) predicts that ETH could still reach a price target of $18,000. Related Reading: “Ethereum Is Not Dead”: Broadening Wedge Suggests Another Leg-Up Is Coming Notably, Ethereum recently bounced off the $1,800 – $2,000 support range, which previously served as resistance during the ‘Head’ phase of the iH&S pattern. With this crucial retest confirmed, ETH may be entering the final stage of its reversal, set up to new all-time highs. Lagen’s $18,000 bullish target is more than 8X Ethereum’s current price, underscoring the sheer magnitude of this projection. Lagen has identified the formation of the iH&S structure on the Ethereum chart, supporting his ambitious prediction with this renowned bullish chart pattern. The Inverse Head and Shoulder is a classic bullish reversal structure, often signaling the end of a downtrend and the beginning of a strong and new uptrend. Considering the Ethereum’s price has been in a downturn, the formation of the iH&S chart pattern suggests that this prolonged decline may be finally coming to an end. In the analyst’s chart, this left shoulder of the iH&S structure began forming from 2021 to 2022, experiencing a price peak before a pullback. From 2022 to 2023, a deeper decline occurred, marking the cycle low and the formation of the ‘Head.’ Finally, the right shoulder of the technical pattern was formed between 2024 to 2024, recording a higher low that aligned with the left shoulder. Lagen’s price chart highlights that the most critical level to watch is the neckline of the iH&S structure, which is approximately $3,978 and acts as the primary resistance area. How An $18,000 ETH Target Is Possible Still looking at Lagen’s Ethereum price chart, the analyst suggests that if ETH can surpass the $3,978 resistance level with strong volume, it could validate the Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern and open the door for a rally toward $18,000. Conversely, if Ethereum fails to break above this resistance level, a prolonged consolidation or significant pullback may occur before its next breakout attempt. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Extremely Strong Support And Monthly 55 EMA Says ETH Is Headed For $4,867 Lagen predicts that a rejection at the resistance area could see the Ethereum price drop to $1,888 — an important support level which could prevent further declines. A drop to this support would represent a potential 52% dip from the main resistance level and an 8.52% decline from ETH’s current market value of $2,055.

Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just announced its support for Celo’s groundbreaking move to an Ethereum layer-2 network. This significant blockchain upgrade marks a new chapter for Celo, the carbon-negative platform focused on mobile accessibility. If you’re a Celo (CGLD) holder or a Coinbase user, this news is particularly relevant for you. Let’s dive into what this Celo Layer-2 Migration means, how it impacts you, and why it’s a crucial step forward for the Celo ecosystem. What is this Coinbase Celo Support all about? Coinbase’s announcement, delivered via X (formerly Twitter), confirms their commitment to supporting the Celo Layer-2 Migration . Essentially, Celo is evolving from being a standalone layer-1 blockchain to operating as a layer-2 solution built on top of Ethereum. This is a strategic move aimed at enhancing scalability, efficiency, and interoperability for the Celo network. To facilitate this transition smoothly, Coinbase will be performing a system upgrade. Here are the key details: Upgrade Timing: Scheduled for later today, starting at 8 p.m. Pacific Time (PT). Service Impact: Temporary suspension of CGLD token deposits and withdrawals during the upgrade period. Token Impact: Focus is on CGLD token as it is the native token of the Celo network. User Action: If you are a Coinbase user holding CGLD, be aware of this temporary suspension. No immediate action is required, but avoid initiating CGLD deposits or withdrawals during the specified time. Why is Celo Migrating to an Ethereum Layer-2? The move to an Ethereum Layer-2 network is a strategic decision by Celo, driven by several compelling benefits. Let’s explore the key reasons behind this blockchain upgrade : Enhanced Scalability: Layer-2 solutions are designed to offload transaction processing from the main Ethereum chain, thereby significantly increasing transaction throughput and reducing congestion. This means faster transactions and lower fees for Celo users in the long run. Leveraging Ethereum’s Security: By building on Ethereum, Celo benefits from the robust security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. Ethereum is the most established smart contract platform, and inheriting its security is a major advantage. Improved Interoperability: Being on Ethereum layer-2 enhances Celo’s interoperability within the broader Ethereum ecosystem. This opens up possibilities for easier integration with other Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols. Developer Ecosystem Growth: The Ethereum ecosystem boasts a massive and vibrant community of developers and tools. Migrating to layer-2 can attract more developers to build on Celo, further enriching its ecosystem and driving innovation. Future-Proofing Celo: Layer-2 solutions are seen as a crucial part of Ethereum’s scaling roadmap. By embracing this technology, Celo is positioning itself for long-term growth and relevance in the evolving crypto landscape. Think of it like this: Ethereum is the major highway, and Celo is moving from a smaller, parallel road to a faster lane on this highway. This allows Celo to handle more traffic (transactions) efficiently and connect more easily with other vehicles (dApps) on the same highway. What are the Benefits of Celo Layer-2 Migration? This Celo Layer-2 Migration brings a plethora of advantages to the Celo ecosystem and its users. Let’s break down the key benefits: Benefit Description Lower Transaction Fees Layer-2 solutions are renowned for significantly reducing transaction costs compared to layer-1. Users can expect cheaper transactions on the Celo network after the migration. Faster Transaction Speeds Increased transaction throughput on layer-2 translates to quicker transaction confirmations. This improves the user experience, especially for applications requiring fast and frequent transactions. Enhanced User Experience Faster and cheaper transactions contribute to a smoother and more user-friendly experience for interacting with Celo-based applications and services. Stronger Security Inheriting Ethereum’s security provides a more robust and reliable foundation for the Celo network, enhancing user confidence and trust. Greater Interoperability Seamless integration with the vast Ethereum ecosystem opens doors for new partnerships, collaborations, and opportunities for Celo within the broader crypto space. Environmental Sustainability (Continued) Celo’s commitment to being carbon-negative remains intact with the layer-2 migration. Ethereum’s ongoing transition to Proof-of-Stake further contributes to the overall sustainability of the ecosystem. Impact on CGLD Token and Coinbase Users For holders of CGLD Token and Coinbase users, the immediate impact is the temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals. This is a standard procedure during such upgrades to ensure the integrity of the process. Here’s what you need to know: Temporary Suspension: As mentioned, CGLD deposits and withdrawals will be paused on Coinbase starting at 8 p.m. PT today. No Action Required (Usually): Unless specifically instructed by Coinbase, users typically don’t need to take any action. Your CGLD holdings on Coinbase should be safe during the upgrade. Post-Upgrade Benefits: In the long run, the Ethereum Layer-2 migration is expected to benefit CGLD holders through a more robust, scalable, and efficient Celo network. This can potentially lead to increased adoption and value for the CGLD token. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Coinbase and Celo for any updates or specific instructions related to the upgrade. Looking Ahead: The Future of Celo and Layer-2 Solutions Celo’s decision to embrace Ethereum Layer-2 technology is a significant indicator of the evolving landscape of blockchain scalability. Layer-2 solutions are increasingly becoming vital for the growth and mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. By making this move, Celo is positioning itself at the forefront of this trend. This blockchain upgrade not only benefits Celo and its users but also contributes to the overall maturation of the crypto ecosystem. It demonstrates a commitment to innovation, scalability, and interoperability – key ingredients for the future of decentralized technologies. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Step for Celo Coinbase’s support for the Celo Layer-2 Migration is more than just a routine upgrade; it’s a revolutionary step that underscores Celo’s commitment to growth, scalability, and user experience. By joining the Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem, Celo is set to unlock new levels of performance, efficiency, and interoperability. For CGLD Token holders and the wider crypto community, this upgrade signals a positive trajectory for Celo and the continued evolution of blockchain technology towards a more scalable and accessible future.

According to multiple analysts, DOGE price is displaying a combination of technical indicators and structures that suggest the potential for a 10X rally. These include a breakout from a triangle pattern, a developing “cup and handle” formation, and historical pattern similarities to the 2017 bull market. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Chart Patterns Point to 10X Meme Coin Rally In a recent post on X, analyst Trader Tardigrade shared a chart showing the MACD indicator breaking out from a triangle formation. This setup has historically been linked with strong upward momentum in Dogecoin price. The MACD breakout is accompanied by a rounded bottom pattern, often seen as a preparatory phase before bullish moves. Notably, during previous instances in September and March, similar MACD triangle breakouts occurred. In both cases, the breakout led to a rapid acceleration in Dogecoin price. These historical movements suggest that the current meme coin rally may lead to a new all-time high. Source: X The MACD lines have crossed again in recent sessions, with the indicator moving above the triangle’s downtrend line. Analysts are observing similar conditions that were present during previous rallies. The upward curl in the price structure reinforces the breakout narrative. Meanwhile, following the recent move by House of Doge , market analysts are forecasting a 16% rise in Dogecoin price as bullish momentum builds. Cup and Handle Pattern Suggests Upside Toward $2.00 Additionally, according to Crypto Elites , DOGE price is forming a cup and handle pattern, a technical formation often associated with bullish continuation. The rounded bottom of the cup has already developed, and the handle phase is underway. This formation typically leads to a breakout once the price surpasses the neckline resistance. The key resistance level is positioned near $0.185. A confirmed break above this threshold could open the door to a sharp upward movement. Based on this chart pattern, the projected target is in the $1.85 to $2.00 range. The projection is calculated using the depth of the cup formation. Source: X However, the analyst noted that the current retracement to the handle’s lower range may act as a support zone. This area has historically been where momentum builds ahead of breakouts. Historical Behavior Resembling 2017 Cycle Concurrently, analyst KrissPax has identified similarities between the current Dogecoin price movement and the 2017 bull run. KrissPax posted a chart on X that compares both periods, showing the current phase aligning closely with the structure before DOGE price previous surge. According to the chart, the current meme coin cycle could extend beyond the previous all-time high. KrissPax projected that the top meme coin could rise to $4 if the second major breakout occurs, similar to the 2017 pattern. While this is a longer-term scenario, it is based on recurring patterns observed in past market cycles. A recent CoinGape report supports the bullish outlook on DOGE price, noting that a breakout above the $0.18 resistance could ignite a meme coin rally toward the $20 mark.

Meet Gemini 2.5 Pro, the latest family of AI reasoning models designed to think before it speaks (or codes!). This isn’t just another AI; Google claims it’s their most intelligent creation yet, poised to redefine benchmarks and set new standards in the industry. For crypto enthusiasts and tech innovators alike, understanding the advancements in AI, especially reasoning models, is crucial as it underpins many emerging technologies within the blockchain and decentralized spaces. Let’s dive deep into what makes Gemini 2.5 Pro a game-changer. What Makes Gemini 2.5 Pro the Next-Gen AI Reasoning Model? Imagine an AI that doesn’t just react but reasons. That’s the promise of AI reasoning models , and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking center stage. Unlike previous models, Gemini 2.5 Pro pauses to ‘think’ before generating a response. This crucial step involves: Fact-checking: Ensuring the information provided is accurate and reliable. Problem-solving: Analyzing complex queries to deliver well-reasoned answers. Contextual Understanding: Grasping the nuances of language and intent for more relevant outputs. This enhanced reasoning capability is not just a minor upgrade; it’s a fundamental shift that elevates AI performance to new heights. Google is making Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental available on its Google AI Studio developer platform and through the Gemini Advanced plan. This means developers and early adopters can immediately start experimenting with this cutting-edge technology. The Race for AI Reasoning Supremacy: Google vs. the Competition Since OpenAI launched its first AI reasoning model , o1, in September 2024, the tech world has been in a frenzy to catch up and surpass its capabilities. Now, key players like Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI are all in the ring, each with their own versions of reasoning AI. Why is this race so important? Improved Accuracy: Reasoning enhances the reliability of AI outputs, crucial for applications in finance, healthcare, and beyond. Complex Task Handling: Reasoning models excel in math, coding, and strategic problem-solving – tasks previously challenging for AI. Foundation for AI Agents: Many believe reasoning is the bedrock for creating autonomous AI agents capable of performing tasks with minimal human oversight. However, this leap in intelligence comes at a cost. AI reasoning models are computationally intensive and more expensive to run. Google’s Gemini 2.5 is their most ambitious attempt to outshine OpenAI’s o series, showcasing the fierce competition driving AI innovation. Gemini 2.5 Pro: Benchmarking AI Performance Google is making bold claims about Gemini 2.5 Pro’s AI performance , stating it outperforms both its previous models and leading competitors in several key benchmarks. Let’s break down some of these claims: Benchmark Gemini 2.5 Pro Score Comparison Significance Aider Polyglot (Code Editing) 68.6% Outperforms top models from OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek Highlights superior code editing capabilities, crucial for software development. SWE-bench Verified (Software Dev) 63.8% Outperforms OpenAI’s o3-mini & DeepSeek’s R1, underperforms Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet (70.3%) Shows strong software development abilities, competitive but not leading in all aspects. Humanity’s Last Exam (Multimodal) 18.8% Better than most rival flagship models Demonstrates strong performance in a broad range of knowledge domains (math, humanities, sciences). These benchmarks suggest that Gemini 2.5 Pro is a formidable contender, especially in code-related tasks and broad knowledge understanding. However, the competitive landscape remains dynamic, with different models excelling in different areas. Unleashing the Power of Context: The 1 Million Token Context Window One of the most impressive features of Gemini 2.5 Pro is its massive context window . At launch, it boasts a 1 million token context window, capable of processing approximately 750,000 words in a single input. To put this into perspective, that’s longer than the entire ‘Lord of The Rings’ series! And Google isn’t stopping there; they plan to double this to 2 million tokens soon. What does this mean for users? Enhanced Understanding: The model can retain and process vast amounts of information, leading to more coherent and contextually relevant responses. Complex Document Analysis: Imagine summarizing lengthy research papers, analyzing extensive codebases, or even drafting entire books. Gemini 2.5 Pro’s context window makes this feasible. Improved AI Agents: For AI agents, a large context window means better memory and the ability to handle long, complex tasks more effectively. This expanded context window is a significant leap forward, potentially unlocking new applications and capabilities for AI models. Pricing and Availability: What to Expect Currently, Google has not released specific API pricing details for Gemini 2.5 Pro. They have indicated that more information will be shared in the coming weeks. For now, access is available through Google AI Studio and the Gemini Advanced subscription. Keep an eye out for updates as pricing details will be crucial for developers and businesses looking to integrate this powerful AI reasoning model into their projects. Conclusion: A Giant Leap for AI… and Beyond? Google’s unveiling of Gemini 2.5 Pro marks a significant milestone in the evolution of AI. With its enhanced reasoning capabilities, impressive performance benchmarks, and massive context window, it’s clear that Google is serious about leading the charge in AI innovation. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, advancements like these in AI reasoning models are incredibly relevant. AI is increasingly being used for smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi) risk assessment, and even predicting market trends. As AI becomes more intelligent and context-aware, its integration into blockchain technologies promises to unlock even more sophisticated and efficient solutions.

BTFD Coin’s $0.0002 Entry and LAUNCH100 Bonus Might Be Your Second Chance,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-not-grabbing-pudgy-penguins-early-btfd-coins-0-0002-entry-and-launch100-bonus-might-be-your-second-chance/,"They say hindsight’s 20/20—especially in crypto. If you’re one of the thousands who watched Pudgy Penguins soar and thought, “I should’ve bought in early,” you’re definitely not alone. From meme NFTs to a booming brand with toys in stores and a token that’s making waves, Pudgy Penguins built one of the most surprising success stories of the meme coin world. And for those who caught that launch? They’re now sitting pretty. But if you didn’t ape in when $PENGU was just getting started, don’t stress—it’s not game over. In fact, a new door just swung wide open. BTFD Coin, one of the best new meme coins to join this week , is making noise with a real Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a staking program with jaw-dropping 90% APY, and an active referral system pulling in Bulls by the thousands. And the best part? It’s still in presale at just $0.0002 per coin, with the LAUNCH100 bonus code giving buyers a full 2x token reward until March 30, 2025. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a full-on ecosystem with actual utility and a real shot at delivering massive gains. And if you’re into second chances, this is the one you’ve been waiting for. BTFD Coin’s Live P2E Game Puts It Among the Best New Meme Coins to Join This Week Let’s cut to the chase—what really sets BTFD Coin apart is the game. Not a “coming soon” promise. Not a vague roadmap. But a fully live Play-to-Earn game that launched on January 1st, 2025, and is already rewarding players who suit up and charge into the Bull Run arena. This isn’t passive holding. This is earn-as-you-play, and it’s addictively fun. Early users are already seeing returns. One gamer turned their first week into thousands of tokens, then staked them for compounding growth. With the staking program offering 90% APY, it’s one of the best new meme coins to join this week for anyone looking to build both short-term gains and long-term momentum. You’re not just buying a token—you’re stepping into a full-blown meme coin presale ecosystem where your investment works while you play. Then there’s the Bulls Squad, a community of over 11,500 holders who aren’t just bullish—they’re building. The referral program lets users invite friends and earn extra tokens, turning every tweet or text into a potential payday. With over 71 billion tokens sold and $6.41 million raised, this isn’t your average meme coin presale. This project isn’t whispering—it’s roaring, and the community’s energy is off the charts. And here’s where things get juicy. If you put in $5,000 at today’s meme coin presale price of $0.0002, you’re scoring 25 million $BTFD tokens. That’s not just a nice number—if the coin hits its projected listing price of $0.0006, you’re sitting on $15,000. And if the buzz around its $0.006 moon price proves true? That flips to $150,000. That’s the kind of math that made Pudgy Penguin holders rich—and this time, you could be ahead of the curve. What seals the deal? The LAUNCH100 bonus code, which literally doubles your tokens during Stage 15. Buy 1 million tokens? You get 2 million. But only if you act fast—March 30th is the cutoff. Miss this meme coin presale opportunity, and the bonus disappears for good. So how do you get started? Just go to the BTFD Coin presale site and connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet both work). Fund it with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Enter LAUNCH100 in the promo box in all caps, choose your amount, and confirm the transaction. You’ll get your tokens at the end of the presale—and your crypto game will never be the same. This is why BTFD Coin is topping every list of the best new meme coins to join this week—because it delivers utility, rewards, community, and upside all in one. Pudgy Penguins: A Missed Launch That Created Massive Gains Pudgy Penguins began as a wholesome NFT project built around adorable, ice-loving cartoon birds. But what started as an art project quickly turned into a movement. Community members built memes, merch, even brand partnerships. And once the $PENGU token dropped, it didn’t take long for it to soar. The Penguins became more than just collectibles—they became a cultural icon. They made headlines in both crypto and mainstream circles. $PENGU got traction, exchanges picked it up, and early backers cashed in. That rise made Pudgy Penguins one of the biggest “why didn’t I buy it early?” stories of the year. But let’s be honest—most people didn’t buy early. They watched the buzz, hesitated, and then watched the price take off. And now? They’re on the hunt for the best new meme coins to join this week—something with real upside and a better entry point. Enter BTFD Coin. Conclusion: This Time, Be the One Who Bought Early Let’s not sugarcoat it—you probably missed the early boat on Pudgy Penguins. That train left the station, and it took a lot of big wins with it. But the beauty of the crypto world? There’s always another launch, another shot, another chance to get in before the masses. BTFD Coin is that chance. It’s got the community, the staking, the bonus, and best of all—a fully functional game already live and paying out. With a presale price of just $0.0002, a potential moon price of $0.006, and the LAUNCH100 code giving you double tokens until March 30th, this is hands-down one of the best new meme coins to join this week. No more second-guessing. No more could-have-beens. This is the one. Make the move and join BTFD Coin’s presale before this chance becomes another “I should’ve.” FAQs Why is BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join this week? Because it offers more than hype—BTFD Coin has a live Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY staking, and a referral program, all while being in presale at $0.0002 with a moon target of $0.006. How do I claim the LAUNCH100 bonus code with BTFD Coin? Go to the presale site, connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in all caps in the promo field, then confirm your purchase. The bonus doubles your token amount instantly. Is BTFD Coin still available for presale? Yes! It’s currently in Stage 15, priced at $0.0002, with over $6.41 million raised, 71 billion tokens sold, and 11,500 holders joining what’s easily one of the best new meme coins to join this week.

This settlement marks a likely end to the long legal battle that has been ongoing since the SEC sued Ripple in 2020 over the sale of XRP tokens, which it claimed were unregistered securities. As part of the deal, the SEC has also requested that Judge Analisa Torres lift the “obey the law” injunction that had been placed on Ripple, which was part of the earlier ruling. With this agreement, Ripple will recover $75 million from escrow, while the SEC will retain $50 million.

The long-standing case has been a major point of contention in the cryptocurrency world, with Ripple consistently arguing that the SEC’s actions were more about intimidation than protecting investors. Garlinghouse opened up about the financial harm caused by the lawsuit, saying that the legal proceedings had potentially wiped out up to $15 billion in value for XRP holders.

Trading at $8.04 at press time, BeraChain crypto has witnessed an impressive 38.2% surge over the past week, catapulting it into the top 100 by market cap, with a valuation of $864 million. The Berachain Network PoL system The BeraChain mainnet first roared to life in February with a $1.17 billion BeraChain airdrop, rewarding early participants who engaged in pre-launch activities. That initial phase, however, was constrained to BEX, the native decentralized exchange, leaving room for broader growth. Now, with the PoL system live, the Berachain Network is opening new doors that enhance the BeraChain TVL and incentivize participation. Unlike traditional PoS, where users stake directly with validators, PoL encourages staking in DeFi liquidity pools to earn BGT, the governance token of the BeraChain ecosystem. Validators stake BERA, the utility token of BeraChain, to secure the network and propose blocks, earning BGT that flows into reward vaults, which can be swapped for BERA at a 1:1 ratio, though irreversibly. The BeraChain launch of PoL has unleashed 37 whitelisted reward vaults, initially focused on DEX liquidity pools like those on BEX, Kodiak, and Beradrome. Berachain Foundation 🐻⛓ @berachain · Follow Replying to @berachain 37 new reward vaults are now live, distributing BGT emissions across the ecosystem.See the full list here: blog.berachain.com/blog/berachain… 9:09 pm · 24 Mar 2025 99 Reply Copy link Read 2 replies These vaults, vetted for economic value, security, and synergy with the BeraChain ecosystem, pair major tokens such as BERA, HONEY, USDC, and wETH to maximize liquidity depth. The Berachain token’s role in these pools has fueled trading activity, with a 24-hour volume of $165.9 million. Beyond DEXes, the network plans to expand into real-world assets, gaming, and more, with a second batch of vaults up for review by March 27th. This scalability positions the BeraChain mainnet as a hub for diverse dApps, from BeraChain swaps to potential BeraChain NFTs. Notably, governance is a cornerstone of the PoL system, with BGT holders now wielding influence over the Berachain Network’s direction. The BeraChain airdrop laid the foundation, but PoL decentralizes control, letting the community dictate incentive flows. Validators supply liquidity to vaults, receiving receipt tokens that can also be staked, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. This innovative approach has elevated the BeraChain crypto’s appeal, drawing builders and users eager to tap into a permissionless ecosystem. As pseudonymous founder Homme Bera noted, this is a major step in the network’s evolution, promising sustainable growth. Looking forward, the Berachain Network’s roadmap inspires confidence. The upcoming review of additional vaults next week could broaden its scope, potentially boosting the BeraChain price further. With the PoL launch having already pushed BeraChain crypto into the top 100, it has ignited speculation about the effects of the next milestones.

This move aligns the company with a growing number of publicly traded firms choosing to hold bitcoin as part of their financial strategy. Along with its fourth-quarter earnings report, GameStop revealed that its board has unanimously decided to add bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. This allows the company to hold digital assets on its balance sheet, signaling a shift in its treasury management and aligning with its evolving financial strategy. GME Surges Over 5% This announcement gained attention earlier in February when CEO Ryan Cohen posted a photo of himself with Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy (MSTR), at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, sparking curiosity about the company’s future plans in the crypto space. By the end of 2024, GameStop reported $5.355 billion in current assets but didn’t specify how much of this would be used for Bitcoin purchases. The news led to a 5.9% increase in GME shares during after-hours trading. Matt Cole Urges Gamestop To Adopt BTC Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Asset Management, an investment firm co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy previously called on GameStop to adopt bitcoin as a reserve asset. In a letter to Ryan Cohen, GameStop’s Chairman and CEO, on February 24, Cole argued that with nearly $5 billion in cash reserves, GameStop has a unique chance to transform itself into a market leader. Strive Asset Management’s clients own GameStop shares through the firm’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Cole also mentioned that Strive holds GameStop stock across three different ETFs but did not share how much stock the firm owns. “We believe GameStop has an incredible opportunity to transform its financial future by becoming the premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector,” Cole wrote. Cohen further fueled the speculation when he tweeted , “Letter received,” in response to Cole’s suggestion. Growing Trend Of Companies Pursuing BTC Strategy The letter follows previous reports from that GameStop is considering investing in alternative assets, including bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The suggestion in the letter aligns with moves already made by companies like MicroStrategy, Semler Scientific, and MARA Holdings. Cole praised GameStop for closing unprofitable stores and publicly rejecting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.

He said that investing in digital coins involves “a very high risk that you could lose all your money.” In explaining why this matters, Rathi shared that the number of Britons owning shares directly is much lower than in places like the United States or Sweden. He told MPs on Tuesday that 38 percent of US citizens hold equities, while in Sweden, the figure is more than 20 percent. By contrast, far fewer people in the UK own shares, especially younger citizens, who seem drawn to alternative assets like bitcoin. Rathi added, “We have also evolved a particular approach to risk and compensation in the UK, which perhaps isn’t matched in other parts of the world.” UK’s FCA wants young Britains to consider ‘mainstream investments’ The FCA’s new five-year plan, presented on Tuesday, focuses on four key objectives, one of which is helping consumers make better financial decisions. The authority will track how many people with more than £10,000 of investible assets choose to place their money in what it calls “mainstream investments” by 2030. Rathi told the committee that one of his concerns is “the sheer number of under 35-year-olds for whom the financial product that they invest in first is crypto — several million in the UK.” Currently, the UK’s crypto market is largely unregulated. Companies handling crypto transactions only need to register with the FCA to show they follow anti-money laundering rules. The government, however, intends to introduce legislation that would create a specific regulatory framework for crypto businesses. Last year, the FCA estimated that about 12 percent of UK adults owned crypto assets. That equates to roughly 7 million people, with men under 35 most likely to borrow money to fund their coin purchases, according to a YouGov survey of nearly 2,200 adults. Rathi linked the country’s low level of share ownership to “a mix of tax, education, regulation and broader culture in our country.” He emphasized that the question of risk and compensation is not the FCA’s responsibility alone. “We have also evolved a particular approach to risk and compensation in the UK, which perhaps isn’t matched in other parts of the world,” he said. Under the new plan, the FCA pledges to “deepen trust, rebalance risk, support growth and improve lives.” While the regulator has been criticized in the past for holding back innovation and investment, several industry figures gave the new strategy a careful endorsement. The authority will use AI to act ‘more efficiently and effectively’ A central part of the new approach is making more use of technology, including artificial intelligence, to help the FCA act “more efficiently and effectively.” The agency also aims to crack down further on financial crime, stressing that it will focus “on those who seek to use the fact they are regulated to do harm.” Also on Tuesday, the authority announced plans to simplify its extensive set of regulations by removing over 100 pages devoted to consumer finance, investments, and mortgage lending. This change was set in motion after Chancellor Rachel Reeves revealed a “radical action plan to cut red tape,” intending to reduce regulatory costs for businesses by 25 percent. The FCA’s rule book is currently longer than 10,000 pages, and the goal is to make it less burdensome for legitimate operators while keeping protections in place for the public. James Daley, who heads the research group Fairer Finance, expressed worry about the direction of these proposals. “The general direction of travel is worrying,” he said. He believes the regulator is under political pressure to reduce the regulation burden but argues that some of these changes “would be a step backwards.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

But the tides are shifting. While these tokens have built strong communities, their price action has been frustrating, with long periods of stagnation. Now, a growing number of Shiba Inu and DOGE holders are making a calculated move into an AI-driven altcoin; RCO Finance . Let’s dive into why investors are making the switch. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Holders Are Looking for the Next Big Opportunity Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have given their holders some wild rides over the years, but the market has not been kind to meme coin investors lately. Shiba Inu , which once seemed unstoppable, has been stuck in a macro downtrend since its peak. While recent movements suggest a potential breakout, the token still faces a critical resistance range between $0.00001450 and $0.00001550. A breakthrough could send it climbing, but another rejection could push it back toward support at $0.00001269. Dogecoin isn’t faring much better. The token is trying to push past $0.19, but the selling pressure is heavy. If it fails to clear this level, there’s a strong chance of another drop, possibly as low as $0.10. On the flip side, breaking past $0.29 could restore confidence, but given the current trend, that seems like an uphill battle. For Shiba Inu and Dogecoin holders, this kind of uncertainty is frustrating. That’s why they are making a strategic move into RCO Finance because it’s still in its early stages, has practical applications, and could be on the verge of an explosive run. This AI-Driven Altcoin Is Outshining Meme Coins RCO Finance is designed to help investors make smarter moves with its AI-powered Robo Advisor. This is an advanced, real-time AI system that processes data from leading financial sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, spotting market trends before they go mainstream. For instance, a new altcoin is quietly gaining traction, similar to how Shiba Inu exploded in its early days. Most traders don’t notice it yet, but RCOF’s AI does. It recognizes unusual trading patterns, increasing volume, and early whale accumulation. With a single alert, you’re in early, buying before the masses. A month later, that same token has surged 100x, and your $500 investment is now worth $50,000; all because you had the right data at the right time. The AI also protects your investments. Let’s say a market downturn is looming. It triggers an automated sell-off, securing your profits before the crash. Beyond trading, RCO Finance allows users to diversify into 120,000+ assets, including stocks, ETFs, bonds, and tokenized real estate, all on the same platform. It’s also entirely KYC-free, meaning no invasive verification processes. And the RCOF debit cards let you use your holdings in real life without the hassle of converting them to fiat first. RCOF Presale Is Gaining Traction with Early Buyers RCOF has already proven itself. Unlike most presale projects, it has a fully operational Beta Platform with over 10,000 active users testing its core features. And this is just the beginning; while the beta is live, the upcoming Alpha phase promises even more powerful upgrades, currently in internal testing. The presale is already in its 5th stage, with the token selling at $0.10. Once it moves to the next stage, the price will rise to $0.13; a guaranteed 30% gain in just a few weeks. With over $14 million raised so far, the momentum is undeniable, and the price will only go up from here. A $1,000 investment at the current stage would turn into $1,300 when the next stage kicks in. If it follows the same trajectory as other successful AI-driven projects, early buyers could see their holdings multiply 50x or even 100x. That same $1,000 could easily become $100,000. Security is also a top priority. RCOF has undergone a full audit by SolidProof , one of the most reputable blockchain security firms. The audit confirmed no vulnerabilities, meaning investors can participate with confidence. Meme Coins Had Their Moment but the Future Belongs to AI Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have cemented their place in crypto history, but their best days might be behind them. At their peak, they delivered jaw-dropping returns, but today, their growth is nowhere near what it once was because they’re established. And without continuous waves of hype, their momentum is fading. RCOF , on the other hand, is just getting started. It’s new, meaning early adoption is happening fast, and as more investors discover its AI-driven advantages, its growth will accelerate even further. Investors who got in during the earlier presale stages have already seen their holdings grow, and those who wait too long will find themselves paying significantly higher prices. Joining in the next stage alone means missing out on an easy 30% gain, and waiting until it hits exchanges could mean missing out on 100x potential.

Among the players making waves this year are Qubetics , Tezos, and VeChain, three blockchain projects that have distinct features setting them apart from the rest. If you’ve been following the crypto space closely, you’ll know how fast things change, but these three coins seem to be going the distance in different ways. Whether it’s groundbreaking real-world applications, cutting-edge tokenomics, or smart contract capabilities, they all have unique offerings that demand attention. Tezos has long been a fan favorite for its innovative proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while VeChain continues to make strides in supply chain solutions. And then, there’s Qubetics—a rising star with a fresh approach to the tokenization of real-world assets, making it easy for businesses, professionals, and individuals to embrace the future of finance. While each of these cryptos brings something different to the table, one thing is certain: they are all poised to make a big impact on the digital finance landscape. Let’s break down the key features of each of these top 3 cryptos—Qubetics, Tezos, and VeChain—and explore what makes them tick in 2025. From Qubetics’ Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace to VeChain’s efforts to streamline supply chains, each has a critical role to play in the future of blockchain. Qubetics ($TICS) – Revolutionizing Real World Asset Tokenization Qubetics has been turning heads with its innovative approach to blockchain technology, particularly through its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. Unlike other platforms, Qubetics is designed to simplify the process for businesses, professionals, and individuals looking to tokenize real-world assets. Think of it as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, offering a smooth and secure way to digitize physical assets for trade or investment purposes. At the heart of Qubetics lies its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, which aims to break down the barriers that have traditionally kept smaller businesses and individuals out of the crypto space. By making it easier to tokenize assets such as real estate, commodities, or even intellectual property, Qubetics is providing a user-friendly interface that opens up new avenues for decentralized finance (DeFi). The ease of access, transparency, and security are what set Qubetics apart from other blockchain projects in the space. Qubetics Presale Surpasses Milestones – A Look at the Exciting 2025 Opportunity Over 503 million $TICS tokens sold across 23,700+ holders Raised more than $15.4 million in presale funds Currently in its 27th stage, with tokens priced at $0.1300 Analysts predict up to 11,436% ROI once the mainnet launches Qubetics emerges as one of the most exciting crypto projects of 2025 Latest News: $TICS token gaining momentum as it enters final presale stages Aggressive roadmap leading up to the mainnet launch Qubetics is building lasting value, not just riding hype Crypto Presale success reflects strong trust in the platform Growing demand for real-world asset tokenization is evident Tezos Launches Etherlink and Announces Major Upgrades Tezos continues to solidify its position as a leading self-upgradable and energy-efficient Proof of Stake blockchain. Recent developments include the launch of Etherlink, a Layer-2 solution built on Tezos technology, which successfully completed its public beta and is now officially production-ready. During ETHDenver 2025, Etherlink’s team announced a substantial incentive program, allocating $3 million in rewards to attract and retain users, further enhancing the Tezos ecosystem’s scalability and efficiency. ​ In addition to technological advancements, Tezos has seen significant community engagement, with the Tezos Commons providing monthly overviews of ecosystem milestones. The February 2025 report highlighted key achievements, including important protocol upgrades like Oxford and Paris C, the announcement of Tezos X, and the launch of Etherlink. These developments underscore Tezos’s commitment to continuous improvement and innovation within the blockchain space. ​ VeChain Enhances Supply Chain Transparency ​VeChain (VET) continues to make strides in blockchain-based supply chain solutions. The platform’s ongoing developments and strategic initiatives have positioned it as a significant player in enhancing transparency and efficiency across various industries. Recent analyses suggest that VeChain’s market presence remains robust, with its token trading within a specific range, reflecting a period of consolidation. ​ Community engagement plays a pivotal role in VeChain’s evolution. The recent Galactica Vote, held from February 25 to March 4, 2025, was a critical event for VeChain and associated tokens. This vote aimed to set the stage for significant upgrades, encouraging community participation that could influence VeChain’s strategic direction and long-term success. Positive outcomes from such initiatives are expected to bolster participants confidence and potentially drive adoption. Understanding the Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace Tokenizing real-world assets opens up incredible opportunities for individuals, businesses, and professionals to interact with a variety of asset types in a decentralized way. It allows for fractional ownership, meaning that high-value assets such as real estate, art, or commodities can be broken down into smaller, more affordable tokens. This makes it easier for anyone to participate in asset markets that were once out of reach. For Qubetics, this focus on real-world asset tokenization is a game-changer. It provides a transparent, secure, and easy-to-use platform for asset tokenization. What sets Qubetics apart is the combination of its seamless marketplace with an emphasis on bringing liquidity to assets that traditionally have been illiquid. By digitizing assets and allowing them to be traded, Qubetics opens up a whole new world of opportunities for both seasoned professionals and newcomers alike. Whether it’s real estate, intellectual property, or even commodities, the potential of asset tokenization is just beginning to unfold. Conclusion: Top 3 Cryptos to Buy Now The Top 3 Cryptos —Qubetics, Tezos, and VeChain—are making big waves in the blockchain world this year.

The NCIA would have oversight over state funds and investment strategies, including the option to invest up to 5% of the funds under its control in digital assets. The 2025 State Investment Modernization Act was introduced into the House on March 24 and the Senate on March 25. The bills were introduced by Republican sponsors, making North Carolina the 19th state to have Bitcoin-related proposals in front of its legislature. The bills create a new investment agency Under the bills (H506 and S709), the NCIA would have oversight of funds including retirement systems, general funds, and special funds. It would be made up of a five-member board headed by the state treasurer, who will select the remaining members on the basis of their expertise. The NCIA board will choose a chief investment officer who will be responsible for day-to-day operations and staffing. The bills also provide greater flexibility for choosing assets, including digital assets with a 5% cap, and exempt the NCIA from some state regulations. At the same time, it introduces new governance requirements regarding transparency and the handling of illiquid investments. The NCIA would be formed by July 1 and begin full operation on Jan. 1, 2026. The bills are competing with other bills proposing 10% funds allocation Different bills on digital asset investment ( H92 and S327 ) were introduced into the chambers of the North Carolina legislature in February. Those bills would allow up to 10% of funds to be invested in digital assets. The Senate bill would create a Bitcoin Economic Advisory Board and require the approval of two-thirds of the General Assembly for the liquidation of Bitcoin holdings. The bills would also restrict investable digital assets to exchange-traded funds or assets with a market cap of over $750 billion. Only Bitcoin meets the market cap requirement. These bills were also introduced unilaterally by Republicans. House Speaker Destin Hall endorsed H92. “Today, I filed HB 92, The North Carolina Digital Assets Investments Act, to authorize the NC State Treasurer to invest in qualifying digital assets like #Bitcoin — aligning with President Trump’s vision for a national Bitcoin stockpile and ensuring North Carolina leads at the state level,” Hall wrote on X on Feb. 10. Trump issued an executive order creating a federal Bitcoin reserve on March 7. The bills faced some opposition, with the State Employees Association of North Carolina speaking out against it, for example. “Retirees do not like the conversation about investing in this highly volatile currency. Past, present, and future state employees are taxpayers, and their promised benefits should not be played with,” a spokesman for that organization said . Those bills are now in committee. North Carolina passed an anti-central bank digital currency (CBDC) law in September, overturning a veto by the then-governor to do so. The law prohibits the state from participating in the testing of a CBDC. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State in May. The Senate companion version in is the Banking Committee. Federal Reserve has repeatedly stated that it will not issue a CBDC without a Congressional mandate.

Infinite Reality said in a March 25 statement that Napster would offer “branded 3D virtual spaces” to allow virtual concerts and “social listening parties” along with the ability to offer virtual merchandise. “Imagine stepping into a virtual venue to watch an exclusive show with friends, chat with your favorite artist in their own virtual hangout as they drop their new single, and be able to directly buy their exclusive digital and physical merch,” said Napster CEO Jon Vlassopulos, who will continue in his role amid the acquisition. “The internet has evolved from desktop to mobile, from mobile to social, and now we are entering the immersive era,” he added.

Napster’s latest repurposing Napster was a pioneer in piracy, launching in 1999 as a peer-to-peer (P2P) filing-sharing service mostly for music. It shuttered in 2001, buried by a court order after a wave of copyright infringement lawsuits. The now-bankrupt company sold its brand, which was relaunched as a music-streaming service before bouncing between owners for the next 20 years. The blockchain firm Algorand and crypto investment firm Hivemind most recently bought it in 2022. Related: Here’s what musicians actually think of tokenizing content in Web3 Napster had made several moves in the Web3 space, announcing plans in June 2022 to launch its own Napster token on the Algorand blockchain that could be used to buy music subscriptions and other content.

Source: Napster John Acunto, co-founder and CEO of Infinite Reality, said the team hopes to lead an “internet industry shift from a flat 2D clickable web to a 3D conversational one.” Infinite Reality says the acquisition of Napster is slated to close in a few weeks.

Attorney Fred Rispoli quickly reacted to Alderoty’s post, expressing both frustration and sympathy for the SEC attorneys who worked tirelessly on the case. He pointed out that, after investing thousands of hours, making personal sacrifices, and being away from their families, the case has now been resolved swiftly, which he describes as their hard work being “wiped out in an instant.” However some X users commented that the real victims are the Ripple team and XRP holders, who suffered through years of stress and financial losses due to the lawsuit.

After years of intense scrutiny and market-moving headlines, both parties have signaled a move towards finality, agreeing to drop their respective appeals. This breakthrough development marks a potentially pivotal moment for Ripple, XRP, and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Let’s dive into the details of this landmark settlement and what it means for the future. Ripple SEC Settlement: A Major Milestone Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderotti, took to X (formerly Twitter) to announce the significant progress in the Ripple SEC settlement . In a concise update, Alderotti revealed that both Ripple and the SEC have agreed to dismiss their appeals in the ongoing legal saga. This decision signifies a mutual desire to finalize the matter and move forward, avoiding further protracted legal proceedings. This move towards resolution has been keenly watched by the crypto community, given the case’s implications for crypto regulation and the precedent it could set. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key terms of the proposed settlement: Appeals Dropped: Both Ripple and the SEC will withdraw their appeals, effectively accepting the current court rulings as the basis for settlement. Fine Adjustment: The SEC will retain $50 million of the original $125 million penalty imposed on Ripple. This means a substantial $75 million will be returned to Ripple. Injunction Lift Request: The SEC will request the court to remove a previously imposed injunction against Ripple. This is a crucial aspect, potentially freeing up Ripple from certain operational constraints. It’s important to note that while this agreement is a significant step, finalization is still contingent upon several procedural steps. These include a vote by the Commissioners at the SEC, approval from the court overseeing the case, and adherence to standard legal procedures. While these are formalities, they are necessary to make the settlement legally binding. Why is the XRP Lawsuit Settlement a Big Deal? The XRP lawsuit has been a dark cloud hanging over Ripple and the entire cryptocurrency market for years. Initiated in December 2020, the SEC alleged that Ripple’s sales of XRP constituted unregistered securities offerings. The case has been complex, involving intricate legal arguments and numerous court rulings. A settlement at this stage carries substantial weight for several reasons: Clarity for Ripple: Settlement provides Ripple with much-needed clarity regarding its regulatory standing in the U.S. market. Ending the legal uncertainty allows Ripple to focus more decisively on its business operations and future growth strategies. Positive Signal for XRP: The resolution is widely perceived as a positive development for XRP. The reduced legal risk could boost investor confidence and potentially positively impact the XRP price in the market. Broader Crypto Implications: This case has been a bellwether for crypto regulation in the United States. A settlement could signal a potential shift in the SEC’s approach towards enforcement and regulation within the crypto space. It might also offer a template for resolving similar disputes involving other crypto projects. Reduced Financial Burden: Dropping appeals saves both Ripple and the SEC further legal costs and resource expenditure. For Ripple, recovering a significant portion of the fine is a tangible financial benefit. Decoding the SEC Lawsuit and its Twists and Turns The SEC lawsuit against Ripple has been anything but straightforward. It has involved numerous legal arguments, expert testimonies, and court decisions. Understanding the key milestones helps appreciate the significance of this settlement agreement: Milestone Description Initial Filing (Dec 2020) SEC files lawsuit against Ripple, alleging XRP is a security. Summary Judgment Rulings (July 2023) Judge Analisa Torres rules that programmatic sales of XRP are not securities, but institutional sales are. This was seen as a partial victory for Ripple. Appeals Filed Both SEC and Ripple file appeals against different aspects of the summary judgment ruling. Settlement Agreement (May 2024) Ripple and SEC agree to drop appeals and finalize settlement terms. The partial victory for Ripple in the summary judgment, particularly the ruling on programmatic sales not being securities, was a critical turning point. This ruling has been influential in shaping the regulatory discourse around crypto assets. The current settlement appears to build upon this foundation, seeking to conclude the protracted legal battle amicably. What Happens Next? Key Steps to Finalization While the agreement to settle is a major leap forward, several steps remain before the Ripple SEC settlement becomes fully effective: SEC Commission Vote: The proposed settlement needs to be put to a vote before the Commissioners of the SEC. While Alderotti’s announcement suggests agreement, formal Commission approval is still required. Court Approval: The court overseeing the case must also approve the settlement terms. Judicial approval is necessary to ensure the settlement is fair and legally sound. Legal Procedures: Standard legal procedures for finalizing settlements, such as documentation and filings, will need to be completed. Injunction Lift: The SEC must formally request the court to lift the injunction previously imposed. The timing and process for this will depend on court procedures. The timeline for these steps can vary, but given the mutual agreement and public announcements, the process is expected to move relatively smoothly. The crypto community will be closely watching for updates and official confirmations in the coming days and weeks. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Ripple and Crypto Regulation? The agreement between Ripple and the SEC to settle their long-standing legal dispute marks a significant and potentially transformative moment. For Ripple, it signifies the end of a major chapter of uncertainty and opens the door to renewed focus on innovation and expansion. For the broader cryptocurrency industry, this breakthrough settlement could offer valuable insights into navigating regulatory complexities and engaging with authorities like the SEC. While the specifics of future crypto regulation remain to be seen, the Ripple case and its resolution will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping the landscape for years to come. The markets are reacting positively, and the hope is that this settlement paves the way for more clarity and constructive dialogue between regulators and the burgeoning crypto industry.

According to his analysis, the coin may grow more than 12 times its current value if it follows previous cycle patterns. During the ongoing third cycle, numerous investors follow Dogecoin to observe its potential reach higher. Another analyst through X predicted Dogecoin price would experience future price growth with potential peaks ahead. A price history chart for Dogecoin spans from 2014 to 2025, according to a tweet published by Trader Tardigrade. The provided chart demonstrates an increasing price trend with important marks shown as red arrows that represent major price shifts. The analyst indicates that the cryptocurrency has a strong potential for substantial growth throughout the upcoming years. Dogecoin traders should track current patterns since such data may indicate future price increases for the digital currency. Will DOGE Price Hit $0.3 By This Week As Bullish Gain Momentum? The price of DOGE has experienced a significant upward trend to reach $0.1833 while demonstrating a 5% rise throughout the last day. The current market momentum shows increasing potential due to the BTC price remaining above $88k and ETH above $2k. The market continues to climb after meme coins increased in volume while investors speculate about a DOGE ETF. Dogecoin price stands at resistance points that became significant obstacles in its price action. The price currently encounters resistance of nearly $0.21 as this point becomes vital to sustaining optimistic market trends. Breaking this resistance level may trigger DOGE to explore new key points at $0.22 before potentially reaching $0.25 in the upcoming months. If DOGE reaches $0.3 it could experience a 60% increase. An analysis of the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) shows 0.19 as its current value, which represents a positive movement of funds for DOGE. The MACD indicator shows an upward trend as it crosses the signal line from below. An upward movement of Dogecoin price may continue based on the existing trend pattern. The downside support for Dogecoin exists at $0.17 and $0.15 which bears could force Dogecoin price prediction to reach those levels. Source: TradingView To sum up, The third generation of the Dogecoin price shows promising signs for reaching the $3 level. The present market conditions indicate the currency could experience substantial growth beyond projected values.

Can Shiba Inu Rally 45% to $0.000020? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular dog-themed meme coin, is making waves with its recent price momentum following the formation of a bullish price action pattern on the daily time frame. The past few days have been favorable for the meme coin, as it has broken out from a descending trendline that acted as a resistance level and further confirmed a breakout from a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern. SHIB Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels Following the breakout, SHIB turned bullish, partially shifting its market sentiment from a downtrend to an uptrend. According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, if Shiba Inu’s price continues to rise and closes a daily candle above the $0.0000138 level, there is a strong possibility that the meme coin could surge by 45% to reach the $0.000020 level in the future. Despite this positive development, Shiba Inu remains below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame, keeping the meme coin in a downtrend. As of now, SHIB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 55, indicating strong momentum for the meme coin and suggesting that it has enough room to rise significantly. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Current Price Momentum At press time, SHIB is trading near $0.0000139, registering a price surge of over 2% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the meme coin’s trading volume has increased by 6% during the same period, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day.

42350404,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143244,1742958640,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary ChatGPT Image Generation Unleashed with GPT-4o Upgrade,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chatgpt-image-generation-gpt4o-upgrade/,"Get ready for a visual revolution in the world of AI! OpenAI has just dropped a game-changer: a significant upgrade to ChatGPT’s image generation feature. For over a year, we’ve been anticipating this, and now it’s finally here. Powered by the cutting-edge GPT-4o model, ChatGPT can now natively conjure and tweak images and photos, taking your creative possibilities to unprecedented heights. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental shift in how you can interact with AI. Let’s dive into what this enhanced ChatGPT image generation capability means for you and the future of AI. Unveiling the Power of GPT-4o for Image Creation For those in the know, GPT-4o has been the powerhouse behind ChatGPT, but its talents were previously limited to text. Now, OpenAI has unleashed its visual potential. During a recent livestream, CEO Sam Altman himself announced that GPT-4o is now the engine driving native AI image upgrade within ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s video generation platform. This means you can now create and modify images directly within these tools, unlocking a new dimension of creative expression. Here’s a quick breakdown of what this upgrade brings: Native Image Generation: ChatGPT can now create images from scratch, directly within the chat interface. Image Modification: Edit and transform existing images, including photos with people. Inpainting Capabilities: Intelligently add or alter details like foreground and background objects in images. Powered by GPT-4o: Leveraging OpenAI’s most advanced model for more accurate and detailed visuals. DALL-E 3 Replacement: GPT-4o supersedes DALL-E 3, offering improved image quality and editing features. Who Gets to Experience the Enhanced Image Generation First? Excited to get your hands on this new feature? Here’s the rollout plan: User Group Availability Pro Plan Users ($200/month) Live Now Plus Users Coming Soon Free ChatGPT Users Rolling Out Soon API Developers Coming Soon While Pro users are already enjoying the benefits of GPT-4o powered generative AI images , OpenAI assures that Plus and free users, as well as developers utilizing their API, will gain access to this feature soon. Patience is key, but the wait promises to be worthwhile! GPT-4o: Thinking Deeper for Superior Visuals OpenAI highlights that GPT-4o “thinks” a bit longer than its predecessor, DALL-E 3, before generating images. This extra processing time translates into what OpenAI describes as “more accurate and detailed images.” Think of it as the AI taking a moment to truly understand your request, resulting in visuals that are closer to your vision. This improvement is a significant leap forward in the quality and precision of OpenAI image AI capabilities. Moreover, the ability to edit existing images opens up a world of creative possibilities. Want to transform a photo? Need to subtly alter a background or foreground element? GPT-4o makes it possible with its advanced inpainting capabilities. Imagine the power to refine and enhance your visuals with simple text prompts, all within ChatGPT. The Mystery of Training Data and Ethical Considerations One aspect OpenAI remains tight-lipped about is the specific image data used to train these new generative AI images capabilities. This secrecy is common practice in the generative AI space. Companies often view training data as a crucial competitive edge, guarding it closely. Furthermore, revealing training data details can open doors to potential IP-related legal challenges, adding another layer of disincentive for transparency. However, OpenAI does offer some control to content creators. They provide an opt-out form allowing creators to request the removal of their works from training datasets. Additionally, OpenAI states that they respect requests to disallow their web-scraping bots from collecting training data, including images, from specific websites. This demonstrates a degree of consideration for creators’ rights in the evolving landscape of AI and copyright. Following in Google’s Footsteps, but Learning from Missteps ChatGPT’s enhanced image generation arrives shortly after Google’s experimental foray into native image output with Gemini 2.0 Flash. Gemini’s image component quickly went viral, but not entirely for positive reasons. It was discovered that Gemini 2.0 Flash lacked sufficient guardrails, allowing users to remove watermarks and generate images depicting copyrighted characters. This highlighted the critical need for robust safety measures in generative AI images to prevent misuse and copyright infringement. It remains to be seen how OpenAI has addressed these potential pitfalls in its ChatGPT image generation upgrade. The lessons learned from Gemini’s experience are undoubtedly valuable, and hopefully, OpenAI has incorporated stronger safeguards to ensure responsible and ethical use of its powerful new feature. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for AI Creativity The upgrade to ChatGPT’s image generation is more than just a feature update; it’s a significant step forward in making AI a more versatile and powerful creative tool. By integrating GPT-4o for native image generation and editing, OpenAI has unleashed a new era of possibilities for users across various domains. From content creation to personal expression, the enhanced visual capabilities of ChatGPT promise to reshape how we interact with AI and bring our ideas to life. As this feature rolls out to more users, it will be fascinating to witness the innovative and imaginative ways people leverage this exciting AI image upgrade .

While meme coin giants like Floki Inu show signs of breaking out and Pudgy Penguins stir hype with their NFT-crypto ETF, something way more explosive is happening at the presale level. Say hi to BTFD Coin (BTFD) —a rising meme coin that’s changing the game quite literally. While Floki Inu holds strong and PENGU tries to shake off whale dominance, BTFD Coin is handing out a 100% bonus with code LAUNCH100 during its 15th presale stage, backed by a full P2E game that just went live. With over $6.41 million raised, 71 billion coins sold, and 11,500+ Bulls already in, it’s not just another project—it’s a movement. So let’s dive into the best meme coin presale in 2025 . BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin Presale With a Real Utility Imagine this: You just dropped $5,000 into a presale at $0.0002 per coin. Before you even blink, the value is already set to jump 200% by the time it lists at $0.0006. But wait—you used the LAUNCH100 bonus code, so now you’ve doubled your coins. That $5,000 just bought you 25 million BTFD Coins, but thanks to the bonus, you’re holding 50 million. Once BTFD hits its listing price, you’re sitting on $30,000. That’s the kind of play meme coin legends are made of. Now throw in a live P2E game that’s dishing out real rewards, a staking system offering 90% APY, and a squad-themed ecosystem that makes community fun again. That’s BTFD—a coin built on Ethereum, crafted by traders for traders, and engineered for those who know that buying the dip isn’t just a strategy—it’s a lifestyle. The BTFD game is more than just a game. It’s your passport to passive income in the crypto world. Play through four interactive levels, rack up in-game coins, and convert them into BTFD tokens. Better yet? Invite friends, earn bonuses, and upgrade your DeFi portfolio while having fun. No gimmicks—just pure Web3 utility, wrapped in memes and money-making madness. Hey Bulls, Heads up: The Clock is Ticking! That 100% bonus code LAUNCH100 isn’t going to last forever. It ends on March 30, 2025, and every token you grab until then gets doubled. Use it now, while the presale is still in Stage 15 at just $0.0002 per token. After Stage 16, the price will launch at $0.0006, which means buying now is like getting in on a 200% ROI before it even hits the open market. Want to cash in? Here’s how to use the LAUNCH100 code: Head over to the BTFD Presale , connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.), enter LAUNCH100 in all caps in the bonus code field, and confirm it. Plug in your purchase amount, hit “Buy Now,” confirm in your wallet, and boom—you’ve just doubled your stack. Still reading? Here’s more. BTFD isn’t just throwing bones to buyers. They’re running a killer referral program: Make it to the Top 20 referrers by the end of the month, and you’ll score 10% of the total raise from your referrals in BTFD tokens. This resets monthly, so if you’re good at shilling, this one’s for you. BTFD’s meme coin presale has stacked all the right plays: over $6.41 million already raised, 71 billion coins sold, and a community that’s buzzing across socials. Stage 15 is in full swing, and this is the final pit stop before liftoff. Floki Inu (FLOKI): GameFi Giant Gears Up for Valhalla FLOKI isn’t sleeping on the job. The meme coin, currently trading around $0.00006512, has rallied behind its GameFi strength. With a market cap of $630.3 million and whales scooping up billions of tokens recently, analysts are speculating that the sideways trading since early March could be the calm before the bull storm. The upcoming Valhalla mainnet launch in Q1 2025 is FLOKI’s big play. Add to that a Telegram trading bot picking up traction, and you’ve got solid foundations for a future rally. But let’s face it—while FLOKI is moving steadily, the real heat is coming from new meme coin presales. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): ETF Hype vs. Whale Pressure PENGU recently got its wings flapping again with ETF news that pushed it into the headlines. But after a short-lived V-shaped recovery and a dip back to $0.006874, retail traders are getting cautious. Despite bullish buzz on Stocktwits, technical indicators still show weakness. The RSI is sitting near 40, MACD is still bearish, and the top 10 wallets control over 66% of supply. Sure, the ETF angle could boost visibility if it’s approved, but PENGU’s near-term price action looks shaky. For those chasing short-term ROI, presales like BTFD might be the better play this week. Final Thoughts: Why BTFD Ranks #1 in the Top New Meme Coins to Join This Week Here’s the thing: In a market where volatility is the name of the game, smart investors look for low-risk, high-reward entry points. Presales like BTFD Coin give you just that—a safe way to lock in prices before the FOMO kicks in. While big players like FLOKI and PENGU deal with market swings and whale games, BTFD Coin lets you grab double tokens, earn via a P2E game, stake for 90% APY, and join a tight-knit, meme-savvy community. Based on current trends, social buzz, and the sheer amount of money flowing into BTFD, this is the pick of the litter when it comes to the top new meme coins to join this week. Time’s running out—the 100% bonus ends March 30, and Stage 15 won’t last long. So don’t just sit there scrolling. Join the BTFD Coin presale now. BTFD or get left in the dust. You choose.

According to a statement from the company on Mar. 26, the regulator will not take any enforcement action against Immutable ( IMX ), the IMX Ecosystem Foundation, or its chief executive officer. This officially puts an end to the matter. Immutable first revealed in October that it had received a Wells notice from the SEC. This notice meant the agency was considering possible charges for violating U.S. securities laws. However, with the investigation now closed, Immutable says this outcome validates its long-standing commitment to legal and regulatory compliance. The company welcomed the SEC’s ruling and noted that it was a step in the right direction for the web3 gaming sector. Immutable claimed that throughout the process, it stayed committed to its goal and kept developing products for gamers.

These aren’t just any locations; they are areas that traditional mining operations have bypassed for decades. This exciting news, exclusively shared with Bitcoin World, highlights a paradigm shift in mineral exploration – moving from conventional methods to AI-driven precision. What are Critical Minerals and Why is AI Mining a Game Changer? Critical minerals are the unsung heroes of modern technology. They are essential ingredients in everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to renewable energy infrastructure and, importantly, the very hardware that powers the cryptocurrency world. Securing a stable and diverse supply of these minerals is paramount in an increasingly tech-dependent global economy. Traditional mineral exploration is a time-consuming, expensive, and often hit-or-miss endeavor. It relies heavily on geological surveys, manual data analysis, and educated guesswork. This is where AI mining enters as a revolutionary force. AI mining leverages sophisticated algorithms to analyze vast datasets – including historical geological surveys, satellite imagery, and geochemical data – to identify patterns and anomalies that human geologists might miss. This approach drastically accelerates the exploration process, reduces costs, and increases the likelihood of successful discoveries. Earth AI’s breakthrough exemplifies the transformative potential of AI mining , demonstrating how technology can unlock resources previously deemed inaccessible or uneconomical. Earth AI’s Discovery: Unearthing the Overlooked with AI While details on the exact size of Earth AI’s discoveries are still under wraps, the implications are massive. The startup has identified promising deposits of: Copper, Cobalt, and Gold in the Northern Territory Silver, Molybdenum, and Tin in New South Wales (approximately 310 miles northwest of Sydney) These locations were not chosen randomly. Earth AI’s algorithms meticulously combed through decades of archived geological data, uncovering potential that had been overlooked by traditional mineral exploration methods. Roman Teslyuk, Earth AI’s founder and CEO, emphasized this technological frontier, stating, “The actual, real frontier [in mining] is not so much geographical as it is technological.” This sentiment underscores the core of Earth AI’s success: shifting the focus from simply searching new territories to intelligently re-evaluating existing data with cutting-edge mining technology . How Does Earth AI’s Mining Technology Work? Earth AI’s journey began with Teslyuk’s doctoral research at the University of Sydney. He recognized a treasure trove of untapped information within Australia’s national archive of mining exploration data. For decades, exploration companies in Australia have been required to submit their data to this archive. Teslyuk realized the potential of this data if analyzed with the right tools. Here’s a simplified breakdown of Earth AI’s approach to AI mining : Data Ingestion: Earth AI’s algorithms ingest massive amounts of historical geological data, including reports, surveys, and maps dating back to the 1970s. AI-Powered Analysis: Sophisticated machine learning algorithms are trained to identify patterns, anomalies, and indicators of mineral deposits within this vast dataset. The AI learns from past successes and failures in mineral exploration . Target Identification: The AI pinpoints specific locations with high potential for critical mineral deposits, even in areas previously explored and deemed unpromising. Ground Validation: Earth AI developed its own drilling equipment to rapidly and cost-effectively validate the AI’s predictions on the ground, proving the accuracy and effectiveness of their mining technology . This integrated approach, combining AI-driven analysis with rapid on-site validation, sets Earth AI apart and addresses a key challenge in the traditional mining industry: the reluctance to adopt unproven technologies. The Future of Mineral Exploration: Faster, Smarter, and More Efficient Earth AI’s success, alongside KoBold’s recent copper discovery in Zambia, signals a significant shift in the landscape of mineral exploration . The traditional, decade-long process of finding new deposits is becoming increasingly unsustainable in today’s fast-paced world. As Teslyuk aptly puts it, “The way we used to explore for metals in the past, the 20th century, it just takes very, very long. It takes decades to find something. With modern pace of the world, you just can’t wait for that long.” AI mining offers a compelling solution. By dramatically accelerating the discovery process, reducing exploration costs, and enhancing the accuracy of target identification, mining technology powered by AI is poised to: Secure Supply Chains: Ensure a more reliable and diversified supply of critical minerals essential for technological advancement and economic stability. Reduce Environmental Impact: By making exploration more targeted, AI can help minimize the environmental footprint associated with widespread, less focused exploration activities. Unlock Economic Opportunities: Revitalize mining in regions previously considered depleted or unviable, creating new economic opportunities and jobs. Drive Innovation: Encourage further innovation in mining technology and the development of even more efficient and sustainable mineral extraction methods. Earth AI’s breakthrough is more than just a promising discovery; it’s a powerful demonstration of how AI mining is revolutionizing an age-old industry, paving the way for a future where resource acquisition is smarter, faster, and more aligned with the demands of the 21st century. As the world increasingly relies on critical minerals to power its technological progress, companies like Earth AI, leveraging cutting-edge mining technology , are becoming indispensable.

With over $100 million already raised for its Bitcoin ETFs , the firm is doubling down on Bitcoin exposure while strategically avoiding the allure of Ethereum and the volatile world of memecoins. This decision, as reported by CoinDesk, underscores a calculated and risk management focused strategy in navigating the complex cryptocurrency landscape. Let’s delve deeper into Calamos’s approach and what it signals for the future of institutional institutional adoption in crypto. Why Bitcoin ETFs Are Calamos’s Primary Focus? Calamos’s strong emphasis on Bitcoin ETFs isn’t arbitrary. It reflects a strategic alignment with what they perceive as a more mature and institutionally palatable segment of the crypto market. Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons behind this focus: Established Market Presence: Bitcoin, as the pioneering cryptocurrency, boasts the longest track record and the most developed infrastructure. This maturity lends a degree of stability and predictability that appeals to traditional asset managers like Calamos. Regulatory Clarity (Relatively): While crypto regulations are still evolving globally, Bitcoin has generally faced less regulatory scrutiny compared to other cryptocurrencies. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions further solidifies its standing within regulatory frameworks. Investor Demand: There’s a significant and growing demand for Bitcoin exposure from institutional and retail investors alike. Bitcoin ETFs provide a regulated and accessible route for these investors to gain exposure without directly holding the underlying asset. Hedging Tools: As Calamos themselves pointed out, the availability of robust hedging tools for Bitcoin is a crucial factor. These tools are essential for managing risk and volatility, a cornerstone of traditional asset management. The Ethereum Question: Why the Hesitation? While Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and a hub for innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Calamos is taking a cautious stance. Their hesitation towards launching Ethereum -based products stems from several concerns: Limited Hedging Tools: Calamos specifically cited the “limited ETH hedging tools” as a primary reason for their current avoidance. Compared to Bitcoin, the market for sophisticated hedging instruments for Ethereum is less developed, making risk management more challenging. Technological Complexity: Ethereum’s ecosystem is more complex than Bitcoin’s, involving smart contracts, decentralized applications, and layer-2 scaling solutions. This complexity can introduce additional operational and security risks. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for Ethereum and its associated technologies is still evolving and, in some areas, less clear than for Bitcoin. This uncertainty can deter institutions seeking regulatory compliance and clarity. Proof-of-Stake Transition: While the move to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) was a significant upgrade for Ethereum , it also introduced new dynamics and considerations, particularly around staking rewards and network security, which might require further evaluation from a risk management perspective. Memecoins: A Definite No-Go Zone When it comes to memecoins, Calamos’s stance is clear: a definite no. This aversion is rooted in the very nature of memecoins, which are characterized by: Extreme Volatility: Memecoins are notoriously volatile, often driven by social media trends and community sentiment rather than fundamental value. This volatility makes them unsuitable for risk-averse institutional investors. Lack of Fundamental Value: Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum , memecoins typically lack strong underlying technology, use cases, or development teams. Their value is primarily speculative. High Risk of Market Manipulation: The relatively low liquidity and concentrated ownership in many memecoins make them susceptible to market manipulation and pump-and-dump schemes. Reputational Risk: For a traditional asset manager like Calamos, associating with memecoins could pose reputational risks, potentially alienating clients who prioritize stability and long-term value. The Broader Implications for Institutional Adoption Calamos’s strategy offers valuable insights into the broader trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Their approach highlights several key considerations for traditional financial firms venturing into this space: Factor Bitcoin ETFs Ethereum Memecoins Risk Profile Moderate (relative to crypto) Moderate to High Extremely High Hedging Tools Developing, improving Limited Negligible Regulatory Clarity Increasing Evolving Unclear Institutional Appeal High Moderate Very Low This table summarizes the comparative landscape, emphasizing why Bitcoin ETFs are currently the preferred entry point for institutions seeking crypto exposure. It’s not just about embracing crypto; it’s about doing so in a way that aligns with established risk management principles and client expectations. Risk Management: The Cornerstone of Calamos’s Crypto Strategy Risk management is clearly at the heart of Calamos’s crypto strategy. Their decision-making process underscores the importance of a cautious and calculated approach, especially when dealing with a nascent and volatile asset class. Here are key takeaways regarding their risk management philosophy: Prioritizing Mature Assets: Focusing on Bitcoin, the most established cryptocurrency, demonstrates a preference for assets with a longer track record and greater market depth. Demand for Hedging: The emphasis on hedging tools highlights the need for traditional risk mitigation strategies to be applicable in the crypto space. Gradual Engagement: Avoiding Ethereum and memecoins suggests a phased approach to crypto adoption, starting with lower-risk, more understood assets. Client Protection: Ultimately, this risk-averse strategy is geared towards protecting client capital and maintaining trust, which is paramount for any asset management firm. Actionable Insights for Investors What can investors learn from Calamos’s approach? Here are some actionable insights: Diversification within Crypto: Even within the crypto space, diversification is crucial. Different cryptocurrencies have vastly different risk profiles. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Assess your own risk tolerance before investing in any cryptocurrency. Bitcoin ETFs may be suitable for those with moderate risk appetite, while memecoins are strictly for high-risk speculators. Due Diligence is Key: Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency or crypto investment product before investing. Understand the technology, the market dynamics, and the associated risks. Consider Institutional Signals: Pay attention to how institutional investors are approaching crypto. Firms like Calamos offer valuable insights into prudent and risk-aware crypto investment strategies. Conclusion: A Strategic and Cautious Crypto Future Calamos’s decision to focus on Bitcoin ETFs while sidestepping Ethereum and memecoins is a telling sign of how traditional finance is cautiously but surely integrating with the crypto world. Their emphasis on risk management , hedging tools, and established assets underscores a pragmatic approach to institutional adoption . As the crypto market continues to evolve, expect to see more nuanced strategies from traditional players, prioritizing calculated moves over impulsive leaps into the unknown. Calamos’s bold move serves as a valuable case study for navigating the exciting yet complex landscape of cryptocurrency investments.

This news, first reported by BWE News citing VentureBeat, brings a wave of relief to the project and its community, who have been under the shadow of regulatory uncertainty since receiving a Wells Notice in October of the previous year. What does this mean for Immutable X, IMX token holders, and the future of Web3 gaming? Let’s dive into the details. Why the SEC Investigation into Immutable X Mattered The SEC investigation into Immutable, specifically focusing on the IMX token sale, was a critical point of concern for several reasons. A Wells Notice from the SEC is a formal indication that the agency is considering recommending enforcement action against the recipient. In the context of cryptocurrencies, these investigations often revolve around whether a token sale constitutes an offering of unregistered securities. For Immutable, a leading platform in the burgeoning Web3 gaming space, the implications were substantial. The uncertainty could have hindered development, partnerships, and overall adoption of the IMX ecosystem. Regulatory Cloud: The investigation cast a regulatory cloud over Immutable X, potentially deterring investors and partners wary of regulatory risks. Impact on IMX Token: The price and sentiment around the IMX token were undoubtedly affected by the looming investigation. Investor confidence can wane during periods of regulatory scrutiny. Industry-Wide Implications: The outcome of the Immutable investigation was closely watched by the wider Web3 gaming and crypto industry. It could have set a precedent for how the SEC approaches token sales in this innovative sector. The Breakthrough: SEC Closes the Case The news that the SEC has decided to end its investigation without pursuing enforcement action is a major win for Immutable. This decision signals that, at least in this instance, the SEC did not find sufficient grounds to allege that Immutable’s IMX token sale violated securities laws. For Immutable, this marks a pivotal moment, removing a significant hurdle and paving the way for greater focus on growth and innovation. The resolution of the SEC investigation is not just a victory for Immutable but also sends a positive signal to the broader Web3 gaming industry, suggesting a potentially more nuanced regulatory approach than some might have feared. Immutable X and Web3 Gaming: What’s Next? With the SEC investigation behind them, Immutable X is now positioned to accelerate its mission to bring Web3 gaming to the masses. Immutable X is a layer-2 scaling solution for NFTs on Ethereum, specifically designed to enhance the gaming experience by offering near-instant transactions, massive scalability, and zero gas fees for trading and minting NFTs. Here’s what we can expect from Immutable X moving forward: Focus on Growth and Adoption Partnerships: Expect Immutable X to aggressively pursue new partnerships with game developers and studios looking to build on Web3. The clarity provided by the SEC’s decision will make Immutable a more attractive platform. Ecosystem Expansion: Immutable can now double down on expanding its ecosystem, attracting more games, developers, and users to its platform. Technological Advancement: Freed from the shadow of the investigation, Immutable can dedicate more resources to further developing its technology and enhancing its offerings for Web3 gaming. Benefits for IMX Token Holders The positive resolution of the SEC investigation is also good news for IMX token holders. The token’s utility within the Immutable X ecosystem includes governance, staking, and transaction fees. With increased adoption and growth of the platform, the demand and utility of the IMX token could see a significant boost. Investors who were hesitant due to regulatory uncertainty may now find IMX a more appealing asset. Challenges and the Path Ahead for Crypto Regulation While the conclusion of the SEC investigation into Immutable is a positive development, it doesn’t mean the path is entirely clear for Web3 gaming and crypto regulation. The broader regulatory landscape remains complex and evolving. Here are some ongoing challenges and considerations: Challenge Description Actionable Insight Regulatory Uncertainty Globally, crypto regulations are still being developed and vary significantly across jurisdictions. This creates ongoing uncertainty for projects operating in the space. Projects need to proactively engage with regulators, seek legal counsel, and adapt to evolving regulatory frameworks. SEC Scrutiny While Immutable’s investigation ended without enforcement, the SEC continues to scrutinize the crypto industry. Future token sales and projects will still need to navigate SEC regulations. Web3 projects should prioritize compliance, ensure proper legal structuring of token sales, and maintain transparency in their operations. Industry Education There’s a need for ongoing education for both regulators and the public about the nuances of Web3 technology and its potential benefits. Industry players should actively participate in dialogues with regulators, providing clarity and context to help shape informed regulatory policies. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Immutable X and Web3 Gaming The SEC’s decision to end its investigation into Immutable X marks a significant milestone for the project and offers a beacon of hope for the Web3 gaming sector. It removes a major obstacle, allowing Immutable to fully focus on its mission of building the leading platform for NFT gaming. For investors, developers, and gamers alike, this news is a powerful endorsement of the potential of Web3 gaming and the innovative solutions being built on platforms like Immutable X. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of compliance and constructive engagement, while also highlighting the potential for positive outcomes when innovation and regulation find a path forward. The relief felt by the Immutable community is palpable, and the future looks brighter than ever for this pioneering platform.

Despite the anticipated challenges following the Bitcoin halving, the Bitcoin mining sector is showing remarkable resilience. New data reveals that Bitcoin miner revenue has not only stabilized but also demonstrated impressive growth, particularly in the last quarter of 2024. Let’s dive into the numbers and explore what this means for the future of Bitcoin mining and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This surge in Bitcoin mining revenue signals a strong and adaptable industry. Is Bitcoin Mining Revenue Still Profitable Post-Halving? The Bitcoin halving, a pre-programmed event that reduces the block reward for miners by half, historically creates uncertainty around miner profitability. However, recent data from Coin Metrics, highlighted by Cointelegraph, paints a different picture. In Q4 2024, Bitcoin mining revenue reached a significant $3.7 billion. This represents a substantial 42% increase, demonstrating the underlying strength and adaptability within the mining industry. Even more encouraging is the fact that this revenue level is holding steady into Q1 2025, suggesting that miners have effectively navigated the immediate post-halving period. This robust performance addresses concerns about the immediate impact of the halving on crypto miner profitability . How Are Miners Adapting to Maintain Profitability? The Bitcoin mining community isn’t sitting still. Faced with reduced block rewards, miners are proactively implementing several strategies to maintain and even enhance their crypto miner profitability . These adaptive measures are crucial for the long-term health of the Bitcoin network. Let’s explore some key adaptations: Equipment Upgrades: Investing in newer, more energy-efficient mining equipment is a primary focus. Next-generation ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) offer significantly improved hash rates per watt, reducing operational costs and boosting efficiency. This technological advancement is vital for sustaining Bitcoin mining revenue . Cost Optimization: Miners are scrutinizing every aspect of their operations to cut costs. This includes negotiating better energy rates, optimizing cooling systems, and streamlining operational workflows. Efficient cost management is paramount for maximizing profit margins in the competitive mining landscape and securing stable Bitcoin mining trends . Diversification into AI Hosting: An interesting and increasingly popular trend is diversification into AI hosting. Mining facilities, with their robust infrastructure and power capacity, are well-suited to host AI computation workloads. This diversification provides an additional revenue stream, hedging against Bitcoin price volatility and enhancing overall business resilience. This innovative approach contributes to a more diversified and stable revenue base beyond solely relying on Bitcoin mining Q4 2024 performance. Challenges and Risks on the Horizon While the current outlook for Bitcoin mining revenue is positive, miners still face several challenges and potential risks that could impact future profitability: Potential Trade Tariffs: Geopolitical factors, such as trade tariffs on mining equipment, could significantly increase capital expenditure and operational costs. Tariffs can disrupt supply chains and make it more expensive for miners to upgrade or expand their operations. This external factor could put pressure on crypto miner profitability . Low Transaction Fees: Currently, a significant portion of Bitcoin activity still comes from small-value transfers. This translates to relatively low transaction fees for miners. If this trend continues, and on-chain activity doesn’t shift towards higher-value transactions, reliance on block rewards will remain high, especially post-halving. Increased transaction fees are needed to supplement block rewards and ensure long-term Bitcoin mining revenue sustainability. Bitcoin Mining in Q4 2024: A Data Snapshot To better understand the recent performance of Bitcoin mining, let’s look at some key data points for Bitcoin mining Q4 2024 : Metric Value Significance Total Bitcoin Mining Revenue (Q4 2024) $3.7 Billion Indicates strong industry performance and revenue generation. Quarter-over-Quarter Growth 42% Demonstrates significant revenue increase compared to previous quarter. Revenue Trend (Post-Halving) Stable Suggests miners are adapting effectively to reduced block rewards. Key Adaptation Strategies Equipment upgrades, cost cuts, AI hosting Highlights proactive measures taken by miners to maintain profitability. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors What does this mean for you? The stability and growth in Bitcoin mining revenue post-halving are positive indicators for the Bitcoin ecosystem. It suggests: Network Security: A healthy and profitable mining sector is crucial for maintaining the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Strong miner revenue incentivizes continued participation and investment in the network. Long-Term Viability: The adaptability shown by miners in the face of halving demonstrates the long-term viability and resilience of the Bitcoin mining industry. Diversification into areas like AI hosting further strengthens this outlook. Investment Opportunities: For investors, a stable and growing Bitcoin mining sector can present potential investment opportunities, both in mining companies and related infrastructure projects. Understanding Bitcoin mining trends is key for informed investment decisions. Conclusion: A Resilient Future for Bitcoin Mining The latest data on Bitcoin mining revenue paints a promising picture. The industry’s ability to not only stabilize but thrive after the halving is a testament to its resilience, innovation, and proactive adaptation. While challenges remain, particularly concerning trade tariffs and transaction fees, the strategic shifts towards efficiency, diversification, and technological upgrades position Bitcoin miners for continued success. The robust Bitcoin mining trends observed in Q4 2024 and continuing into 2025 offer a hopeful outlook for the future of Bitcoin mining and its vital role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

In a move that’s sending shockwaves through both the gaming and financial worlds, GameStop (GME), the beloved and sometimes turbulent video game retailer, has just announced a bold decision: they’re adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet as a reserve asset. Yes, you read that right. GameStop, the company that once symbolized brick-and-mortar retail in the digital age, is diving headfirst into the world of cryptocurrency. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a potentially game-changing shift that could redefine how corporations think about their finances. Let’s break down what this electrifying announcement means, why it’s happening, and what it could mean for the future of both GameStop and the broader crypto landscape. GameStop Officially Adopts Bitcoin as Reserve Asset The official word dropped via a press release that has since ignited conversations across the internet. GameStop’s board of directors, in a unanimous decision, approved the allocation of Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset for the company. This isn’t just about dipping a toe into the crypto waters; it’s a full-on cannonball into the deep end. Consider the context: GameStop is sitting on a substantial pile of liquid assets, reportedly $5.35 billion as of the end of 2024. Allocating a portion of this to Bitcoin is a significant vote of confidence in the leading cryptocurrency and a clear signal of a forward-thinking financial strategy. But what sparked this monumental decision? It appears the catalyst might have been a nudge from an influential voice in the financial world. Matt Cole, CEO of asset management firm Strive, reportedly penned a letter to GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen last month, urging him to consider Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Cohen’s cryptic yet telling response on X (formerly Twitter), simply stating, “Letter received,” now seems incredibly prescient. It suggests that the idea of Bitcoin adoption was already on Cohen’s radar, and Cole’s letter may have been the final push needed to set the wheels in motion. Why Bitcoin? Understanding the Reserve Asset Rationale So, why would a company like GameStop choose Bitcoin as a reserve asset? It’s not like they’re short on traditional currency. The answer lies in the evolving understanding of corporate treasury management and the unique properties of Bitcoin itself. Let’s explore some key reasons: Diversification and Inflation Hedge: In an era of potential inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty, holding a portion of reserves in Bitcoin can act as a diversification strategy and a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins inherently contrasts with the potentially limitless supply of government-issued currencies, making it an attractive store of value. Enhanced Returns Potential: Compared to traditional reserve assets like cash or low-yield government bonds, Bitcoin offers the potential for significantly higher returns. While volatility is a factor, the upside potential of Bitcoin, particularly in the long term, is a compelling draw for companies seeking to optimize their treasury holdings. Future-Proofing the Balance Sheet: Embracing cryptocurrency now can be seen as a strategic move to future-proof GameStop’s balance sheet and position the company at the forefront of financial innovation. It sends a message that GameStop is not just a relic of the past but a company actively adapting to the future of finance and technology. Attracting a New Generation of Investors and Customers: Adopting Bitcoin can resonate strongly with a younger, digitally native demographic, many of whom are deeply interested in cryptocurrencies. This move could enhance GameStop’s brand image, attract new investors, and even appeal to a broader customer base who appreciate forward-thinking companies. The Benefits of Bitcoin for GameStop: A Deep Dive Let’s delve deeper into the specific advantages GameStop might gain by holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet: Benefit Description Improved Treasury Performance Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation could lead to significant gains on GameStop’s reserves, outperforming traditional low-yield assets. Enhanced Brand Perception Positioning GameStop as a tech-forward company embracing digital assets can attract a new wave of customers and investors, particularly within the crypto-savvy community. Strategic Asset Diversification Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds can reduce overall portfolio risk and provide diversification benefits to GameStop’s treasury. Operational Efficiencies (Potential Future) While not immediate, in the future, GameStop could explore integrating Bitcoin into its operations, such as accepting it for payments or using it for cross-border transactions, potentially reducing fees and improving efficiency. Navigating the Challenges: Is Bitcoin a Risky Move for GameStop? While the potential benefits are considerable, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks associated with holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This is uncharted territory for many publicly traded companies, and there are valid concerns to consider: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Significant price swings could impact GameStop’s balance sheet and potentially lead to investor concerns if not managed carefully. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the accounting treatment and legal status of Bitcoin holdings. Security and Custody: Securing and storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. GameStop will need to implement institutional-grade custody solutions. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting standards for cryptocurrency holdings are still developing. GameStop will need to navigate complex accounting rules and ensure transparent reporting of its Bitcoin assets. Public Perception and Investor Sentiment: While many are excited, some traditional investors may be wary of Bitcoin’s volatility and perceived risk, potentially leading to mixed reactions. Clear communication and a well-defined strategy are crucial. Examples of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: GameStop Joins the Ranks GameStop isn’t the first major corporation to embrace institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset. They are joining a growing list of forward-thinking companies recognizing the potential of cryptocurrency. Notable examples include: MicroStrategy: Perhaps the most well-known example, MicroStrategy has made Bitcoin its primary treasury reserve asset, holding billions of dollars worth of BTC. Tesla: Elon Musk’s Tesla also added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, although they have bought and sold portions of their holdings over time. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s Block has also invested in Bitcoin, demonstrating confidence in its long-term value proposition. These examples demonstrate that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is not just a fringe movement but a growing trend among publicly traded companies seeking to diversify their treasury holdings and embrace digital assets. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Investors and the Crypto Market? GameStop’s move into Bitcoin has several implications for investors and the broader crypto market: Increased Mainstream Acceptance: When a company as recognizable as GameStop adopts Bitcoin, it signals further mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. This can encourage other corporations to consider similar moves. Potential Price Impact: Significant institutional investments in Bitcoin can contribute to increased demand and potentially drive up the price of BTC, although market reactions can be complex and influenced by many factors. Validation for Crypto Advocates: For long-time crypto enthusiasts, GameStop’s decision is a validation of their belief in the transformative potential of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Focus on Corporate Treasury Strategies: This move will likely prompt more companies to re-evaluate their treasury management strategies and consider incorporating digital assets into their reserves. Conclusion: A New Level Unlocked for GameStop and Bitcoin? GameStop adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet is more than just a headline; it’s a potentially transformative moment for both the company and the cryptocurrency world. It’s a daring leap into the future of finance, a signal of innovation, and a bold bet on the long-term value of digital assets. While challenges and risks remain, the potential rewards for GameStop, and the ripple effects across the market, are undeniable. This move could very well be a game-changer, unlocking a new level of corporate engagement with Bitcoin and paving the way for further institutional adoption.

These include the $88,355.91 to $90,920.05, $90,920.05 to $93,591.02, $93,591.02 to $96,262.00, $96,262.00 to $98,932.97, and $98,932.97 to $101,603.95 levels—zones where many addresses are currently holding Bitcoin at a loss. Is Bitcoin on its way to test its highs? The red bubbles in this chart highlight levels where underwater investors could sell as they break even, especially if uncertainty persists. A key zone is around $97.4k, where roughly 1.44 million BTC are currently holding at a loss. pic.twitter.com/LKaDBen7cU — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 24, 2025 Notably, around the $97.4K level alone, approximately 1.44 million BTC are held by investors in unrealized loss positions, which could introduce selling pressure as prices recover. Despite the resistance ahead, other on-chain activity shows signs of investor confidence. According to IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin saw over $220 million in net outflows from centralized exchanges in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, total outflows have exceeded $424 million, often interpreted as a sign of investors moving assets into cold storage rather than preparing to sell. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci noted that Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility index has surged to 52.31 points—its highest level in the past six months. The spike in volatility coincides with anticipation around the US Core PCE report expected Friday, a macroeconomic event that could introduce further price swings. Technical Outlook On Bitcoin From a technical perspective, analysts remain divided. Crypto analyst Ali pointed out that Bitcoin is approaching a key resistance zone around $89,000, where the 50-day moving average intersects with a descending trendline drawn from the January all-time high. The outcome at this level may influence the direction of the next major move. On the other hand, analyst Javon Marks highlighted what he described as a potential breakout pattern forming on Bitcoin’s chart.

Marks believes that if momentum continues, Bitcoin could be positioning itself for another rapid climb toward new record highs.

Here’s Where Crypto Whales Are Allocating Their Funds,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-solana-sol-and-sui-sui-good-buys-at-current-prices-heres-where-crypto-whales-are-allocating-their-funds/,"Solana (SOL) has seen its co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko dismiss the need for layer-2 solutions, arguing that a high-performing layer-1 can be both faster and cheaper. Meanwhile, Sui (SUI) wavers after last week’s small dip, with some analysts expecting a strong breakout soon. As crypto whales scout new opportunities, an altcoin named Remittix (RTX) at $0.0734, having raised $14+ million and sold over 522 million tokens is quietly drawing attention for its cross-border payment utility. Below, we examine SOL, SUI and why many big holders are eyeing RTX. Solana (SOL): Still a Layer-1 Heavyweight SOL at $141. Solana (SOL) stands around $145.61, with co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently stating there’s “no reason” for slower or more complex layer-2 solutions if layer-1 can be optimized well. He asserts that the data availability stack moves smoothly on Solana, ensuring no speed penalties and no major security trade-offs. Some whales remain bullish on Solana’s technical approach, believing it could maintain a strong place in DeFi and NFTs. Still, skeptics question whether previous network outages or competitive ecosystems might slow long-term growth. If more dApps arrive and performance remains stable , SOL could push higher, but it might require new inflows or fresh partnerships to power a substantial price rally. Sui (SUI): Ready for a Breakout? SUI at $2.40. Source: CoinGecko Meanwhile, Sui (SUI) sits near $2.47 after slipping 2.48% last week. According to analyst Noob , SUI’s sideways trading might soon end if it breaks above $2.50. Support stands around $2.26, and losing that could send the token near $1.75. However, a push past $3.00 might rekindle investor optimism. With top whales generally splitting their positions, some see SUI’s real potential in advanced DeFi features. Others remain cautious, waiting for a clear sign of volume surges. If the market mood shifts bullish, SUI could reclaim lost ground quickly but that depends on both broader market conditions and Sui’s ability to differentiate itself among fast blockchains. Remittix (RTX): The Whales’ Hidden Gem? While Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) chase technical performance, Remittix (RTX) focuses on an easier-to-understand issue: cheaper, faster global payments. Priced at $0.0734, with $14 million+ raised and 521+ million tokens sold, RTX could end up as a whale favorite if it secures real user adoption. Observers point out that countless freelancers, small businesses, or families face high wire fees and multi-day waits. Remittix solves that by converting crypto (like BTC, ETH, or DOGE) into local currency in about 24 hours, depositing straight into normal bank accounts. Another draw for whales is security: locked tokens and an audited contract reduce the scam risk often found in presale tokens. If Remittix inks deals with online retailers or payroll services, daily transactions might explode potentially sparking big ROI. As a result, RTX could overshadow slower-growing coins if PayFi remains a hot trend. Conclusion: Where Are Whales Putting Their Money? Between Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), whales are still observing which chain will deliver top speed and robust apps. Solana’s big defenders see no need for layer-2, while Sui watchers look for a rally above $3. But if you’re hunting for a practical altcoin with immediate real-world impact, Remittix (RTX) may be the dark horse whales are flocking to. Already at $0.0734 with $14+ million raised, RTX addresses a global need for remittances potentially granting it faster adoption and bigger returns. Ultimately, the big money might pick whichever project Solana, Sui or Remittix is dominating its niche. And so far, RTX appears primed to own the cross-border payments space.

In a March 25 announcement, Crusoe said it plans to sell its Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining operation, including its digital flare mitigation business, to NYDIG, subject to regulatory approvals and other consents. The deal includes Crusoe’s 270 megawatts of power generation technology from more than 425 modular data centers across the United States and Argentina, along with 135 Crusoe employees who will join NYDIG, as no roles will be eliminated as a result of the transaction. Crusoe was founded in 2018 and pioneered technology that captures waste gas created during oil extraction and refinement that would be normally burned off in a process called gas flaring in order to power Bitcoin miners . Photo of gas flaring in action. Source: Crusoe Energy It converts the gas or “stranded energy” into electricity used to power the high-performance compute required for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. Some reports suggest that Crusoe’s Bitcoin mining operation accounts for 1% of the world’s Bitcoin mining. Crusoe’s AI expansion plans However, Crusoe says it now wants to focus its tech on building out AI infrastructure. “The AI business — it’s become the majority of our revenue,” Cully Cavness, the co-founder, president and chief operating officer of Crusoe, told CNBC. The company recently expanded its AI data center in Abilene, Texas, to 1.2 gigawatts around the same time it announced a joint venture with investment firm Engine No. 1 to develop large-scale data center campuses across the US to build out AI capabilities. Source: Matthew Sigel Last year in December, it closed $600 million in a Series D round at a $2.8 billion valuation to power AI. “We see a huge opportunity in front of us, and we have a big advantage and a big head start with what we’ve already announced — and more coming soon,” added Cavness. Related: Tokenized US gold could ultimately benefit Bitcoin: NYDIG NYDIG said that the acquisition of Crusoe’s Bitcoin mining business will help expand its role in supporting Bitcoin’s proof-of-work security. NYDIG founder and executive chairman Ross Stevens said that “it is critically important to keep the Bitcoin network secure, and at the lowest possible cost,” claiming that fiat currencies are “collapsing against Bitcoin around the world.” Magazine: Ex-Alameda hire on ‘pressure’ to not blow up Backpack exchange: Armani Ferrante, X Hall of Flame",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|FIAT|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-26 04:03:43

The price is now trading above $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.430 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might extend losses if it breaks the $2.420 support zone. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price remained supported and started a recovery wave above the $2.350 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to clear the $2.420 and $2.450 resistance levels. The price even tested the $2.50 resistance. However, there was no upside break, and the price reacted to the downside. There was a move below the $2.45 level. A low was formed at $2.40 and the price is now consolidating.

In his latest Bloomberg interview, CEO Brad Gralinghouse said that it’s important to have this exchange-traded fund, while just falling short of accepting that they are working with the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock. XRP price movement has been relatively mute to this development, while industry players expect a $3 breakout soon. Are Ripple and BlackRock Exploring Potential XRP ETF? In his recent Bloomberg interview, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was asked whether they are collaborating with BlackRock to launch an XRP ETF in the US. Although Garlinghouse didn’t explicitly accept such a collaboration, he sparked speculation by stating, “We think it makes sense for the XRP community overall”. The prospect of a BlackRock filing for an XRP ETF in 2025 has captured the attention of the crypto community. Many believe that once the regulatory wall over Ripple is removed, asset managers will rush in the second-half of the year to bring a Ripple ETF to the market. Furthermore, Ripple CEO Garlinghouse is also confident that XRP would make it to the US Digital Asset stockpile. Adding to the discussion, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek highlighted the transformative potential of XRP ETFs. He predicts that the development could attract $8 billion in inflows following the approval. Ripple Drops Cross-Appeal Against US SEC The long-running Ripple vs SEC lawsuit has finally come to an end as the blockchain startup has decided to no longer pursue the cross-appeal against the securities regulator. The resolution involves a $75 million refund to Ripple, following the SEC’s decision to drop its appeal and Ripple abandoning its cross-appeal. This settlement concludes a case that initially resulted in a $125 million penalty against Ripple. With the refund, the company’s net payment to the SEC amounts to $50 million. Under the Trump administration, the SEC has softened its stance, while putting a greater focus on establishing clear crypto regulations. XRP Price Surge to $3 Soon? Amid the current development and hopes for XRP ETF, the XRP price has given a muted response as it continues to face strong rejection at $2.50 levels. Despite this, market analysts have made bold predictions, expecting the XRP price rally to continue at $15 and beyond. Sharing the XRPUSDT chart, popular crypto trader Seyma stated that she’s more bullish on the Ripple cryptocurrency in comparison to other altcoins. “My weekly target is $3-$3.24 i never give investment or trading advice just noted to myself,” she wrote.

Nikita Bier, the ingenious mind behind the viral social apps tbh and Gas, is now onboard to fuel Solana’s ambitious mobile app expansion. This strategic alliance signals a powerful push towards making Web3 more accessible and user-friendly, directly through the devices we use every day – our smartphones. What does this mean for the future of Solana and the broader crypto mobile landscape? Let’s dive in. Why Nikita Bier’s Expertise is a Game Changer for Solana’s Mobile Apps Strategy Nikita Bier isn’t just another advisor; he’s a proven innovator in the social app space. His creations, tbh and Gas, captivated millions with their positive and engaging user experiences. tbh, acquired by Facebook, focused on anonymous positive affirmations among high school students, while Gas continued this trend with compliments and positivity. Bier’s knack for creating viral, user-centric mobile experiences is precisely what Solana needs as it doubles down on its mobile-first approach. His role will be pivotal in: Guiding App Selection: Bier will be instrumental in identifying and selecting promising teams to build on the Solana ecosystem. This curated approach ensures quality and relevance in the apps that Solana supports. Fostering Growth: His experience in scaling social apps will be invaluable in helping these selected teams achieve rapid user growth and engagement within the Solana environment. Enhancing User Experience: Bier’s deep understanding of user behavior and mobile app design will contribute to creating intuitive and enjoyable Web3 mobile applications on Solana. This partnership arrives at a crucial juncture for Solana, especially with initiatives like the Solana Seeker smartphone. Let’s explore how this all fits together. Solana’s Bold Bet on Mobile: The Seeker Smartphone and Web3 Accessibility Solana isn’t just dipping its toes into the mobile world; it’s diving in headfirst. The Solana Seeker smartphone is a testament to this commitment. But why mobile? And why now? Consider these points: Mobile is Ubiquitous: Smartphones are the primary computing device for billions globally. Tapping into the mobile market is essential for widespread crypto adoption . User-Friendly Onboarding: Mobile apps offer a more intuitive and less intimidating entry point to Web3 compared to desktop-centric experiences. Expanding the Ecosystem: Mobile-first applications can unlock new use cases and attract a broader demographic to the Solana ecosystem. The Seeker phone is designed to be a crypto-native device, aiming to simplify access to decentralized applications (dApps), digital asset management, and other Web3 functionalities directly from your pocket. However, great hardware needs equally compelling software. This is where Nikita Bier’s advisory role becomes even more critical. Nikita Bier and the Future of Web3 Mobile Apps on Solana Imagine a future where accessing your crypto wallet, participating in DeFi, or engaging with NFTs is as seamless and enjoyable as using your favorite social media app. This is the vision that the collaboration between Solana and Nikita Bier aims to realize. But what kind of mobile apps are we talking about? Think about: Decentralized Social Media: Apps that prioritize user privacy and data ownership, moving away from centralized platforms. Mobile DeFi Platforms: Simplified interfaces for accessing decentralized finance services like lending, borrowing, and staking directly from your phone. NFT Marketplaces on the Go: Seamless platforms for discovering, trading, and managing NFTs on mobile devices. Play-to-Earn Mobile Games: Engaging mobile games that integrate crypto rewards and NFT assets, making Web3 gaming more accessible. Bier’s guidance will be crucial in ensuring these apps are not only functional but also engaging and user-friendly, overcoming a key barrier to mainstream Web3 adoption. Navigating Challenges and Maximizing Benefits in Solana’s Mobile Expansion While the potential is immense, Solana’s mobile journey isn’t without its hurdles. Successfully integrating Web3 into the mobile experience requires careful consideration of: Challenge Consideration User Education Many mobile users are unfamiliar with crypto and Web3 concepts. Apps need to be intuitive and educational, with seamless onboarding processes. Security Concerns Mobile devices are often targets for security threats. Robust security measures are paramount to protect user assets and data within Web3 mobile apps. Gas Fees and Transaction Speed While Solana is known for speed and low fees, optimizing transactions for mobile users and ensuring a smooth experience is critical. Competition from Web2 Giants Existing Web2 mobile platforms have a massive user base. Web3 mobile apps need to offer compelling value propositions to attract users away from established platforms. To overcome these challenges and maximize the benefits, Solana and its app developers should focus on: Prioritizing User Experience (UX): Apps must be incredibly easy to use, even for crypto novices. Focus on simple interfaces and clear value propositions. Building Strong Communities: Foster communities around mobile dApps to provide support, feedback, and drive organic growth. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborate with mobile carriers, device manufacturers, and other relevant players to expand reach and accessibility. Continuous Innovation: The mobile landscape is constantly evolving. Solana needs to stay ahead of the curve, continuously innovating and adapting its mobile strategy. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For crypto enthusiasts and developers, Nikita Bier joining Solana as an advisor is a significant signal. It indicates a serious commitment from Solana to conquer the crypto adoption challenges by focusing on mobile accessibility. For Users: Expect to see more user-friendly and engaging Web3 mobile apps on Solana in the near future. Keep an eye out for innovative applications that simplify your interaction with the crypto world, directly from your smartphone. For Developers: Solana is signaling that it’s a prime platform for building mobile-first Web3 applications. With Bier’s guidance and Solana’s robust infrastructure, there’s a significant opportunity to create impactful and widely adopted mobile dApps.

As of now, ETH is trading just above the crucial support level of $2,000, reflecting a year-to-date decline of 43%. This stark contrast is particularly notable when compared to Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP, which have seen gains of 23% and an astonishing 279%, respectively, during the same period. Could A 60% Surge In Q2 Bring It Back To $3,200? Market expert Lark Davis has drawn attention to the dramatic downturn in Ethereum’s price in a recent social media update, highlighting a 38% drop in Q1 of this year for the altcoin. This figure is alarmingly close to its worst quarterly performance of 46% recorded during the first quarter of 2018, as noted in the comparison chart shared by Davis. Related Reading: XRP Breakout On Hold? Financial Expert Reveals What’s Missing Following that troubling quarter in 2018, Ethereum saw a brief recovery of 15% in Q2, only to face more than 40% declines in the subsequent quarters, respectively, raising concerns for current investors that this pattern might occur once again in this cycle. Despite these discouraging figures, Davis posed an interesting question regarding the potential for an “explosive” second quarter for Ethereum. Historically, since 2016, ETH has averaged a remarkable 66% surge during this period. If this trend continues and the Ethereum price were to achieve a 60% increase in the coming months, its price could climb to $3,200 per token—levels not seen since early February of this year. Crypto Expert Predicts 1,100% Surge For The Ethereum Price While short-term challenges remain, many analysts retain a long-term bullish outlook for Ethereum. Crypto analyst Merlijn drew parallels between the current market conditions and Bitcoin’s past performance, suggesting that Ethereum is poised for a similar trajectory. The analyst noted, “Accumulation, breakout, and V-shape recovery loading,” implying that a new bull run could be on the horizon for ETH, with forecasts suggesting it could reach up to $24,000 during this cycle—a major 1,100% increase.

Expert Ali Martinez recently highlighted key resistance levels that Ethereum must overcome for a sustainable rebound in the short-term. Martinez noted that ETH’s price has reclaimed its realized price of $2,040, but the next significant challenge lies at the $2,300 mark, where strong resistance has been observed for the leading altcoin. Despite a recent recovery that saw a 10% spike in the past two weeks, Ethereum still faces notable monthly losses, down nearly 25% following a broader market correction.

33767162,[object Object],1742965235,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Ripple Accepts SEC Settlement, Reduces Original Fine By Over Half To $50 Million",https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-accepts-sec-settlement-reduces-original-fine/,"In a significant win for Ripple Labs and XRP, the company has reached a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that will effectively conclude their prolonged legal battle . Ending Prolonged Legal Battle As reported by Fox Journalist Eleanor Terret, Ripple has agreed to drop its appeal against the SEC and will pay a reduced fine of $50 million, down from the initially ordered $125 million. The SEC has also indicated its intention to ask Judge Torres to lift the ‘obey the law’ injunction that was previously imposed on the firm. The resolution of this case marks an end to a legal saga that began in 2020 when the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that the company had conducted an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP. According to Terret’s insights, the SEC-Ripple settlement means that, once finalized and voted on by the Commission, the case will be resolved , allowing the blockchain payment company to move forward. Despite the hefty legal fees, estimated to be between $150 million and $200 million, Ripple finds itself returning to a position similar to where it stood before the SEC’s lawsuit. The SEC, too, has presumably incurred significant costs in taxpayer dollars in its pursuit of the case. Ripple’s Legal Victory: Clarity For XRP The legal proceedings had adverse effects on XRP holders, as many exchanges such as Binance, eToro, and Coinbase opted to delist the token during the lawsuit, leading to a notable decline in its market value . This uncertainty made other cryptocurrency projects wary of building their operations in the US, fearing potential legal repercussions from the Securities and Exchange Commission led at the time by Gary Gensler. As highlighted by Terret, critics have pointed out that SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s focus on pursuing crypto firms for failing to register has eroded public trust. The agency has been criticized for overlooking significant threats in the crypto space, such as the collapses of crypto exchange FTX and crypto lender Celsius, which caused substantial losses to investors. For Ripple, there is a silver lining in this settlement , according to Terret. The company is set to pay a smaller fine than originally anticipated and may avoid the ongoing injunction that could have hampered its operations. Additionally, Ripple can take credit for contributing to legal clarity concerning the programmatic and secondary market sales of XRP—a ruling that remains unchallenged. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, expressed optimism in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), indicating that this would likely be his final update on the SEC case. Alderoty noted that the SEC has agreed to drop its appeal without conditions, and Ripple will drop its cross-appeal. The SEC will retain $50 million of the fine, which is already held in an interest-bearing escrow account, while the remaining balance will be returned to Ripple. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.45, reflecting a 9% gain over the seven-day period and inching closer to its current record high of $3.40, which was reached during the 2018 bull run.

The transition ends a long journey beginning back in July 2023 for the layer-1 blockchain that included a community vote in July 2024 and a fierce competition, won by Optimism , among layer-2 networks out to convince the Celo ecosystem to build with their technology. The improved network — like other layer 2s — offers faster and cheaper transactions on top of Ethereum's mainnet. The blockchain is powered by Optimism’s OP Stack, a customizable framework that lets developers build layer-2 networks based off of Optimism’s technology. “You know, whenever people ask us, we always recommend the OP stack, because the team there has been so helpful and so supportive,” said Marek Olszewski, the CEO at cLabs, the main developer firm supporting the Celo blockchain. A blueprint for other layer 1s According to Rene Reisberg, the CEO of the Celo Foundation, the migration is the first of its kind in the Ethereum ecosystem, and will probably be used as a blueprint for other EVM-compatible blockchains that are looking to become a layer-2 network. “This path of not just spinning up a new chain, but actually maintaining that history, and having everyone be on the new chain, while it's a lot more work, is great from a Celo perspective. It's becoming this kind of great case study for Ethereum,” Rene Reinsberg, the president at the Celo Foundation, said in an interview. “Even just based on outreach I've been getting from other L1 founders that are like, ‘hey, so what does it actually feel like on the inside of going through this transition, and how much work is it, and how you're thinking about it?’ And so it definitely feels like there's increased interest now,” Reinsberg added. Despite Ethereum's leaders experiencing backlash from the community because of the clunky experience of operating between the plethora of layer-2 blockchains, the lagging price of ether ( ETH ) relative to other cryptocurrencies and the blockchain losing mindshare and new talent to competitors like Solana, Reinsberg said other layer 1s similar to Celo are watching the transition and also considering moving into the layer-2 ecosystem. “As some of these short-term storms come down and sentiment starts to shift, I think you'll start seeing a series of layer 1s that will likely be more public about that,” Reisberg said. “But we're definitely already seeing these early conversations happening.” Celo’s new home According to the team, Celo end users won’t notice much of a difference in their setups, and will still be able to access key features like SocialConnect , a protocol that connects users' phone numbers or X handles to their Celo wallet addresses to make payments. Nevertheless, there are protocol-level changes. “Validator responsibilities have evolved from operating the consensus protocol to temporarily running community RPC nodes, with validator rewards now distributed via smart contract execution rather than at epoch blocks,” the team said in a press release. “Additionally, transaction sequencing — previously determined by validators running the consensus protocol — will initially be handled by a centralized sequencer, with a roadmap in place for transitioning to decentralized sequencing in the future.” Read more: Celo Community Ratifies Plan to Use Optimism's OP Stack for New Layer-2 Chain",Tech|Celo|celo-foundation|layer 2|Optimism|rollup|Optimism foundation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|OP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-26 05:02:26

ADA is correcting some gains and might find bids near the $0.7380 zone. ADA price started a recovery wave from the $0.690 zone. The price is trading above $0.720 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.7385 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.7550 resistance zone. Cardano Price Holds Support In the past few days, Cardano saw a recovery wave from the $0.690 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA was able to climb above the $0.720 and $0.7320 resistance levels. It even cleared the $0.750 resistance zone. A high was formed at $0.7661 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor move below the $0.750 level.

Custodia said on March 25 that it tokenized US dollar demand deposits and facilitated the issuance, transfer and redemption of the stablecoin “Avit” on Ethereum via the ERC-20 token standard. “A new US dollar payment rail has now been activated inside the US banking system,” Custodia added. “We broke ground on the legal/regulatory front, proving that US banks can collaborate to tokenize demand deposits on a permissionless blockchain in a regulatorily-compliant manner,” said Custodia CEO Caitlin Long. Source: Caitlin Long Vantage Bank CEO and President Jeff Sinnott said the event was a “pivotal moment in reshaping the financial landscape, demonstrating how blockchain and stablecoins can revolutionize payments.” In a series of posts on X, Long explained that the Avit stablecoin was a “real dollar” and not a “synthetic” dollar, as Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller called stablecoins in a Feb. 12 speech. “Real” US dollars, Long explained, can only be issued by the Federal Reserve and a few legally authorized entities, including Custodia Bank. She added that Avit is a “real dollar” as it tokenizes a bank’s demand deposit — funds that customers can withdraw on-demand, such as money in a checking account. Ethereum backers cheer Custodia’s chain choice Custodia has historically championed Bitcoin, and Ethereum advocates were quick to note that the bank chose Ethereum for the stablecoin. “ETH fixed this. Bitcoin couldn’t,” wrote Ethereum advocate Evan Van Ness. Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano also posted to make clear the “permissionless blockchain” Custodia referred to in its announcement. “Just in case it wasn’t obvious, this is built on Ethereum.” Source: Matthew Sigel Related: Ethereum poised for record highs in Q1 2025, analysts predict Ethereum secures over $125.8 billion worth of stablecoins on its network, nearly doubling the second-place Tron blockchain at $64.8 billion, DefiLlama data shows.

The market takes notice—and fast. Bonk, the Solana-based underdog, just surged over 27% in the last seven days, gaining traction from its “for the people” vibe. Meanwhile, Ethereum-born Pepe isn’t sitting still either, chalking up a solid 13% gain this week and catching eyes with a 30% jump in trading volume. But while both Bonk and Pepe are flashing green, there’s something even bigger brewing in presale land—BTFD Coin. With just days left before its LAUNCH100 bonus code expires on March 30, BTFD is the best crypto to buy now for anyone chasing serious upside. The project is gearing up for a breakout, and early investors are already calculating what 2900% ROI could look like when this meme coin hits its predicted moon price of $0.006. Meme coins have always played the long game through community power and cultural hype, but BTFD’s setup is different. With a thriving referral program, an immersive P2E game launched earlier this year, and a 90% APY staking model, it’s not just another hype train—it’s an ecosystem stacked with utility and fun. And right now, there’s a chance to grab 2x tokens—but only if it’s done before the buzzer. BTFD Coin’s Moon Momentum: Referral Program and Bonus Code Fuel the Bull Rush Ever wonder what it’s like to get in early before a meme coin explodes across charts? BTFD is giving everyone that exact shot. At Stage 15 of its presale and trading for just $0.0002, this meme coin presale is packing some serious heat. With over $6.41 million raised and 71 billion tokens sold to more than 11,500+ bulls, it’s not just making waves—it’s setting the tide. BTFD’s most electrifying feature right now? The referral program . It’s not some low-key cashback gimmick—it’s a leaderboard-based system that’s turning community growth into token rewards. Refer friends, family, or fellow degens, and earn 10% of their token buy—if you land in the top 20, the payout is real. Those who get referred also score an extra 10% in tokens, so it’s a win-win hustle during this final stage. Combine that with the LAUNCH100 code that doubles your tokens, and the timing couldn’t be better. A $7,000 investment right now would secure 35 million BTFD tokens. Once the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, that bag’s worth a cool $21,000. But if BTFD rides the bull run to $0.006, that same investment could blast to $210,000. That’s 2900% ROI. Let that number sink in. How to grab BTFD? Just set up a wallet using MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with ETH, BNB, or USDT, then head over to the presale page . Connect your wallet, enter the LAUNCH100 code in all caps, type in your purchase amount, and confirm the buy. Done. Tokens get doubled instantly. It’s that simple. While other meme coins hype community, BTFD’s building it. From the Bulls Squad to the full-blown P2E ecosystem that went live on January 1, 2025, this isn’t just a presale—it’s a party for those who know how to own the dip and run with the bulls. Bonk’s Bounce Back: 27% Weekly Surge and Solana’s Dog Coin Darling Bonk is back in the spotlight. With a 27.99% weekly pump and a recent 2.24% daily gain, this Solana-powered dog-themed meme coin is barking loud again. Created “for the people, by the people,” Bonk’s rise has always been community-fueled, and now that it’s moving again, there’s renewed buzz about its potential to help push Solana even further into the meme coin space. Launched on December 25, 2022, Bonk started strong by airdropping 50% of its supply to the Solana ecosystem, immediately causing a 34% rise in SOL’s price in under 48 hours. Now, despite a 14.99% drop over the past month, Bonk’s rebound shows how fast things can flip in crypto when a project taps into culture. The vibe around Bonk isn’t just memetic—it’s strategic. With its decentralized supply model and loyal user base, this token is creating waves again. Its accessibility and brand power are giving traders serious FOMO. Pepe Pops Off: 13% Weekly Gain and Trading Volume Up Over 30% Pepe might’ve started as a meme, but it’s growing into something more. The Ethereum-based coin named after the internet’s most iconic frog is showing signs of strength again—up 3.99% today and 13.18% over the past seven days, with a trading volume jump of over 30%. Its origins are pure internet culture, but its traction is all blockchain momentum. Launched as a deflationary token, PEPE’s tokenomics are designed to keep things lean while rewarding early supporters. It doesn’t hurt that the meme it’s based on is legendary—giving it an instantly recognizable brand image with every TikTok and tweet. Pepe’s current uptrend proves that the community is still betting big on the frog. While its one-month drop sits at 17.99%, the short-term reversal is stirring attention from crypto analysts who see potential in the project’s bounceback. With whales and retail traders watching, PEPE is making noise again on the charts, and for meme coin enthusiasts looking beyond the hype, it’s one to keep tabs on this month. Final Verdict Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the best crypto to buy now. While Bonk and Pepe are riding solid green waves, BTFD is the only project that still lets investors enter at ground level—with a presale price of just $0.0002, a massive 2900% ROI potential, and a community growing faster than most meme coins in recent memory. The referral program, staking rewards, and full-fledged P2E game are giving investors more than just hype—they’re getting real features and long-term potential. But the window’s closing. The LAUNCH100 bonus code ends March 30, and once that’s gone, so is the 2x token bonus that’s got 11,500+ bulls stampeding in. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Get in now before the final stage closes . Buy BTFD, double your tokens, and ride the bulls to the moon. FAQs What is the best crypto to buy now with high ROI potential? BTFD Coin is considered the best crypto to buy now thanks to its presale price of $0.0002, projected moon price of $0.006, and 2900% ROI potential. How can I claim the BTFD Coin LAUNCH100 bonus code? Connect your wallet on the presale page, enter LAUNCH100 in all caps, confirm the code, and complete your purchase to receive 2x tokens instantly. What makes BTFD Coin different from Bonk and Pepe?

Sato was given a 2-year prison sentence and fined for buying shares in around 10 tender offers before they were made public. Sato’s defense reportedly argued that his investment of around ¥9.5 million (~$63,000 at current exchange rates) and subsequent profit of about ¥3.93 million, was not as bad as similar cases, but the 32-year-old former judge and FSA employee nonetheless received a 2-year prison sentence and fines adding up to around ¥11.2 million. Also tacked on to the sentence were four years of probation. According to local media, Sato argued that he (translated) “wanted to understand the market mechanism from the perspective of a shareholder,” elaborating: “I wanted to have financial security for my aging parents and young children.

42356903,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61685,1742967033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Bullrun Incoming?! Key Ethereum Price Indicators Could Signal A Bullish Stampede, Will Solana Keep Up?",https://timestabloid.com/bullrun-incoming-key-ethereum-price-indicators-could-signal/,"Ethereum’s latest technical signals are sparking talk of an incoming bullrun, with analysts pointing to strong support levels and whale accumulation as early signs of a major breakout. While Solana attempts to catch up after recent volatility, a new contender Remittix is quietly building momentum. With real-world payment utility and a presale gaining rapid traction, Remittix is now on analysts’ radars as the ERC-20 token that could steal the spotlight in the next market surge. Ethereum Accumulation Zone Attracts Big Investors and Whales Ethereum is holding firm above $2,000, trading at around $2,071 after briefly touching $2,104 today. The recent 1% dip hasn’t shaken investor confidence, especially with analysts like MAXPAIN suggesting the pullback could open up a high-conviction buy zone near $1,900. Many see this potential dip as the calm before a storm one that could kick off Ethereum’s next explosive leg upward. On-chain signals continue to lean bullish. Daily volume remains strong above $10 billion, while ETH futures open interest is climbing clear signs that traders and institutions are circling with intent. Nearly half a million ETH has been scooped up by large players recently, with over 1.2 million ETH exiting exchanges and moving into private wallets and staking contracts. That’s a supply crunch waiting to happen, especially with retail investors now re-entering the market. The accumulation zone between $1,871 and $1,981 has become a stronghold, with both whales and long-term holders building positions. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s long/short ratio has jumped to 55% in favor of longs, further hinting at building bullish pressure in the derivatives market. As Ethereum gears up for what could be a textbook bullrun , traders are questioning whether Solana can keep up. But even more interestingly, some investors are already betting on newer Ethereum -based projects like Remittix. Solana Climbs Back After March Slump and Gains 6 Percent in a Day Solana price has been bouncing back after a rough stretch, clawing its way from a March 11 low of $118 to a current price near $145.74. That’s an 18.8% gain in just over a week, reigniting interest in whether Solana can keep pace as the broader market teases a potential bullrun. After reaching $298 back in January, Solana price has struggled to regain that kind of momentum but analysts believe the tide might be turning. Crypto analyst Satoshi Flipper pointed to a symmetrical triangle forming on Solana’s 4-hour chart, a pattern that typically suggests an impending breakout. If SOL can break and hold above the $132 resistance line, the triangle’s technical target suggests a move to $152 could follow. That’s a realistic 10% climb, modest in crypto terms but significant considering the recent sell pressure across the market. Remittix Gains Momentum as Ethereum Builds Toward a Bull Run Investors hungry for the next big winner aren’t just watching the legacy giants anymore, they’re turning to Remittix (RTX) , an Ethereum -based altcoin that’s rewriting what real-world utility looks like in crypto. While most tokens ride hype cycles, Remittix is riding a structural shift in the payment industry and that makes all the difference. Remittix is positioning itself as the go-to solution for crypto-to-fiat transfers, allowing users to send digital assets and have them arrive as cash in a bank account anywhere in the world. That may sound simple, but the underlying system challenges outdated financial rails, eliminates excessive fees and opens the door for the unbanked to tap into global finance. Its PayFi protocol bridges DeFi and real-world finance in a way few others have managed and the market is noticing. Already, the presale has pulled in over $14+ million, with more than 522 million tokens sold at just $0.0734. This isn’t just another early-stage token with big promises, it’s a functioning concept with a target market worth over $190 trillion. With that kind of runway, analysts say a 50x to 100x rally after launch isn’t just possible, it’s increasingly likely. Investors Bet Big on Remittix as the Best Crypto Presale of the Year While Ethereum’s long-term chart looks primed for a surge and Solana teases a technical breakout, Remittix offers something entirely different utility in motion. This is why seasoned investors aren’t just asking whether ETH or SOL will lead the next bull run. They’re watching which token brings lasting impact. For many, Remittix checks that box. And if the broader market turns risk-on, this could be one of the most explosive tokens heading into the next leg up.

Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez revealed that whales bought 200 million coins in the last 14 days. As a response, traders and investors project substantial bullishness over future DOGE price prospects. Dogecoin Whales Buy 200M Coins In Just 2 Weeks Analyst Ali Martinez revealed in an X post on March 26 that Dogecoin whales sacked 200 million coins over the past two weeks. This accumulation saga, occurring despite broader price volatility, has reinforced positive market sentiments on the meme coin’s price trajectory. Source: Ali Charts, X For context, rising whale accumulations underscore heightened market interest in the crypto. In turn, traders and investors anticipate that price gains loom, given the increased buying pressure and demand for the token. Is Dogecoin Recovering? It’s worth mentioning that the whale accumulations occurred as DOGE price recovered from $0.15 to $0.19 since March 11 to 25 (the past 14 days). The dog-themed meme token is up nearly 25% in two weeks, aligning with Dogecoin whales’ trade movers that offer price support. DOGE Price Rally Ahead? As of press time, DOGE token’s price was up nearly 5% intraday and exchanged hands at $0.1910. The meme coin bottomed and peaked at $0.1825 and $0.1955 in the last 24 hours. Furthermore, the weekly chart for the crypto showcased gains worth 14%, aligning with the massive buying in recent days. Market watchers continue to anticipate more gains ahead, escorted by whale data and other market dynamics. Crypto Analyst Sparks Market Optimism With Bullish Projection Another renowned market analyst recently posted on X, projecting a highly bullish outlook for the crypto. Analyst ‘Trader Tardigrade’ revealed that DOGE price is finalizing the last stage of ‘cycle 3.’ Based on historical price movements, this prediction highlights that a massive upswing awaits. Simultaneously, Dogecoin whales’ recent trade movers have further cemented market sentiments of an enormous rally ahead. Source: Trader Tardigrade, X Futures OI Adds Market Optimism It’s also worth mentioning that DOGE futures OI soared 6%, reaching $1.94 billion today. Moreover, the derivatives volume rose 16% to $4.09 billion, per Coinglass data. This statistic further underlined a significant rise in market interest for the crypto, adding to bullish sentiments over long-term prospects. Even a recent report by CoinGape spotlighted that Dogecoin price eyes gains worth 10x ahead, as confirmed by analysts.

The Investment Modernization Act (House Bill 506), introduced by Representative Brenden Jones on March 24, would create an independent investment authority under the state’s Treasury to determine which digital assets could be suitable for inclusion into the state retirement funds. An identical bill, the State Investment Modernization Act (Senate Bill 709), was introduced into the state’s Senate on March 25. The bills define a digital asset as a cryptocurrency, stablecoin, non-fungible token (NFT), or any other asset that is electronic in nature that confers economic, proprietary or access rights. The North Carolina bills don’t set market cap criteria for digital assets, unlike other crypto bills that are working their way into law at the state level. Source: Bitcoin Laws The newly created agency, dubbed the North Carolina Investment Authority, would, however, need to carefully weigh the risk and reward profile of each digital asset and ensure the funds are maintained in a secure custody solution. Bitcoin legislation tracker Bitcoin Laws noted on X that House Bill 506 wasn’t drafted as a Bitcoin reserve bill as it does not mandate the investment authority to hold Bitcoin ( BTC ) — or any digital asset — over the long term. North Carolina wants in on Bitcoin bill race On March 18, North Carolina senators introduced the Bitcoin Reserve and Investment Act (Senate Bill 327), which calls for the treasurer to allocate up to 10% of public funds specifically into Bitcoin. The bill — introduced by Republicans Todd Johnson, Brad Overcash and Timothy Moffitt — aims to leverage Bitcoin investment as a “financial innovation strategy” to strengthen North Carolina’s economic standing. Related: GameStop hints at future Bitcoin purchases following board approval The treasurer would need to ensure that the Bitcoin is stored in a multi-signature cold storage wallet , and the BTC could only be liquidated during a “severe financial crisis,” with approval from two-thirds of North Carolina’s General Assembly. The bill would also create a Bitcoin Economic Advisory Board to oversee the reserve’s management. According to Bitcoin Law, 41 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced at the state level in 23 states, and 35 of those 41 bills remain live. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, both of which will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases.

He announced that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is following the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in removing “reputational risk” as a factor in bank supervision. This change effectively rolls back the controversial Operation Chokepoint 2.0 policies, which had led to the unfair debanking of crypto companies. Sacks said that this is a big step forward for crypto. Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which was supported by figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren, used vague criteria like “reputational risk” to target crypto businesses. This meant that institutions could be punished for negative publicity, whether true or not. The new policy change will make banking criteria more objective and fair, preventing political influence from hurting the crypto sector. Sacks also credited Senator Tim Scott for his leadership in pushing these changes, especially through the Financial Institution Reform and Modernization (FIRM) Act. This move is expected to create a better environment for crypto businesses and could lead to higher prices for digital assets in the future. Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett added more context, explaining why “regulation by enforcement” doesn’t work. She explained that Ripple has spent between $150 million and $200 million in legal fees over the years, only to end up in the same position it was in when the SEC first filed the lawsuit in 2020.

Despite Bitcoin’s (BTC) uncertainty, Ethereum prices today hit a daily high of No data found for ethereum on 19 minutes ago after No data found for ethereum on 19 minutes ago% move on March 26. Why is Ethereum Price Down Today? The recent consolidation in BTC has caused Ethereum’s price to pause its bullishness, which is why it’s down today. However, if BTC regains its bullish momentum and hits $90K, ETH price will also extend its gains. Regardless, investors need to be careful as technical analysis points to a potential drop in BTC toward $85K to fill the CME gap formed over the previous weekend. *Ethereum price updated as of No data found for ethereum on 19 minutes ago. Fractals Forecast Five Digit Target For ETH Based on fractal analysis posted by two crypto analysts, the target for ETH is in the five digits. The first fractal shows a target beyond $10,000 per Ethereum token. The second analysis’ target is around $20,000. The former analysis notes a “1, 2, 3 bounce pattern” in 2017, 2018, and 2020. The rally that emerged after these three bounces led to a move from $100 to $4,900. If this outlook repeats, Ethereum price could hit $10,000 to $11,000. The second fractal shows a declining broadening wedge pattern. Ethereum Price Prediction & Analysis The technical analysis of the Ethereum price on the daily time frame reveals successive higher highs and higher lows, signaling an effort from buyers to flip the bearish trend. As noted in the chart below, the key resistance levels at $2,100 and $2,166 need to be flipped into support levels to confirm the start of a bullish trend. In such a case, ETH price could attempt 20%, 28%, and 40% rallies to tag the $2,600, $2,770, and $3,000 resistance levels. So far, Ethereum has already tagged the $2,100 level and is currently retracing to find its footing. As long as this digital asset forms a higher low above $1,934, the recently formed bullish trend will remain intact. In this case, investors can expect the next leg to tag the $2,166 hurdle and the subsequent level mentioned above. ETH/USDT 1-day chart Supporting these bullish Ethereum price prediction targets are the CME gaps at $2,623, $2,888, $3,237, and $3,930. If the buying pressure remains strong coupled Bitcoin’s macro bullish outlook , the momentum will be enough to push ETH price to $4,000 in April. ETH/USDT CME 1-day chart On the other hand, if Ethereum price breaks the $2,134 low, it will suggest that the bears or selling pressure is dominant. In such a case, ETH will revisit the $1,756 key support level. A breakdown of this level will invalidate the bullish thesis and potentially crash the altcoin down to $1,500. Other Factors That Affect Ethereum’s Predictions and Analysis Spot Ethereum ETF outflows have been reducing since February 26 and hit zero on Monday. If this trend continues, ETH ETFs might see an inflow, adding to the overall positive outlook for the cryptocurrency. Roughly $701 million worth of short positions will be forced to close, aka liquidation, if the Ethereum price hits $2,114, based on CoinGlass data . A forced closing of short position means that investors are forced to buy back, which adds buying pressure to the already bullish outlook for ETH.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped 0.59% in 24 hours to $2.44. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Following this, the SEC will file a motion to lift the injunction, which Ripple will not contest. Once the judge signs off, the case will be finalized, most likely within 60 days. Talking about the XRP price, it is currently up 0.97% to $2.45. If the bullish momentum continues, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.549. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price will remain range-bound between its key support levels at $2.364 and $2.33. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.45459950 0.94% Market cap $ 142,754,871,633.46 Circulating Supply 58,158,111,605.00 Trading Volume $ 2,687,164,687.6862 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as Franklin Templeton has announced filing for an XRP ETF. Once launched, it is expected to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). The exchange inflow vs outflow graph from March 1st to March 11th shows 501k outflows in comparison to 482k inflows. This signals a spike in strong investor interest, which is a big thumbs-up for XRP. XRP Exchange Inflow vs Outflow If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the long-term XRP price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

With this, it has extended its weekly losses to 28% amid delays in mainnet launch, Binance listing, etc. and initial investor sentiment waning significantly. Investors are turning anxious about whether the Pi Coin price could stage an upside above $1 anytime soon or not. Pi Network Core Team Needs to Step Up With delays in plans of a mainnet launch, listing on Binance, or the Pi Domain auction , the Pi community members are seeking answers from the Core team, asking them to step up the game, as the Pi Coin price faces a steep fall from $3 to $0.82. Community members believe that the recent turbulence comes as the Core Team (CT) remains silent on critical updates. Furthermore, there have been allegations that the Pi core team has been drifting away from its promise of full decentralization, to now attracting big institutions. Large corporations handling billions of dollars in daily transactions naturally prioritize security and transaction speed over complete decentralization. With these opposing interests, the Pi Network core team seems to have made some compromises while trying to strike a balance between inclusivity and global adoption. Popular community member, Dr. Altcoin noted: “We should embrace this collaboration between everyday users and big institutions. High-volume trading driven by businesses is what is required to drive our utilities, and that will ultimately push the price upward. The Core Team should also remain committed to rewarding the Pi community. Without the Pi community, the Pi Network would have been just another typical memecoin story”. What Happens to Pi Coin Price Next? Despite the strong community back, the Pi Coin price has been seeing a one-directional downside all the way to $0.82. Crypto analyst Moon Jeff has issued a bold prediction regarding Pi Network’s price trajectory. According to Jeff, the token is poised to decline to $0.60, which he identifies as its last significant support level. Source: Moon Jeff Despite this, the analyst remains optimistic of the Pi Coin price recovery , suggesting that a rebound from this point could spark a rally toward the $5 mark. Dr. Altcoin also shared a similar outlook noting: “Let’s HODL and buy both Patience and Pi together while they’re still available. Let’s also not be surprised if Pi shoots up to $3.14 in the coming weeks or even to $10 in the coming months”. Recent reports also suggest a projected PI listing on the crypto exchange Upbit .

But 2025’s shaping up a little differently. A rising presale project, Remittix (RTX) , just blasted past $14 million raised, and analysts are starting to question whether the old guard can keep up. While Cardano continues to roll out updates and try to maintain relevance, Remittix is skipping the slow climb and heading straight for utility bringing swift payments, low gas fees and real-world use cases to the table. And with early growth this strong, some are wondering if we’re witnessing a major passing of the torch. Cardano (ADA): All Tech, No Hype? Cardano’s doing what Cardano always does building carefully, slowly and with a whole lot of peer review. But in 2025’s fast-paced market, that’s starting to feel like a bit of a liability. ADA is down over 2% in the past month despite a brief surge in the last 24 hours , and the much-hyped Plomin Hard Fork hasn’t made the impact many were hoping for. Some analysts still give Cardano a 1300% upside target but it’s going to need some serious firepower to hit that. On-chain stats show Cardano is largely held by long-term wallets , with low whale concentration giving it some stability. Meanwhile, projects like Remittix are flying out of presale with big promises and bigger momentum. ADA might still rise but it’s got competition. Remittix Disrupts The Status Quo In Global Payments For all the advancements in blockchain technology, using crypto for real-world payments is still far too difficult. Long withdrawal times, high conversion fees and banking restrictions have turned digital assets into a speculative investment rather than a practical financial tool. That’s where Remittix (RTX) is stepping in to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance. By offering instant crypto-to-FIAT conversion, Remittix enables users to send funds directly to any bank account worldwide, removing the delays and excessive costs that have plagued the industry for years. For Diego, a freelance software developer in Argentina, these issues meant that his USDT payments from clients overseas were stuck in processing for days before he could withdraw them in Pesos. With Remittix, he now converts and receives his funds instantly, avoiding the hassle of slow exchanges. Similarly, Sarah, an expat in Canada, used to deal with high remittance fees when sending money to her family in Nigeria. Now, with Remittix, she can send stablecoins and her family receives local currency in their bank account within hours without overpaying on transaction fees. Remittix is also changing the game for privacy. It offers a suitable alternative to highly monitored traditional systems instead of prioritizing privacy and control. When users send funds through Remittix, the recipient receives a standard bank deposit with no visible link to cryptocurrency, allowing for greater autonomy without excessive oversight. For users in countries where banking regulations are strict, this feature provides a crucial way to manage funds freely and securely. Investors Pour Into The Remittix Presale Investors are racing to get in on the Remittix presale, snapping up RTX tokens for just $0.0734 a piece. The project’s extensive value proposition has led analysts to project a steep 800% price rise before the presale’s end, with more growth expected post-launch. For any PayFi enthusiast or savvy investor looking to stay ahead of the game in 2025, this is not a project to pass up on.

Meanwhile, BlackRock launched its first Bitcoin ETP in Europe to capitalize on institutional interest with competitive pricing and regulatory clarity across the EU. On the geopolitical front, Donald Trump’s renewed trade war with China is pushing for stronger domestic Bitcoin mining, which may actually benefit US manufacturers like Auradine, especially as they roll out better mining rigs and off-grid solutions to meet rising demand and reduce reliance on Chinese tech. GameStop Turns to Crypto GameStop Corporation, which was once known primarily as a struggling video game retailer turned meme stock sensation, is making headlines yet again. This time, the company is turning heads for stepping into the world of digital assets. The company officially announced plans to invest in Bitcoin and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins, which is a major pivot in its financial strategy. According to a March 25 report by CNBC, GameStop’s board unanimously approved the initiative, which will see a portion of its corporate cash or future debt issuances allocated toward cryptocurrency holdings. This move was confirmed in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which explicitly states that GameStop’s investment policy now permits holdings in certain cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and stablecoins. As of Feb. 1, GameStop’s cash reserves stood at over $4.77 billion. This was a huge jump from $921.7 million a year before, and means that GameStop has a great foundation for its digital asset ambitions. The company also posted $1.283 billion in net sales for Q4 and $3.823 billion for fiscal 2024. GameStop's shift towards crypto is very similar to the strategic moves of companies like Strategy, whose Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has been one of Bitcoin’s most vocal corporate advocates. Speculation about GameStop’s crypto interest began in February when CEO Ryan Cohen posted a photo on social media with Saylor. This caused rumors of an imminent Bitcoin acquisition. That buzz has now materialized into concrete action. Just this week, Strategy announced another purchase of 6,911 Bitcoin, which brought its total holdings to 506,137 BTC. GameStop is now also signaling its belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Strategy controls around 2.4% of Bitcoin’s total supply, and GameStop may be looking to emulate that model as it continues its transformation from a meme-driven retail story into a modern, diversified company with a bold vision for the future. BlackRock Launches Bitcoin ETP in Europe Other companies are also expanding their business with Bitcoin. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently expanded its crypto offerings into Europe with the launch of a new Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP). The iShares Bitcoin ETP started trading on March 25 across several European stock exchanges, including Xetra, Euronext Amsterdam, and Euronext Paris. This move builds on the success of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in the United States, which attracted $50.7 billion in assets under management and currently accounts for around 2.73% of the total Bitcoin supply. Details about BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETP Despite the ETP’s strong debut, market analysts are cautious about expecting similar explosive demand in Europe. Stephen Wundke , director of strategy and revenue at crypto investment firm Algoz, stated that regulated crypto investment options have been more accessible in Europe than in the US, and Bitcoin is easier to purchase directly. He also believes that while the new ETP provides an avenue for traditional family offices to hold digital gold, the European market likely won’t see $60 billion in inflows any time soon. The ETP trades under different tickers depending on the exchange: IB1T on Xetra and Euronext Paris, and BTCN on Euronext Amsterdam. The product launched with a promotional fee waiver of 10 basis points, reducing the total expense ratio to 0.15% through the end of 2025. This makes BlackRock’s ETP one of the most competitively priced offerings on the market, especially compared to CoinShares’ Physical Bitcoin ETP that charges 0.25%. Wundke thinks that this aggressive pricing strategy is designed to limit competition and test the resolve of potential new entrants, ultimately benefiting investors and the digital asset space by pushing providers to offer better terms. This is BlackRock’s first crypto ETP launch outside of North America. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of Europe and Middle East iShares Product, described the launch as a tipping point for the industry, thanks to growing demand from both retail and institutional investors. Ajay Dhingra , head of research at Unizen, added that BlackRock’s decision reflects its confidence in the European Union’s regulatory framework for crypto assets. Unlike the United States, which has experienced policy inconsistency under different administrations, the EU has steadily pursued a regulated approach to blockchain adoption, offering the regulatory clarity that firms like BlackRock value. Trump’s Trade War Boosts US Bitcoin Miners Amid the renewed trade tensions between the United States and China, President Donald Trump’s push to strengthen domestic Bitcoin mining could greatly benefit US-based mining rig manufacturers. Although the US contributes more than 40% of the global Bitcoin hashrate, it still relies heavily on mining equipment made in China, where Bitmain dominates the market with an estimated 90% share . Industry voices, like Sanjay Gupta , chief strategy officer at Auradine, believe Trump’s focus on boosting the American Bitcoin mining industry proves the urgency of reducing dependence on foreign technology. The friction between the two nations already impacted Bitcoin firms operating in the US. Last year, thousands of mining rigs were reportedly delayed at American ports. This was allegedly due to confusion over their classification as unauthorized Chinese radio frequency devices. These supply chain issues were only exacerbated by escalating trade tensions, which Gupta said have led to growing uncertainty and delays in hardware shipments. While the US has been vying with China to gain an edge in high-end chip manufacturing, these challenges only intensified for American miners. Despite its dominance, Bitmain has begun expanding its footprint into the US to improve supply chain efficiency, and even launched a new production line in December. Auradine, meanwhile, sees an opportunity in Trump’s onshoring agenda. Gupta believes that rising domestic mining could increase pressure on the US electric grid, which means that there is a need for off-grid solutions. His company recently launched the Teraflux AH3880 hydro-cooled Bitcoin miner to compete with major players like Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan. On concerns over decentralization, Gupta believes increased US mining could benefit the Bitcoin network, provided that the growth remains aligned with sustainable and decentralized practices. Still, the growing concentration of hash power in the US and China raises some serious questions about long-term balance in the network’s security and distribution.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-26 05:59:14

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced plans to eliminate the use of “reputational risk” in bank supervision—an often-criticized factor in the debanking of crypto firms—while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) closed its investigation into Web3 gaming platform Immutable without pursuing enforcement action. FDIC Moves to Eliminate “Reputational Risk” as a Supervisory Tool in Shift Toward Crypto-Friendly Oversight The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has revealed plans to eliminate “reputational risk” as a factor in bank supervision. The shift is being heralded by digital asset advocates as a long-overdue step toward a more transparent and fair regulatory environment, especially for blockchain-based businesses long sidelined by traditional financial institutions. According to a letter dated March 24 from FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill to US Representative Dan Meuser, the agency has completed a comprehensive review of all mentions of reputational risk across its regulatory and policy frameworks. As a result, the FDIC now “plans to eradicate this concept from our regulatory approach.” “While a bank’s reputation is critically important, most activities that could threaten a bank’s reputation do so through traditional risk channels (e.g., credit risk, market risk, etc.) that supervisors already focus on,” Hill wrote, emphasizing a more objective and quantifiable framework for supervision. The letter, first reported by Politico , signals a growing recognition that reputational risk—a vague and often subjective regulatory standard—has been misused to marginalize certain industries. The Federal Reserve defines reputational risk as “the potential that negative publicity regarding an institution’s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.” Critics argue that this broad and nebulous standard has been weaponized to restrict banking access to industries that are politically or socially controversial, regardless of their actual financial or operational risk. Nowhere has the impact of reputational risk been more acutely felt than in the digital asset sector. Blockchain startups, cryptocurrency exchanges, and Web3 developers have struggled for years to obtain or maintain banking relationships, with some institutions citing reputational concerns as justification for abrupt account closures or rejections. This systemic issue gained national attention in 2023, following the collapse of several crypto-friendly banks, and the subsequent wave of what many labeled Operation Chokepoint 2.0—a reference to the Obama-era program that allegedly pressured banks to sever ties with industries deemed “high-risk,” including firearms dealers, payday lenders, and later, crypto firms. More than 30 digital asset and tech companies were reportedly debanked during this period, with no clear path to regulatory recourse. Critics argued that these decisions were not based on measurable financial risks but rather ideological or reputational judgments made behind closed doors. Acting Chairman Hill’s letter marks a notable change in tone and substance. In it, Hill acknowledges that the FDIC has been “closed for business” to institutions interested in blockchain or distributed ledger technologies. However, he also revealed that the agency is now “working on a new direction for digital asset policy” with the goal of providing a pathway for banks to safely and responsibly engage with the sector. The letter was sent in response to a February initiative from Rep. Meuser and several other lawmakers, who had urged US financial regulators to adopt clear digital asset policies and put an end to arbitrary debanking practices. Their communication included a list of recommendations for crafting digital asset rules that promote innovation while safeguarding financial stability. Hill’s response may signal that such recommendations are being taken seriously, at least at the FDIC. While it remains to be seen how other regulatory bodies—such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve—will follow suit, the move could lay the groundwork for a more inclusive regulatory environment for digital assets in the United States. Industry and Lawmaker Reactions The crypto industry has responded positively, with many seeing the move as a clear repudiation of the informal but damaging barriers that have long limited institutional engagement with Web3 technologies. The FDIC’s planned removal of reputational risk from its supervisory vocabulary does not automatically translate into regulatory clarity or guaranteed access for crypto companies. However, it eliminates a major institutional barrier and signals that the agency is willing to reevaluate the way it governs financial innovation. SEC Closes Investigation into Immutable, Signaling Major Win for Web3 Gaming Industry In other news, Ethereum layer-2 developer Immutable announced that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally ended its investigation into the company, deciding not to pursue any enforcement action. The development marks a critical turning point for the rapidly evolving GameFi space and adds momentum to a broader shift in regulatory posture toward blockchain innovators. In a statement issued on March 25, Immutable said the closure of the SEC’s inquiry effectively “closes the loop” on a Wells notice the firm received in late 2023. The Wells notice — a warning that the SEC may bring a lawsuit after believing it has uncovered violations of securities law — had sparked concern throughout the blockchain gaming world, which has long been in regulatory limbo. “We are pleased the SEC has concluded its inquiry. This marks a significant milestone for the crypto industry and gaming as we advance towards a future with regulatory clarity,” said Robbie Ferguson, president and co-founder of Immutable. An Immutable spokesperson said that the company received an unexpected termination letter from the SEC, which offered no rationale for why the agency had closed the case. The decision came without any further communication or demand for action, and appears to be based solely on the information Immutable had previously provided. Immutable was under scrutiny over a 2021 blog post describing the listing and private sale of its IMX token, including claims around pre-launch token pricing and valuation. The SEC reportedly took issue with a statement that pre-launch investors bought IMX at $0.10, issued at a ”$10 pre-100:1 split” — an assertion the SEC considered potentially misleading regarding the nature of the transaction. Immutable had previously expressed strong confidence in its compliance position, stating that there was a legitimate exchange of value and that it would “vigorously defend” itself if needed. With the investigation now closed, that defense will no longer be necessary — at least from the SEC. While the federal regulator has stepped back, Rosen Law Firm, a New York-based securities class-action specialist, has sought to use the now-defunct Wells notice as a foundation for a private lawsuit over the IMX token. Immutable’s spokesperson brushed off the potential legal challenge, saying the company is “not concerned” about it. A New Era of Regulatory Rollbacks? The SEC’s decision to halt its probe into Immutable is part of a broader pattern. Over recent months, the agency has also dropped investigations into high-profile crypto entities including OpenSea, Robinhood, Uniswap Labs, and Gemini. Many of these rollbacks have occurred under the renewed leadership direction of President Donald Trump, whose administration has taken steps to dismantle aggressive enforcement strategies that gained traction during previous years. Trump has repeatedly promised to “liberate” the crypto industry from what he characterized as stifling regulation and bureaucratic hostility. In addition to closing investigations, the SEC has scaled back or abandoned several lawsuits — most notably against Ripple Labs, Coinbase, and Kraken — which had once been seen as emblematic of the regulator’s hardline stance. The conclusion of the SEC’s investigation could be a significant confidence boost for Web3 gaming platforms and investors. For years, major AAA game studios and traditional gaming publishers have cited legal uncertainty as a key reason for staying on the sidelines of blockchain gaming. Immutable, which powers the Immutable X layer-2 network on Ethereum, has positioned itself as a pioneer in blockchain gaming infrastructure. With a strong lineup of partnerships and a growing ecosystem of Web3 game titles, the regulatory green light is likely to embolden other platforms to enter the space or scale their operations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|MX,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-26 06:00:00

According to Massad, the president’s crypto works are largely similar to pump-and-dump schemes, raising questions about Trump’s intentions and ethics. Trump launched his meme coin before taking office, and his family still has a giant stake in WLFI Trump isn’t the first president to come to office with side businesses or multiple assets. But, to preclude any conflict of interest, most former presidents, like Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, arranged to place their holdings in a blind trust. In contrast, Donald Trump handed day-to-day management to his sons but kept all his shares in his businesses during his first term. Despite facing criticism for violating traditional norms of conflict of interest, Trump did so again before taking office for his second term. This time, however, his conflicts of interest are larger than in his first term. In addition to his real estate projects, Trump has ventured into crypto. Days before being sworn in, Trump released his personal meme coin, which began to gain traction, going from less than $10 to above $75 in less than a week after launch. Additionally, by February’s start, Trump had earned nearly $100 million from token trading, despite criticism from ethics experts. However, the token has tanked in value since and is now worth just $11.37. Aside from his meme coin project, the Trump family still has a stake in World Liberty Financial, about 75% of the platform’s net revenue, and a 60% stake in the holding company. While Trump does not have any position in WLFI, his name and those of his three sons are on the whitepaper’s list of supporting teams as “Chief Crypto Advocate.” Massad believes Trump’s crypto projects may add no value to people The Trump administration has been actively involved in crypto policy development and even agreed to establish a BTC reserve and digital asset stockpile. However, crypto community members have questioned whether Trump means well for the industry or if he’s just looking for more ways to propel his projects. Some have pointed out that Trump’s crypto projects and political influence are now seemingly intertwined, presenting huge conflicts of interest. Tim Massad even commented, “I think it’s unprecedented and plainly wrong for a President of the United States to engage in commercial ventures or have his family and associates engage in commercial ventures that can be directly influenced by the policies he adopts as President or the statements he makes about those policies.” In his view, a US president should not participate in any economic ventures while in office, especially those that pose blatant conflicts of interest, given that crypto regulation is still a top priority for the administration. He added that he does not see any of Trump’s crypto businesses as valuable to people, saying that the projects “all just have a character of taking advantage of people.” Before WLFI was launched, Alex Miller, CEO of Hiro, a Web3 platform, called the project an “obvious pump scheme.” Similarly, influential figures Mark Cuban, Max Keiser, and Anthony Scaramucci pushed back against Trump’s decision to proceed with WLF’s token sales. To add to Trump’s controversial projects, TRON founder Justin Sun invested in WLFI, buying $30 million worth of WLF tokens in November, and got recruited as an advisor. Then, he invested another $45 million in the project on Trump’s inauguration. Sun’s involvement in WLFI came under heavy scrutiny, with some suggesting that his past run-ins with the SEC motivated his contributions. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The crypto asset showed upward momentum earlier in the week, briefly rallying beyond $88,000. Although the rally has slowed, the broader market remains focused on whether Bitcoin’s recent performance signals a temporary correction or a more substantial shift in trend. Market analysts have turned to on-chain metrics for additional clarity. One such analyst, Burak Kesmeci, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, recently examined four key cyclical indicators to assess whether Bitcoin’s bullish phase is losing steam. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Realized Cap and UTXO Data Signal a Major Shift—Here’s What to Watch Key Indicators Reflect Mixed Sentiment According to Kesmeci, while some metrics suggest weakness, they do not yet indicate a market top. Kesmeci’s first point highlights the Internal Funding Pressure (IFP) metric, which currently stands at 696K—below its 90-day simple moving average (SMA90) of 794K. Historically, a cross above the SMA90 tends to signal renewed bullish momentum, but for now, the metric suggests a lack of reversal strength. The second metric analyzed is the Bull & Bear Market Cycle Indicator. Kesmeci notes the current setup mirrors earlier soft bearish signals observed during this cycle. The 30-day moving average (DMA30) sits at -0.16, while the longer-term 365-day moving average (DMA365) is at 0.18. Until the shorter-term average crosses above the longer-term trend, the indicator remains tilted toward bearish sentiment. Do 4 Different Cyclical On-Chain Metrics Signal the End of Bitcoin’s Bull Market? “All of these metrics suggest that Bitcoin is experiencing significant turbulence in the short to mid-term. However, none of them indicate that Bitcoin has reached an overheated or cycle-top… pic.twitter.com/tPw74wqERy — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 25, 2025 Bitcoin MVRV and NUPL Provide Additional Clues Kesmeci also assessed the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) score, which remains below its 365-day SMA. Historically, this positioning tends to precede increased selling pressure, although a rebound is possible once the score crosses back above its moving average. The last such event occurred during the August 2024 carry trade crisis, which was resolved with a recovery after macroeconomic pressures eased. Similarly, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric sits below its SMA365. Currently, NUPL stands at 0.49, compared to a moving average of 0.53. While not a definitive end to the bullish trend, the metric’s position implies that further strength is needed for Bitcoin to regain bullish footing.

Drawing comparisons to last year’s macro-driven selloff, he suggests that external factors—such as recent economic uncertainty and tariff-related tensions—may be temporarily suppressing BTC’s performance.

The Immutable ( IMX ) token rose around 15% on March 25 to reach just under $0.74 shortly after the firm announced that the SEC shut its inquiry without any breach of violations, which Immutable said closed “the loop on the Wells notice issued by the SEC last year.” IMX matched crypto market downtrend It is the highest price that IMX has reached since March 3, before a broader market decline — driven by prolonged uncertainty over US President Donald Trump’s tariffs and US interest rates — pushed it down to $0.46 on March 11. At the time of publication, IMX had retraced back to $0.67, according to CoinMarketCap. A move back toward $0.70 would wipe approximately $449,500 in short positions, according to CoinGlass data. IMX is up 0.34% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap While the token price surged on the positive news, it barely moved when Immutable announced in November it had been issued a Wells notice. However, the broader market was already gaining momentum as Trump’s odds to win the election looked strong in the days before his eventual win on Nov. 5. Immutable co-founder Robbie Ferguson said in a March 25 X post that the SEC’s dropped investigation was “an enormous win for Web3 gaming.” “After a year of fighting, this threat to digital ownership rights has finally been put to rest,” Ferguson said.

Set to unfold between April 11th and June 6th, these sessions promise to delve into the most pressing issues facing the digital asset space. Are you ready to understand how these discussions could reshape the future of your crypto investments? Decoding the SEC Crypto Task Force Roundtable Schedule According to a recent update from Unfolded on X, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force is intensifying its engagement with the crypto industry. This initiative signals a proactive approach from regulators to grapple with the complexities of digital assets. The scheduled roundtables are strategically designed to cover a spectrum of critical themes. Let’s break down the key areas of focus: Regulation: The cornerstone of any established financial system. Understanding the nuances of crypto regulation is paramount for businesses and investors alike. Crypto Custody: Ensuring the safe storage and management of digital assets is non-negotiable. Crypto custody solutions are evolving rapidly, and these roundtables will likely explore best practices and potential regulatory frameworks. Tokenization: The process of representing real-world assets on a blockchain is gaining momentum. Discussions around tokenization will likely explore its potential benefits and regulatory considerations. DeFi: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is revolutionizing traditional finance. The roundtables dedicated to DeFi regulation are particularly anticipated, given the sector’s rapid growth and novel challenges. These roundtables are not just procedural; they are critical forums where industry experts, regulators, and stakeholders converge to shape the trajectory of crypto. The outcomes of these discussions could significantly influence future policies and enforcement actions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Why is Crypto Regulation a Central Theme? The spotlight on crypto regulation is no surprise. As the crypto market matures and becomes increasingly integrated into the global financial system, the need for clear and consistent rules becomes more urgent. But what exactly makes regulating crypto so challenging? Global Nature: Cryptocurrencies operate across borders, making jurisdictional enforcement complex. Technological Novelty: The underlying technology is constantly evolving, requiring regulators to stay ahead of the curve. Decentralization: The decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies challenges traditional regulatory frameworks designed for centralized entities. Investor Protection: Ensuring investor safety in a volatile and often opaque market is a primary concern for regulators. These roundtables present an opportunity to bridge the gap between innovation and regulation, fostering a framework that encourages growth while mitigating risks. The discussions around crypto regulation are expected to be robust, covering topics from security tokens to stablecoins and beyond. Crypto Custody: Securing the Digital Vault The security of digital assets hinges on robust crypto custody solutions. With high-profile hacks and thefts in the crypto space, secure custody is not just a technical challenge but also a regulatory imperative. What are the key aspects of crypto custody that these roundtables might address? Aspect Description Relevance to Regulation Security Protocols Measures to protect private keys and prevent unauthorized access. Regulatory bodies are concerned with establishing minimum security standards for custodians. Compliance Adherence to KYC/AML regulations and other legal requirements. Custodians must operate within legal frameworks, and regulations are evolving to address crypto-specific compliance needs. Insurance Coverage against loss of digital assets due to theft or other unforeseen events. Regulatory discussions may touch upon the adequacy and availability of insurance for crypto custodians. Operational Risks Risks associated with the day-to-day operations of custody services. Regulators aim to ensure operational resilience and business continuity for crypto custodians. The evolution of crypto custody is crucial for institutional adoption. Clear regulatory guidelines can foster trust and encourage larger players to enter the market, knowing their assets are safeguarded under established standards. Tokenization: Unlocking New Asset Classes Tokenization is often hailed as a game-changer, promising to democratize access to various asset classes and enhance market efficiency. By representing real-world assets like real estate, art, or commodities as digital tokens on a blockchain, tokenization offers numerous benefits. But what are the challenges and regulatory hurdles? Benefits of Tokenization: Fractional Ownership: Allows for dividing high-value assets into smaller, more affordable units. Increased Liquidity: Tokens can be traded more easily and efficiently than traditional assets. Reduced Costs: Streamlines processes and reduces intermediaries, potentially lowering transaction costs. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain technology provides a transparent and auditable record of ownership and transactions. Challenges of Tokenization: Valuation and Appraisal: Determining the value of tokenized assets can be complex. Legal Frameworks: Existing legal systems may not fully accommodate tokenized assets, requiring new legal interpretations and frameworks. Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving, creating uncertainty for issuers and investors. The SEC Crypto Task Force roundtables on tokenization are timely. They offer a platform to discuss these challenges and explore pathways for responsible innovation in this burgeoning field. Clarity on regulatory aspects will be essential to unlock the full potential of tokenization while protecting investors and maintaining market integrity. DeFi Regulation: Navigating the Decentralized Frontier Decentralized Finance (DeFi) represents a paradigm shift in financial services, operating outside the traditional centralized structures. While DeFi offers exciting possibilities for financial inclusion and innovation, its decentralized nature presents unique regulatory challenges. DeFi regulation is arguably the most complex and hotly debated topic in the crypto regulatory landscape. What are the core issues? Key Challenges in DeFi Regulation: Anonymity and Decentralization: Identifying and regulating decentralized protocols and anonymous developers is inherently difficult. Smart Contract Risks: DeFi protocols rely on smart contracts, which can be vulnerable to bugs and exploits, posing systemic risks. Cross-Border Operations: DeFi protocols often operate globally, making jurisdictional enforcement extremely challenging. Lack of Central Intermediaries: Traditional regulations often rely on intermediaries to ensure compliance, but DeFi often lacks these intermediaries. The discussions surrounding DeFi regulation at the SEC roundtables are eagerly anticipated. The challenge is to strike a balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks. Regulators are exploring various approaches, from adapting existing securities laws to developing new frameworks specifically tailored for DeFi. The outcomes of these discussions will significantly shape the future of DeFi and its integration with the broader financial system. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Stakeholders Do? These SEC Crypto Task Force roundtables are more than just meetings; they are signals of intent and direction. For anyone involved in the cryptocurrency space – investors, developers, businesses – staying informed and proactive is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow news and updates related to the roundtables. Organizations like Unfolded and crypto news outlets will provide coverage and analysis. Engage with Industry Discussions: Participate in online forums, webinars, and industry events to understand the evolving regulatory landscape. Assess Regulatory Risks: Evaluate how potential regulatory changes might impact your crypto investments or business operations. Prepare for Compliance: Begin to consider how you might adapt to stricter regulatory requirements, particularly in areas like KYC/AML and custody. Advocate for Balanced Regulation: Engage with industry associations and participate in consultations to advocate for regulations that foster innovation while protecting consumers. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto’s Future The SEC Crypto Task Force roundtables represent a significant moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The discussions around crypto regulation, crypto custody, tokenization, and DeFi regulation will undoubtedly influence the direction of policy and enforcement for years to come. By bringing together diverse perspectives and expertise, these roundtables have the potential to forge a path towards a more regulated, yet still innovative, crypto ecosystem. The coming months will be crucial in observing how these discussions translate into concrete actions and shape the future of digital assets.

Opportunities for profit—or potential losses—appear and disappear within minutes. Monitoring such a dynamic environment manually requires enormous human resources, and emotional pressure caused by fear or greed often leads to erroneous decisions. In situations where humans cannot respond promptly to every change, there is a need for an assistant that works 24/7, analyzes vast amounts of real-time data, learns from past events, and makes decisions faster and more accurately. AI agents in cryptocurrency trading serve precisely this function. AI agents are specialized software programs that use artificial intelligence algorithms to solve tasks related to cryptocurrency trading, market analysis, and risk management. Unlike traditional trading bots that operate on rigidly defined algorithms, AI Post’s in-depth analysis highlights that AI agents adapt to changing market conditions by learning from data obtained from the internet and social networks, such as X (Twitter). This adaptability makes them particularly effective in a volatile market, where every second counts. The main advantage of AI agents is their independence from human emotions. They do not experience panic during market downturns or greed during peaks, allowing them to act purely based on objective data. Their ability to operate continuously without breaks and improve through machine learning enables them to respond to any changes, even when the market operates 24/7. According to CoinGecko, by March 2025, the market capitalization of tokens associated with AI agents had reached $ 4.5 billion. Projects in the meme coin segment, such as Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), Ai16z, AIXBT, and Virtual Protocol, where the aggregate value of individual tokens exceeded $1 billion during peak times, played a particularly notable role. In this space, artificial intelligence is used not only for trading but also for generating memes, writing posts on X, and increasing audience engagement, which creates additional virality and boosts interest in assets. However, the significance of AI agents extends beyond meme coins, assisting regular traders with analytics and automation: perform several key tasks, helping traders cope with constantly changing conditions. They can be broadly divided into three main categories: 1. Trading Agents: Automate the buying and selling of assets, executing trades when prices reach predetermined levels. For example, AI agents on Binance processed over 1.2 million trades daily in 2024, per Binance Research. Use arbitrage strategies between exchanges to profit from price discrepancies. Respond to price swings in under 0.5 seconds, critical in a market where opportunities vanish within minutes. 2. Analytical Agents: Process vast amounts of data, including historical prices, trading volumes, and news from social networks. Analyze correlations between mentions on X and price changes, as demonstrated by Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), whose price increased by 161% within a week in November 2024 before falling by 27.1%. Predict market trends based on statistical models and real-time pattern recognition. 3. Risk Management Agents: Minimize losses by setting dynamic stop-loss orders, reducing portfolio drawdowns by an average of 15% during crashes. Activate protective measures during sharp market crashes to mitigate potential losses. Maintain control over situations even during extreme fluctuations, helping traders remain secure. The advent of AI into cryptocurrency trading has enabled new opportunities but at the same time many challenges too. AI systems are capable of consuming global market data in real-time and execute complex algorithmic strategies but their effectiveness is often disrupted by market turbulence, security breaches, regulatory ambiguity and potential overuse. In the shifting crypto-trading terrain, here are the top five major AI agent-based obstacles. Market Volatility and Its Impact on AI Agents AI Post has identified that the most challenging hurdle faced by AI driven trading systems is the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrency prices can surge or drop within a seconds (not to mention more unpredictable dynamics driven by social media discussions, macroeconomic phenomenon or regulatory decisions). And examples such as the $VIRTUAL seesaw illustrate how fast and unpredictable fluctuations can spoil the relatively obedient world where an even-keel AI model processes information. While AI shines at sifting through historical patterns of trading and real time data, sudden, strange market movements are disruptive to its analytical functions. But if an AI agent does not adapt fast enough with changes in context, the execution loses efficacy and results in massive financial losses for the portfolio. The market can sometimes move faster than AI can adjust, and perhaps training these systems better for extreme market turbulence is critical. Cybersecurity Risks in AI-Driven Trading More AI adoption increases cybersecurity risks. Hackers increasingly target automated trading systems, exploiting algorithmic vulnerabilities. The breach of an AI-driven exchange in 2024 led to $87 million of asset theft; AI can be tricked into bad decisions by bad actors who manipulate market data, using techniques like spoofs costing traders ~$150m/year. These systems need to be protected — robust defenses such as AI-driven anomaly detection (34% fewer breaches). Algorithmic Transparency and Accountability Issues Perhaps the biggest issue so far as adoption of AI in crypto trading is concerned is the black box of decision making, in a way one is governed by an untraceable algorithm. Most AI models are like black boxes, the logic and train of reasoning is completely opaque to human traders. Liability of an AI agent: Without transparency, this makes it difficult to ask the right question — Who is responsible for an AI agent when it makes a mistake or when they act rashly and trade on merriment? The trader? The AI developer? The algorithm. Algorithmic transparency is crucial for the sake of fairness and ethics of trading, especially from the end of institutional investors and regulators. Market participants might find themselves in trouble without audit trail of the AI-driven decision-making. For the Wide Acceptance of AI models in financial markets, we need to build interpretable AI models that have the same predictability as the traditional statistical models. Regulatory Uncertainty and Legal Complexities The lack of a legal structure for AI trading cryptocurrency negatively affects an additional layer. While US regulators have taken a cautious approach to digital assets (SEC and CFTC among others), AI-driven trading strategies are in effect mostly unregulated. The European Union has taken steps towards regulating AI governance by the AI Act, however, the full potential that it is going to have on crypto markets is not known yet. This muddy regulatory landscape is a perfect storm for businesses and investors who are in the gray zone of legality. When the AI agents take trading decisions which are never intended to infringe financial regulations, compliance problems may pop-up. If firms are deliberately using AI in trading, they will be open to legal action, penalties, or forced to shut down the operations. As the AI technology matures, regulators will also need to draw lines on its place in finance without cutting off innovation. The Risks of Over-Reliance on AI Agents AI may make actionable to improve the relevancy execution in trading but going overboard on reliance of automation can be dangerous too. Beginners who rely entirely on AI for trade decisions without oversight risk financial ruin. AI is powerful, but it struggles to interpret unrecognized signals or detect subtle market tipping points While AI drives how accurately a machine can predict, just as in the olden days, there are going to be things AI misses because it learns linear patterns in an unpredictable market. But when traders hand off decision-making entirely to AI, they swing wide open for catastrophic losses if the algorithm breaks. So, for now, dialing just the right step and using AI to amplify our trading strategy but not shock it in crypto, is the way to go. Conclusion AI Post’s research confirms that the future of the cryptocurrency market lies in deeper integration of AI agents. They already have the capability to automate processes in decentralized finance (DeFi), including lending and liquidity management, as well as creating decentralized networks to enhance transparency. Personalized assistants based on artificial intelligence will simplify trading for beginners, lower entry barriers, and improve overall operational efficiency. Nevertheless, the future evolution of these technologies is hampered by security issues, ethical implications and lack of a generally agreed upon legal framework. AI-powered agents have revolutionized cryptocurrency trading with their unmatched speed and enhanced market analysis. They protect traders from emotional mistakes, timely respond to the market and can use the short-term price swings. However, managing volatility, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory uncertainty requires long-term planning and technological advancements. As AI agents sound like a very natural extension of the crypto economy into sustainable development and innovation in digital assets, if only integrated correctly and aided by changing regulations. Thus, the modern cryptocurrency market, where every second matters, demands solutions that operate continuously and without emotions. AI agents have already proven their effectiveness and continue to evolve, opening new horizons for trading, analytics, and risk management. With a thoughtful approach and further technological improvements, they have the potential to ensure stability and transparency even under extreme volatility, AI agents must balance cutting-edge innovation with sound judgment to ensure sustainable growth in the crypto market.

42356992,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143331,1742969759,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Bitcoin Wallet Revelation: Fidelity Exec Exposes S-Curve Stagnation!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-wallet-s-curve-stagnation/,"Is Bitcoin adoption hitting a snag? While the crypto market buzzes with excitement and prices fluctuate wildly, a surprising observation from a Fidelity executive has sparked a crucial conversation. Jurrien Timmer, a respected voice in global macro strategy at Fidelity Investments, recently pointed out a fascinating anomaly: the number of Bitcoin wallets has barely budged in the last year. This revelation has left many wondering – what does this mean for Bitcoin’s growth trajectory and the widely accepted S-Curve model? Decoding the Bitcoin Wallet Mystery: Why Aren’t They Growing? Timmer’s statement, shared on X (formerly Twitter), isn’t just a random observation; it’s a potential indicator of a shift in how Bitcoin is being adopted and held. He suggests that the stagnation in Bitcoin wallets isn’t necessarily a sign of waning interest. Instead, it might reflect the increasing dominance of large institutional players in the Bitcoin market. Think about it – firms like MicroStrategy (MSTR), known for their massive Bitcoin treasuries, and the issuers of the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs. These entities don’t need millions of individual wallets. They operate with a few, highly secure, and substantial wallets to manage their holdings. To illustrate this point, consider the typical user versus an institution: User Type Typical Wallet Needs Impact on Wallet Growth Metrics Individual Retail Investor Multiple wallets for various purposes (trading, savings, privacy) Contributes significantly to overall wallet growth numbers Institutional Investor (e.g., ETF issuer, Treasury Firm) Few, large, highly secure wallets for managing vast holdings Minimal impact on overall wallet growth metrics despite large Bitcoin holdings This shift towards institutional holding could explain why, despite increasing institutional interest and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, the raw number of Bitcoin wallets isn’t reflecting the same growth trajectory we might have expected. The S-Curve Model and Bitcoin: A Love Story or a Fading Romance? For years, the S-Curve model has been a popular framework for understanding and projecting the growth of Bitcoin. This model, commonly used to describe the adoption lifecycle of new technologies, posits that growth starts slowly, then accelerates rapidly before eventually plateauing as saturation is reached. Think of the adoption of smartphones or the internet – they followed a similar S-shaped curve. Timmer himself has previously highlighted Bitcoin’s adherence to the S-Curve model . The core idea is simple: as more people join the Bitcoin network, its value increases. This “network effect” is a powerful driver of growth. More participants mean increased utility, security, and ultimately, demand, pushing the price higher. However, Timmer’s recent observation about stagnant wallet growth throws a curveball into this seemingly straightforward narrative. Understanding the Bitcoin S-Curve in Detail Let’s break down the S-Curve model in the context of Bitcoin: Early Adoption (Slow Growth): In the initial years of Bitcoin, adoption was slow, primarily driven by cypherpunks, tech enthusiasts, and early believers. Wallet growth was modest. Rapid Growth (Steep Ascent): As Bitcoin gained mainstream attention, fueled by price surges and increasing awareness, adoption accelerated dramatically. This period saw a significant increase in the number of Bitcoin wallets and users. Maturity/Plateau (Slowing Growth): According to the traditional S-Curve, as Bitcoin matures and reaches wider adoption, the rate of new user growth is expected to slow down. This is where Timmer’s observation becomes particularly relevant. Is the stagnation in wallet growth a sign of Bitcoin entering this maturity phase faster than anticipated? Is the S-Curve Model Still Relevant for Bitcoin Adoption? Timmer raises a critical question: will the S-Curve model remain a reliable tool for tracking Bitcoin’s future trajectory? His analysis suggests that relying solely on wallet growth as an indicator of adoption might become increasingly misleading. The influx of institutional capital and the concentration of Bitcoin holdings in fewer, larger wallets are changing the dynamics of the network. Here are some key points to consider regarding the S-Curve and Bitcoin’s future: Shifting Metrics: Wallet count might be becoming a less accurate metric for measuring Bitcoin adoption. Perhaps metrics like transaction volume, on-chain activity, or the total value locked in Bitcoin are becoming more relevant indicators. Institutional Impact: Institutional adoption, while bullish for Bitcoin’s price and legitimacy, can skew traditional adoption metrics like wallet growth. Large institutions operate differently from retail users. Network Evolution: Bitcoin’s network is constantly evolving. Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which facilitate faster and cheaper transactions, might also influence wallet usage patterns and how we measure adoption. Fidelity Investments’ Perspective: A Nuanced View on Bitcoin’s Future Fidelity Investments , a major player in the traditional financial world, has been increasingly embracing Bitcoin and the broader crypto space. Their perspective, as articulated by Jurrien Timmer, offers a valuable nuanced view. It’s not about dismissing the S-Curve model entirely but rather recognizing its limitations in a rapidly evolving landscape. Fidelity’s involvement in Bitcoin, including their application for a spot Bitcoin ETF, signals their belief in the long-term potential of this asset class. However, Timmer’s analysis serves as a reminder that the path to mainstream Bitcoin adoption is not always linear and predictable. We need to adapt our understanding and metrics as the ecosystem matures. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what are the takeaways from this shocking Bitcoin wallet revelation and the evolving relevance of the S-Curve model? Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Metrics: Don’t solely rely on wallet growth to gauge Bitcoin adoption. Look at a broader range of indicators, including transaction volume, active addresses, institutional flows, and regulatory developments. Understand Institutional Impact: Pay attention to the role of institutions in the Bitcoin market. Their actions and holdings significantly influence market dynamics and adoption patterns. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The crypto space is constantly changing. Stay updated on the latest trends, analyses, and perspectives from reputable sources like Fidelity Investments to make informed decisions. Long-Term Vision: Despite short-term fluctuations and evolving metrics, maintain a long-term perspective on Bitcoin’s potential. Technological adoption curves are rarely perfectly smooth, and periods of apparent stagnation can be followed by renewed growth. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Bitcoin Narrative Jurrien Timmer’s observation about stagnant Bitcoin wallets is not a cause for alarm but rather a crucial piece of the puzzle in understanding Bitcoin’s evolving narrative. It highlights the increasing influence of institutional investors and the need to refine our metrics for measuring adoption. The S-Curve model, while still relevant in principle, may require adjustments and supplementary indicators to accurately reflect Bitcoin’s unique growth trajectory in this new era of institutional involvement. As Bitcoin continues to mature and integrate into the global financial system, expect more such insightful observations that challenge conventional wisdom and deepen our understanding of this revolutionary asset. The journey of Bitcoin adoption is far from over, and navigating its complexities requires a keen eye, adaptable strategies, and a willingness to look beyond simple metrics.

Besides, the foundation is also in talks with the US government to accept DOGE for parking fees, utilities, and even major sporting events. These developments and the easing market dynamics have kept the DOGE price up by over 10% since the start of the week. This has not only made the market participants bullish on Dogecoin, but also has induced significant confidence among the whales. As a result, they have begun to accumulate DOGE heavily, fluttering bullish flags across the markets. As Santiment data shared by a known analyst, Ali , the wallets holding DOGE tokens between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 have accumulated over 200 million tokens in the past two weeks. This can be considered a rise in the confidence among the investors regardless of the rising volatility. Hence, this suggests the DOGE price is preparing for a strong bullish action that could elevate the levels above the bearish range. The weekly chart of DOGE price suggests the price has completed a decent retracement and hence could soon begin its journey back to the resistance. The DOGE price faced a rejection from $0.48, earlier this year and hence, the latest trade dynamics suggest the bulls are gearing up to push the price beyond the range. The weekly MACD displays a drop in the selling pressure, which may further lead towards a bullish crossover. On the other hand, the DMI is also attempting a bullish crossover that could validate a flip from the bearish trend. Meanwhile, the ADX is plunging, hinting towards a drop in the strength of the rally, which could slow down the progress of the rally. Therefore, the Dogecoin price has come under the bullish influence but a bullish confirmation could only push the token towards the upper range. This could happen when the DOGE rises and secures above $0.22 before the end of Q1. Once done, the price may not only rise above the yearly highs, but also mark a new ATH close to $1, later this year.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-26 06:16:43
