This Altcoin Tops Toncoin, Chainlink, BNB, and Tron on Investor Watchlists",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/best-crypto-to-buy-before-april-this-altcoin-tops-toncoin-chainlink-bnb-and-tron-on-investor-watchlists,"While investors are keeping a close eye on tokens like Toncoin, Chainlink, BNB, and Tron, another altcoin leads the pack. While volatility struck these headline-grabbing assets in recent months, one token— Remittix —is quietly marching ahead without fanfare due to its stable, payment-oriented use case. While crypto markets are reeling from scandals and price swings, investors are increasingly looking towards projects that offer stability and real-world applications. And that's why Remittixis now the top pick as the best cryptocurrency to invest in before April. Toncoin (TON) Stumbles Amid Misinformation Saga, Investors Look to Remittix Toncoin recently surged by 8% after false reports spread claiming the TON Foundation had raised $400 million . The excitement was short-lived, as the foundation quickly clarified that the $400 million represented existing holdings by U.S.-based VCs, not fresh capital. Investors reacted negatively when the truth dawned, and most blamed insiders for manipulating sentiment. The scandal added to Toncoin's current troubles, particularly in the wake of legal troubles facing Telegram founder Pavel Durov. The issues marred the future of Toncoin. Source: Tradingview Chainlink's Volatility Limits Gains, Remittix Offers Stability Chainlink (LINK) recently saw an impressive 6.7% increase, breaking the $15 mark with high investor interest. Despite the trend, LINK is encountering resistance to break through $18.12. Even technical indicators indicate a correction overdue, as the RSI is nearing overbought levels. In addition, recent liquidations of $1.06 million indicate Chainlink's built-in volatility. While LINK remains attractive to speculative traders, its price volatility scares off long-term investors. Remittix, on the other hand, offers stability in its PayFi model, specifically addressing transaction inefficiencies globally. Investors who want consistent and substantial growth prefer the actual application of Remittix to speculative tokens like LINK. Source: Tradingview Binance (BNB) Insider Trading Controversy Hurts Confidence, Benefiting Remittix Binance (BNB) is currently navigating a major scandal involving alleged insider trading. An employee was recently suspended for front-running trades using privileged information from BNB Chain’s operations . Although Binance acted swiftly, the damage to its reputation raises serious questions about internal governance. Regulatory scrutiny will likely intensify, further complicating BNB’s short-term price outlook and dampening investor enthusiasm. By comparison, Remittix’s transparent operations and clear regulatory strategy position it as a trustworthy alternative. Source: Tradingview Tron (TRX) Struggles at Resistance Levels, Remittix Gains Momentum Tron (TRX) faces persistent challenges in surpassing the $0.25 resistance level. This repeated failure to break upward has sparked concerns over TRX’s future market standing. Mixed technical indicators further weaken investor sentiment. With on-balance volume data showing limited buying activity, traders are turning skeptical. If Tron can't regain bullish momentum, investors may begin looking elsewhere.

Odds of approval are rising fast, and some analysts think that could be the rocket fuel XRP’s been waiting for. Stellar (XLM) is also getting swept up in optimism, riding the wave thanks to its shared focus on cross-border transactions. But while the old-school payment coins battle it out for a comeback, a newer name is quietly stealing the show— Remittix (RTX) . It’s already pulled in over $14 million in presale, and with its built-in PayFi functionality for investors, businesses, and individuals, some are calling it the next-gen solution Ripple was supposed to be. If you’re betting on the future of payments, RTX is looking like a seriously promising move. Remittix (RTX) Levels Up The Global Payments Space Crypto has spent more than a decade promising to replace legacy finance—but for most users, actually spending digital assets is still a slow, expensive, and often frustrating experience. Exchange withdrawals can take days, conversion fees are excessive, and banks routinely block or delay crypto-related transactions. This is exactly the problem Remittix (RTX) is built to solve. The platform allows users to instantly convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT, sending funds directly to any bank account globally. Whether you're cashing out stablecoins, moving crypto earnings to a local bank, or making international transfers, Remittix removes the friction without compromising control. For example, a freelancer in Kenya can accept payment in USDT and receive Kenyan Shillings in their local bank account that same day. Or a business owner in Colombia can settle supplier invoices using Ethereum, without touching an exchange or dealing with FX fees. Remittix is also turning heads with its focus on privacy. As global banking becomes more invasive—tracking transactions, flagging crypto activity, and limiting financial autonomy—users are demanding tools that give them privacy without breaking the rules. Remittix provides that balance. Transactions initiated through the platform result in a traditional bank deposit on the other end, without exposing the crypto origin. That means freedom to move funds on your terms, while still interacting with the existing financial system. Ripple (XRP): ETF Hype Building, But Is It Priced In Already? XRP’s been grinding for months, but now things might finally be picking up. The odds of an XRP ETF getting the green light are climbing , and traders are already speculating on a big price breakout. If approved, it could pull in serious institutional interest—something XRP has been waiting on for years. But let’s be honest—some of that hype might already be baked into the price. XRP’s still sitting way below its ATH, and while ETF approval would be a massive headline, execution matters more than hype. Ripple’s working on real-world integrations with CBDC s and payment networks, but until those roll out at scale, XRP’s stuck playing catch-up. The ETF could be the boost it needs—but new players like Remittix are already doing what XRP aims to. Monero (XMR): Still the Privacy King, But Facing Headwinds Monero’s always been that quiet, shadowy player in the crypto space—the go-to for privacy-maxis. It still offers unmatched anonymity, but regulators aren’t too fond of that, and it’s starting to weigh on adoption. Many exchanges have either de-listed XMR or added more hurdles to buy it, which is limiting its upside. The tech behind Monero is solid—private transactions, stealth addresses, ring signatures—it’s all there. But it hasn’t evolved much in terms of broader utility. With more payment coins entering the space and projects like Remittix offering regulatory-friendly privacy options with lightning-fast settlement, Monero’s looking more like a niche tool than a mass-market solution. It’ll always have a cult following—but it may have already peaked. Remittix Presale Gains Momentum—Early Backers Move Fast With $14 million already raised, and tokens available at $0.0734, Remittix is attracting serious attention from early-stage investors who see beyond the hype. This is a project with clear utility, a growing user base, and real-world demand. Industry analysts are calling for an 800% increase in token price before the presale ends, with even more upside projected post-launch as adoption accelerates. For anyone seeking exposure to the next generation of blockchain utility—not speculation, but real financial infrastructure—Remittix is standing out as a breakout player in 2025’s crypto landscape. And right now, it’s still early enough to get in before the rest of the market catches on.

MARA Backing: Supported by MARA, a significant player in the Bitcoin mining industry, adding credibility and potential for widespread adoption. Why Hydro-Cooling? The Edge in Efficiency and Performance In the world of Bitcoin mining , heat is the enemy. Traditional air-cooled miners can generate immense heat, leading to performance throttling, increased energy consumption for cooling, and even hardware degradation over time. This is where hydro-cooled Bitcoin miners like the Terraflux AH3880 shine. Hydro-cooling, or liquid cooling, offers several key advantages: Superior Heat Dissipation: Liquid cooling is significantly more effective at removing heat compared to air cooling. This allows miners to operate at optimal temperatures, maintaining consistent performance. Enhanced Efficiency: By keeping temperatures down, hydro-cooling contributes to better energy efficiency. Cooler components operate more efficiently, reducing energy waste. Potential for Overclocking: The improved thermal management of hydro-cooling can potentially allow for overclocking, pushing the miner to perform beyond its standard specifications (though Auradine hasn’t explicitly mentioned this for the AH3880). Quieter Operation: Hydro-cooled systems can often operate more quietly than air-cooled systems, reducing noise pollution in mining facilities. Increased Lifespan: Lower operating temperatures can contribute to a longer lifespan for the mining hardware by reducing thermal stress on components. For large-scale Bitcoin mining operations , these benefits translate to significant cost savings in the long run, both in terms of energy consumption and hardware maintenance. The Terraflux AH3880’s adoption of hydro-cooling is a clear indicator of Auradine’s focus on efficiency and long-term sustainability in mining operations. Terraflux AH3880 vs. The Competition: Setting a New Benchmark Auradine claims that the Terraflux AH3880 outperforms leading models from industry giants like Antminer and Whatsminer. Let’s put this into perspective. While specific models from Antminer and Whatsminer weren’t named in the initial reports, we can compare the Terraflux AH3880 against some of their top-tier offerings based on publicly available data: Miner Model Hash Rate (TH/s) Efficiency (J/TH) Cooling System Auradine Terraflux AH3880 600 14.5 Hydro-Cooled Antminer S21 335 ~17.5 Air-Cooled Whatsminer M50S++ ~140 ~26 Air-Cooled Whatsminer M60 ~170 ~17 Air-Cooled *Note: Performance data for competitor models may vary and is based on publicly available specifications. As you can see from the table, the Terraflux AH3880 boasts a significantly higher hash rate and superior energy efficiency compared to some of the leading air-cooled models currently available. The energy-efficient Bitcoin miner market is fiercely competitive, and Auradine is clearly aiming to take the lead with this new offering. The hydro-cooling system is a key differentiator, enabling this performance edge. Addressing Critical Challenges: Energy Costs, Computing Demands, and U.S. Reliance Auradine highlights that the Terraflux AH3880 is designed to address several critical challenges facing the Bitcoin mining industry and the broader tech landscape: Rising Energy Costs: The exceptional energy efficiency of 14.5 J/TH directly tackles the issue of escalating energy costs, which are a major operational expense for miners. By consuming less energy per unit of hash rate, the Terraflux AH3880 can significantly reduce energy bills and improve profitability, especially in regions with high electricity prices. Growing Computing Demands: The Bitcoin network’s hashrate continues to climb, increasing mining difficulty and demanding more powerful hardware. The Terraflux AH3880’s high hash rate of 600 TH/s ensures that miners can remain competitive in this increasingly demanding environment. It provides the computational muscle needed to secure block rewards and maintain profitability. U.S. Reliance on Overseas Hardware: The fact that the Terraflux AH3880 is U.S.-engineered is a strategic move to reduce reliance on overseas hardware manufacturers. This is particularly relevant in the current geopolitical climate, where supply chain security and domestic technological capabilities are increasingly prioritized. Auradine is positioning itself as a champion of American innovation in the Bitcoin mining hardware sector. The MARA Connection: A Strong Endorsement The backing of MARA (Marathon Digital Holdings), a prominent publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, lends significant weight to Auradine’s claims and the potential of the Terraflux AH3880. MARA’s involvement suggests that they have vetted and validated the performance and efficiency of the miner, and see it as a valuable asset for their operations. This endorsement could pave the way for wider adoption of the Terraflux AH3880 across the industry, as other mining companies may follow MARA’s lead. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin Mining? The launch of the Auradine Terraflux AH3880 signals a significant step forward in Bitcoin mining technology . It underscores several key trends shaping the industry: Focus on Efficiency: Energy efficiency is no longer a secondary consideration; it’s a primary driver of innovation. Miners are increasingly seeking solutions that minimize energy consumption and maximize output. Advancements in Cooling: Hydro-cooling is likely to become more prevalent as miners seek to push performance boundaries and manage the thermal challenges of high-density mining operations. Geopolitical Considerations: The emphasis on U.S. engineering highlights the growing importance of domestic manufacturing and supply chain resilience in the technology sector, including cryptocurrency mining. Increased Competition: The entry of Auradine and the launch of the Terraflux AH3880 injects fresh competition into the Bitcoin miner market, which is ultimately beneficial for the industry as it drives innovation and potentially lowers costs for miners. Conclusion: A Powerful New Player Emerges The Auradine Terraflux AH3880 is more than just a new Bitcoin miner ; it’s a symbol of innovation, efficiency, and a shift towards greater domestic involvement in the cryptocurrency hardware sector. With its impressive hash rate, superior energy efficiency, and advanced hydro-cooling system, backed by the endorsement of MARA, the Terraflux AH3880 is poised to make a significant impact on the Bitcoin mining landscape.

Recent analyses from experts suggest that Ethereum price behavior is showing both bullish short-term structure and macro-level cyclical patterns, which could support an upward continuation if key levels hold. Ethereum Price Could Surge Past $2100 on Liquidity Grab Analyst Crypto Patel shared insight on the X platform, identifying a bullish price setup on the ETH/USDT chart. According to Patel, the top altcoin has shown a strong displacement move to the upside, which has led to a shift in market structure. This move followed a reaction from a previously identified bullish Point of Interest (POI). Ethereum price is reacting positively from a key mitigation block near $2064.60, indicating strong institutional demand. The mitigation block represents a zone where the top altcoin price retraced after a breakout, often used by institutional traders to mitigate prior orders before continuing the trend. This setup places the entry for a long position within the upper mitigation zone, aligning with smart money principles. Source: X The price target of $2128.12 aligns with a swing high liquidity zone, suggesting a likely smart money-driven move upward. These zones often hold clustered stop-loss orders and pending buy positions. A move into this area could allow investors to capture liquidity before a reversal. Patel sets a stop-loss at $2027.20, just below the mitigation block, providing a defined risk level if the altcoin price structure fails. Current ETH Cycle Compared to 2018–2020 Pattern Another analyst, TimeFreedomROB, posted a chart on X comparing Ethereum price weekly structure to its 2018–2020 cycle. The analysis shows ETH breaking below an ascending triangle, mirroring its past breakdown below a descending triangle before its major 2020 recovery. In that prior cycle, ETH price formed a macro bottom and rallied from under $100 to nearly $4800. According to the chart, Ethereum price is currently trading near $2060. It recently broke below the $2300 psychological level and tested the lower diagonal trendline around $1800. This area corresponds with horizontal demand levels from previous years. The chart implies this could represent a final shakeout phase before a strong upward move, similar to historical cycles. Source: X The support zone between $1800 and $2000 has acted as a long-term base in earlier market periods. A reclaim of the $2200–$2400 range is important for Ethereum price to confirm a shift back into bullish momentum on the weekly timeframe. Altcoin Price Prediction Additionally, the macro view provided by TimeFreedomROB outlines possible reversal targets if the price continues to follow historical patterns. In 2020, ETH saw a 40x increase following structure reclaim. While current conditions differ, the projected path includes potential resistance levels at $3600, $4870, and an extended range of $6000–$7500. Supporting the bullish projections, analyst MAXPAIN noted that ETH price could retrace to the $1,900 zone before a potential rally to $3,000. His analysis, based on the TPO chart, identifies the $1,874–$1,924 range as a key support and accumulation area. The top altcoin is currently trading at $2,064.98, showing an 8.10% gain over the past 7 days. Its market cap stands at $249.12 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $11.71 billion.

Year to date, Pump.fun has deposited over 1.57M SOL, valued at over $293M. Overall, Pump.fun has already produced 3,232,101 SOL in total fees, valued at close to $500M. Of those, the platform probably cashed out over $250M, with the bulk during the 2024 bull market. Following the latest sale, SOL traded at $145.56. The asset got a boost from a series of ETF applications, pointing to future demand. Pump.fun is back in the top 10 of apps, with $1.53M in fees for the last day. On more successful days, the platform reaches over $3M in fees, though still far from peak results of over $7M daily. Currently, Pump.fun once again produces more fees compared to Solana, and has far surpassed even the entire Ethereum chain. Meanwhile, Pump.fun sees a lower number of new tokens, falling to around 20K to 25K daily. On weaker days, under 2,000 new tokens are minted. Token shifts to Raydium go to zero The effect of PumpSwap is already visible, as almost no tokens are moving to Raydium. The integrated DEX now lists all tokens that have finished the bonding curve. Graduated tokens were already rare, with around 200 new tickers daily moving to Raydium. PumpSwap is just building up its list of tokens, initially starting with 26 coins. The DEX has added some of the more liquid Solana assets like Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and Jupiter (JUP). Pump.fun itself is also showing slower graduations, as the community only trades new launches, but rarely raises enough liquidity for graduation to a DEX. The DEX also added USDT and USDC liquidity, as well as older blue chip memes. However, PumpSwap achieved $1.23B in trading volumes for the first week, producing an estimated $1M in fees as part of the Pump.fun ecosystem. PumpSwap is competing with other DEX, taking between 7% and 15% of Solana DEX activity. | Source: Dune Analytics Pump.fun makes up around 7% of all Solana DEX volumes. March 24 was the first peak day, with over $890M in total daily activity. Pump.fun has also surpassed Meteora in daily token trades, peaking at over 14% of all Solana DEX on Monday. The new exchange is yet to prove its ability to replace the ‘trenches’ with new token mints and unexpected success stories. The growing DEX activity may add to more fee liquidation, as the Pump.fun ecosystem has not yet introduced its profit-sharing mechanism. Most of the SOL fees generated are either partially used for staking or sold on the open market. In the coming months, PumpSwap will start sharing its revenues with token creators. In the very first days of its operation, the new DEX almost reached Pump.fun’s in terms of fees. If trading volumes keep their levels, PumpSwap may replace the lost revenues from the slower meme token casino. The DEX has achieved up to $2.8M in daily revenues on the more successful days, both from trade fees of 0.25%, and from liquidity provider services. Most of the fees will flow back to the main token developer, once again with no plans for rewarding communities. The new model rebuilds the Moonshot launchpad and DEX combination, which, however, could not differentiate between legitimate projects and rug pulls. Most Pump.fun wallets break even or lose $500 The highly competitive PvP trading of meme tokens means the majority of players end up with losses. Since traders only make small bets on new memes, the most common loss is up to $500. Around 1M wallets break even, and 1.3M wallets lose up to $500. Only 33 whale wallets have achieved earnings of over $1M, and just four whales have lost over $1M on the platform. The Pump.fun trading format shows a shift of retail bets into whale wallets, where the top 500 traders make most of the earnings. Only two tokens, FARTCOIN and WOULD, have broken above $500M valuations. Solana memes remain active, with a total valuation for top tokens at $8.4B . The meme space has recovered, though remaining far from its peak valuations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

What Will Happen If He Fires?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-us-president-donald-trump-fire-fed-chairman-jerome-powell-what-will-happen-if-he-fires/,"US President Donald Trump has increased pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates, arguing that falling food and energy prices justify such a move. However, sources suggest that if the central bank does not meet his demands, Trump may take an even harsher step and dismiss Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump has long expressed frustration with the Fed, but tensions have escalated following its decision last week to keep interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%. The president has appeared on Truth Social and in public to press for lower interest rates, saying lower borrowing costs would stimulate economic growth and prevent any slowdowns from trade policies. Despite Trump’s calls, Powell signaled caution by emphasizing the potential inflationary impact of Trump’s upcoming tariff measures. The Fed’s new economic forecasts suggest there will be no further decline in inflation this year, largely due to the expected effects of additional tariffs. “I think further progress may be delayed once tariff-induced inflation arrives,” Powell warned last week. Trump will impose new reciprocal tariffs on April 2, which he calls “Liberation Day.” The move is aimed at countering foreign tariffs on American goods, but economists warn that such policies could further complicate the Fed’s ability to maintain economic stability. Amid the rising tensions, speculation has mounted over whether Trump could attempt to fire Powell, a move that would likely roil financial markets. Powell, whose term expires in 2026, has previously said he would not resign early even if the president asked him to. Related News: ‘Whales Entered Bitcoin Short at $88,000,’ Analysis Company Says, Explains Its Meaning Ian Katz, a director at research firm Capital Alpha Partners in Washington, said he did not expect Trump to fire Powell given the potential market turmoil. “Given how aggressively Trump has asserted his authority, you can’t rule anything out,” Katz warned. “A decision that clearly gives the president more authority over monetary policy would be extremely unsettling to the market.” Trump’s willingness to remove independent agency officials has already been demonstrated with the removal of two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Legal experts point to a 1935 Supreme Court decision, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, that protects independent agency members from being removed without cause. If Trump were to defy that precedent, it could lead to a Supreme Court showdown that would resonate across financial markets. *This is not investment advice.

42343763,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143206,1742944845,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlock Effortless Kubernetes Management: Plural’s AI Platform Revolutionizes Enterprise Operations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unlock-kubernetes-management-plural-platform/,"In the fast-evolving world of enterprise infrastructure, managing Kubernetes clusters has become a critical yet complex task. As businesses scale and adopt cloud-native architectures, the challenge of handling sprawling Kubernetes deployments intensifies. Plural emerges as a powerful solution, offering a centralized platform designed to simplify Kubernetes operations and revolutionize how enterprises manage their clusters. Imagine a world where Kubernetes management is no longer a headache but a streamlined, efficient process. Plural is making that vision a reality. The Kubernetes Sprawl Challenge: Why Centralized Management Matters For many enterprises, the Kubernetes journey began with a single cluster. However, as needs grew, so did the number of clusters, leading to a phenomenon known as Kubernetes sprawl. Sam Weaver, co-founder of Plural, experienced this firsthand at Unqork. Faced with the daunting task of managing a growing network of Kubernetes clusters, Unqork embarked on a costly, two-year project to build an in-house solution. The result? A platform that was merely ‘okay’. This experience highlighted a crucial gap in the market: the need for a comprehensive, user-friendly Kubernetes management platform . The traditional approach of managing Kubernetes clusters individually using disparate open-source tools is no longer sustainable for large organizations. This decentralized approach leads to: Increased Operational Overhead: Managing each cluster separately demands significant time and resources from DevOps teams. Inconsistency and Errors: Lack of standardization across clusters can lead to configuration drift and increased risk of errors. Slower Deployments and Updates: Rolling out updates and new applications across multiple clusters becomes a time-consuming and complex process. Visibility Gaps: Gaining a holistic view of cluster health, performance, and resource utilization across the entire infrastructure becomes challenging. Plural: Your Centralized Command Center for Kubernetes Plural addresses these challenges head-on by providing a centralized Kubernetes management platform. Born from the frustrations of Kubernetes sprawl, Plural consolidates all your enterprise Kubernetes clusters into a single, intuitive dashboard. This unified view empowers teams to streamline operations, efficiently manage clusters, and deploy updates from one central location. Imagine the time and resources saved by having all your Kubernetes infrastructure at your fingertips. The genesis of Plural is a compelling story of identifying a problem and crafting an elegant solution. After his experience at Unqork, Weaver partnered with Michael Guarino, a seasoned engineer from tech giants like Amazon and Twitter. Guarino’s swift development of a superior system in just weeks laid the foundation for Plural. This rapid innovation underscores the platform’s core value proposition: efficiency and speed in Kubernetes management. AI-Powered Kubernetes: Smart Optimization and Proactive Problem Solving Plural goes beyond basic cluster management by integrating AI-powered Kubernetes capabilities. The platform’s AI engine offers intelligent suggestions for: Cluster Optimization: AI algorithms analyze cluster performance and identify areas for optimization, improving resource utilization and reducing costs. Scaling Issue Diagnosis: Plural’s AI proactively detects and diagnoses scaling bottlenecks, enabling teams to address issues before they impact application performance. Proactive Insights: The platform provides actionable insights based on AI-driven analysis, helping teams anticipate potential problems and optimize their Kubernetes deployments proactively. This AI-driven approach transforms Kubernetes management from a reactive task to a proactive and strategic function. By leveraging AI, Plural empowers enterprises to not just manage their clusters but to optimize them for peak performance and efficiency. Benefits of Plural: Streamlining Enterprise Kubernetes Clusters The benefits of adopting Plural’s platform are substantial, particularly for organizations grappling with complex enterprise Kubernetes clusters . Plural promises to: Reduce Operational Overhead by 90%: By centralizing management and automating key tasks, Plural dramatically reduces the time and effort required to manage Kubernetes infrastructure. Accelerate Update Cycles: Deploy updates in hours instead of weeks, ensuring faster time-to-market for new features and applications. Boost Developer Productivity: Free developers from the complexities of Kubernetes management, allowing them to focus on building and innovating. Enhance Control and Security: Plural’s self-hosted, GitOps-based architecture provides enterprises with full control over their data and deployments, enhancing security and compliance. Weaver emphasizes that Plural is designed to be cloud and LLM agnostic, offering flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in. This commitment to openness and control is a key differentiator in the Kubernetes management landscape. Why Now? The Perfect Timing for Plural’s Solution The rise of AI and the increasing adoption of cloud-native architectures have converged to create the perfect storm for Kubernetes sprawl. Enterprises are no longer managing just one or two clusters; they are dealing with dozens, even hundreds. This exponential growth necessitates a more sophisticated and simplified Kubernetes operations approach. Plural’s emergence at this juncture is not accidental. The company recognized the growing pain points associated with Kubernetes management and developed a solution precisely tailored to address these challenges. The recent $6 million seed funding round, led by Primary Venture Partners with participation from Capital One Ventures and Company Ventures, underscores investor confidence in Plural’s vision and potential. Plural vs. Competitors: Architecture as a Differentiator While Plural is not alone in the Kubernetes management space, Weaver highlights key architectural differentiators that set Plural apart from competitors like Loft Labs and Rancher Labs. These include: GitOps Model: Plural operates on a GitOps model, ensuring infrastructure-as-code principles for consistent and auditable deployments. Self-Hosted Architecture: Unlike SaaS solutions, Plural is self-hosted by each customer, providing maximum control and data privacy. AI Agents per Cluster: Each Kubernetes cluster has its own dedicated AI agent, enabling localized optimization and intelligent management. These architectural choices reflect Plural’s commitment to enterprise-grade security, control, and customization. The ‘no data sent home’ approach resonates strongly with organizations in regulated industries like financial services, where data privacy and compliance are paramount. Conclusion: Empowering Enterprises in the Kubernetes Era Plural is poised to become a game-changer in the Kubernetes management landscape. By offering a centralized, AI-powered platform, Plural empowers enterprises to unlock effortless Kubernetes management , streamline operations, and accelerate innovation. As Kubernetes continues to be the orchestration engine of choice for modern applications, solutions like Plural will be instrumental in enabling organizations to harness the full potential of this powerful technology without being bogged down by complexity.

Per a Coincheck press release , the new service is named Coincheck Prime and is “specifically targeted” at “corporate and institutional” crypto investors. Coincheck: Responding to Growing Demand from Corporate Sector? The firm said its new service will cater to “corporate clients” with deposit balances worth “10 million yen ($66,763) or more.” Trading volumes on the Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) It will also cater to big-spending firms and investors who are prepared to spend similar amounts on one-off or continuous crypto purchases. Coincheck said its service will also provide trading and management support from “specialized” experts. Until very recently, the majority of Japanese corporate players dealing with crypto were web3 and blockchain players. But since late last year, there has been a rise in the number of corporations looking to raise funds through crypto investment. Some companies have also gone on the record as stating that they think crypto can help them protect their liquid assets against fiat inflation. A recent and dramatic spike in Japanese bond yields is a stark reminder that the decades-long experiment in ultralow rates is well and truly coming to an end. https://t.co/c4M4qos1up — The Japan Times (@japantimes) March 25, 2025 Coincheck also suggested it could use its Prime services to help institutional investors who might require custody services should the government approve crypto spot ETFs at a future date.

(Source: Google Finance) OTC Options The new platform will also allow users to make large over-the-counter (OTC) trades “at preferential rates.” It also promises to provide users with “robust security” for cryptoassets in the exchange’s custody. The company suggested its NASDAQ listing could help it build trust in its new services. It also pointed out that its owner, the securities giant Monex Group, is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s Prime Market. Coincheck claimed: “We adhere to global standards for internal controls, risk management, and security levels as required by [stock market-]listed financial group companies. We also provide services with a high level of transparency.” Oki Matsumoto, the Executive Director of the Coincheck operator and securities firm Monex Group. (Source: Monex on Demand/YouTube/Screenshot) Coincheck claims that its total customer assets were worth 1.29 trillion yen (over $8.6 billion) as of the end of January 2025. It also said that it was “the number one exchange in Japan in terms of Bitcoin (BTC) spot trading volume in the second half of 2024.” Japanese Companies Flocking to BTC, Altcoin Markets Corporate crypto investment is increasing rapidly in Japan, with companies now scrambling to use their balance sheets to buy Bitcoin and altcoins. Earlier this month, the Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed real estate and digital transformation firm Value Creation announced it had recently spent $667,000 on Bitcoin . Other notable Japanese firms buying BTC or unveiling plans to do so in recent months include the bullish investment player Metaplanet , as well as the SBC Medical Group and the auto trading firm Remixpoint . Japan named Kazuto Uchida as the head of the Government Pension Investment Fund https://t.co/s5Q46WTWBi — Bloomberg (@business) March 25, 2025 Remixpoint spent around $3.2 million on BTC in January this year, and has earmarked another $16 million for Bitcoin and altcoin buys. The company has also bought smaller amounts of Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , XRP , Avalanche (AVAX), and Dogecoin (DOGE) . Metaplanet, meanwhile, has publicly claimed it wants to cement its position as “Asia’s leading Bitcoin treasury company.” It has also spoken of a wider “goal” to “expand” the size of its Bitcoin holdings to BTC 10,000 by the end of this year.

According to data from Onchain Lens, a total of 54,113 SOL worth approximately $7.81 million were moved to the trading platform. The PumpFun Large Solana Transfer Continues It is worth mentioning that this transaction is part of a pattern in which the launchpad has offloaded 1,573,313 SOL this year alone. On January 2, CoinGape reported that the launchpad moved 120,000 SOL worth approximately $22.88 million to Kraken. 2 hours ago, PumpFun ( @pumpdotfun ) deposited 54,113 $SOL valued at $7.81M, into #Kraken . In 2025, they sent a total of 1,573,313 $SOL worth $293.26M. Overall, they have earned 3,232,101 $SOL currently valued at $469.1M. pic.twitter.com/YMhtxRKF4Z — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) March 25, 2025 In addition, last month, it transferred another 148,759 SOL valued at $28.22 million, adding to the ongoing trend. According to the Onchain Lens data, over 1.5 million SOL moved this year, valued at $293.26 million. These frequent transactions often place Solana under intense selling pressure. Despite the initial projections of whether PumpFun was selling its Solana stash, some still argue the platform might have another reason for moving the coins. This latest transfer comes with potential debate on whether it could derail the mild consolidation Solana price has picked from earlier in the week. PumpFun and the PumpSwap Move In a bid to repair its ecosystem reputation, PumpFun has launched PumpSwap . This new platform is a decentralized exchange DEX designed to give traders and investors using the launchpad a more direct and efficient way to trade meme coins. Per the update, the platform intends to use the newly launched product to reduce dependence on centralized exchanges like Kraken. With it, it hopes to improve liquidity within the Solana ecosystem. While PumpSwap presents itself as a positive step, it remains unclear whether it can fully restore confidence in PumpFun’s activities, especially as large SOL transfers persist. Some investors see it as an attempt to shift focus away from ongoing selloff and other ethical concerns. Solana Price Outlook Amid Growing Consolidation Despite PumpFun’s frequent transactions, Solana’s price has remained relatively stable. After the February 13 transfer of 148,759 SOL, CoinGape reported that SOL price dropped by 1.2% before recovering. Furthermore, many analysts have mixed opinions on whether the market will continue consolidating or if Solana will record a breakout soon. Some stakeholders, like VanEck, see the coin soaring to $520 in the long term should market conditions be favorable. However, repeated large-scale transfers like those from PumpFun could serve as a headwind for the coin. As of this publication, CoinMarketCap data shows that SOL price was trading at $143.99, up 1.60% in the last 24 hours.

However, crypto analyst Ali Martinez warns that strong resistance may lie ahead. Bitcoin Finally Breaks Daily RSI Downtrend In a recent X post, crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC has broken through a multi-month RSI downtrend. The analyst shared a Bitcoin daily chart, showing how the leading cryptocurrency’s RSI has broken free from a prolonged downtrend that began at the start of the year. For the uninitiated, the RSI is a momentum indicator that suggests when the underlying asset – in this case, BTC – may be overbought or oversold. A rising RSI after sustained downtrend can indicate growing bullish momentum and a possible trend reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Hit $112,000, But Only If It Holds Above This Key Level – Analyst Explains Fellow crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader echoed Rekt Capital’s analysis, stating that the RSI breakout confirms bullish momentum and could pave the way for a significant price rally. Another key indicator turned bullish this week – the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons. In an X post, crypto analyst Robert Mercer noted: One of the most accurate mid-term indicator is bullish now. Expecting BTC to go back above $100,000 in Q2 of 2025! To explain, the Hash Ribbons indicator turning bullish signals that Bitcoin miners – after a period of capitulation – are returning to the network, suggesting mining recovery and reduced selling pressure. This often marks a strong buy signal, and has historically aligned with the end of bear markets and the start of new uptrends. Analyst Warns Of Stiff Resistance Ahead Despite BTC’s more than 15% surge from its March 10 low, seasoned analyst Ali Martinez cautions that the top digital asset is likely to encounter strong resistance around the $89,000 level. Martinez explained: Bitcoin $BTC faces a key resistance cluster at $89,000, where the 50-day moving average and the descending trendline from the all-time high converge. That said, several positive macroeconomic factors could support BTC’s bullish momentum. In a recent analysis, crypto analyst The M2 Guy emphasized that the expanding M2 money supply is likely to benefit risk-on assets like BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Probably’ Hit Its Bottom At $77,000, Arthur Hayes Says However, other cryptocurrency analysts – such as Maartunn – argued that BTC must decisively clear the $87,000 price level to have a shot at sustained upward price movement.

42344232,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143208,1742945455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionizing Finance: CME Group and Google Cloud Pioneer Asset Tokenization,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cme-group-asset-tokenization-google/,"Get ready for a seismic shift in the financial world! Imagine a future where assets, from stocks to real estate, are traded with unprecedented ease and efficiency, all thanks to the power of blockchain. This future is rapidly approaching, and leading the charge are industry giants like CME Group and Google Cloud. Let’s dive into their exciting collaboration and explore how they are set to revolutionize finance through asset tokenization . What is Asset Tokenization and Why is CME Group Exploring It? Asset tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets – anything from company shares and commodities to art and real estate – as digital tokens on a blockchain. Think of it as creating a digital twin of a physical or intangible asset. These tokens can then be easily traded, managed, and fractionalized, opening up a world of new possibilities. Why is CME Group, a global leader in derivatives trading, so interested in this space? The answer lies in the transformative potential of asset tokenization . Here’s why it’s a game-changer: Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenization can unlock liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets. For example, real estate, which can be slow and cumbersome to trade, can become far more liquid when fractionalized into tokens. Increased Accessibility: Asset tokenization democratizes investment opportunities. It allows smaller investors to participate in markets that were previously only accessible to large institutions. Imagine owning a fraction of a blue-chip artwork or a prime piece of real estate with just a few clicks. Operational Efficiency: Blockchain technology streamlines many processes associated with traditional asset management, such as settlement, custody, and compliance. This can lead to significant cost reductions and faster transaction times. Transparency and Security: Blockchain’s inherent transparency and security features provide a robust and auditable record of asset ownership and transactions, reducing fraud and increasing trust. For CME Group, embracing asset tokenization is a strategic move to stay ahead of the curve and cater to the evolving needs of the financial market. By exploring this technology, they are positioning themselves to offer innovative services and maintain their leadership in the global trading landscape. Google Cloud’s Universal Ledger: The Key to CME’s Tokenization Ambitions? The partnership between CME Group and Google Cloud is particularly intriguing because it leverages Google’s cutting-edge technology, specifically their new Universal Ledger. But what exactly is Universal Ledger, and why is it crucial for asset tokenization ? Google Cloud’s Universal Ledger is a blockchain-based infrastructure designed to provide a secure, scalable, and auditable platform for businesses to build and deploy decentralized applications. It stands out due to several key features: Scalability: Built on Google Cloud’s robust infrastructure, Universal Ledger is designed to handle high transaction volumes, crucial for the demands of mainstream financial markets. Interoperability: While details are still emerging, the “Universal” aspect suggests a focus on interoperability, meaning it could potentially connect with different blockchain networks, fostering a more unified and efficient ecosystem for asset tokenization . Security and Compliance: Google Cloud’s reputation for security and compliance is a major advantage. Universal Ledger is expected to offer enterprise-grade security features and tools to meet regulatory requirements, vital for the adoption of asset tokenization in regulated industries. Integration with Google Cloud Services: Leveraging the broader Google Cloud ecosystem provides access to powerful tools for data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, which can further enhance the capabilities of asset tokenization platforms. By choosing Google Cloud’s Universal Ledger, CME Group is opting for a technology partner that can provide the infrastructure, scalability, and security needed to realize the full potential of asset tokenization in the financial markets. Benefits of CME Group’s Asset Tokenization Initiative The collaboration between CME Group and Google Cloud to test asset tokenization is not just about technological innovation; it’s about unlocking tangible benefits for market participants. Let’s explore some of the key advantages: Benefit Description Reduced Transaction Costs Blockchain-based systems can automate many manual processes, reducing intermediaries and lowering transaction fees associated with traditional asset trading. Faster Settlement Times Traditional asset settlement can take days. Asset tokenization on a blockchain can enable near-instantaneous settlement, improving efficiency and reducing counterparty risk. Fractional Ownership Opportunities High-value assets can be fractionalized into smaller tokens, making them accessible to a wider range of investors and democratizing investment. 24/7 Trading Blockchain-based markets can operate 24/7, unlike traditional exchanges with limited trading hours, providing greater flexibility for global investors.

Rowe Price—the firm that handles over $1 trillion in assets—said that now is a good time to have exposure to bitcoin. He likened the price of bitcoin to a commodity and how investors should think about investing in it. “Bitcoin itself has traded very close to its average cost of mine. So if you think about it like a traditional commodity, that's actually historically a really good time to have exposure to it when it's close to its cost of mine,” he said. In traditional commodity investing, when the cost of mining or extracting a commodity is close to the spot price, it often signals that the commodity's price might have found the floor or has a limited downside. This is something contrarian investors look for when investing in commodities, as the bearish sentiment could be priced in when such an event occurs. Rizzo seems to be alluding to such a dynamic in play for bitcoin as well if one compares commodity cycles to bitcoin price. According to MacroMicro blog, the current average price of mining bitcoin is around $84,770, while the spot price is hovering near $87,000. How to play blockchain and AI revolution Rizzo also said that he sees blockchain and digital payments as an integral part of fintech and artificial intelligence (AI). “The world is getting more global, we're moving from cash to digital payments … so, I think digital payments is really at the nexus of moving money cheaply and taking a software-driven approach to areas that have historically been not software-driven,” according to Rizzo. He said part of this movement is blockchain, which he believes every investor should have some exposure to, whether through holding stocks of companies like Coinbase (COIN) or Robinhood (HOOD) or those of crypto miners profiting from the evolution of AI.",Finance|Bitcoin|commodity,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-25 23:30:57

Given the telecom’s underlying business fundamental s, strategic growth drivers, and defensive characteristics in a challenging overall economic backdrop, Goldman Sachs rates the stock as Buys and expects high upside ability in the next few years. Meanwhile, a nalyst James Schneider has a near-term price target of $29, nearly 8% higher than Monday’s close of $26.96. AT&T’s strong profits and generous dividend make it appealing to investors AT&T’s stock has done well lately: it’s up 21% YTD and better than 60% YTD (dividends excluded). When combined with the telecommunications company’s dividend yield of 4.1%, that’s a recipe for a strong income investment. Another big plus for AT&T is that it is less volatile than the market, at a beta of only 0.64. This indicates that the share price tends to be less sensitive to broad market moves, which is very attractive in uncertain economic times and makes stock perceived as a safe-haven investment. AT&T’s wireless business is still a hit. The company has continued to add new cell phone subscribers as demand for its network services is strong. At the same time, it is moving customers to more expensive premium plans, which boosts average revenue per user (ARPU) for its services and supports hometown revenue growth. Goldman Sachs then contends that such forces will quietly but inexorably raise earning estimates, which are the basis for the sustained revenue growth that the company has realized thus far. AT&T, as the most aggressive fiber builder in the U.S., is expected to see a significant boost in broadband profitability over the next five years. The company has also aggressively pursued fibre assets to replace their DSL/U-verse copper-based networks, increasing future capacity upgrades relative to other forms of access volume and a potentially cheaper model all-in for the company. Analysts also anticipate AT&T’s broadband revenue growth accelerating through the end of the decade as more residential customers migrate to fiber. Such focus will strengthen the firm’s broadband marketplace presence and balance sheet. The FCC is streamlining regulations to accelerate fibre transitions and drive cost savings for telecom companies Another major tailwind supporting AT&T’s fibre transition is regulatory tailwinds. The FCC is working on policies that will allow for faster decommissioning of legacy copper plants. Should these regulatory changes take off, AT&T has the potential to accelerate its fibre transition, ramp up its capacity, and realize its $6 billion savings targets. The transition from copper to fibre improves network efficiency and cuts maintenance and operating costs, both of which bode well for AT&T’s long-term fundamentals. Goldman Sachs attributes its positive outlook on AT&T, first and foremost, to the company’s strong market position, high dividend yield, and solid business fundamentals.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) space has been rocked by another exploit. This time, it’s Abracadabra, a popular DeFi platform known for its MIM stablecoin, that’s in the spotlight. In a startling turn of events, Abracadabra confirmed via X (formerly Twitter) that its gmCauldrons lending contracts were targeted in a sophisticated attack. Let’s break down what we know about this urgent situation and how Abracadabra is responding. What Happened? Unpacking the Abracadabra Exploit The alarm bells started ringing when unusual transactions were detected targeting Abracadabra’s gmCauldrons. These cauldrons are essentially lending contracts within the DeFi platform, allowing users to borrow assets. According to Abracadabra’s official statement, the exploit was identified after several malicious transactions had already taken place. In response, and to prevent further damage, borrowing has been immediately halted across all gmCauldrons. This proactive measure aims to contain the fallout and assess the full extent of the damage from this crypto hack . Here’s a quick rundown of the key details we know so far: Platform Targeted: Abracadabra DeFi platform Vulnerable Contracts: gmCauldrons lending contracts Issue: Exploit leading to unauthorized borrowing Response: Borrowing halted across all cauldrons Confirmation: Announced via Abracadabra’s official X account The Devastating Toll: $13 Million Crypto Hack The financial implications of this crypto hack are substantial. Blockchain security firm Peckshield, a trusted name in the industry, estimates the damage to be around 6,260 ETH. At current Ethereum prices, this translates to a staggering $13 million loss. This figure underscores the severity of the exploit and the significant financial hit Abracadabra has endured. The sheer scale of the stolen funds highlights the ongoing challenges in securing DeFi platforms against increasingly sophisticated attacks. It’s a stark reminder of the risks involved in the decentralized finance ecosystem, even for established platforms like Abracadabra. A Bold Move: 20% Bug Bounty Offered In a rather unconventional and perhaps desperate move, Abracadabra has offered a 20% bug bounty to the attacker. This means they are willing to pay 20% of the stolen funds – approximately $2.6 million based on the $13 million loss – for the return of the remaining 80%. Offering a bug bounty , especially of this magnitude, is a clear indication of Abracadabra’s urgency to recover the stolen assets and mitigate further damage. It’s a high-stakes gamble, hoping to incentivize the attacker to return the majority of the funds while potentially identifying vulnerabilities that led to the exploit. Whether the attacker will accept this offer remains to be seen, but it’s certainly a dramatic development in this unfolding situation. Let’s consider the implications of offering such a large bug bounty : Incentive for Return: A significant financial reward could entice the attacker to return funds. Reputation Management: Shows Abracadabra is taking proactive steps to resolve the issue. Vulnerability Insight: May lead to information about the exploit’s mechanics, helping prevent future attacks. Ethical Dilemma: Some may question rewarding malicious activity, even for fund recovery. Uncertain Outcome: No guarantee the attacker will accept or be identifiable. DeFi Platform Security: A Constant Battle This latest Abracadabra exploit serves as another stark reminder of the ongoing security challenges within the DeFi space. While DeFi platforms offer incredible innovation and financial opportunities, they are also prime targets for hackers. The decentralized and often open-source nature of these platforms can, paradoxically, create vulnerabilities if not rigorously audited and secured. The DeFi platform ecosystem is in a constant state of evolution, with new protocols and smart contracts being deployed regularly. This rapid pace of development can sometimes outstrip security measures, leaving gaps that malicious actors can exploit. For users, this underscores the importance of due diligence, understanding the risks involved, and choosing platforms with robust security track records. Here are some key takeaways regarding DeFi platform security: Aspect Consideration Smart Contract Audits Essential to identify vulnerabilities before deployment. Security Practices Rigorous testing, monitoring, and incident response plans are crucial. Community Vigilance Active community monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity can be invaluable. User Education Users need to understand risks and best practices for interacting with DeFi platforms. The Future of Abracadabra and MIM Stablecoin The immediate aftermath of this Abracadabra exploit raises questions about the future of the platform and its MIM stablecoin. While Abracadabra has acted swiftly to halt borrowing and offer a bug bounty , the incident will undoubtedly impact user confidence. The price of SPELL, Abracadabra’s native token, and the stability of MIM could face increased scrutiny in the short term. How Abracadabra handles this crisis, communicates with its community, and implements stronger security measures will be critical in determining its long-term viability. The resilience and transparency displayed in the coming days will be crucial for regaining trust and ensuring the continued operation of this prominent DeFi platform . In conclusion, the Abracadabra exploit is a significant event in the DeFi world, highlighting both the potential and the perils of decentralized finance. The $13 million crypto hack and the unprecedented bug bounty offer underscore the high stakes and fast-paced nature of this innovative yet risky space. As the situation unfolds, the crypto community will be watching closely to see how Abracadabra recovers and what lessons can be learned to bolster security across the entire DeFi ecosystem.

42344889,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143216,1742946631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Paid Startup: Manny Medina Unveils Lucrative AI Agent Billing Solution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/paid-startup-ai-agent-billing/,"The world of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, and 2024 is shaping up to be the year of the AI agent . As businesses increasingly explore the potential of these autonomous digital workers, a critical infrastructure is needed to support their growth and, crucially, their compensation. Enter Paid, a groundbreaking new venture from Manny Medina, the visionary founder of Outreach. Paid isn’t building AI agents themselves; instead, they are providing the essential financial rails – the picks and shovels, if you will – to ensure these digital entities, and the companies deploying them, thrive in this new era. Bitcoin World had the exclusive scoop on this exciting development. Decoding the Challenge of AI Agent Pricing Manny Medina, fresh off his success at sales automation giant Outreach (valued at a staggering $4.4 billion), recognized a significant gap in the burgeoning AI agents landscape. After extensive conversations with numerous agentic platform startups, a recurring pain point emerged: how do you effectively and profitably charge for the work of AI agents ? The traditional software pricing models simply don’t translate to this paradigm shift. Forget per-user or per-seat licenses – the very essence of AI agents is their ability to operate autonomously and at scale. One human employee might oversee dozens, or even hundreds, of agents. Similarly, usage-based pricing, reminiscent of the SaaS revolution, also falls short. If AI agents are truly effective, they are designed to take over entire roles, not just perform discrete tasks. Medina astutely points out, “An agent’s customer doesn’t want to pay for all the discrete tasks an agent does – if it even knows them all. They want to pay for its results, like an employee.” Imagine an AI agent deployed in insurance, tasked with policy renewals. The client isn’t concerned with the number of emails sent or actions taken; they care about the successful policy renewals generated. This outcome-based expectation clashes with the variable costs associated with running AI agents , primarily driven by the consumption of LLM tokens during training and task execution. This complexity creates a significant hurdle for startups in the AI agent space. “So how do you help them price for the job that they’re delivering?” Medina questioned, highlighting the core problem Paid aims to solve. These startups need the flexibility to experiment with different AI pricing strategies and, crucially, to accurately measure their profit margins. Paid: Bridging Billing and HR for the AI Agent Era The novelty of AI agents means that fundamental business processes, like profitable billing and renewals, are still largely uncharted territory. Paid steps in to provide this crucial framework. The platform empowers agentic startups to craft sophisticated AI pricing models – whether fixed or variable – with a laser focus on achieving profitable margins. Beyond just billing, Paid also incorporates agent output tracking. This dual functionality allows startups to not only optimize their agent billing strategies but also to rigorously validate the return on investment (ROI) generated by their AI agents . Think of it as the next-generation evolution of SaaS business tools: Zuora (the leader in SaaS renewal billing) converging with SuccessFactors (a powerhouse in SaaS HR management), specifically tailored for the age of AI agents . Paid’s initial target market is startups, rather than established enterprise giants like Salesforce or Microsoft, which are also venturing into agentic platforms. However, by focusing on the startups building the next wave of AI innovation, Paid is positioning itself at the very heart of the AI agent revolution. Already, Paid boasts an impressive roster of beta customers, including Logic.app, 11x, Vidlab7, Artisan, and HappyRobot, showcasing the immediate need and appeal of their platform. The Power of AI in Building Paid Medina emphasizes the transformative impact of AI not just on the solutions Paid enables, but also on the very process of building the company itself. “Agents are replacing roles, human roles, not the entire job, but entire roles,” Medina stated, underscoring the profound shift underway. He’s putting this philosophy into practice by leveraging AI tools to accelerate Paid’s development. The initial product demos for Paid were “vibe coded” by their engineers using cutting-edge AI -powered tools like V0, Replit, and Lovable. Medina is clearly excited about this new paradigm of company building. “This is what is so much fun about building a company right now. We have two engineers, and we have built the entirety of the building platform in a month. Why? Because we build everything on AI,” he revealed, highlighting the unprecedented speed and efficiency AI brings to software development. Manny Medina: From Outreach to Paid – A Serial Entrepreneur’s Journey Manny Medina’s track record speaks for itself. His journey with Outreach is a testament to his entrepreneurial prowess. From its humble beginnings in 2011, he steered Outreach to become a dominant force in sales automation, scaling it to 800 employees and $250 million in annual recurring revenue by the time he stepped down as CEO in September. While he later relinquished his executive chairman role in March (remaining on the board), Medina’s entrepreneurial spirit remains as vibrant as ever. Now based in London, he is channeling his experience and vision into Paid, ready to tackle the next frontier of business in the AI agent era. Paid’s successful €10 million (approximately $11 million) pre-seed funding round, led by European powerhouse EQT Ventures, alongside Sequoia and GTMFund, is a strong validation of Medina’s vision and the critical need for a platform like Paid. As AI agents become increasingly integral to the business landscape, Paid is poised to become the indispensable infrastructure that ensures their economic viability and fuels the continued growth of this transformative technology.

To fund this initiative, a total of 10 million DOGE tokens worth approximately $1.8 million were bought. House of Doge has been tasked with promoting the cryptocurrency’s appeal as a payment method to corporate partners – e.g. merchants. “The Official @Dogecoin Reserve” … sooner than Powered By : @houseofdoge & @DogecoinFdn $DOGE #dogecoin Dogecoin is Money! pic.twitter.com/xGuRKIei7o — House of Doge (@houseofdoge) March 14, 2025 “By maintaining a reserve, we can bridge the gap between transaction processing times and real-world usability, making Dogecoin extremely practical for everyday purchases,” commented Michael Galloro, Member of the Board-Elect of House of Doge in a press release published on Monday. The announcement has sparked enthusiasm among market participants, with Dogecoin (DOGE) outperforming its meme coin peers today. While Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have posted modest 24-hour gains of 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively, FLOKI and WIF have slipped by 0.2% and 1.1%. DOGE trading volume has surged by 41% in the past day as investors rushed to gain exposure following the news. This momentum highlights a growing trend of meme coins gaining utility beyond their origins as internet culture icons or speculative assets. If more merchants begin accepting Dogecoin for payments, the token’s real-world use case could drive increased demand and help cement its status as the leading meme coin. DOGE Climbs for a Third Consecutive Day – Is the Sell-Off Over? DOGE’s daily chart shows that the token found a temporary floor at the $0.1400 level during the early March sell-off. The token has been rising for three days in a row as positive momentum seems to be picking up its pace. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above the signal line and has distanced itself from it by nearly 31% already, which is bullish. Meanwhile, the MACD’s histogram shows steadily rising positive momentum readings. DOGE is also breaking a bearish descending triangle today. This is another early sign that the token could be about to reverse its downtrend. However, a reversal would only be confirmed if DOGE rises above its most recent lower high at $0.2410. If that happens, we could witness a full-blown recovery over the next few months for DOGE as market sentiment continues to improve. Identifying which meme coins will outperform the market can be a difficult task. Meme Index ($MEMEX) is becoming one of the best crypto presales of the year as it makes it easier for investors to get diversified exposure to this sector. Meme Index ($MEMEX) Raises $4M to Launch its Decentralized Meme Coin Investing Platform Meme Index ($MEMEX) is a decentralized investment platform designed to simplify and diversify exposure to the meme coin market. It offers four tailored index baskets—Titan, Moonshot, Midcap, and Meme Frenzy—allowing investors to choose based on their individual risk profiles. $MEMEX serves as the utility token and gateway to the platform. As adoption grows among meme coin investors, demand for $MEMEX is expected to rise significantly. Currently priced at a discounted $0.0166883 during its presale, $MEMEX presents a compelling opportunity for early buyers. Many analysts anticipate a sharp price increase once the token is listed on major exchanges. To buy $MEMEX, simply head to the Meme Index website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can swap ETH or USDT for this token or use a bank card to make your investment.

According to Dune Analytics data, most of that volume has come within the last 24 hours, during which time the protocol generated over $500 million in volume. Over the last 24 hours, the massive trading volume has continued a positive trend for the newly launched DEX, which started operating on March 20. Since its launch, PumpSwap has recorded 12.58 million total swaps from over 401,000 active traders. PumpSwap volume has been on rapid rise (Source: Dune Analytics) With PumpSwap, people who launch tokens on Pump.fun can move their tokens directly to the DEX as soon as they complete the bonding curve. A bonding curve is a mathematical model that determines a token’s price based on its supply, with the price increasing as more tokens are bought. The launch of PumpSwap finally allows memecoin creators to migrate to DEX without paying the 6 SOL migration fee and with plans to enable creators’ revenue sharing later on. Unsurprisingly, the increase in DEX trading volume also means revenue is rising. Per Dune Analytics, the total protocol fees generated so far are $2.4 million, while liquidity providers have received over $600,000 in fees. PumpSwap charges 0.25% in fees, of which 0.2% is for the liquidity providers and 0.005% is for the protocol. Despite the relatively positive performance, an in-depth analysis of its performance metrics shows that most of the protocol’s trades are small transactions. According to Flipside data, 65.22% of its trades, when last updated, were for transactions less than $10, while 21.40% were between $10 and $100. Over 86% of PumpSwap transactions in the last 24 hours is between $1 to $100 (Source: Flipside) This shows that most of its users are still testing out its abilities and do not trust it with their big transactions yet. It could also signify that they want to engage the protocol with the hope of a future airdrop. Nevertheless, many people have already tried out the network, with a total number of unique users now at 3.57 million, with 823 tokens graduated Is PumpSwap coming for Raydium throne? Meanwhile, the rising transaction volume and massive influx of unique addresses interacting with the DEX have led many observers to note that it could challenge Raydium. Raydium is Solana’s leading DEX, with $2.53 billion in volume over the past week, according to Defillama . The protocol also accounts for 27.94% of the DEX volume on Solan, while PumpSwap comes fifth, behind Orca, Meteora, and Linfinity. However, Raydium is now sitting content while watching PumpSwap rise. The DEX also recently unveiled LaunchLab, its own token issuance platform that seems to target Pump.fun. While Pump.fun has established itself as the memecoin deployer, Raydium is positioning LaunchLab as the platform for issuing all kinds of projects and providing permissionless and neutral infrastructure for Solana-based projects to launch their tokens. So far, PumpSwap’s arrival has had little impact on Raydium, as the protocol continues to command significant volume. Its token, RAY, is also performing well. According to CoinMarketCap, RAY has been up 22% in the last seven days and has seen a gain of around 1% in the last 24 hours. The biggest beneficiary of this competition in the Solana ecosystem appears to be the network itself. SOL is now on a rebound, rising 2% in the last 24 hours and 17% in the past seven days.

The trio used spoofed phone numbers and fake support calls to impersonate Google and Gemini representatives, manipulating the victim into transferring funds and resetting their two-factor authentication. The largest transaction happened at 4:05 am UTC when they transferred 4064 BTC, valued at $238 million, in a single transaction.

The indictment revealed both were arrested sometime in September 2024 and charged with conspiring to steal and launder cryptocurrency. They were set to appear in separate federal courts in California and Florida on Thursday, September 19, 2024 according to the Justice Department. According to Zach’s investigation, a cluster of the stolen funds was allegedly used to purchase luxury goods including cars, watches, jewelry and designer clothes. Unlike the other two, Malone had not revealed his identity during the heist but his flashy lifestyle gave him away. With his loot, Lam allegedly purchased a fleet of luxury vehicles, including a Pagani Huayra worth $3.8 million, a Lamborghini Revuelto worth $1 million, and custom Porsches and Ferraris. Authorities have reported that 22 luxury vehicles belonging to Lam are still missing, including a white Lamborghini with his name on it. Aside from the luxury cars, Malone also rented multiple mansions and acquired luxury watches, purchasing one of the watches for about $1.8 million. Within the short period of time that he got the loot, Malone quickly built himself a reputation in the Los Angeles nightlife scenes because of how he spent. He would give out handbags to strangers, including influencers, many of whom would recount their experience in Instagram videos. Malone was linked to the loot after accidentally sharing an address used to purchase luxury clothing. Greavys was the first to be arrested. He was located via OSINT in LA/Miami because his friends kept posting his location on social media every night. He also had an Instagram account where he shared photos of himself using his name in 2024. Greavys’ partner tried to warn Malone of the trouble headed his way after her boyfriend’s arrest, and he tried to flee but was apprehended in the process. Box and Wiz converted most of the funds to XMR, but they slipped up by accidentally linking the laundered funds with the dirty funds in multiple instances. 11/ While most of the funds were converted to XMR both Box and Wiz accidentally linked the laundered funds with the dirty funds on multiple instances. a) Wiz during screenshare showed an address he sent funds to for designer clothes which had millions in exposure to the cluster… pic.twitter.com/L0e2zzguyG — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) September 19, 2024 CFInvestigators, zeroshadow, ZachXBT and Binance Security were able to use this information to freeze over $9 million, with $500,000 returned to the victim. Lam is currently facing two counts of indictment in the District of Columbia for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. Each charge he’s accused of carries a maximum term of 20 years. He is presently being held in Virginia, with his lawyer Scott Armstrong noting that his trial will occur in October 2025. The lawyer also said Lam wants to file other legal attacks, with most of them being suppressive motions that require the US government to provide meaningful discovery in the case against him. The crypto fraudster, who is considered a flight risk, is also reportedly calling for the search warrant affidavits and reports relevant to the searches that were carried out in his case. According to prosecutors, Lam could be looking at between 168 and 210 months in jail due to the gravity of the crime, with about $100 million in stolen Bitcoin still missing.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 542,00 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s current bull market cycle has yet to reach a peak. “BTC bull market progress: 82.5%. (Progress will speed up on parabolic advances and slow down on deeper retraces).” Source: Rekt Capital/X The analyst also tells his 107,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin’s latest correction to $76,000 is not the sign of a beginning bear market based on historical precedence. “Many people have been talking about this being a bear market, but it does look like it is a downside deviation period very similar to what we’ve seen back in the past. Obviously, these downside deviation periods are changing across time, but it’s really important to look at the charts in a level-headed manner and try and look at it in an unbiased way and not scream bear market whenever we see a pullback that is actually very similar to the one we saw here [in 2024]. This was a 32% pullback [in 2024]. This is a 30% pullback [when Bitcoin corrected to the $76,000 range this month], so very similar downside deviation in that regard, but really important to keep level-headed and look at the data, look at the chart, and zoom out when in doubt.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube In technical analysis, a downside deviation is a setup where an asset breaks its immediate support to print a false breakdown before igniting a recovery and rallying to new highs.

The Bitcoin market is buzzing with exciting news. Fidelity’s FBTC Bitcoin ETF has just witnessed a massive $60 million inflow, according to data from Arkham Intelligence on X. This significant surge is not just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure. Are we on the cusp of another major wave of adoption? Let’s dive deep into what this means for Bitcoin and the broader crypto landscape. Why is the Fidelity FBTC Bitcoin ETF attracting such massive inflows? The recent $60 million injection into Fidelity’s FBTC Bitcoin ETF is a noteworthy event for several reasons. It underscores a continued and, perhaps, accelerating trend of institutional investors seeking regulated and convenient pathways to gain exposure to Bitcoin. But what makes the Fidelity FBTC ETF so appealing? Let’s break it down: Reputable Provider: Fidelity is a globally recognized and trusted financial institution with decades of experience in asset management. This established reputation provides a sense of security and reliability for investors, especially larger institutional players who prioritize counterparty risk. Ease of Access: For institutions and even retail investors, investing in a Bitcoin ETF is significantly simpler than directly purchasing and storing Bitcoin. ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them accessible through brokerage accounts that many institutions already utilize. Regulatory Compliance: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a layer of compliance and investor protection that is often lacking in the direct purchase of cryptocurrencies. This regulatory clarity is particularly attractive to institutional investors who must adhere to strict compliance standards. Diversification Benefits: For portfolio managers, adding a Bitcoin ETF can offer diversification benefits, potentially enhancing risk-adjusted returns. Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds makes it an attractive diversifier. The inflow into Fidelity FBTC isn’t happening in isolation. It’s part of a larger narrative of increasing institutional acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into mainstream finance. This latest influx suggests that the narrative is gaining momentum. Institutional Investment in Bitcoin ETFs: What does it really signify? Institutional investment is often considered the holy grail for Bitcoin and the crypto market in general. Why? Because it represents a substantial influx of capital, validation of Bitcoin as an asset class, and a move towards broader mainstream adoption. Here’s what this increasing institutional interest, exemplified by the Fidelity FBTC inflow, really signifies: Increased Market Liquidity: Larger institutional players bring significant capital to the market, which can lead to increased liquidity. This, in turn, can reduce volatility and make the market more efficient. Price Appreciation Potential: As demand for Bitcoin increases through institutional investment in ETFs and other avenues, basic economics suggests that the price of Bitcoin could appreciate. Limited supply coupled with rising demand is a classic recipe for price increases. Mainstream Validation: When established institutions like Fidelity allocate capital to Bitcoin ETFs, it sends a powerful signal to the broader market. It validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, moving it further away from the fringes and closer to the mainstream. Long-Term Investment Horizon: Institutional investors typically have a longer-term investment horizon compared to retail traders. This can contribute to greater stability in the Bitcoin market, reducing the impact of short-term speculative trading. The $60 million inflow into Fidelity FBTC is a tangible manifestation of this growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Decoding Bitcoin Inflows: Is there a direct link to price action? The crypto world is always trying to decipher patterns and predict price movements. Naturally, a significant event like a $60 million Bitcoin inflow into an ETF raises the question: Does this directly translate to positive price action for Bitcoin? While there’s no guaranteed one-to-one correlation, there are strong reasons to believe that Bitcoin inflows into ETFs can be a positive catalyst. Let’s consider the dynamics: Increased Demand: ETF inflows represent actual buying pressure in the Bitcoin market. To fulfill the ETF demand, fund providers like Fidelity need to purchase Bitcoin, directly increasing demand for the asset. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins. Increased demand from ETFs and other sources, against a limited supply, can create upward pressure on prices. Market Sentiment: Positive news like significant ETF inflows can boost market sentiment. Positive sentiment can attract more investors, both institutional and retail, further fueling demand and potentially price appreciation. However, it’s crucial to remember that the Bitcoin market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. While Bitcoin inflows into ETFs are a positive indicator, they are just one piece of the puzzle. External factors can sometimes overshadow even strong positive inflows. Therefore, while these inflows are encouraging, a holistic view of the market is always necessary. The Broader Crypto ETF Landscape: Are other Crypto ETFs seeing similar traction? While the spotlight is currently on Fidelity FBTC due to the $60 million inflow, it’s important to look at the broader Crypto ETF landscape. Are other ETFs experiencing similar positive trends? The answer, to some extent, is yes. The launch and growth of various Bitcoin ETFs, particularly in regions like North America, have collectively contributed to increased institutional and retail access to Bitcoin. Here’s a glimpse into the broader landscape: Crypto ETF Focus Cryptocurrency Key Features Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) Bitcoin One of the earliest and largest Bitcoin investment vehicles, transitioning to an ETF. iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) Bitcoin Offered by BlackRock, a global leader in asset management, providing broad market access. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) Bitcoin Futures First U.S. Bitcoin-linked ETF, offering exposure through futures contracts. Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BTF) Bitcoin Futures Another Bitcoin futures ETF, providing an alternative exposure route. Various Spot Bitcoin ETFs in Canada Bitcoin Canada has been ahead in approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, offering diverse options. The success of Fidelity FBTC and other Crypto ETFs is paving the way for further innovation and product development in the crypto investment space. We may see ETFs focused on other cryptocurrencies, thematic crypto ETFs, and more sophisticated investment products emerging in the future. This expanding landscape offers investors more choices and further legitimizes crypto as a viable investment category. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Adoption? The $60 million inflow into Fidelity FBTC is more than just a single data point; it’s a signpost pointing towards a future where Bitcoin ETFs play an increasingly central role in institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Looking ahead, here are some key aspects to watch: Continued Inflow Momentum: Will the inflow into Bitcoin ETFs , including Fidelity FBTC , continue at this pace or even accelerate? Sustained inflows would further strengthen the bullish case for Bitcoin. Regulatory Developments: Regulatory clarity and support for crypto ETFs in various jurisdictions will be crucial for broader institutional participation. Positive regulatory signals could unlock even larger pools of capital. Performance of Bitcoin ETFs: The performance of existing Bitcoin ETFs will influence investor sentiment and future allocation decisions. Strong performance could attract more investors and further validate the ETF structure. Expansion to Other Cryptocurrencies: Will the success of Bitcoin ETFs pave the way for ETFs based on other leading cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, or even baskets of cryptocurrencies? This expansion would broaden the crypto investment universe accessible through traditional financial channels. The journey of institutional adoption of Bitcoin through ETFs is still in its early stages, but the recent $60 million inflow into Fidelity FBTC is a powerful indication of the direction of travel. It suggests that institutional investors are becoming increasingly comfortable with Bitcoin as an asset class and are utilizing ETFs as a preferred vehicle for gaining exposure. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal for Bitcoin’s Future The $60 million inflow into Fidelity’s FBTC Bitcoin ETF is undoubtedly a stunning development. It’s a clear signal that institutional interest in Bitcoin is not just a fleeting trend but a growing conviction. This influx of capital into a reputable Bitcoin ETF like Fidelity FBTC validates Bitcoin’s position in the evolving financial landscape and suggests a bright future for crypto adoption. As Bitcoin inflows into ETFs continue and the Crypto ETF market matures, we can expect to see further integration of digital assets into mainstream investment portfolios, potentially driving significant growth and stability in the crypto market.

This bold initiative, detailed in a formal correspondence to the SEC’s crypto task force, signals a proactive approach towards fostering innovation while ensuring regulatory clarity in the burgeoning Web3 space. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development and explore what it could mean for the future of digital assets and Web3. What is Tokenization and Why is it Crucial for Web3? Before we delve into the specifics of the Asia Web3 Alliance’s proposal, it’s essential to understand the core concept of tokenization . In simple terms, tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets or rights as digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens can represent anything from traditional securities and commodities to intellectual property, real estate, and even loyalty points. The importance of tokenization for Web3 is multifaceted: Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenizing assets makes them more easily divisible and tradable, unlocking liquidity in previously illiquid markets. Fractional Ownership: It allows for fractional ownership of high-value assets, democratizing investment opportunities and making them accessible to a wider range of participants. Increased Efficiency and Transparency: Blockchain-based tokenization streamlines processes, reduces intermediaries, and enhances transparency in transactions. New Business Models: Tokenization paves the way for innovative business models and decentralized applications (dApps) in the Web3 ecosystem. As Web3 continues to evolve, tokenization is poised to become a cornerstone of the new digital economy, bridging the gap between the traditional financial world and the decentralized future. Asia Web3 Alliance’s Bold Proposal: Bridging the Regulatory Gap The Asia Web3 Alliance, a prominent organization based in Japan, is taking a proactive stance to address the regulatory complexities surrounding tokenization and Web3. Their proposal to the U.S. SEC outlines a framework for joint cooperation aimed at promoting both innovation and responsible regulation. The alliance envisions a collaborative effort involving key regulatory bodies from both regions, specifically suggesting the participation of: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan Bank of Japan (BoJ) This multi-agency approach underscores the comprehensive nature of the proposal, recognizing that effective Web3 regulation requires a coordinated effort across different sectors and jurisdictions. The core objectives of this proposed collaboration are ambitious and forward-thinking, designed to lay a solid foundation for the future of tokenization and Web3. Why Tokenization Regulation Matters for Cross-Border Web3 Growth? One of the biggest hurdles for the widespread adoption of tokenization and Web3 technologies is the lack of clear and consistent regulatory frameworks globally. The current regulatory landscape is fragmented, with different jurisdictions adopting varying approaches to digital assets and blockchain-based innovations. This creates uncertainty, hinders cross-border transactions, and stifles innovation. The Asia Web3 Alliance recognizes this challenge and emphasizes the critical need for regulatory interoperability. Their proposal specifically aims to address this issue by focusing on: Developing a Token Classification Framework: Creating a clear and harmonized framework to distinguish between tokenized securities and utility tokens is paramount. This will provide much-needed clarity for businesses and investors, reducing ambiguity and fostering compliance. Supporting Cross-Border Token Issuance: Facilitating the seamless issuance of tokens across different jurisdictions is crucial for promoting global Web3 growth. This requires establishing mutual recognition and compliance standards. Establishing Cross-Border Token Trading and Custody Standards: Developing standardized protocols for the trading and custody of tokens across borders will enhance security, efficiency, and investor protection in the global Web3 marketplace. By tackling these key areas, the proposed collaboration seeks to create a more unified and predictable regulatory environment, paving the way for accelerated growth in the global Web3 ecosystem . Key Benefits of the Proposed Collaboration for Web3 Innovation The potential benefits of a successful collaboration between the U.S. SEC and Asian regulatory bodies on Web3 regulation are substantial and far-reaching. This initiative could act as a catalyst for innovation, fostering a more robust and globally interconnected Web3 ecosystem. Some of the key advantages include: Benefit Description Regulatory Clarity and Certainty Harmonized regulations will provide businesses and investors with greater clarity and predictability, encouraging investment and participation in the Web3 space. Reduced Compliance Burden Interoperable regulations will simplify compliance for companies operating across borders, reducing costs and administrative hurdles. Accelerated Innovation A more favorable regulatory environment will foster innovation and experimentation in tokenization and Web3 technologies. Enhanced Investor Protection Jointly developed standards for trading and custody will strengthen investor protection in the evolving digital asset market. Global Web3 Growth By promoting cross-border collaboration and interoperability, this initiative can contribute to the overall growth and maturation of the global Web3 ecosystem. Moreover, the proposal includes the establishment of a “safe harbor mechanism” for early-stage token projects and learning sandbox test models from the U.S. This demonstrates a commitment to nurturing innovation from the ground up, providing a supportive environment for startups and emerging Web3 ventures. What are the Challenges in Tokenization and Cross-Border Regulation? While the Asia Web3 Alliance’s proposal is undoubtedly a positive step, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent challenges in achieving effective tokenization regulation and cross-border collaboration. Navigating these complexities will be crucial for the success of this initiative. Some of the key challenges include: Divergent Regulatory Philosophies: The U.S. and Asian countries may have different regulatory philosophies and priorities, making it challenging to reach a consensus on unified standards. Technological Complexity: Web3 technologies are rapidly evolving, making it difficult for regulators to keep pace and develop future-proof regulations. Enforcement Challenges: Enforcing cross-border regulations in a decentralized and global Web3 environment presents significant logistical and legal hurdles. Data Privacy and Security Concerns: Balancing innovation with data privacy and security requirements is a critical consideration in Web3 regulation . Political and Economic Factors: Geopolitical dynamics and economic competition between nations could also influence the progress and outcomes of regulatory collaboration. Overcoming these challenges will require sustained dialogue, compromise, and a shared commitment to fostering responsible innovation in the Web3 space. Examples of Successful Tokenization Initiatives Globally Despite the regulatory hurdles, tokenization is already gaining traction across various sectors globally, showcasing its transformative potential. Examining successful examples can provide valuable insights and inspire further innovation. Here are a few notable examples: Real Estate Tokenization: Platforms like RealT are tokenizing real estate properties, allowing investors to purchase fractions of properties with cryptocurrency, increasing accessibility and liquidity in the real estate market. Security Token Offerings (STOs): Companies are utilizing STOs to raise capital by issuing tokenized securities, offering a regulated alternative to traditional Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and expanding access to investment opportunities. Supply Chain Tokenization: Blockchain-based tokenization is being used to track and manage supply chains, enhancing transparency, efficiency, and traceability of goods. Digital Collectibles (NFTs): Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized the digital art and collectibles market, demonstrating the power of tokenization in creating unique and verifiable digital assets. Tokenized Carbon Credits: Initiatives are emerging to tokenize carbon credits, creating a more transparent and efficient market for carbon offsetting and promoting environmental sustainability. These examples highlight the diverse applications of tokenization and its potential to disrupt and improve various industries. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Future of Web3 Regulation The Asia Web3 Alliance’s proposal offers valuable insights for stakeholders navigating the evolving landscape of Web3 regulation . Here are some actionable takeaways: Proactive Engagement is Key: Industry players should proactively engage with regulators to shape the regulatory framework and ensure it is conducive to innovation.

This comes as Americans continue to view the U.S. economy negatively due to rising prices and uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s policies. The economic outlook’s uncertainty is seriously affecting consumers’ predictions of their future well-being By March, the Conference Board consumer confidence index had reached 92.9, the lowest level in four years and down from February’s 98.3. The expectations index, which examines consumers’ short-term expectations for business, labour market, and income conditions, also declined in February and March. At 65.2% in March, the expectations index was far below the 80-point mark, which, according to the Conference Board, normally indicates an impending recession. February also saw a decline, with the index falling to 72.9—the first time it had dipped below 80 since June 2024. Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior U.S. economist at the Conference Board, said one of their most striking findings was how consumers’ expectations concerning their financial circumstances had deteriorated. “So that does seem to indicate that all this uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook is really beginning to weigh on consumers’ (view) of how they will do going forward,” she added. In addition, consumer expectations for the economy have weakened, according to multiple readings, including Tuesday’s. The market is increasingly concerned that consumers could pull back on spending if they grow more pessimistic about the economy. The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and economists disagree on whether “soft” survey data, such as the consumer confidence index, will make “hard” economic data, like real consumer spending, worse. “There’ve been lots of times when people are saying downbeat stuff about the economy, and they go out and buy a new car,” Powell said. However, we can’t assume that that will be the case here. We will be watching closely for weakness in the real data.” For now, however, most economists have insisted that there remains no clear sign of a sharp slowdown, even if the overall growth trajectory for the U.S. economy is likely weaker than expected going into the year. On Sunday, Morgan Stanley’s chief global economist wrote in a research note to clients that all recession-related crises are probably overstated. He pointed to the worrying collapse of retail sales in January before rebounding in February. U.S. consumers express low confidence through growing financial pessimism According to the February edition of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, which was made public on Monday, March 10, consumers were less confident about their future financial circumstances even though their medium- and long-term inflation expectations remained constant. Furthermore, the bank’s Centre for Macroeconomic Data revealed notable drops in expectations regarding credit accessibility, delinquency, and unemployment. Based on credit accessibility, a greater percentage of households believed it was harder to obtain credit, whereas a smaller percentage believed it was simpler. Additionally, three banking regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released data on Monday that indicated weakening credit quality among borrowers with balances exceeding $100 million. The regulators explained that the reasons for the negative trends in credit quality were the pressure of high interest rates on leveraged borrowers and the compressed operating margins in certain industry sectors.

42346074,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143220,1742949035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Victory for Crypto: FDIC Kills ‘Reputational Risk’ in Bank Supervision,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fdic-kills-reputational-risk/,"In a move hailed as a significant win for the cryptocurrency industry, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has officially removed ‘reputational risk’ as a criterion for bank supervision. This decision, celebrated by figures like David Sacks, a former Trump administration official, marks a pivotal shift away from subjective standards that have previously hindered crypto businesses’ access to traditional banking services. For years, the specter of ‘reputational risk’ has loomed large, often used as a vague justification to deny banking to legitimate crypto enterprises. Is this the end of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and a new era of fairness for the digital asset space? Why is Removing ‘Reputational Risk’ from Bank Supervision a Big Deal? The removal of ‘reputational risk’ from the FDIC’s supervisory framework is not just bureaucratic jargon; it’s a fundamental change with real-world implications. Previously, banks could cite ‘reputational risk’ – a nebulous and often subjective concept – to justify severing ties with or refusing service to businesses deemed undesirable. In practice, this vague standard became a tool to target lawful cryptocurrency firms, a phenomenon critics dubbed ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’. Think of it this way: Subjectivity vs. Objectivity: ‘Reputational risk’ is inherently subjective. What one regulator deems risky, another might not. This lack of clarity created uncertainty and stifled innovation in the crypto sector. Chilling Effect: The mere threat of being labeled ‘reputationally risky’ could deter banks from working with crypto companies, even those operating within legal boundaries. Lack of Transparency: Decisions based on ‘reputational risk’ were often opaque, leaving crypto businesses in the dark about the specific concerns and with limited recourse. By eliminating this criterion, the FDIC is signaling a move towards objective, data-driven assessments of risk. Banks will now be expected to rely on concrete factors like financial stability, compliance with regulations, and actual, demonstrable risks, rather than vague notions of ‘reputational risk’. David Sacks and the Echoes of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 David Sacks, a prominent voice in the tech and crypto space, didn’t mince words in his praise for the FDIC’s decision. As the former Director of Cryptocurrency and AI in the Trump administration, Sacks has been a vocal critic of what he perceives as regulatory overreach targeting the crypto industry. His reference to ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’ is particularly telling. Operation Chokepoint, initiated by the Obama administration, aimed to combat fraud by pressuring banks to cut ties with businesses deemed ‘high-risk’. While the original intent might have been laudable, critics argue that it was misused to target legitimate industries. ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0′, as coined by some, suggests a similar pattern – a perceived effort to stifle the cryptocurrency industry by leveraging banking regulations. Sacks’ endorsement underscores the significance of the FDIC’s move in the context of these past regulatory challenges. His statement on X (formerly Twitter) highlights the relief felt by many in the crypto community who believe that ‘reputational risk’ was weaponized to unfairly target their businesses. Senator Tim Scott and the FIRM Act: Legislative Muscle Behind Fair Bank Supervision While the FDIC’s action is a regulatory shift, it’s also intertwined with broader legislative efforts to bring clarity and fairness to bank supervision. David Sacks specifically credited Senator Tim Scott’s leadership through the FIRM Act. But what is the FIRM Act, and how does it connect to this FDIC decision? The FIRM Act (Financial Innovation and Regulatory Modernization Act) , championed by Senator Tim Scott, aims to modernize the regulatory framework for financial technology and digital assets. A key objective of the FIRM Act is to promote innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. It seeks to achieve this by: Establishing Clear Regulatory Boundaries: The FIRM Act aims to provide clearer guidelines for how existing financial regulations apply to new technologies like cryptocurrencies. Encouraging Innovation: By reducing regulatory uncertainty, the Act intends to foster innovation and growth in the fintech and digital asset sectors. Promoting Competition: A more level playing field, as envisioned by the FIRM Act, could encourage competition and benefit consumers. The FDIC’s decision to drop ‘reputational risk’ aligns perfectly with the spirit of the FIRM Act. It signals a move towards a more objective, less discriminatory approach to bank supervision, which is crucial for the healthy development of the cryptocurrency industry within the regulated financial system. Benefits of Objective Bank Supervision for Crypto Firms The shift towards objective, data-driven bank supervision, spurred by the FDIC’s action and supported by legislative efforts like the FIRM Act, unlocks a range of benefits for cryptocurrency firms. Let’s explore some key advantages: Benefit Description Improved Access to Banking Services Crypto firms, especially smaller businesses and startups, will find it easier to open and maintain bank accounts, access loans, and utilize other essential financial services. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty Clearer, objective criteria for bank supervision reduces the ambiguity and fear associated with ‘reputational risk’, fostering a more predictable regulatory environment. Fairer Competitive Landscape By eliminating subjective barriers, the FDIC’s move promotes a fairer playing field where crypto firms are judged on their actual risk profile, not on perceived reputational issues. Encouraged Innovation and Growth With better access to banking and reduced regulatory hurdles, the cryptocurrency industry can focus on innovation and growth, driving economic activity and job creation. Enhanced Investor Confidence A more stable and predictable regulatory environment can boost investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market, attracting further investment and development. Are There Challenges Ahead? Navigating the New Landscape of Bank Supervision While the FDIC’s decision is undoubtedly a positive step, it’s crucial to acknowledge that challenges may still lie ahead. The removal of ‘reputational risk’ doesn’t automatically guarantee smooth sailing for crypto firms. What potential hurdles remain? Implementation and Enforcement: The true impact of this policy change will depend on how effectively it is implemented and enforced by bank supervisors. Consistent and fair application across all banks is essential. Residual Subjectivity: Even with ‘reputational risk’ removed, some degree of subjectivity might still creep into bank supervision. Regulators must remain vigilant against implicit biases and ensure truly objective assessments. Ongoing Regulatory Scrutiny: The cryptocurrency industry remains under significant regulatory scrutiny globally. Firms must continue to prioritize compliance and risk management to maintain positive relationships with banks and regulators. Education and Awareness: Banks and regulators need to be further educated about the nuances of the cryptocurrency industry to make informed decisions based on facts, not misconceptions. Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses: Seizing the Opportunity For cryptocurrency businesses, the FDIC’s decision and the broader shift towards objective bank supervision present a valuable opportunity. Here are some actionable steps crypto firms can take: Strengthen Compliance Frameworks: Robust KYC/AML procedures, transparent operations, and adherence to all applicable regulations are more critical than ever. Demonstrate a commitment to compliance to build trust with banks. Proactively Engage with Banks: Don’t wait for banks to reach out. Initiate conversations, showcase your compliance measures, and clearly articulate your business model and risk mitigation strategies. Document Everything: Maintain meticulous records of your operations, compliance efforts, and financial transactions. Transparency and documentation are key to building credibility. Seek Legal and Regulatory Counsel: Stay informed about evolving regulations and seek expert legal and regulatory advice to ensure you are navigating the landscape effectively. Advocate for Fair Policies: Engage with industry associations and participate in advocacy efforts to promote fair and balanced regulatory frameworks that support innovation. A Welcome Shift Towards Fairness in Crypto Banking The FDIC’s decision to drop ‘reputational risk’ from bank supervision is more than just a policy tweak; it’s a symbolic victory for the cryptocurrency industry. It signals a move away from subjective biases and towards a more objective, data-driven approach to regulating this burgeoning sector. While challenges remain, this development, coupled with legislative efforts like the FIRM Act, offers a glimmer of hope for a fairer and more inclusive financial future for crypto. This welcome shift can pave the way for greater innovation, broader adoption, and a more level playing field for crypto businesses seeking to operate within the traditional financial system. The era of ‘reputational risk’ as a blunt instrument against crypto appears to be waning, replaced by a more nuanced and hopefully, more equitable approach.

In November 2024, the SEC issued a Wells notice to the Web3 gaming company alleging that it was in potential violation of securities laws. In a report , Immutable called the notice the latest in the agency’s policy of regulation by enforcement, which was targeting leading Web3 companies, such as Ripple, OpenSea, and Coinbase. While the SEC did not state it in its notice, Immutable believes the inquiry targeted the listing and sales of its tokens IMX in 2021 and expressed confidence that its assets and services were not in violation of any laws. “We are confident in the legality of our assets and services, in the value digital ownership can bring to 3.1 billion gamers across the world, and in the power of blockchain to create a better internet. If required, we will fight for these rights, and those of our industry, vigorously,” the report said. SEC ends all investigations into Web3 gaming company Immutable Last year, the SEC issued Immutable a Wells Notice. That inquiry is now officially closed, with zero findings of wrongdoing, and the SEC is taking no action. This is a huge win – not just for web3 gaming, but everyone who believes in digital ownership rights. Let's build. — Immutable (@Immutable) March 25, 2025 On March 25, 2025, the Web3 gaming company announced that the SEC has decided to formally end all investigations into Immutable, the IMX Ecosystem Foundation, and its CEO. Also, the regulator would not be taking any further enforcement actions. “The SEC’s decision to end its investigation is a win for all builders, creators and gamers fighting for true digital ownership in gaming,” the Web3 gaming firm shared in a news release, adding that it is vindicated in its longstanding focus on legal and regulatory compliance. The SEC dropping its inquiry into Immutable aligns with the broader shift of the regulatory landscape under President Trump. In January 2025, the SEC established a crypto task force led by Hester Peirce , charged with creating comprehensive and clear regulatory frameworks governing digital assets. The SEC also dropped its case against Ripple, with more settlements and agreements agreed earlier today. Immutable says it welcomes the U.S. government’s commitment to creating clear frameworks for digital assets, adding that, “Constructive regulation provides certainty for builders, and helps foster the innovative potential of blockchain technology.” SEC resolution has implications for the Web3 gaming industry Immutable recorded about $80 million in NFT sales volume in Q4 2024, according to a Messari report . The conclusion of the SEC’s inquiry would have significant effects on the Web3 gaming industry. Regulatory clarity will help unlock investments and help Immutable to tokenize the in-game purchase market , which is worth over $100 billion. After the SEC closed the Inquiry, Immutable co-founder Robbie Ferguson, in a post on X, said it was a huge win not just for Web3 gaming but also digital asset ownership rights, saying the threats to digital asset ownership have been removed. The company, throughout the SEC investigation, was working on its vision to bring digital ownership to the 3.1 billion gamers worldwide. Ferguson believes overcoming the investigation brings Immutable closer to onboarding gamers on-chain. The closure of the SEC’s investigation follows a trend of reevaluating enforcement actions against Web3 and digital asset firms under the Trump administration.

The world of digital assets is buzzing with excitement as traditional finance giant Fidelity Investments makes a bold leap into the Solana ecosystem. In a potentially game-changing development, Fidelity has officially filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Solana ETF . This news, first spotted by the keen eyes at @solidintel_x on X, signals a major step forward for Solana and the broader crypto market. But what does this mean for you, the crypto investor? Let’s dive into the details of this thrilling announcement and unpack its potential impact. Why a Spot Solana ETF is a Big Deal For those unfamiliar, an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. A spot Solana ETF , if approved, would directly hold Solana tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to Solana’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This is a significant departure from futures-based ETFs and opens up a new avenue for traditional investors to access the crypto market. Here’s why this is generating so much buzz: Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. This makes Solana investment available to a wider range of investors who may be hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. Familiarity and Regulation: ETFs operate within a well-established regulatory framework. This provides a sense of security and familiarity for institutional and retail investors accustomed to traditional financial products. Diversification: A Solana ETF can be a valuable tool for portfolio diversification. It allows investors to add crypto exposure without the need to manage individual digital assets directly. Institutional Adoption Signal: Fidelity, a major player in asset management, filing for a Solana ETF sends a powerful signal of institutional confidence in Solana and the long-term potential of crypto. Fidelity’s Foray into Crypto ETFs: A Sign of the Times? Fidelity Investments is no stranger to the crypto space. They have been gradually increasing their involvement, offering crypto trading services and even including Bitcoin in some retirement plans. However, a Fidelity ETF specifically focused on Solana represents a significant escalation in their crypto strategy. This move suggests that Fidelity sees substantial growth potential in Solana and believes there is strong investor demand for a regulated investment product linked to SOL. Consider Fidelity’s track record in the ETF market. They are a well-respected and experienced ETF issuer. Their entry into the crypto ETF arena, particularly with a focus on Solana, could pave the way for wider acceptance and adoption of crypto ETFs by other major financial institutions. The Current Crypto ETF Landscape: Where Does Solana Fit In? The crypto ETF market is still relatively nascent, but it’s rapidly evolving. Currently, spot Bitcoin ETFs have gained significant traction after their approval in the US. Ethereum ETFs are also anticipated, and now, a spot Solana ETF application from Fidelity adds another layer of excitement and potential diversification to the market. Here’s a quick comparison: Cryptocurrency Existing ETFs (Spot/Futures) Fidelity’s Move Bitcoin (BTC) Spot ETFs Approved Already offers Bitcoin products Ethereum (ETH) Futures ETFs, Spot ETFs Anticipated Likely to follow with ETH ETF Solana (SOL) No Spot ETF yet Fidelity files for spot Solana ETF The introduction of a Solana ETF could broaden the appeal of crypto investments beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially attracting investors who are interested in Solana’s unique technology and ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations for a Solana ETF While the spot Solana ETF application is a positive development, it’s important to acknowledge the potential hurdles: SEC Approval: The SEC’s stance on crypto ETFs has been cautious. Approval is not guaranteed, and the review process can be lengthy and rigorous. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their price volatility. This inherent risk needs to be carefully considered by investors. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and changes in regulations could impact crypto ETFs. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of the underlying Solana assets is crucial for a spot ETF. Despite these challenges, Fidelity’s decision to file for a Solana ETF suggests they are confident in navigating these complexities and see a viable path to bringing this product to market. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Investors? So, what should you do with this news? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the progress of Fidelity’s Solana ETF application and any updates from the SEC. Research Solana: If you’re unfamiliar with Solana, now is a good time to research its technology, ecosystem, and potential use cases. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals before investing in any crypto-related product, including ETFs. Diversify Wisely: If a Solana ETF becomes available, consider it as a potential diversification tool within a broader investment portfolio. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Future of Crypto Investment Fidelity’s filing for a spot Solana ETF is undoubtedly a groundbreaking moment for the crypto industry. It signifies a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions and opens up exciting new avenues for investors to participate in the digital asset revolution. While the path to approval may have its bumps, this move underscores the increasing maturity of the crypto market and the enduring appeal of innovative blockchain technologies like Solana. The potential launch of a Fidelity ETF for Solana could mark a new era of accessibility and mainstream adoption for Solana investment and the broader crypto space.

Originally slated for September 2024, the Cerebras IPO delay is now extending further into the future as the national security review process drags on. This delay raises questions about the IPO market and the increasing scrutiny faced by tech companies, especially those in sensitive sectors like artificial intelligence. Why is the Cerebras IPO Delay Happening? Several factors are contributing to the Cerebras IPO delay, primarily centered around a rigorous national security review. Here’s a breakdown: National Security Review: The IPO triggered a national security review due to a significant $335 million investment from G42, an AI holding company based in Abu Dhabi. G42’s past connections with Chinese tech giant Huawei have amplified concerns, leading to intense scrutiny from U.S. authorities. Government Vacancies: Adding to the complexity, key positions within the U.S. government that oversee such reviews remain unfilled. Notably, the assistant Treasury secretary for investment security, who leads the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), is yet to be appointed. This vacancy has slowed down the review process significantly. Geopolitical Tensions: The current geopolitical climate, marked by heightened tensions and a focus on national security, especially concerning technology and AI, is playing a crucial role. Investments from foreign entities, particularly those with potential links to adversarial nations, are under increased examination. Impact on the AI Chips IPO Landscape The Cerebras IPO delay sends ripples through the AI chips IPO landscape. Cerebras is a significant player in the AI hardware space, known for its innovative Wafer Scale Engine. A successful IPO was expected to boost investor confidence in the sector and pave the way for other AI-focused companies to go public. However, this delay introduces uncertainty. What are the potential consequences? Investor Hesitation: The drawn-out review process might make investors wary of investing in AI chip companies, especially those with international funding. It highlights the potential regulatory hurdles and delays associated with IPOs in sensitive tech sectors. Valuation Concerns: Prolonged delays can impact a company’s valuation. Market conditions can change, and investor sentiment can shift, potentially affecting the IPO’s success even after the security review is cleared. Precedent Setting: The Cerebras case could set a precedent for future AI chips IPOs. Companies in similar situations might face even more stringent and time-consuming national security reviews. Cerebras’ Innovative AI Investment and Future Prospects Despite the IPO setbacks, Cerebras remains a formidable force in the AI industry. Their groundbreaking Wafer Scale Engine, a massive chip designed specifically for AI workloads, positions them at the forefront of AI hardware innovation. The AI investment they have attracted, even with the current scrutiny, underscores the potential of their technology. Key highlights of Cerebras’ technology and market position: Wafer Scale Engine (WSE): Cerebras’ WSE is significantly larger and more powerful than traditional GPUs, offering unparalleled performance for complex AI models and computations. Target Market: They cater to high-performance computing needs in areas like scientific research, drug discovery, and large-scale AI model training. Competitive Edge: While facing competition from established players like NVIDIA and AMD, Cerebras carves a niche with its unique architecture optimized for specific AI workloads. Navigating the National Security Review Maze The national security review process is becoming an increasingly critical aspect of IPOs, especially for companies operating in sensitive technology sectors. For Cerebras and other startups seeking to go public, understanding and navigating this maze is crucial. Actionable insights for companies facing similar reviews: Early Engagement: Proactively engage with regulatory bodies and seek guidance early in the IPO process. Transparency: Maintain full transparency regarding funding sources and international partnerships. Risk Assessment: Conduct thorough risk assessments to identify potential national security concerns and address them proactively. Legal Counsel: Seek expert legal counsel specializing in national security reviews and IPO regulations. The Road Ahead for Cerebras and the IPO Market The Cerebras IPO delay is a stark reminder of the complexities and challenges in the current IPO market, particularly for technology companies operating at the intersection of AI and national security. While the delay is undoubtedly a setback, it doesn’t diminish Cerebras’ technological achievements or long-term potential. The company’s ability to navigate the regulatory hurdles and eventually proceed with its IPO will be closely watched by the industry. The outcome of Cerebras’ IPO journey will not only impact the company itself but also shape investor sentiment and the regulatory landscape for future AI and tech IPOs. It underscores the increasing importance of national security considerations in the global technology race.

It has been negotiating with Morocco, Bangladesh, and Turkey. Progress has also been made in other huge markets like India. However, Musk’s political connections have started to complicate Starlink’s global rollout. Musk’s relations with Trump have helped Starlink secure critical government contracts in the United States. Trump-era officials showed fewer concerns about monopolies, clearing a path for SpaceX to land lucrative federal deals. Thanks to that environment, Starlink was recently installed at the White House, and Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, has urged officials to consider the service under the $42 billion US rural Broadband Equity. Regulators in other countries must now decide whether Musk’s political reputation and unpredictable comments on his social media platform create too much risk. This debate has already surfaced in Canada, Europe, and other regions that initially embraced Starlink but are now hesitant to deepen their dependence on Musk’s company. In a recent example, a Canadian province canceled a $100 million agreement with Starlink as a protest against American tariffs, signaling that Musk’s image in the U.S. could affect cross-border deals. He also stirred opposition from European politicians after criticizing their approach to Ukraine’s conflict with Russia. Industry experts say these issues might spark a shift in the satellite communications arena, suggesting that Starlink, while still the largest player, may not remain the only major force if governments decide to diversify. Edison Yu, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, noted, “There appears to be a potentially tectonic shift occurring in the satellite communications landscape ignited by geopolitics. Starlink is still clearly number one, but not the only one.” Musk has a huge financial stake in Starlink Meanwhile, Musk’s financial stake is enormous. Starlink is a key part of SpaceX, which was valued at $350 billion in a private tender offer. Roughly half of Musk’s $314 billion net worth is now tied to SpaceX, while his 20 percent stake in Tesla has dwindled in value to around $100 billion. According to Morgan Stanley, Starlink could generate $16.3 billion in revenue this year, a 74 percent increase from $9.3 billion in 2024. The subscriber base, reported at 4.65 million in January, may nearly double to 7.8 million in the near term. By comparison, SpaceX’s rocket launch business is projected to make $5.8 billion in revenue in 2025, rising from $4.9 billion in the prior year. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said, “While it all began with market-leading launch capability, we believe Starlink will be the primary driver of SpaceX’s growth and profitability.” Starlink claims that it has a network of around 7,000 low-orbit satellites that connect distant corners of the world. Niger, for example, became the latest nation to gain access just last week. However, company insiders report that the bigger developments lie in negotiations with Turkey and Morocco, with the latter exploring an expansion of service into Western Sahara, a disputed territory. In Bangladesh, officials say Musk personally spoke with the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, in hopes of finalizing an operating license. These efforts build on Starlink’s progress in India , where deals were recently made with tycoons Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Mittal. Such partnerships are especially appealing in regions that are geographically difficult to serve. Airlines and maritime companies have also adopted Starlink, including Qatar Airways and Air France. However, Musk’s foray into political matters has presented drawbacks. Musk’s controversial statements and relations with Trump are proving to be a hurdle Musk’s labeling of certain South African Black economic empowerment rules as “openly racist” has caused friction over Starlink’s entry into his home country. Brazil saw a similar controversy over false information shared on Musk’s social media site, X, causing leaders there to consider a ban on Starlink at one point. The global tension grew more visible when Musk requested an urgent meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella to salvage a $1.5 billion deal with Italy’s government. The deal hit a snag after Trump suspended certain military aid and intelligence-sharing arrangements with Ukraine. Italy’s presidential palace refused a direct meeting, instead directing Starlink to work with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose administration holds the real authority in such matters. Around 40,000 terminals are operating in Ukraine’s military, hospital, business, and relief settings. SpaceX originally covered those costs, but they are now handled by Poland and the US Department of Defense. The Pentagon holds a $537 million contract with SpaceX through 2027 under the Proliferated Low Earth Orbit program, ensuring Ukraine’s forces keep receiving satellite coverage. Poland also chips in about $50 million annually to supply Starlink terminals, according to its digitization ministry. Musk’s remarks on X have at times sparked anxiety among Ukraine’s partners. He boasted that Starlink is the “backbone of the Ukrainian army,” adding that the front line would “collapse” without it. In response, Poland’s foreign minister Radosław Sikorski warned that relying so heavily on a single supplier might require Poland to find another provider if Starlink proved unreliable. I literally challenged Putin to one on one physical combat over Ukraine and my Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off. What I am sickened by is years of slaughter in a stalemate that Ukraine will… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 9, 2025 Musk fired back at Sikorski on X, telling him to “be quiet” and insisting that Poland pays only a fraction of Starlink’s overall cost. He then clarified that SpaceX would never disconnect Ukraine’s access or use the service as leverage. Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 9, 2025 Defense experts note that Europe may try to develop alternatives in light of Musk’s unpredictable statements. Still, no nation has banned Starlink outright. Analysts who follow the satellite industry see no slowdown for Starlink in the immediate future. Chris Quilty of Quilty Space says, “If a country banned access to Starlink, people would be at politicians with pitchforks.” Even in markets that have blocked government contracts or threatened to pull support, private citizens and businesses often find ways to use Starlink equipment bought elsewhere. Given the scarcity of reliable alternatives in rural or conflict-affected zones, local populations may pressure politicians to allow Starlink services, even if officials dislike Musk’s political connections.

According to analysts, those tokens won’t cost anything as the mutm’s tokenomics back a 200% return for the exchange listing at $0.06, with an end of phase prediction of a post launch token price of $1.50, giving a total 7,400% increase to the raise. Momentum On Mutuum Finance presale Meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and DogeCoin (DOGE) have been hot in recent months, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers utility that has shown signs of trouncing all of the other meme coins. Instead of focusing on social media hype like SHIB and DOGE do, MUTM offers a decentralized lending platform that allows users to lend, borrow and earn interest on mtTokens, and converts deposits to an interest-bearing asset. Such real-world utility stands in stark contrast to the speculative nature of meme coins, drawing in investors looking for sustainable returns. Urgency has been created for the presale’s phased structure, which rises in price incrementally, with third phase now filling very quickly in advance of an upcoming price rise. Phase four will yield a 25% profit for early participants who purchase tokens at $0.02 — in addition to the 200% baseline return at launch. Prospects for ROI and the Tokenomics Strategy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides One of the Most Calculable ROIs in the Crypto Market Tokens purchased during the current $0.02 presale will effectively be worth 200% more once they hit exchanges at $0.06. Analysts also predict the price could soar to $1.50 in the months after listing, boosted by the platform’s buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of platform revenue goes toward repurchasing MUTM tokens to be distributed to stakers, creating a continuous buy pressure and reducing sell-offs. For perspective, Investing $1,000 at phase three prices would reap you $3,000 at launch and over $75,000 if the token touches $1.50 and retains it. Safety and Forward Progress Mutuum Finance is concluding a smart contract audit with industry leader CertiK, the biggest blockchain security company, to confirm protocol integrity. Final results will be announced through official channels once completed, providing further reassurance to the investor base. Alongside the $100,000 presale giveaway — a campaign in which the ten selected participants will receive $10,000 each — the project is establishing itself as a serious competitor in the often cut-throat world of DeFi. With the crypto market’s evolution, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is acting as a bridge between speculative trading and real financial utility. Its presale success combined with predictable yields and a deflationary token model contrasts sharply with the fluctuations affecting Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). There is limited time left to get tokens as phase three is nearly a wrap and closing time fast. Investors are flocking to MUTM’s structured, utility-first approach, looking to replicate past meme coin gains, but without the risk. Time To Act Before Phase Three Ends Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the rare case of accessibility and high-growth potential. Not only do early participants register immediate benefits as presale phases progress, but they also enable themselves for blockbuster returns following the launch of the tokens. With more demand than supply, especially as the project approaches listings. Which is why, if you want to get in on the next giant DeFi breakout, your best bet may be to lock phase three down now and not wait.

42346588,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=718129,1742950813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42346588.jpeg,"Ethereum Forms Complex iH&S Structure, Why $18,000 Is The Possible Target",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-complex-ihs-structure/,"Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of a bullish breakout, forming a complex Inverse Head and Shoulder (iH&S) pattern on the weekly timeframe. This key technical formation suggests that the Ethereum price is on track for a massive rally toward a bullish target of $18,000. Ethereum Forms Inverse Head & Shoulder Pattern The Ethereum price has been in a long consolidation period, experiencing a crash amid the ongoing market turmoil. Despite recording massive declines that have pushed its value significantly below all-time highs, crypto analyst Gert van Lagen on X (formerly Twitter) predicts that ETH could still reach a price target of $18,000. Related Reading: “Ethereum Is Not Dead”: Broadening Wedge Suggests Another Leg-Up Is Coming Notably, Ethereum recently bounced off the $1,800 – $2,000 support range, which previously served as resistance during the ‘Head’ phase of the iH&S pattern. With this crucial retest confirmed, ETH may be entering the final stage of its reversal, set up to new all-time highs. Lagen’s $18,000 bullish target is more than 8X Ethereum’s current price, underscoring the sheer magnitude of this projection. Lagen has identified the formation of the iH&S structure on the Ethereum chart, supporting his ambitious prediction with this renowned bullish chart pattern. The Inverse Head and Shoulder is a classic bullish reversal structure, often signaling the end of a downtrend and the beginning of a strong and new uptrend. Considering the Ethereum’s price has been in a downturn, the formation of the iH&S chart pattern suggests that this prolonged decline may be finally coming to an end. In the analyst’s chart, this left shoulder of the iH&S structure began forming from 2021 to 2022, experiencing a price peak before a pullback. From 2022 to 2023, a deeper decline occurred, marking the cycle low and the formation of the ‘Head.’ Finally, the right shoulder of the technical pattern was formed between 2024 to 2024, recording a higher low that aligned with the left shoulder. Lagen’s price chart highlights that the most critical level to watch is the neckline of the iH&S structure, which is approximately $3,978 and acts as the primary resistance area. How An $18,000 ETH Target Is Possible Still looking at Lagen’s Ethereum price chart, the analyst suggests that if ETH can surpass the $3,978 resistance level with strong volume, it could validate the Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern and open the door for a rally toward $18,000. Conversely, if Ethereum fails to break above this resistance level, a prolonged consolidation or significant pullback may occur before its next breakout attempt. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Extremely Strong Support And Monthly 55 EMA Says ETH Is Headed For $4,867 Lagen predicts that a rejection at the resistance area could see the Ethereum price drop to $1,888 — an important support level which could prevent further declines. A drop to this support would represent a potential 52% dip from the main resistance level and an 8.52% decline from ETH’s current market value of $2,055.

Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just announced its support for Celo’s groundbreaking move to an Ethereum layer-2 network. This significant blockchain upgrade marks a new chapter for Celo, the carbon-negative platform focused on mobile accessibility. If you’re a Celo (CGLD) holder or a Coinbase user, this news is particularly relevant for you. Let’s dive into what this Celo Layer-2 Migration means, how it impacts you, and why it’s a crucial step forward for the Celo ecosystem. What is this Coinbase Celo Support all about? Coinbase’s announcement, delivered via X (formerly Twitter), confirms their commitment to supporting the Celo Layer-2 Migration . Essentially, Celo is evolving from being a standalone layer-1 blockchain to operating as a layer-2 solution built on top of Ethereum. This is a strategic move aimed at enhancing scalability, efficiency, and interoperability for the Celo network. To facilitate this transition smoothly, Coinbase will be performing a system upgrade. Here are the key details: Upgrade Timing: Scheduled for later today, starting at 8 p.m. Pacific Time (PT). Service Impact: Temporary suspension of CGLD token deposits and withdrawals during the upgrade period. Token Impact: Focus is on CGLD token as it is the native token of the Celo network. User Action: If you are a Coinbase user holding CGLD, be aware of this temporary suspension. No immediate action is required, but avoid initiating CGLD deposits or withdrawals during the specified time. Why is Celo Migrating to an Ethereum Layer-2? The move to an Ethereum Layer-2 network is a strategic decision by Celo, driven by several compelling benefits. Let’s explore the key reasons behind this blockchain upgrade : Enhanced Scalability: Layer-2 solutions are designed to offload transaction processing from the main Ethereum chain, thereby significantly increasing transaction throughput and reducing congestion. This means faster transactions and lower fees for Celo users in the long run. Leveraging Ethereum’s Security: By building on Ethereum, Celo benefits from the robust security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. Ethereum is the most established smart contract platform, and inheriting its security is a major advantage. Improved Interoperability: Being on Ethereum layer-2 enhances Celo’s interoperability within the broader Ethereum ecosystem. This opens up possibilities for easier integration with other Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols. Developer Ecosystem Growth: The Ethereum ecosystem boasts a massive and vibrant community of developers and tools. Migrating to layer-2 can attract more developers to build on Celo, further enriching its ecosystem and driving innovation. Future-Proofing Celo: Layer-2 solutions are seen as a crucial part of Ethereum’s scaling roadmap. By embracing this technology, Celo is positioning itself for long-term growth and relevance in the evolving crypto landscape. Think of it like this: Ethereum is the major highway, and Celo is moving from a smaller, parallel road to a faster lane on this highway. This allows Celo to handle more traffic (transactions) efficiently and connect more easily with other vehicles (dApps) on the same highway. What are the Benefits of Celo Layer-2 Migration? This Celo Layer-2 Migration brings a plethora of advantages to the Celo ecosystem and its users. Let’s break down the key benefits: Benefit Description Lower Transaction Fees Layer-2 solutions are renowned for significantly reducing transaction costs compared to layer-1. Users can expect cheaper transactions on the Celo network after the migration. Faster Transaction Speeds Increased transaction throughput on layer-2 translates to quicker transaction confirmations. This improves the user experience, especially for applications requiring fast and frequent transactions. Enhanced User Experience Faster and cheaper transactions contribute to a smoother and more user-friendly experience for interacting with Celo-based applications and services. Stronger Security Inheriting Ethereum’s security provides a more robust and reliable foundation for the Celo network, enhancing user confidence and trust. Greater Interoperability Seamless integration with the vast Ethereum ecosystem opens doors for new partnerships, collaborations, and opportunities for Celo within the broader crypto space. Environmental Sustainability (Continued) Celo’s commitment to being carbon-negative remains intact with the layer-2 migration. Ethereum’s ongoing transition to Proof-of-Stake further contributes to the overall sustainability of the ecosystem. Impact on CGLD Token and Coinbase Users For holders of CGLD Token and Coinbase users, the immediate impact is the temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals. This is a standard procedure during such upgrades to ensure the integrity of the process. Here’s what you need to know: Temporary Suspension: As mentioned, CGLD deposits and withdrawals will be paused on Coinbase starting at 8 p.m. PT today. No Action Required (Usually): Unless specifically instructed by Coinbase, users typically don’t need to take any action. Your CGLD holdings on Coinbase should be safe during the upgrade. Post-Upgrade Benefits: In the long run, the Ethereum Layer-2 migration is expected to benefit CGLD holders through a more robust, scalable, and efficient Celo network. This can potentially lead to increased adoption and value for the CGLD token. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Coinbase and Celo for any updates or specific instructions related to the upgrade. Looking Ahead: The Future of Celo and Layer-2 Solutions Celo’s decision to embrace Ethereum Layer-2 technology is a significant indicator of the evolving landscape of blockchain scalability. Layer-2 solutions are increasingly becoming vital for the growth and mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. By making this move, Celo is positioning itself at the forefront of this trend. This blockchain upgrade not only benefits Celo and its users but also contributes to the overall maturation of the crypto ecosystem. It demonstrates a commitment to innovation, scalability, and interoperability – key ingredients for the future of decentralized technologies. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Step for Celo Coinbase’s support for the Celo Layer-2 Migration is more than just a routine upgrade; it’s a revolutionary step that underscores Celo’s commitment to growth, scalability, and user experience. By joining the Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem, Celo is set to unlock new levels of performance, efficiency, and interoperability. For CGLD Token holders and the wider crypto community, this upgrade signals a positive trajectory for Celo and the continued evolution of blockchain technology towards a more scalable and accessible future.

According to multiple analysts, DOGE price is displaying a combination of technical indicators and structures that suggest the potential for a 10X rally. These include a breakout from a triangle pattern, a developing “cup and handle” formation, and historical pattern similarities to the 2017 bull market. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Chart Patterns Point to 10X Meme Coin Rally In a recent post on X, analyst Trader Tardigrade shared a chart showing the MACD indicator breaking out from a triangle formation. This setup has historically been linked with strong upward momentum in Dogecoin price. The MACD breakout is accompanied by a rounded bottom pattern, often seen as a preparatory phase before bullish moves. Notably, during previous instances in September and March, similar MACD triangle breakouts occurred. In both cases, the breakout led to a rapid acceleration in Dogecoin price. These historical movements suggest that the current meme coin rally may lead to a new all-time high. Source: X The MACD lines have crossed again in recent sessions, with the indicator moving above the triangle’s downtrend line. Analysts are observing similar conditions that were present during previous rallies. The upward curl in the price structure reinforces the breakout narrative. Meanwhile, following the recent move by House of Doge , market analysts are forecasting a 16% rise in Dogecoin price as bullish momentum builds. Cup and Handle Pattern Suggests Upside Toward $2.00 Additionally, according to Crypto Elites , DOGE price is forming a cup and handle pattern, a technical formation often associated with bullish continuation. The rounded bottom of the cup has already developed, and the handle phase is underway. This formation typically leads to a breakout once the price surpasses the neckline resistance. The key resistance level is positioned near $0.185. A confirmed break above this threshold could open the door to a sharp upward movement. Based on this chart pattern, the projected target is in the $1.85 to $2.00 range. The projection is calculated using the depth of the cup formation. Source: X However, the analyst noted that the current retracement to the handle’s lower range may act as a support zone. This area has historically been where momentum builds ahead of breakouts. Historical Behavior Resembling 2017 Cycle Concurrently, analyst KrissPax has identified similarities between the current Dogecoin price movement and the 2017 bull run. KrissPax posted a chart on X that compares both periods, showing the current phase aligning closely with the structure before DOGE price previous surge. According to the chart, the current meme coin cycle could extend beyond the previous all-time high. KrissPax projected that the top meme coin could rise to $4 if the second major breakout occurs, similar to the 2017 pattern. While this is a longer-term scenario, it is based on recurring patterns observed in past market cycles. A recent CoinGape report supports the bullish outlook on DOGE price, noting that a breakout above the $0.18 resistance could ignite a meme coin rally toward the $20 mark.

Meet Gemini 2.5 Pro, the latest family of AI reasoning models designed to think before it speaks (or codes!). This isn’t just another AI; Google claims it’s their most intelligent creation yet, poised to redefine benchmarks and set new standards in the industry. For crypto enthusiasts and tech innovators alike, understanding the advancements in AI, especially reasoning models, is crucial as it underpins many emerging technologies within the blockchain and decentralized spaces. Let’s dive deep into what makes Gemini 2.5 Pro a game-changer. What Makes Gemini 2.5 Pro the Next-Gen AI Reasoning Model? Imagine an AI that doesn’t just react but reasons. That’s the promise of AI reasoning models , and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking center stage. Unlike previous models, Gemini 2.5 Pro pauses to ‘think’ before generating a response. This crucial step involves: Fact-checking: Ensuring the information provided is accurate and reliable. Problem-solving: Analyzing complex queries to deliver well-reasoned answers. Contextual Understanding: Grasping the nuances of language and intent for more relevant outputs. This enhanced reasoning capability is not just a minor upgrade; it’s a fundamental shift that elevates AI performance to new heights. Google is making Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental available on its Google AI Studio developer platform and through the Gemini Advanced plan. This means developers and early adopters can immediately start experimenting with this cutting-edge technology. The Race for AI Reasoning Supremacy: Google vs. the Competition Since OpenAI launched its first AI reasoning model , o1, in September 2024, the tech world has been in a frenzy to catch up and surpass its capabilities. Now, key players like Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI are all in the ring, each with their own versions of reasoning AI. Why is this race so important? Improved Accuracy: Reasoning enhances the reliability of AI outputs, crucial for applications in finance, healthcare, and beyond. Complex Task Handling: Reasoning models excel in math, coding, and strategic problem-solving – tasks previously challenging for AI. Foundation for AI Agents: Many believe reasoning is the bedrock for creating autonomous AI agents capable of performing tasks with minimal human oversight. However, this leap in intelligence comes at a cost. AI reasoning models are computationally intensive and more expensive to run. Google’s Gemini 2.5 is their most ambitious attempt to outshine OpenAI’s o series, showcasing the fierce competition driving AI innovation. Gemini 2.5 Pro: Benchmarking AI Performance Google is making bold claims about Gemini 2.5 Pro’s AI performance , stating it outperforms both its previous models and leading competitors in several key benchmarks. Let’s break down some of these claims: Benchmark Gemini 2.5 Pro Score Comparison Significance Aider Polyglot (Code Editing) 68.6% Outperforms top models from OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek Highlights superior code editing capabilities, crucial for software development. SWE-bench Verified (Software Dev) 63.8% Outperforms OpenAI’s o3-mini & DeepSeek’s R1, underperforms Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet (70.3%) Shows strong software development abilities, competitive but not leading in all aspects. Humanity’s Last Exam (Multimodal) 18.8% Better than most rival flagship models Demonstrates strong performance in a broad range of knowledge domains (math, humanities, sciences). These benchmarks suggest that Gemini 2.5 Pro is a formidable contender, especially in code-related tasks and broad knowledge understanding. However, the competitive landscape remains dynamic, with different models excelling in different areas. Unleashing the Power of Context: The 1 Million Token Context Window One of the most impressive features of Gemini 2.5 Pro is its massive context window . At launch, it boasts a 1 million token context window, capable of processing approximately 750,000 words in a single input. To put this into perspective, that’s longer than the entire ‘Lord of The Rings’ series! And Google isn’t stopping there; they plan to double this to 2 million tokens soon. What does this mean for users? Enhanced Understanding: The model can retain and process vast amounts of information, leading to more coherent and contextually relevant responses. Complex Document Analysis: Imagine summarizing lengthy research papers, analyzing extensive codebases, or even drafting entire books. Gemini 2.5 Pro’s context window makes this feasible. Improved AI Agents: For AI agents, a large context window means better memory and the ability to handle long, complex tasks more effectively. This expanded context window is a significant leap forward, potentially unlocking new applications and capabilities for AI models. Pricing and Availability: What to Expect Currently, Google has not released specific API pricing details for Gemini 2.5 Pro. They have indicated that more information will be shared in the coming weeks. For now, access is available through Google AI Studio and the Gemini Advanced subscription. Keep an eye out for updates as pricing details will be crucial for developers and businesses looking to integrate this powerful AI reasoning model into their projects. Conclusion: A Giant Leap for AI… and Beyond? Google’s unveiling of Gemini 2.5 Pro marks a significant milestone in the evolution of AI. With its enhanced reasoning capabilities, impressive performance benchmarks, and massive context window, it’s clear that Google is serious about leading the charge in AI innovation. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, advancements like these in AI reasoning models are incredibly relevant. AI is increasingly being used for smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi) risk assessment, and even predicting market trends. As AI becomes more intelligent and context-aware, its integration into blockchain technologies promises to unlock even more sophisticated and efficient solutions.

BTFD Coin’s $0.0002 Entry and LAUNCH100 Bonus Might Be Your Second Chance,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-not-grabbing-pudgy-penguins-early-btfd-coins-0-0002-entry-and-launch100-bonus-might-be-your-second-chance/,"They say hindsight’s 20/20—especially in crypto. If you’re one of the thousands who watched Pudgy Penguins soar and thought, “I should’ve bought in early,” you’re definitely not alone. From meme NFTs to a booming brand with toys in stores and a token that’s making waves, Pudgy Penguins built one of the most surprising success stories of the meme coin world. And for those who caught that launch? They’re now sitting pretty. But if you didn’t ape in when $PENGU was just getting started, don’t stress—it’s not game over. In fact, a new door just swung wide open. BTFD Coin, one of the best new meme coins to join this week , is making noise with a real Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a staking program with jaw-dropping 90% APY, and an active referral system pulling in Bulls by the thousands. And the best part? It’s still in presale at just $0.0002 per coin, with the LAUNCH100 bonus code giving buyers a full 2x token reward until March 30, 2025. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a full-on ecosystem with actual utility and a real shot at delivering massive gains. And if you’re into second chances, this is the one you’ve been waiting for. BTFD Coin’s Live P2E Game Puts It Among the Best New Meme Coins to Join This Week Let’s cut to the chase—what really sets BTFD Coin apart is the game. Not a “coming soon” promise. Not a vague roadmap. But a fully live Play-to-Earn game that launched on January 1st, 2025, and is already rewarding players who suit up and charge into the Bull Run arena. This isn’t passive holding. This is earn-as-you-play, and it’s addictively fun. Early users are already seeing returns. One gamer turned their first week into thousands of tokens, then staked them for compounding growth. With the staking program offering 90% APY, it’s one of the best new meme coins to join this week for anyone looking to build both short-term gains and long-term momentum. You’re not just buying a token—you’re stepping into a full-blown meme coin presale ecosystem where your investment works while you play. Then there’s the Bulls Squad, a community of over 11,500 holders who aren’t just bullish—they’re building. The referral program lets users invite friends and earn extra tokens, turning every tweet or text into a potential payday. With over 71 billion tokens sold and $6.41 million raised, this isn’t your average meme coin presale. This project isn’t whispering—it’s roaring, and the community’s energy is off the charts. And here’s where things get juicy. If you put in $5,000 at today’s meme coin presale price of $0.0002, you’re scoring 25 million $BTFD tokens. That’s not just a nice number—if the coin hits its projected listing price of $0.0006, you’re sitting on $15,000. And if the buzz around its $0.006 moon price proves true? That flips to $150,000. That’s the kind of math that made Pudgy Penguin holders rich—and this time, you could be ahead of the curve. What seals the deal? The LAUNCH100 bonus code, which literally doubles your tokens during Stage 15. Buy 1 million tokens? You get 2 million. But only if you act fast—March 30th is the cutoff. Miss this meme coin presale opportunity, and the bonus disappears for good. So how do you get started? Just go to the BTFD Coin presale site and connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet both work). Fund it with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Enter LAUNCH100 in the promo box in all caps, choose your amount, and confirm the transaction. You’ll get your tokens at the end of the presale—and your crypto game will never be the same. This is why BTFD Coin is topping every list of the best new meme coins to join this week—because it delivers utility, rewards, community, and upside all in one. Pudgy Penguins: A Missed Launch That Created Massive Gains Pudgy Penguins began as a wholesome NFT project built around adorable, ice-loving cartoon birds. But what started as an art project quickly turned into a movement. Community members built memes, merch, even brand partnerships. And once the $PENGU token dropped, it didn’t take long for it to soar. The Penguins became more than just collectibles—they became a cultural icon. They made headlines in both crypto and mainstream circles. $PENGU got traction, exchanges picked it up, and early backers cashed in. That rise made Pudgy Penguins one of the biggest “why didn’t I buy it early?” stories of the year. But let’s be honest—most people didn’t buy early. They watched the buzz, hesitated, and then watched the price take off. And now? They’re on the hunt for the best new meme coins to join this week—something with real upside and a better entry point. Enter BTFD Coin. Conclusion: This Time, Be the One Who Bought Early Let’s not sugarcoat it—you probably missed the early boat on Pudgy Penguins. That train left the station, and it took a lot of big wins with it. But the beauty of the crypto world? There’s always another launch, another shot, another chance to get in before the masses. BTFD Coin is that chance. It’s got the community, the staking, the bonus, and best of all—a fully functional game already live and paying out. With a presale price of just $0.0002, a potential moon price of $0.006, and the LAUNCH100 code giving you double tokens until March 30th, this is hands-down one of the best new meme coins to join this week. No more second-guessing. No more could-have-beens. This is the one. Make the move and join BTFD Coin’s presale before this chance becomes another “I should’ve.” FAQs Why is BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join this week? Because it offers more than hype—BTFD Coin has a live Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY staking, and a referral program, all while being in presale at $0.0002 with a moon target of $0.006. How do I claim the LAUNCH100 bonus code with BTFD Coin? Go to the presale site, connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in all caps in the promo field, then confirm your purchase. The bonus doubles your token amount instantly. Is BTFD Coin still available for presale? Yes! It’s currently in Stage 15, priced at $0.0002, with over $6.41 million raised, 71 billion tokens sold, and 11,500 holders joining what’s easily one of the best new meme coins to join this week.

This settlement marks a likely end to the long legal battle that has been ongoing since the SEC sued Ripple in 2020 over the sale of XRP tokens, which it claimed were unregistered securities. As part of the deal, the SEC has also requested that Judge Analisa Torres lift the “obey the law” injunction that had been placed on Ripple, which was part of the earlier ruling. With this agreement, Ripple will recover $75 million from escrow, while the SEC will retain $50 million.

The long-standing case has been a major point of contention in the cryptocurrency world, with Ripple consistently arguing that the SEC’s actions were more about intimidation than protecting investors. Garlinghouse opened up about the financial harm caused by the lawsuit, saying that the legal proceedings had potentially wiped out up to $15 billion in value for XRP holders.

Trading at $8.04 at press time, BeraChain crypto has witnessed an impressive 38.2% surge over the past week, catapulting it into the top 100 by market cap, with a valuation of $864 million. The Berachain Network PoL system The BeraChain mainnet first roared to life in February with a $1.17 billion BeraChain airdrop, rewarding early participants who engaged in pre-launch activities. That initial phase, however, was constrained to BEX, the native decentralized exchange, leaving room for broader growth. Now, with the PoL system live, the Berachain Network is opening new doors that enhance the BeraChain TVL and incentivize participation. Unlike traditional PoS, where users stake directly with validators, PoL encourages staking in DeFi liquidity pools to earn BGT, the governance token of the BeraChain ecosystem. Validators stake BERA, the utility token of BeraChain, to secure the network and propose blocks, earning BGT that flows into reward vaults, which can be swapped for BERA at a 1:1 ratio, though irreversibly. The BeraChain launch of PoL has unleashed 37 whitelisted reward vaults, initially focused on DEX liquidity pools like those on BEX, Kodiak, and Beradrome. Berachain Foundation 🐻⛓ @berachain · Follow Replying to @berachain 37 new reward vaults are now live, distributing BGT emissions across the ecosystem.See the full list here: blog.berachain.com/blog/berachain… 9:09 pm · 24 Mar 2025 99 Reply Copy link Read 2 replies These vaults, vetted for economic value, security, and synergy with the BeraChain ecosystem, pair major tokens such as BERA, HONEY, USDC, and wETH to maximize liquidity depth. The Berachain token’s role in these pools has fueled trading activity, with a 24-hour volume of $165.9 million. Beyond DEXes, the network plans to expand into real-world assets, gaming, and more, with a second batch of vaults up for review by March 27th. This scalability positions the BeraChain mainnet as a hub for diverse dApps, from BeraChain swaps to potential BeraChain NFTs. Notably, governance is a cornerstone of the PoL system, with BGT holders now wielding influence over the Berachain Network’s direction. The BeraChain airdrop laid the foundation, but PoL decentralizes control, letting the community dictate incentive flows. Validators supply liquidity to vaults, receiving receipt tokens that can also be staked, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. This innovative approach has elevated the BeraChain crypto’s appeal, drawing builders and users eager to tap into a permissionless ecosystem. As pseudonymous founder Homme Bera noted, this is a major step in the network’s evolution, promising sustainable growth. Looking forward, the Berachain Network’s roadmap inspires confidence. The upcoming review of additional vaults next week could broaden its scope, potentially boosting the BeraChain price further. With the PoL launch having already pushed BeraChain crypto into the top 100, it has ignited speculation about the effects of the next milestones.

This move aligns the company with a growing number of publicly traded firms choosing to hold bitcoin as part of their financial strategy. Along with its fourth-quarter earnings report, GameStop revealed that its board has unanimously decided to add bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. This allows the company to hold digital assets on its balance sheet, signaling a shift in its treasury management and aligning with its evolving financial strategy. GME Surges Over 5% This announcement gained attention earlier in February when CEO Ryan Cohen posted a photo of himself with Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy (MSTR), at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, sparking curiosity about the company’s future plans in the crypto space. By the end of 2024, GameStop reported $5.355 billion in current assets but didn’t specify how much of this would be used for Bitcoin purchases. The news led to a 5.9% increase in GME shares during after-hours trading. Matt Cole Urges Gamestop To Adopt BTC Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Asset Management, an investment firm co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy previously called on GameStop to adopt bitcoin as a reserve asset. In a letter to Ryan Cohen, GameStop’s Chairman and CEO, on February 24, Cole argued that with nearly $5 billion in cash reserves, GameStop has a unique chance to transform itself into a market leader. Strive Asset Management’s clients own GameStop shares through the firm’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Cole also mentioned that Strive holds GameStop stock across three different ETFs but did not share how much stock the firm owns. “We believe GameStop has an incredible opportunity to transform its financial future by becoming the premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector,” Cole wrote. Cohen further fueled the speculation when he tweeted , “Letter received,” in response to Cole’s suggestion. Growing Trend Of Companies Pursuing BTC Strategy The letter follows previous reports from that GameStop is considering investing in alternative assets, including bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The suggestion in the letter aligns with moves already made by companies like MicroStrategy, Semler Scientific, and MARA Holdings. Cole praised GameStop for closing unprofitable stores and publicly rejecting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.

He said that investing in digital coins involves “a very high risk that you could lose all your money.” In explaining why this matters, Rathi shared that the number of Britons owning shares directly is much lower than in places like the United States or Sweden. He told MPs on Tuesday that 38 percent of US citizens hold equities, while in Sweden, the figure is more than 20 percent. By contrast, far fewer people in the UK own shares, especially younger citizens, who seem drawn to alternative assets like bitcoin. Rathi added, “We have also evolved a particular approach to risk and compensation in the UK, which perhaps isn’t matched in other parts of the world.” UK’s FCA wants young Britains to consider ‘mainstream investments’ The FCA’s new five-year plan, presented on Tuesday, focuses on four key objectives, one of which is helping consumers make better financial decisions. The authority will track how many people with more than £10,000 of investible assets choose to place their money in what it calls “mainstream investments” by 2030. Rathi told the committee that one of his concerns is “the sheer number of under 35-year-olds for whom the financial product that they invest in first is crypto — several million in the UK.” Currently, the UK’s crypto market is largely unregulated. Companies handling crypto transactions only need to register with the FCA to show they follow anti-money laundering rules. The government, however, intends to introduce legislation that would create a specific regulatory framework for crypto businesses. Last year, the FCA estimated that about 12 percent of UK adults owned crypto assets. That equates to roughly 7 million people, with men under 35 most likely to borrow money to fund their coin purchases, according to a YouGov survey of nearly 2,200 adults. Rathi linked the country’s low level of share ownership to “a mix of tax, education, regulation and broader culture in our country.” He emphasized that the question of risk and compensation is not the FCA’s responsibility alone. “We have also evolved a particular approach to risk and compensation in the UK, which perhaps isn’t matched in other parts of the world,” he said. Under the new plan, the FCA pledges to “deepen trust, rebalance risk, support growth and improve lives.” While the regulator has been criticized in the past for holding back innovation and investment, several industry figures gave the new strategy a careful endorsement. The authority will use AI to act ‘more efficiently and effectively’ A central part of the new approach is making more use of technology, including artificial intelligence, to help the FCA act “more efficiently and effectively.” The agency also aims to crack down further on financial crime, stressing that it will focus “on those who seek to use the fact they are regulated to do harm.” Also on Tuesday, the authority announced plans to simplify its extensive set of regulations by removing over 100 pages devoted to consumer finance, investments, and mortgage lending. This change was set in motion after Chancellor Rachel Reeves revealed a “radical action plan to cut red tape,” intending to reduce regulatory costs for businesses by 25 percent. The FCA’s rule book is currently longer than 10,000 pages, and the goal is to make it less burdensome for legitimate operators while keeping protections in place for the public. James Daley, who heads the research group Fairer Finance, expressed worry about the direction of these proposals. “The general direction of travel is worrying,” he said. He believes the regulator is under political pressure to reduce the regulation burden but argues that some of these changes “would be a step backwards.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

But the tides are shifting. While these tokens have built strong communities, their price action has been frustrating, with long periods of stagnation. Now, a growing number of Shiba Inu and DOGE holders are making a calculated move into an AI-driven altcoin; RCO Finance . Let’s dive into why investors are making the switch. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Holders Are Looking for the Next Big Opportunity Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have given their holders some wild rides over the years, but the market has not been kind to meme coin investors lately. Shiba Inu , which once seemed unstoppable, has been stuck in a macro downtrend since its peak. While recent movements suggest a potential breakout, the token still faces a critical resistance range between $0.00001450 and $0.00001550. A breakthrough could send it climbing, but another rejection could push it back toward support at $0.00001269. Dogecoin isn’t faring much better. The token is trying to push past $0.19, but the selling pressure is heavy. If it fails to clear this level, there’s a strong chance of another drop, possibly as low as $0.10. On the flip side, breaking past $0.29 could restore confidence, but given the current trend, that seems like an uphill battle. For Shiba Inu and Dogecoin holders, this kind of uncertainty is frustrating. That’s why they are making a strategic move into RCO Finance because it’s still in its early stages, has practical applications, and could be on the verge of an explosive run. This AI-Driven Altcoin Is Outshining Meme Coins RCO Finance is designed to help investors make smarter moves with its AI-powered Robo Advisor. This is an advanced, real-time AI system that processes data from leading financial sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, spotting market trends before they go mainstream. For instance, a new altcoin is quietly gaining traction, similar to how Shiba Inu exploded in its early days. Most traders don’t notice it yet, but RCOF’s AI does. It recognizes unusual trading patterns, increasing volume, and early whale accumulation. With a single alert, you’re in early, buying before the masses. A month later, that same token has surged 100x, and your $500 investment is now worth $50,000; all because you had the right data at the right time. The AI also protects your investments. Let’s say a market downturn is looming. It triggers an automated sell-off, securing your profits before the crash. Beyond trading, RCO Finance allows users to diversify into 120,000+ assets, including stocks, ETFs, bonds, and tokenized real estate, all on the same platform. It’s also entirely KYC-free, meaning no invasive verification processes. And the RCOF debit cards let you use your holdings in real life without the hassle of converting them to fiat first. RCOF Presale Is Gaining Traction with Early Buyers RCOF has already proven itself. Unlike most presale projects, it has a fully operational Beta Platform with over 10,000 active users testing its core features. And this is just the beginning; while the beta is live, the upcoming Alpha phase promises even more powerful upgrades, currently in internal testing. The presale is already in its 5th stage, with the token selling at $0.10. Once it moves to the next stage, the price will rise to $0.13; a guaranteed 30% gain in just a few weeks. With over $14 million raised so far, the momentum is undeniable, and the price will only go up from here. A $1,000 investment at the current stage would turn into $1,300 when the next stage kicks in. If it follows the same trajectory as other successful AI-driven projects, early buyers could see their holdings multiply 50x or even 100x. That same $1,000 could easily become $100,000. Security is also a top priority. RCOF has undergone a full audit by SolidProof , one of the most reputable blockchain security firms. The audit confirmed no vulnerabilities, meaning investors can participate with confidence. Meme Coins Had Their Moment but the Future Belongs to AI Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have cemented their place in crypto history, but their best days might be behind them. At their peak, they delivered jaw-dropping returns, but today, their growth is nowhere near what it once was because they’re established. And without continuous waves of hype, their momentum is fading. RCOF , on the other hand, is just getting started. It’s new, meaning early adoption is happening fast, and as more investors discover its AI-driven advantages, its growth will accelerate even further. Investors who got in during the earlier presale stages have already seen their holdings grow, and those who wait too long will find themselves paying significantly higher prices. Joining in the next stage alone means missing out on an easy 30% gain, and waiting until it hits exchanges could mean missing out on 100x potential.

Among the players making waves this year are Qubetics , Tezos, and VeChain, three blockchain projects that have distinct features setting them apart from the rest. If you’ve been following the crypto space closely, you’ll know how fast things change, but these three coins seem to be going the distance in different ways. Whether it’s groundbreaking real-world applications, cutting-edge tokenomics, or smart contract capabilities, they all have unique offerings that demand attention. Tezos has long been a fan favorite for its innovative proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while VeChain continues to make strides in supply chain solutions. And then, there’s Qubetics—a rising star with a fresh approach to the tokenization of real-world assets, making it easy for businesses, professionals, and individuals to embrace the future of finance. While each of these cryptos brings something different to the table, one thing is certain: they are all poised to make a big impact on the digital finance landscape. Let’s break down the key features of each of these top 3 cryptos—Qubetics, Tezos, and VeChain—and explore what makes them tick in 2025. From Qubetics’ Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace to VeChain’s efforts to streamline supply chains, each has a critical role to play in the future of blockchain. Qubetics ($TICS) – Revolutionizing Real World Asset Tokenization Qubetics has been turning heads with its innovative approach to blockchain technology, particularly through its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. Unlike other platforms, Qubetics is designed to simplify the process for businesses, professionals, and individuals looking to tokenize real-world assets. Think of it as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, offering a smooth and secure way to digitize physical assets for trade or investment purposes. At the heart of Qubetics lies its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, which aims to break down the barriers that have traditionally kept smaller businesses and individuals out of the crypto space. By making it easier to tokenize assets such as real estate, commodities, or even intellectual property, Qubetics is providing a user-friendly interface that opens up new avenues for decentralized finance (DeFi). The ease of access, transparency, and security are what set Qubetics apart from other blockchain projects in the space. Qubetics Presale Surpasses Milestones – A Look at the Exciting 2025 Opportunity Over 503 million $TICS tokens sold across 23,700+ holders Raised more than $15.4 million in presale funds Currently in its 27th stage, with tokens priced at $0.1300 Analysts predict up to 11,436% ROI once the mainnet launches Qubetics emerges as one of the most exciting crypto projects of 2025 Latest News: $TICS token gaining momentum as it enters final presale stages Aggressive roadmap leading up to the mainnet launch Qubetics is building lasting value, not just riding hype Crypto Presale success reflects strong trust in the platform Growing demand for real-world asset tokenization is evident Tezos Launches Etherlink and Announces Major Upgrades Tezos continues to solidify its position as a leading self-upgradable and energy-efficient Proof of Stake blockchain. Recent developments include the launch of Etherlink, a Layer-2 solution built on Tezos technology, which successfully completed its public beta and is now officially production-ready. During ETHDenver 2025, Etherlink’s team announced a substantial incentive program, allocating $3 million in rewards to attract and retain users, further enhancing the Tezos ecosystem’s scalability and efficiency. ​ In addition to technological advancements, Tezos has seen significant community engagement, with the Tezos Commons providing monthly overviews of ecosystem milestones. The February 2025 report highlighted key achievements, including important protocol upgrades like Oxford and Paris C, the announcement of Tezos X, and the launch of Etherlink. These developments underscore Tezos’s commitment to continuous improvement and innovation within the blockchain space. ​ VeChain Enhances Supply Chain Transparency ​VeChain (VET) continues to make strides in blockchain-based supply chain solutions. The platform’s ongoing developments and strategic initiatives have positioned it as a significant player in enhancing transparency and efficiency across various industries. Recent analyses suggest that VeChain’s market presence remains robust, with its token trading within a specific range, reflecting a period of consolidation. ​ Community engagement plays a pivotal role in VeChain’s evolution. The recent Galactica Vote, held from February 25 to March 4, 2025, was a critical event for VeChain and associated tokens. This vote aimed to set the stage for significant upgrades, encouraging community participation that could influence VeChain’s strategic direction and long-term success. Positive outcomes from such initiatives are expected to bolster participants confidence and potentially drive adoption. Understanding the Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace Tokenizing real-world assets opens up incredible opportunities for individuals, businesses, and professionals to interact with a variety of asset types in a decentralized way. It allows for fractional ownership, meaning that high-value assets such as real estate, art, or commodities can be broken down into smaller, more affordable tokens. This makes it easier for anyone to participate in asset markets that were once out of reach. For Qubetics, this focus on real-world asset tokenization is a game-changer. It provides a transparent, secure, and easy-to-use platform for asset tokenization. What sets Qubetics apart is the combination of its seamless marketplace with an emphasis on bringing liquidity to assets that traditionally have been illiquid. By digitizing assets and allowing them to be traded, Qubetics opens up a whole new world of opportunities for both seasoned professionals and newcomers alike. Whether it’s real estate, intellectual property, or even commodities, the potential of asset tokenization is just beginning to unfold. Conclusion: Top 3 Cryptos to Buy Now The Top 3 Cryptos —Qubetics, Tezos, and VeChain—are making big waves in the blockchain world this year.

The NCIA would have oversight over state funds and investment strategies, including the option to invest up to 5% of the funds under its control in digital assets. The 2025 State Investment Modernization Act was introduced into the House on March 24 and the Senate on March 25. The bills were introduced by Republican sponsors, making North Carolina the 19th state to have Bitcoin-related proposals in front of its legislature. The bills create a new investment agency Under the bills (H506 and S709), the NCIA would have oversight of funds including retirement systems, general funds, and special funds. It would be made up of a five-member board headed by the state treasurer, who will select the remaining members on the basis of their expertise. The NCIA board will choose a chief investment officer who will be responsible for day-to-day operations and staffing. The bills also provide greater flexibility for choosing assets, including digital assets with a 5% cap, and exempt the NCIA from some state regulations. At the same time, it introduces new governance requirements regarding transparency and the handling of illiquid investments. The NCIA would be formed by July 1 and begin full operation on Jan. 1, 2026. The bills are competing with other bills proposing 10% funds allocation Different bills on digital asset investment ( H92 and S327 ) were introduced into the chambers of the North Carolina legislature in February. Those bills would allow up to 10% of funds to be invested in digital assets. The Senate bill would create a Bitcoin Economic Advisory Board and require the approval of two-thirds of the General Assembly for the liquidation of Bitcoin holdings. The bills would also restrict investable digital assets to exchange-traded funds or assets with a market cap of over $750 billion. Only Bitcoin meets the market cap requirement. These bills were also introduced unilaterally by Republicans. House Speaker Destin Hall endorsed H92. “Today, I filed HB 92, The North Carolina Digital Assets Investments Act, to authorize the NC State Treasurer to invest in qualifying digital assets like #Bitcoin — aligning with President Trump’s vision for a national Bitcoin stockpile and ensuring North Carolina leads at the state level,” Hall wrote on X on Feb. 10. Trump issued an executive order creating a federal Bitcoin reserve on March 7. The bills faced some opposition, with the State Employees Association of North Carolina speaking out against it, for example. “Retirees do not like the conversation about investing in this highly volatile currency. Past, present, and future state employees are taxpayers, and their promised benefits should not be played with,” a spokesman for that organization said . Those bills are now in committee. North Carolina passed an anti-central bank digital currency (CBDC) law in September, overturning a veto by the then-governor to do so. The law prohibits the state from participating in the testing of a CBDC. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State in May. The Senate companion version in is the Banking Committee. Federal Reserve has repeatedly stated that it will not issue a CBDC without a Congressional mandate.

Infinite Reality said in a March 25 statement that Napster would offer “branded 3D virtual spaces” to allow virtual concerts and “social listening parties” along with the ability to offer virtual merchandise. “Imagine stepping into a virtual venue to watch an exclusive show with friends, chat with your favorite artist in their own virtual hangout as they drop their new single, and be able to directly buy their exclusive digital and physical merch,” said Napster CEO Jon Vlassopulos, who will continue in his role amid the acquisition. “The internet has evolved from desktop to mobile, from mobile to social, and now we are entering the immersive era,” he added.

Napster’s latest repurposing Napster was a pioneer in piracy, launching in 1999 as a peer-to-peer (P2P) filing-sharing service mostly for music. It shuttered in 2001, buried by a court order after a wave of copyright infringement lawsuits. The now-bankrupt company sold its brand, which was relaunched as a music-streaming service before bouncing between owners for the next 20 years. The blockchain firm Algorand and crypto investment firm Hivemind most recently bought it in 2022. Related: Here’s what musicians actually think of tokenizing content in Web3 Napster had made several moves in the Web3 space, announcing plans in June 2022 to launch its own Napster token on the Algorand blockchain that could be used to buy music subscriptions and other content.

Source: Napster John Acunto, co-founder and CEO of Infinite Reality, said the team hopes to lead an “internet industry shift from a flat 2D clickable web to a 3D conversational one.” Infinite Reality says the acquisition of Napster is slated to close in a few weeks.

Attorney Fred Rispoli quickly reacted to Alderoty’s post, expressing both frustration and sympathy for the SEC attorneys who worked tirelessly on the case. He pointed out that, after investing thousands of hours, making personal sacrifices, and being away from their families, the case has now been resolved swiftly, which he describes as their hard work being “wiped out in an instant.” However some X users commented that the real victims are the Ripple team and XRP holders, who suffered through years of stress and financial losses due to the lawsuit.

After years of intense scrutiny and market-moving headlines, both parties have signaled a move towards finality, agreeing to drop their respective appeals. This breakthrough development marks a potentially pivotal moment for Ripple, XRP, and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Let’s dive into the details of this landmark settlement and what it means for the future. Ripple SEC Settlement: A Major Milestone Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderotti, took to X (formerly Twitter) to announce the significant progress in the Ripple SEC settlement . In a concise update, Alderotti revealed that both Ripple and the SEC have agreed to dismiss their appeals in the ongoing legal saga. This decision signifies a mutual desire to finalize the matter and move forward, avoiding further protracted legal proceedings. This move towards resolution has been keenly watched by the crypto community, given the case’s implications for crypto regulation and the precedent it could set. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key terms of the proposed settlement: Appeals Dropped: Both Ripple and the SEC will withdraw their appeals, effectively accepting the current court rulings as the basis for settlement. Fine Adjustment: The SEC will retain $50 million of the original $125 million penalty imposed on Ripple. This means a substantial $75 million will be returned to Ripple. Injunction Lift Request: The SEC will request the court to remove a previously imposed injunction against Ripple. This is a crucial aspect, potentially freeing up Ripple from certain operational constraints. It’s important to note that while this agreement is a significant step, finalization is still contingent upon several procedural steps. These include a vote by the Commissioners at the SEC, approval from the court overseeing the case, and adherence to standard legal procedures. While these are formalities, they are necessary to make the settlement legally binding. Why is the XRP Lawsuit Settlement a Big Deal? The XRP lawsuit has been a dark cloud hanging over Ripple and the entire cryptocurrency market for years. Initiated in December 2020, the SEC alleged that Ripple’s sales of XRP constituted unregistered securities offerings. The case has been complex, involving intricate legal arguments and numerous court rulings. A settlement at this stage carries substantial weight for several reasons: Clarity for Ripple: Settlement provides Ripple with much-needed clarity regarding its regulatory standing in the U.S. market. Ending the legal uncertainty allows Ripple to focus more decisively on its business operations and future growth strategies. Positive Signal for XRP: The resolution is widely perceived as a positive development for XRP. The reduced legal risk could boost investor confidence and potentially positively impact the XRP price in the market. Broader Crypto Implications: This case has been a bellwether for crypto regulation in the United States. A settlement could signal a potential shift in the SEC’s approach towards enforcement and regulation within the crypto space. It might also offer a template for resolving similar disputes involving other crypto projects. Reduced Financial Burden: Dropping appeals saves both Ripple and the SEC further legal costs and resource expenditure. For Ripple, recovering a significant portion of the fine is a tangible financial benefit. Decoding the SEC Lawsuit and its Twists and Turns The SEC lawsuit against Ripple has been anything but straightforward. It has involved numerous legal arguments, expert testimonies, and court decisions. Understanding the key milestones helps appreciate the significance of this settlement agreement: Milestone Description Initial Filing (Dec 2020) SEC files lawsuit against Ripple, alleging XRP is a security. Summary Judgment Rulings (July 2023) Judge Analisa Torres rules that programmatic sales of XRP are not securities, but institutional sales are. This was seen as a partial victory for Ripple. Appeals Filed Both SEC and Ripple file appeals against different aspects of the summary judgment ruling. Settlement Agreement (May 2024) Ripple and SEC agree to drop appeals and finalize settlement terms. The partial victory for Ripple in the summary judgment, particularly the ruling on programmatic sales not being securities, was a critical turning point. This ruling has been influential in shaping the regulatory discourse around crypto assets. The current settlement appears to build upon this foundation, seeking to conclude the protracted legal battle amicably. What Happens Next? Key Steps to Finalization While the agreement to settle is a major leap forward, several steps remain before the Ripple SEC settlement becomes fully effective: SEC Commission Vote: The proposed settlement needs to be put to a vote before the Commissioners of the SEC. While Alderotti’s announcement suggests agreement, formal Commission approval is still required. Court Approval: The court overseeing the case must also approve the settlement terms. Judicial approval is necessary to ensure the settlement is fair and legally sound. Legal Procedures: Standard legal procedures for finalizing settlements, such as documentation and filings, will need to be completed. Injunction Lift: The SEC must formally request the court to lift the injunction previously imposed. The timing and process for this will depend on court procedures. The timeline for these steps can vary, but given the mutual agreement and public announcements, the process is expected to move relatively smoothly. The crypto community will be closely watching for updates and official confirmations in the coming days and weeks. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Ripple and Crypto Regulation? The agreement between Ripple and the SEC to settle their long-standing legal dispute marks a significant and potentially transformative moment. For Ripple, it signifies the end of a major chapter of uncertainty and opens the door to renewed focus on innovation and expansion. For the broader cryptocurrency industry, this breakthrough settlement could offer valuable insights into navigating regulatory complexities and engaging with authorities like the SEC. While the specifics of future crypto regulation remain to be seen, the Ripple case and its resolution will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping the landscape for years to come. The markets are reacting positively, and the hope is that this settlement paves the way for more clarity and constructive dialogue between regulators and the burgeoning crypto industry.

According to his analysis, the coin may grow more than 12 times its current value if it follows previous cycle patterns. During the ongoing third cycle, numerous investors follow Dogecoin to observe its potential reach higher. Another analyst through X predicted Dogecoin price would experience future price growth with potential peaks ahead. A price history chart for Dogecoin spans from 2014 to 2025, according to a tweet published by Trader Tardigrade. The provided chart demonstrates an increasing price trend with important marks shown as red arrows that represent major price shifts. The analyst indicates that the cryptocurrency has a strong potential for substantial growth throughout the upcoming years. Dogecoin traders should track current patterns since such data may indicate future price increases for the digital currency. Will DOGE Price Hit $0.3 By This Week As Bullish Gain Momentum? The price of DOGE has experienced a significant upward trend to reach $0.1833 while demonstrating a 5% rise throughout the last day. The current market momentum shows increasing potential due to the BTC price remaining above $88k and ETH above $2k. The market continues to climb after meme coins increased in volume while investors speculate about a DOGE ETF. Dogecoin price stands at resistance points that became significant obstacles in its price action. The price currently encounters resistance of nearly $0.21 as this point becomes vital to sustaining optimistic market trends. Breaking this resistance level may trigger DOGE to explore new key points at $0.22 before potentially reaching $0.25 in the upcoming months. If DOGE reaches $0.3 it could experience a 60% increase. An analysis of the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) shows 0.19 as its current value, which represents a positive movement of funds for DOGE. The MACD indicator shows an upward trend as it crosses the signal line from below. An upward movement of Dogecoin price may continue based on the existing trend pattern. The downside support for Dogecoin exists at $0.17 and $0.15 which bears could force Dogecoin price prediction to reach those levels. Source: TradingView To sum up, The third generation of the Dogecoin price shows promising signs for reaching the $3 level. The present market conditions indicate the currency could experience substantial growth beyond projected values.

Can Shiba Inu Rally 45% to $0.000020? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular dog-themed meme coin, is making waves with its recent price momentum following the formation of a bullish price action pattern on the daily time frame. The past few days have been favorable for the meme coin, as it has broken out from a descending trendline that acted as a resistance level and further confirmed a breakout from a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern. SHIB Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels Following the breakout, SHIB turned bullish, partially shifting its market sentiment from a downtrend to an uptrend. According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, if Shiba Inu’s price continues to rise and closes a daily candle above the $0.0000138 level, there is a strong possibility that the meme coin could surge by 45% to reach the $0.000020 level in the future. Despite this positive development, Shiba Inu remains below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame, keeping the meme coin in a downtrend. As of now, SHIB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 55, indicating strong momentum for the meme coin and suggesting that it has enough room to rise significantly. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Current Price Momentum At press time, SHIB is trading near $0.0000139, registering a price surge of over 2% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the meme coin’s trading volume has increased by 6% during the same period, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day.

42350404,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143244,1742958640,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary ChatGPT Image Generation Unleashed with GPT-4o Upgrade,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chatgpt-image-generation-gpt4o-upgrade/,"Get ready for a visual revolution in the world of AI! OpenAI has just dropped a game-changer: a significant upgrade to ChatGPT’s image generation feature. For over a year, we’ve been anticipating this, and now it’s finally here. Powered by the cutting-edge GPT-4o model, ChatGPT can now natively conjure and tweak images and photos, taking your creative possibilities to unprecedented heights. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental shift in how you can interact with AI. Let’s dive into what this enhanced ChatGPT image generation capability means for you and the future of AI. Unveiling the Power of GPT-4o for Image Creation For those in the know, GPT-4o has been the powerhouse behind ChatGPT, but its talents were previously limited to text. Now, OpenAI has unleashed its visual potential. During a recent livestream, CEO Sam Altman himself announced that GPT-4o is now the engine driving native AI image upgrade within ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s video generation platform. This means you can now create and modify images directly within these tools, unlocking a new dimension of creative expression. Here’s a quick breakdown of what this upgrade brings: Native Image Generation: ChatGPT can now create images from scratch, directly within the chat interface. Image Modification: Edit and transform existing images, including photos with people. Inpainting Capabilities: Intelligently add or alter details like foreground and background objects in images. Powered by GPT-4o: Leveraging OpenAI’s most advanced model for more accurate and detailed visuals. DALL-E 3 Replacement: GPT-4o supersedes DALL-E 3, offering improved image quality and editing features. Who Gets to Experience the Enhanced Image Generation First? Excited to get your hands on this new feature? Here’s the rollout plan: User Group Availability Pro Plan Users ($200/month) Live Now Plus Users Coming Soon Free ChatGPT Users Rolling Out Soon API Developers Coming Soon While Pro users are already enjoying the benefits of GPT-4o powered generative AI images , OpenAI assures that Plus and free users, as well as developers utilizing their API, will gain access to this feature soon. Patience is key, but the wait promises to be worthwhile! GPT-4o: Thinking Deeper for Superior Visuals OpenAI highlights that GPT-4o “thinks” a bit longer than its predecessor, DALL-E 3, before generating images. This extra processing time translates into what OpenAI describes as “more accurate and detailed images.” Think of it as the AI taking a moment to truly understand your request, resulting in visuals that are closer to your vision. This improvement is a significant leap forward in the quality and precision of OpenAI image AI capabilities. Moreover, the ability to edit existing images opens up a world of creative possibilities. Want to transform a photo? Need to subtly alter a background or foreground element? GPT-4o makes it possible with its advanced inpainting capabilities. Imagine the power to refine and enhance your visuals with simple text prompts, all within ChatGPT. The Mystery of Training Data and Ethical Considerations One aspect OpenAI remains tight-lipped about is the specific image data used to train these new generative AI images capabilities. This secrecy is common practice in the generative AI space. Companies often view training data as a crucial competitive edge, guarding it closely. Furthermore, revealing training data details can open doors to potential IP-related legal challenges, adding another layer of disincentive for transparency. However, OpenAI does offer some control to content creators. They provide an opt-out form allowing creators to request the removal of their works from training datasets. Additionally, OpenAI states that they respect requests to disallow their web-scraping bots from collecting training data, including images, from specific websites. This demonstrates a degree of consideration for creators’ rights in the evolving landscape of AI and copyright. Following in Google’s Footsteps, but Learning from Missteps ChatGPT’s enhanced image generation arrives shortly after Google’s experimental foray into native image output with Gemini 2.0 Flash. Gemini’s image component quickly went viral, but not entirely for positive reasons. It was discovered that Gemini 2.0 Flash lacked sufficient guardrails, allowing users to remove watermarks and generate images depicting copyrighted characters. This highlighted the critical need for robust safety measures in generative AI images to prevent misuse and copyright infringement. It remains to be seen how OpenAI has addressed these potential pitfalls in its ChatGPT image generation upgrade. The lessons learned from Gemini’s experience are undoubtedly valuable, and hopefully, OpenAI has incorporated stronger safeguards to ensure responsible and ethical use of its powerful new feature. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for AI Creativity The upgrade to ChatGPT’s image generation is more than just a feature update; it’s a significant step forward in making AI a more versatile and powerful creative tool. By integrating GPT-4o for native image generation and editing, OpenAI has unleashed a new era of possibilities for users across various domains. From content creation to personal expression, the enhanced visual capabilities of ChatGPT promise to reshape how we interact with AI and bring our ideas to life. As this feature rolls out to more users, it will be fascinating to witness the innovative and imaginative ways people leverage this exciting AI image upgrade .

While meme coin giants like Floki Inu show signs of breaking out and Pudgy Penguins stir hype with their NFT-crypto ETF, something way more explosive is happening at the presale level. Say hi to BTFD Coin (BTFD) —a rising meme coin that’s changing the game quite literally. While Floki Inu holds strong and PENGU tries to shake off whale dominance, BTFD Coin is handing out a 100% bonus with code LAUNCH100 during its 15th presale stage, backed by a full P2E game that just went live. With over $6.41 million raised, 71 billion coins sold, and 11,500+ Bulls already in, it’s not just another project—it’s a movement. So let’s dive into the best meme coin presale in 2025 . BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin Presale With a Real Utility Imagine this: You just dropped $5,000 into a presale at $0.0002 per coin. Before you even blink, the value is already set to jump 200% by the time it lists at $0.0006. But wait—you used the LAUNCH100 bonus code, so now you’ve doubled your coins. That $5,000 just bought you 25 million BTFD Coins, but thanks to the bonus, you’re holding 50 million. Once BTFD hits its listing price, you’re sitting on $30,000. That’s the kind of play meme coin legends are made of. Now throw in a live P2E game that’s dishing out real rewards, a staking system offering 90% APY, and a squad-themed ecosystem that makes community fun again. That’s BTFD—a coin built on Ethereum, crafted by traders for traders, and engineered for those who know that buying the dip isn’t just a strategy—it’s a lifestyle. The BTFD game is more than just a game. It’s your passport to passive income in the crypto world. Play through four interactive levels, rack up in-game coins, and convert them into BTFD tokens. Better yet? Invite friends, earn bonuses, and upgrade your DeFi portfolio while having fun. No gimmicks—just pure Web3 utility, wrapped in memes and money-making madness. Hey Bulls, Heads up: The Clock is Ticking! That 100% bonus code LAUNCH100 isn’t going to last forever. It ends on March 30, 2025, and every token you grab until then gets doubled. Use it now, while the presale is still in Stage 15 at just $0.0002 per token. After Stage 16, the price will launch at $0.0006, which means buying now is like getting in on a 200% ROI before it even hits the open market. Want to cash in? Here’s how to use the LAUNCH100 code: Head over to the BTFD Presale , connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.), enter LAUNCH100 in all caps in the bonus code field, and confirm it. Plug in your purchase amount, hit “Buy Now,” confirm in your wallet, and boom—you’ve just doubled your stack. Still reading? Here’s more. BTFD isn’t just throwing bones to buyers. They’re running a killer referral program: Make it to the Top 20 referrers by the end of the month, and you’ll score 10% of the total raise from your referrals in BTFD tokens. This resets monthly, so if you’re good at shilling, this one’s for you. BTFD’s meme coin presale has stacked all the right plays: over $6.41 million already raised, 71 billion coins sold, and a community that’s buzzing across socials. Stage 15 is in full swing, and this is the final pit stop before liftoff. Floki Inu (FLOKI): GameFi Giant Gears Up for Valhalla FLOKI isn’t sleeping on the job. The meme coin, currently trading around $0.00006512, has rallied behind its GameFi strength. With a market cap of $630.3 million and whales scooping up billions of tokens recently, analysts are speculating that the sideways trading since early March could be the calm before the bull storm. The upcoming Valhalla mainnet launch in Q1 2025 is FLOKI’s big play. Add to that a Telegram trading bot picking up traction, and you’ve got solid foundations for a future rally. But let’s face it—while FLOKI is moving steadily, the real heat is coming from new meme coin presales. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): ETF Hype vs. Whale Pressure PENGU recently got its wings flapping again with ETF news that pushed it into the headlines. But after a short-lived V-shaped recovery and a dip back to $0.006874, retail traders are getting cautious. Despite bullish buzz on Stocktwits, technical indicators still show weakness. The RSI is sitting near 40, MACD is still bearish, and the top 10 wallets control over 66% of supply. Sure, the ETF angle could boost visibility if it’s approved, but PENGU’s near-term price action looks shaky. For those chasing short-term ROI, presales like BTFD might be the better play this week. Final Thoughts: Why BTFD Ranks #1 in the Top New Meme Coins to Join This Week Here’s the thing: In a market where volatility is the name of the game, smart investors look for low-risk, high-reward entry points. Presales like BTFD Coin give you just that—a safe way to lock in prices before the FOMO kicks in. While big players like FLOKI and PENGU deal with market swings and whale games, BTFD Coin lets you grab double tokens, earn via a P2E game, stake for 90% APY, and join a tight-knit, meme-savvy community. Based on current trends, social buzz, and the sheer amount of money flowing into BTFD, this is the pick of the litter when it comes to the top new meme coins to join this week. Time’s running out—the 100% bonus ends March 30, and Stage 15 won’t last long. So don’t just sit there scrolling. Join the BTFD Coin presale now. BTFD or get left in the dust. You choose.

According to a statement from the company on Mar. 26, the regulator will not take any enforcement action against Immutable ( IMX ), the IMX Ecosystem Foundation, or its chief executive officer. This officially puts an end to the matter. Immutable first revealed in October that it had received a Wells notice from the SEC. This notice meant the agency was considering possible charges for violating U.S. securities laws. However, with the investigation now closed, Immutable says this outcome validates its long-standing commitment to legal and regulatory compliance. The company welcomed the SEC’s ruling and noted that it was a step in the right direction for the web3 gaming sector. Immutable claimed that throughout the process, it stayed committed to its goal and kept developing products for gamers.

These aren’t just any locations; they are areas that traditional mining operations have bypassed for decades. This exciting news, exclusively shared with Bitcoin World, highlights a paradigm shift in mineral exploration – moving from conventional methods to AI-driven precision. What are Critical Minerals and Why is AI Mining a Game Changer? Critical minerals are the unsung heroes of modern technology. They are essential ingredients in everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to renewable energy infrastructure and, importantly, the very hardware that powers the cryptocurrency world. Securing a stable and diverse supply of these minerals is paramount in an increasingly tech-dependent global economy. Traditional mineral exploration is a time-consuming, expensive, and often hit-or-miss endeavor. It relies heavily on geological surveys, manual data analysis, and educated guesswork. This is where AI mining enters as a revolutionary force. AI mining leverages sophisticated algorithms to analyze vast datasets – including historical geological surveys, satellite imagery, and geochemical data – to identify patterns and anomalies that human geologists might miss. This approach drastically accelerates the exploration process, reduces costs, and increases the likelihood of successful discoveries. Earth AI’s breakthrough exemplifies the transformative potential of AI mining , demonstrating how technology can unlock resources previously deemed inaccessible or uneconomical. Earth AI’s Discovery: Unearthing the Overlooked with AI While details on the exact size of Earth AI’s discoveries are still under wraps, the implications are massive. The startup has identified promising deposits of: Copper, Cobalt, and Gold in the Northern Territory Silver, Molybdenum, and Tin in New South Wales (approximately 310 miles northwest of Sydney) These locations were not chosen randomly. Earth AI’s algorithms meticulously combed through decades of archived geological data, uncovering potential that had been overlooked by traditional mineral exploration methods. Roman Teslyuk, Earth AI’s founder and CEO, emphasized this technological frontier, stating, “The actual, real frontier [in mining] is not so much geographical as it is technological.” This sentiment underscores the core of Earth AI’s success: shifting the focus from simply searching new territories to intelligently re-evaluating existing data with cutting-edge mining technology . How Does Earth AI’s Mining Technology Work? Earth AI’s journey began with Teslyuk’s doctoral research at the University of Sydney. He recognized a treasure trove of untapped information within Australia’s national archive of mining exploration data. For decades, exploration companies in Australia have been required to submit their data to this archive. Teslyuk realized the potential of this data if analyzed with the right tools. Here’s a simplified breakdown of Earth AI’s approach to AI mining : Data Ingestion: Earth AI’s algorithms ingest massive amounts of historical geological data, including reports, surveys, and maps dating back to the 1970s. AI-Powered Analysis: Sophisticated machine learning algorithms are trained to identify patterns, anomalies, and indicators of mineral deposits within this vast dataset. The AI learns from past successes and failures in mineral exploration . Target Identification: The AI pinpoints specific locations with high potential for critical mineral deposits, even in areas previously explored and deemed unpromising. Ground Validation: Earth AI developed its own drilling equipment to rapidly and cost-effectively validate the AI’s predictions on the ground, proving the accuracy and effectiveness of their mining technology . This integrated approach, combining AI-driven analysis with rapid on-site validation, sets Earth AI apart and addresses a key challenge in the traditional mining industry: the reluctance to adopt unproven technologies. The Future of Mineral Exploration: Faster, Smarter, and More Efficient Earth AI’s success, alongside KoBold’s recent copper discovery in Zambia, signals a significant shift in the landscape of mineral exploration . The traditional, decade-long process of finding new deposits is becoming increasingly unsustainable in today’s fast-paced world. As Teslyuk aptly puts it, “The way we used to explore for metals in the past, the 20th century, it just takes very, very long. It takes decades to find something. With modern pace of the world, you just can’t wait for that long.” AI mining offers a compelling solution. By dramatically accelerating the discovery process, reducing exploration costs, and enhancing the accuracy of target identification, mining technology powered by AI is poised to: Secure Supply Chains: Ensure a more reliable and diversified supply of critical minerals essential for technological advancement and economic stability. Reduce Environmental Impact: By making exploration more targeted, AI can help minimize the environmental footprint associated with widespread, less focused exploration activities. Unlock Economic Opportunities: Revitalize mining in regions previously considered depleted or unviable, creating new economic opportunities and jobs. Drive Innovation: Encourage further innovation in mining technology and the development of even more efficient and sustainable mineral extraction methods. Earth AI’s breakthrough is more than just a promising discovery; it’s a powerful demonstration of how AI mining is revolutionizing an age-old industry, paving the way for a future where resource acquisition is smarter, faster, and more aligned with the demands of the 21st century. As the world increasingly relies on critical minerals to power its technological progress, companies like Earth AI, leveraging cutting-edge mining technology , are becoming indispensable.

With over $100 million already raised for its Bitcoin ETFs , the firm is doubling down on Bitcoin exposure while strategically avoiding the allure of Ethereum and the volatile world of memecoins. This decision, as reported by CoinDesk, underscores a calculated and risk management focused strategy in navigating the complex cryptocurrency landscape. Let’s delve deeper into Calamos’s approach and what it signals for the future of institutional institutional adoption in crypto. Why Bitcoin ETFs Are Calamos’s Primary Focus? Calamos’s strong emphasis on Bitcoin ETFs isn’t arbitrary. It reflects a strategic alignment with what they perceive as a more mature and institutionally palatable segment of the crypto market. Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons behind this focus: Established Market Presence: Bitcoin, as the pioneering cryptocurrency, boasts the longest track record and the most developed infrastructure. This maturity lends a degree of stability and predictability that appeals to traditional asset managers like Calamos. Regulatory Clarity (Relatively): While crypto regulations are still evolving globally, Bitcoin has generally faced less regulatory scrutiny compared to other cryptocurrencies. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions further solidifies its standing within regulatory frameworks. Investor Demand: There’s a significant and growing demand for Bitcoin exposure from institutional and retail investors alike. Bitcoin ETFs provide a regulated and accessible route for these investors to gain exposure without directly holding the underlying asset. Hedging Tools: As Calamos themselves pointed out, the availability of robust hedging tools for Bitcoin is a crucial factor. These tools are essential for managing risk and volatility, a cornerstone of traditional asset management. The Ethereum Question: Why the Hesitation? While Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and a hub for innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Calamos is taking a cautious stance. Their hesitation towards launching Ethereum -based products stems from several concerns: Limited Hedging Tools: Calamos specifically cited the “limited ETH hedging tools” as a primary reason for their current avoidance. Compared to Bitcoin, the market for sophisticated hedging instruments for Ethereum is less developed, making risk management more challenging. Technological Complexity: Ethereum’s ecosystem is more complex than Bitcoin’s, involving smart contracts, decentralized applications, and layer-2 scaling solutions. This complexity can introduce additional operational and security risks. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for Ethereum and its associated technologies is still evolving and, in some areas, less clear than for Bitcoin. This uncertainty can deter institutions seeking regulatory compliance and clarity. Proof-of-Stake Transition: While the move to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) was a significant upgrade for Ethereum , it also introduced new dynamics and considerations, particularly around staking rewards and network security, which might require further evaluation from a risk management perspective. Memecoins: A Definite No-Go Zone When it comes to memecoins, Calamos’s stance is clear: a definite no. This aversion is rooted in the very nature of memecoins, which are characterized by: Extreme Volatility: Memecoins are notoriously volatile, often driven by social media trends and community sentiment rather than fundamental value. This volatility makes them unsuitable for risk-averse institutional investors. Lack of Fundamental Value: Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum , memecoins typically lack strong underlying technology, use cases, or development teams. Their value is primarily speculative. High Risk of Market Manipulation: The relatively low liquidity and concentrated ownership in many memecoins make them susceptible to market manipulation and pump-and-dump schemes. Reputational Risk: For a traditional asset manager like Calamos, associating with memecoins could pose reputational risks, potentially alienating clients who prioritize stability and long-term value. The Broader Implications for Institutional Adoption Calamos’s strategy offers valuable insights into the broader trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Their approach highlights several key considerations for traditional financial firms venturing into this space: Factor Bitcoin ETFs Ethereum Memecoins Risk Profile Moderate (relative to crypto) Moderate to High Extremely High Hedging Tools Developing, improving Limited Negligible Regulatory Clarity Increasing Evolving Unclear Institutional Appeal High Moderate Very Low This table summarizes the comparative landscape, emphasizing why Bitcoin ETFs are currently the preferred entry point for institutions seeking crypto exposure. It’s not just about embracing crypto; it’s about doing so in a way that aligns with established risk management principles and client expectations. Risk Management: The Cornerstone of Calamos’s Crypto Strategy Risk management is clearly at the heart of Calamos’s crypto strategy. Their decision-making process underscores the importance of a cautious and calculated approach, especially when dealing with a nascent and volatile asset class. Here are key takeaways regarding their risk management philosophy: Prioritizing Mature Assets: Focusing on Bitcoin, the most established cryptocurrency, demonstrates a preference for assets with a longer track record and greater market depth. Demand for Hedging: The emphasis on hedging tools highlights the need for traditional risk mitigation strategies to be applicable in the crypto space. Gradual Engagement: Avoiding Ethereum and memecoins suggests a phased approach to crypto adoption, starting with lower-risk, more understood assets. Client Protection: Ultimately, this risk-averse strategy is geared towards protecting client capital and maintaining trust, which is paramount for any asset management firm. Actionable Insights for Investors What can investors learn from Calamos’s approach? Here are some actionable insights: Diversification within Crypto: Even within the crypto space, diversification is crucial. Different cryptocurrencies have vastly different risk profiles. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Assess your own risk tolerance before investing in any cryptocurrency. Bitcoin ETFs may be suitable for those with moderate risk appetite, while memecoins are strictly for high-risk speculators. Due Diligence is Key: Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency or crypto investment product before investing. Understand the technology, the market dynamics, and the associated risks. Consider Institutional Signals: Pay attention to how institutional investors are approaching crypto. Firms like Calamos offer valuable insights into prudent and risk-aware crypto investment strategies. Conclusion: A Strategic and Cautious Crypto Future Calamos’s decision to focus on Bitcoin ETFs while sidestepping Ethereum and memecoins is a telling sign of how traditional finance is cautiously but surely integrating with the crypto world. Their emphasis on risk management , hedging tools, and established assets underscores a pragmatic approach to institutional adoption . As the crypto market continues to evolve, expect to see more nuanced strategies from traditional players, prioritizing calculated moves over impulsive leaps into the unknown. Calamos’s bold move serves as a valuable case study for navigating the exciting yet complex landscape of cryptocurrency investments.

This news, first reported by BWE News citing VentureBeat, brings a wave of relief to the project and its community, who have been under the shadow of regulatory uncertainty since receiving a Wells Notice in October of the previous year. What does this mean for Immutable X, IMX token holders, and the future of Web3 gaming? Let’s dive into the details. Why the SEC Investigation into Immutable X Mattered The SEC investigation into Immutable, specifically focusing on the IMX token sale, was a critical point of concern for several reasons. A Wells Notice from the SEC is a formal indication that the agency is considering recommending enforcement action against the recipient. In the context of cryptocurrencies, these investigations often revolve around whether a token sale constitutes an offering of unregistered securities. For Immutable, a leading platform in the burgeoning Web3 gaming space, the implications were substantial. The uncertainty could have hindered development, partnerships, and overall adoption of the IMX ecosystem. Regulatory Cloud: The investigation cast a regulatory cloud over Immutable X, potentially deterring investors and partners wary of regulatory risks. Impact on IMX Token: The price and sentiment around the IMX token were undoubtedly affected by the looming investigation. Investor confidence can wane during periods of regulatory scrutiny. Industry-Wide Implications: The outcome of the Immutable investigation was closely watched by the wider Web3 gaming and crypto industry. It could have set a precedent for how the SEC approaches token sales in this innovative sector. The Breakthrough: SEC Closes the Case The news that the SEC has decided to end its investigation without pursuing enforcement action is a major win for Immutable. This decision signals that, at least in this instance, the SEC did not find sufficient grounds to allege that Immutable’s IMX token sale violated securities laws. For Immutable, this marks a pivotal moment, removing a significant hurdle and paving the way for greater focus on growth and innovation. The resolution of the SEC investigation is not just a victory for Immutable but also sends a positive signal to the broader Web3 gaming industry, suggesting a potentially more nuanced regulatory approach than some might have feared. Immutable X and Web3 Gaming: What’s Next? With the SEC investigation behind them, Immutable X is now positioned to accelerate its mission to bring Web3 gaming to the masses. Immutable X is a layer-2 scaling solution for NFTs on Ethereum, specifically designed to enhance the gaming experience by offering near-instant transactions, massive scalability, and zero gas fees for trading and minting NFTs. Here’s what we can expect from Immutable X moving forward: Focus on Growth and Adoption Partnerships: Expect Immutable X to aggressively pursue new partnerships with game developers and studios looking to build on Web3. The clarity provided by the SEC’s decision will make Immutable a more attractive platform. Ecosystem Expansion: Immutable can now double down on expanding its ecosystem, attracting more games, developers, and users to its platform. Technological Advancement: Freed from the shadow of the investigation, Immutable can dedicate more resources to further developing its technology and enhancing its offerings for Web3 gaming. Benefits for IMX Token Holders The positive resolution of the SEC investigation is also good news for IMX token holders. The token’s utility within the Immutable X ecosystem includes governance, staking, and transaction fees. With increased adoption and growth of the platform, the demand and utility of the IMX token could see a significant boost. Investors who were hesitant due to regulatory uncertainty may now find IMX a more appealing asset. Challenges and the Path Ahead for Crypto Regulation While the conclusion of the SEC investigation into Immutable is a positive development, it doesn’t mean the path is entirely clear for Web3 gaming and crypto regulation. The broader regulatory landscape remains complex and evolving. Here are some ongoing challenges and considerations: Challenge Description Actionable Insight Regulatory Uncertainty Globally, crypto regulations are still being developed and vary significantly across jurisdictions. This creates ongoing uncertainty for projects operating in the space. Projects need to proactively engage with regulators, seek legal counsel, and adapt to evolving regulatory frameworks. SEC Scrutiny While Immutable’s investigation ended without enforcement, the SEC continues to scrutinize the crypto industry. Future token sales and projects will still need to navigate SEC regulations. Web3 projects should prioritize compliance, ensure proper legal structuring of token sales, and maintain transparency in their operations. Industry Education There’s a need for ongoing education for both regulators and the public about the nuances of Web3 technology and its potential benefits. Industry players should actively participate in dialogues with regulators, providing clarity and context to help shape informed regulatory policies. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Immutable X and Web3 Gaming The SEC’s decision to end its investigation into Immutable X marks a significant milestone for the project and offers a beacon of hope for the Web3 gaming sector. It removes a major obstacle, allowing Immutable to fully focus on its mission of building the leading platform for NFT gaming. For investors, developers, and gamers alike, this news is a powerful endorsement of the potential of Web3 gaming and the innovative solutions being built on platforms like Immutable X. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of compliance and constructive engagement, while also highlighting the potential for positive outcomes when innovation and regulation find a path forward. The relief felt by the Immutable community is palpable, and the future looks brighter than ever for this pioneering platform.

Despite the anticipated challenges following the Bitcoin halving, the Bitcoin mining sector is showing remarkable resilience. New data reveals that Bitcoin miner revenue has not only stabilized but also demonstrated impressive growth, particularly in the last quarter of 2024. Let’s dive into the numbers and explore what this means for the future of Bitcoin mining and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This surge in Bitcoin mining revenue signals a strong and adaptable industry. Is Bitcoin Mining Revenue Still Profitable Post-Halving? The Bitcoin halving, a pre-programmed event that reduces the block reward for miners by half, historically creates uncertainty around miner profitability. However, recent data from Coin Metrics, highlighted by Cointelegraph, paints a different picture. In Q4 2024, Bitcoin mining revenue reached a significant $3.7 billion. This represents a substantial 42% increase, demonstrating the underlying strength and adaptability within the mining industry. Even more encouraging is the fact that this revenue level is holding steady into Q1 2025, suggesting that miners have effectively navigated the immediate post-halving period. This robust performance addresses concerns about the immediate impact of the halving on crypto miner profitability . How Are Miners Adapting to Maintain Profitability? The Bitcoin mining community isn’t sitting still. Faced with reduced block rewards, miners are proactively implementing several strategies to maintain and even enhance their crypto miner profitability . These adaptive measures are crucial for the long-term health of the Bitcoin network. Let’s explore some key adaptations: Equipment Upgrades: Investing in newer, more energy-efficient mining equipment is a primary focus. Next-generation ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) offer significantly improved hash rates per watt, reducing operational costs and boosting efficiency. This technological advancement is vital for sustaining Bitcoin mining revenue . Cost Optimization: Miners are scrutinizing every aspect of their operations to cut costs. This includes negotiating better energy rates, optimizing cooling systems, and streamlining operational workflows. Efficient cost management is paramount for maximizing profit margins in the competitive mining landscape and securing stable Bitcoin mining trends . Diversification into AI Hosting: An interesting and increasingly popular trend is diversification into AI hosting. Mining facilities, with their robust infrastructure and power capacity, are well-suited to host AI computation workloads. This diversification provides an additional revenue stream, hedging against Bitcoin price volatility and enhancing overall business resilience. This innovative approach contributes to a more diversified and stable revenue base beyond solely relying on Bitcoin mining Q4 2024 performance. Challenges and Risks on the Horizon While the current outlook for Bitcoin mining revenue is positive, miners still face several challenges and potential risks that could impact future profitability: Potential Trade Tariffs: Geopolitical factors, such as trade tariffs on mining equipment, could significantly increase capital expenditure and operational costs. Tariffs can disrupt supply chains and make it more expensive for miners to upgrade or expand their operations. This external factor could put pressure on crypto miner profitability . Low Transaction Fees: Currently, a significant portion of Bitcoin activity still comes from small-value transfers. This translates to relatively low transaction fees for miners. If this trend continues, and on-chain activity doesn’t shift towards higher-value transactions, reliance on block rewards will remain high, especially post-halving. Increased transaction fees are needed to supplement block rewards and ensure long-term Bitcoin mining revenue sustainability. Bitcoin Mining in Q4 2024: A Data Snapshot To better understand the recent performance of Bitcoin mining, let’s look at some key data points for Bitcoin mining Q4 2024 : Metric Value Significance Total Bitcoin Mining Revenue (Q4 2024) $3.7 Billion Indicates strong industry performance and revenue generation. Quarter-over-Quarter Growth 42% Demonstrates significant revenue increase compared to previous quarter. Revenue Trend (Post-Halving) Stable Suggests miners are adapting effectively to reduced block rewards. Key Adaptation Strategies Equipment upgrades, cost cuts, AI hosting Highlights proactive measures taken by miners to maintain profitability. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors What does this mean for you? The stability and growth in Bitcoin mining revenue post-halving are positive indicators for the Bitcoin ecosystem. It suggests: Network Security: A healthy and profitable mining sector is crucial for maintaining the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Strong miner revenue incentivizes continued participation and investment in the network. Long-Term Viability: The adaptability shown by miners in the face of halving demonstrates the long-term viability and resilience of the Bitcoin mining industry. Diversification into areas like AI hosting further strengthens this outlook. Investment Opportunities: For investors, a stable and growing Bitcoin mining sector can present potential investment opportunities, both in mining companies and related infrastructure projects. Understanding Bitcoin mining trends is key for informed investment decisions. Conclusion: A Resilient Future for Bitcoin Mining The latest data on Bitcoin mining revenue paints a promising picture. The industry’s ability to not only stabilize but thrive after the halving is a testament to its resilience, innovation, and proactive adaptation. While challenges remain, particularly concerning trade tariffs and transaction fees, the strategic shifts towards efficiency, diversification, and technological upgrades position Bitcoin miners for continued success. The robust Bitcoin mining trends observed in Q4 2024 and continuing into 2025 offer a hopeful outlook for the future of Bitcoin mining and its vital role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

In a move that’s sending shockwaves through both the gaming and financial worlds, GameStop (GME), the beloved and sometimes turbulent video game retailer, has just announced a bold decision: they’re adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet as a reserve asset. Yes, you read that right. GameStop, the company that once symbolized brick-and-mortar retail in the digital age, is diving headfirst into the world of cryptocurrency. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a potentially game-changing shift that could redefine how corporations think about their finances. Let’s break down what this electrifying announcement means, why it’s happening, and what it could mean for the future of both GameStop and the broader crypto landscape. GameStop Officially Adopts Bitcoin as Reserve Asset The official word dropped via a press release that has since ignited conversations across the internet. GameStop’s board of directors, in a unanimous decision, approved the allocation of Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset for the company. This isn’t just about dipping a toe into the crypto waters; it’s a full-on cannonball into the deep end. Consider the context: GameStop is sitting on a substantial pile of liquid assets, reportedly $5.35 billion as of the end of 2024. Allocating a portion of this to Bitcoin is a significant vote of confidence in the leading cryptocurrency and a clear signal of a forward-thinking financial strategy. But what sparked this monumental decision? It appears the catalyst might have been a nudge from an influential voice in the financial world. Matt Cole, CEO of asset management firm Strive, reportedly penned a letter to GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen last month, urging him to consider Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Cohen’s cryptic yet telling response on X (formerly Twitter), simply stating, “Letter received,” now seems incredibly prescient. It suggests that the idea of Bitcoin adoption was already on Cohen’s radar, and Cole’s letter may have been the final push needed to set the wheels in motion. Why Bitcoin? Understanding the Reserve Asset Rationale So, why would a company like GameStop choose Bitcoin as a reserve asset? It’s not like they’re short on traditional currency. The answer lies in the evolving understanding of corporate treasury management and the unique properties of Bitcoin itself. Let’s explore some key reasons: Diversification and Inflation Hedge: In an era of potential inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty, holding a portion of reserves in Bitcoin can act as a diversification strategy and a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins inherently contrasts with the potentially limitless supply of government-issued currencies, making it an attractive store of value. Enhanced Returns Potential: Compared to traditional reserve assets like cash or low-yield government bonds, Bitcoin offers the potential for significantly higher returns. While volatility is a factor, the upside potential of Bitcoin, particularly in the long term, is a compelling draw for companies seeking to optimize their treasury holdings. Future-Proofing the Balance Sheet: Embracing cryptocurrency now can be seen as a strategic move to future-proof GameStop’s balance sheet and position the company at the forefront of financial innovation. It sends a message that GameStop is not just a relic of the past but a company actively adapting to the future of finance and technology. Attracting a New Generation of Investors and Customers: Adopting Bitcoin can resonate strongly with a younger, digitally native demographic, many of whom are deeply interested in cryptocurrencies. This move could enhance GameStop’s brand image, attract new investors, and even appeal to a broader customer base who appreciate forward-thinking companies. The Benefits of Bitcoin for GameStop: A Deep Dive Let’s delve deeper into the specific advantages GameStop might gain by holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet: Benefit Description Improved Treasury Performance Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation could lead to significant gains on GameStop’s reserves, outperforming traditional low-yield assets. Enhanced Brand Perception Positioning GameStop as a tech-forward company embracing digital assets can attract a new wave of customers and investors, particularly within the crypto-savvy community. Strategic Asset Diversification Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds can reduce overall portfolio risk and provide diversification benefits to GameStop’s treasury. Operational Efficiencies (Potential Future) While not immediate, in the future, GameStop could explore integrating Bitcoin into its operations, such as accepting it for payments or using it for cross-border transactions, potentially reducing fees and improving efficiency. Navigating the Challenges: Is Bitcoin a Risky Move for GameStop? While the potential benefits are considerable, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks associated with holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This is uncharted territory for many publicly traded companies, and there are valid concerns to consider: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Significant price swings could impact GameStop’s balance sheet and potentially lead to investor concerns if not managed carefully. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the accounting treatment and legal status of Bitcoin holdings. Security and Custody: Securing and storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. GameStop will need to implement institutional-grade custody solutions. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting standards for cryptocurrency holdings are still developing. GameStop will need to navigate complex accounting rules and ensure transparent reporting of its Bitcoin assets. Public Perception and Investor Sentiment: While many are excited, some traditional investors may be wary of Bitcoin’s volatility and perceived risk, potentially leading to mixed reactions. Clear communication and a well-defined strategy are crucial. Examples of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: GameStop Joins the Ranks GameStop isn’t the first major corporation to embrace institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset. They are joining a growing list of forward-thinking companies recognizing the potential of cryptocurrency. Notable examples include: MicroStrategy: Perhaps the most well-known example, MicroStrategy has made Bitcoin its primary treasury reserve asset, holding billions of dollars worth of BTC. Tesla: Elon Musk’s Tesla also added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, although they have bought and sold portions of their holdings over time. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s Block has also invested in Bitcoin, demonstrating confidence in its long-term value proposition. These examples demonstrate that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is not just a fringe movement but a growing trend among publicly traded companies seeking to diversify their treasury holdings and embrace digital assets. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Investors and the Crypto Market? GameStop’s move into Bitcoin has several implications for investors and the broader crypto market: Increased Mainstream Acceptance: When a company as recognizable as GameStop adopts Bitcoin, it signals further mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. This can encourage other corporations to consider similar moves. Potential Price Impact: Significant institutional investments in Bitcoin can contribute to increased demand and potentially drive up the price of BTC, although market reactions can be complex and influenced by many factors. Validation for Crypto Advocates: For long-time crypto enthusiasts, GameStop’s decision is a validation of their belief in the transformative potential of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Focus on Corporate Treasury Strategies: This move will likely prompt more companies to re-evaluate their treasury management strategies and consider incorporating digital assets into their reserves. Conclusion: A New Level Unlocked for GameStop and Bitcoin? GameStop adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet is more than just a headline; it’s a potentially transformative moment for both the company and the cryptocurrency world. It’s a daring leap into the future of finance, a signal of innovation, and a bold bet on the long-term value of digital assets. While challenges and risks remain, the potential rewards for GameStop, and the ripple effects across the market, are undeniable. This move could very well be a game-changer, unlocking a new level of corporate engagement with Bitcoin and paving the way for further institutional adoption.

These include the $88,355.91 to $90,920.05, $90,920.05 to $93,591.02, $93,591.02 to $96,262.00, $96,262.00 to $98,932.97, and $98,932.97 to $101,603.95 levels—zones where many addresses are currently holding Bitcoin at a loss. Is Bitcoin on its way to test its highs? The red bubbles in this chart highlight levels where underwater investors could sell as they break even, especially if uncertainty persists. A key zone is around $97.4k, where roughly 1.44 million BTC are currently holding at a loss. pic.twitter.com/LKaDBen7cU — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 24, 2025 Notably, around the $97.4K level alone, approximately 1.44 million BTC are held by investors in unrealized loss positions, which could introduce selling pressure as prices recover. Despite the resistance ahead, other on-chain activity shows signs of investor confidence. According to IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin saw over $220 million in net outflows from centralized exchanges in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, total outflows have exceeded $424 million, often interpreted as a sign of investors moving assets into cold storage rather than preparing to sell. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci noted that Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility index has surged to 52.31 points—its highest level in the past six months. The spike in volatility coincides with anticipation around the US Core PCE report expected Friday, a macroeconomic event that could introduce further price swings. Technical Outlook On Bitcoin From a technical perspective, analysts remain divided. Crypto analyst Ali pointed out that Bitcoin is approaching a key resistance zone around $89,000, where the 50-day moving average intersects with a descending trendline drawn from the January all-time high. The outcome at this level may influence the direction of the next major move. On the other hand, analyst Javon Marks highlighted what he described as a potential breakout pattern forming on Bitcoin’s chart.

Marks believes that if momentum continues, Bitcoin could be positioning itself for another rapid climb toward new record highs.

Here’s Where Crypto Whales Are Allocating Their Funds,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-solana-sol-and-sui-sui-good-buys-at-current-prices-heres-where-crypto-whales-are-allocating-their-funds/,"Solana (SOL) has seen its co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko dismiss the need for layer-2 solutions, arguing that a high-performing layer-1 can be both faster and cheaper. Meanwhile, Sui (SUI) wavers after last week’s small dip, with some analysts expecting a strong breakout soon. As crypto whales scout new opportunities, an altcoin named Remittix (RTX) at $0.0734, having raised $14+ million and sold over 522 million tokens is quietly drawing attention for its cross-border payment utility. Below, we examine SOL, SUI and why many big holders are eyeing RTX. Solana (SOL): Still a Layer-1 Heavyweight SOL at $141. Solana (SOL) stands around $145.61, with co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently stating there’s “no reason” for slower or more complex layer-2 solutions if layer-1 can be optimized well. He asserts that the data availability stack moves smoothly on Solana, ensuring no speed penalties and no major security trade-offs. Some whales remain bullish on Solana’s technical approach, believing it could maintain a strong place in DeFi and NFTs. Still, skeptics question whether previous network outages or competitive ecosystems might slow long-term growth. If more dApps arrive and performance remains stable , SOL could push higher, but it might require new inflows or fresh partnerships to power a substantial price rally. Sui (SUI): Ready for a Breakout? SUI at $2.40. Source: CoinGecko Meanwhile, Sui (SUI) sits near $2.47 after slipping 2.48% last week. According to analyst Noob , SUI’s sideways trading might soon end if it breaks above $2.50. Support stands around $2.26, and losing that could send the token near $1.75. However, a push past $3.00 might rekindle investor optimism. With top whales generally splitting their positions, some see SUI’s real potential in advanced DeFi features. Others remain cautious, waiting for a clear sign of volume surges. If the market mood shifts bullish, SUI could reclaim lost ground quickly but that depends on both broader market conditions and Sui’s ability to differentiate itself among fast blockchains. Remittix (RTX): The Whales’ Hidden Gem? While Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) chase technical performance, Remittix (RTX) focuses on an easier-to-understand issue: cheaper, faster global payments. Priced at $0.0734, with $14 million+ raised and 521+ million tokens sold, RTX could end up as a whale favorite if it secures real user adoption. Observers point out that countless freelancers, small businesses, or families face high wire fees and multi-day waits. Remittix solves that by converting crypto (like BTC, ETH, or DOGE) into local currency in about 24 hours, depositing straight into normal bank accounts. Another draw for whales is security: locked tokens and an audited contract reduce the scam risk often found in presale tokens. If Remittix inks deals with online retailers or payroll services, daily transactions might explode potentially sparking big ROI. As a result, RTX could overshadow slower-growing coins if PayFi remains a hot trend. Conclusion: Where Are Whales Putting Their Money? Between Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), whales are still observing which chain will deliver top speed and robust apps. Solana’s big defenders see no need for layer-2, while Sui watchers look for a rally above $3. But if you’re hunting for a practical altcoin with immediate real-world impact, Remittix (RTX) may be the dark horse whales are flocking to. Already at $0.0734 with $14+ million raised, RTX addresses a global need for remittances potentially granting it faster adoption and bigger returns. Ultimately, the big money might pick whichever project Solana, Sui or Remittix is dominating its niche. And so far, RTX appears primed to own the cross-border payments space.

In a March 25 announcement, Crusoe said it plans to sell its Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining operation, including its digital flare mitigation business, to NYDIG, subject to regulatory approvals and other consents. The deal includes Crusoe’s 270 megawatts of power generation technology from more than 425 modular data centers across the United States and Argentina, along with 135 Crusoe employees who will join NYDIG, as no roles will be eliminated as a result of the transaction. Crusoe was founded in 2018 and pioneered technology that captures waste gas created during oil extraction and refinement that would be normally burned off in a process called gas flaring in order to power Bitcoin miners . Photo of gas flaring in action. Source: Crusoe Energy It converts the gas or “stranded energy” into electricity used to power the high-performance compute required for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. Some reports suggest that Crusoe’s Bitcoin mining operation accounts for 1% of the world’s Bitcoin mining. Crusoe’s AI expansion plans However, Crusoe says it now wants to focus its tech on building out AI infrastructure. “The AI business — it’s become the majority of our revenue,” Cully Cavness, the co-founder, president and chief operating officer of Crusoe, told CNBC. The company recently expanded its AI data center in Abilene, Texas, to 1.2 gigawatts around the same time it announced a joint venture with investment firm Engine No. 1 to develop large-scale data center campuses across the US to build out AI capabilities. Source: Matthew Sigel Last year in December, it closed $600 million in a Series D round at a $2.8 billion valuation to power AI. “We see a huge opportunity in front of us, and we have a big advantage and a big head start with what we’ve already announced — and more coming soon,” added Cavness. Related: Tokenized US gold could ultimately benefit Bitcoin: NYDIG NYDIG said that the acquisition of Crusoe’s Bitcoin mining business will help expand its role in supporting Bitcoin’s proof-of-work security. NYDIG founder and executive chairman Ross Stevens said that “it is critically important to keep the Bitcoin network secure, and at the lowest possible cost,” claiming that fiat currencies are “collapsing against Bitcoin around the world.” Magazine: Ex-Alameda hire on ‘pressure’ to not blow up Backpack exchange: Armani Ferrante, X Hall of Flame",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|FIAT|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-26 04:03:43

The price is now trading above $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.430 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might extend losses if it breaks the $2.420 support zone. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price remained supported and started a recovery wave above the $2.350 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to clear the $2.420 and $2.450 resistance levels. The price even tested the $2.50 resistance. However, there was no upside break, and the price reacted to the downside. There was a move below the $2.45 level. A low was formed at $2.40 and the price is now consolidating.

In his latest Bloomberg interview, CEO Brad Gralinghouse said that it’s important to have this exchange-traded fund, while just falling short of accepting that they are working with the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock. XRP price movement has been relatively mute to this development, while industry players expect a $3 breakout soon. Are Ripple and BlackRock Exploring Potential XRP ETF? In his recent Bloomberg interview, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was asked whether they are collaborating with BlackRock to launch an XRP ETF in the US. Although Garlinghouse didn’t explicitly accept such a collaboration, he sparked speculation by stating, “We think it makes sense for the XRP community overall”. The prospect of a BlackRock filing for an XRP ETF in 2025 has captured the attention of the crypto community. Many believe that once the regulatory wall over Ripple is removed, asset managers will rush in the second-half of the year to bring a Ripple ETF to the market. Furthermore, Ripple CEO Garlinghouse is also confident that XRP would make it to the US Digital Asset stockpile. Adding to the discussion, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek highlighted the transformative potential of XRP ETFs. He predicts that the development could attract $8 billion in inflows following the approval. Ripple Drops Cross-Appeal Against US SEC The long-running Ripple vs SEC lawsuit has finally come to an end as the blockchain startup has decided to no longer pursue the cross-appeal against the securities regulator. The resolution involves a $75 million refund to Ripple, following the SEC’s decision to drop its appeal and Ripple abandoning its cross-appeal. This settlement concludes a case that initially resulted in a $125 million penalty against Ripple. With the refund, the company’s net payment to the SEC amounts to $50 million. Under the Trump administration, the SEC has softened its stance, while putting a greater focus on establishing clear crypto regulations. XRP Price Surge to $3 Soon? Amid the current development and hopes for XRP ETF, the XRP price has given a muted response as it continues to face strong rejection at $2.50 levels. Despite this, market analysts have made bold predictions, expecting the XRP price rally to continue at $15 and beyond. Sharing the XRPUSDT chart, popular crypto trader Seyma stated that she’s more bullish on the Ripple cryptocurrency in comparison to other altcoins. “My weekly target is $3-$3.24 i never give investment or trading advice just noted to myself,” she wrote.

Nikita Bier, the ingenious mind behind the viral social apps tbh and Gas, is now onboard to fuel Solana’s ambitious mobile app expansion. This strategic alliance signals a powerful push towards making Web3 more accessible and user-friendly, directly through the devices we use every day – our smartphones. What does this mean for the future of Solana and the broader crypto mobile landscape? Let’s dive in. Why Nikita Bier’s Expertise is a Game Changer for Solana’s Mobile Apps Strategy Nikita Bier isn’t just another advisor; he’s a proven innovator in the social app space. His creations, tbh and Gas, captivated millions with their positive and engaging user experiences. tbh, acquired by Facebook, focused on anonymous positive affirmations among high school students, while Gas continued this trend with compliments and positivity. Bier’s knack for creating viral, user-centric mobile experiences is precisely what Solana needs as it doubles down on its mobile-first approach. His role will be pivotal in: Guiding App Selection: Bier will be instrumental in identifying and selecting promising teams to build on the Solana ecosystem. This curated approach ensures quality and relevance in the apps that Solana supports. Fostering Growth: His experience in scaling social apps will be invaluable in helping these selected teams achieve rapid user growth and engagement within the Solana environment. Enhancing User Experience: Bier’s deep understanding of user behavior and mobile app design will contribute to creating intuitive and enjoyable Web3 mobile applications on Solana. This partnership arrives at a crucial juncture for Solana, especially with initiatives like the Solana Seeker smartphone. Let’s explore how this all fits together. Solana’s Bold Bet on Mobile: The Seeker Smartphone and Web3 Accessibility Solana isn’t just dipping its toes into the mobile world; it’s diving in headfirst. The Solana Seeker smartphone is a testament to this commitment. But why mobile? And why now? Consider these points: Mobile is Ubiquitous: Smartphones are the primary computing device for billions globally. Tapping into the mobile market is essential for widespread crypto adoption . User-Friendly Onboarding: Mobile apps offer a more intuitive and less intimidating entry point to Web3 compared to desktop-centric experiences. Expanding the Ecosystem: Mobile-first applications can unlock new use cases and attract a broader demographic to the Solana ecosystem. The Seeker phone is designed to be a crypto-native device, aiming to simplify access to decentralized applications (dApps), digital asset management, and other Web3 functionalities directly from your pocket. However, great hardware needs equally compelling software. This is where Nikita Bier’s advisory role becomes even more critical. Nikita Bier and the Future of Web3 Mobile Apps on Solana Imagine a future where accessing your crypto wallet, participating in DeFi, or engaging with NFTs is as seamless and enjoyable as using your favorite social media app. This is the vision that the collaboration between Solana and Nikita Bier aims to realize. But what kind of mobile apps are we talking about? Think about: Decentralized Social Media: Apps that prioritize user privacy and data ownership, moving away from centralized platforms. Mobile DeFi Platforms: Simplified interfaces for accessing decentralized finance services like lending, borrowing, and staking directly from your phone. NFT Marketplaces on the Go: Seamless platforms for discovering, trading, and managing NFTs on mobile devices. Play-to-Earn Mobile Games: Engaging mobile games that integrate crypto rewards and NFT assets, making Web3 gaming more accessible. Bier’s guidance will be crucial in ensuring these apps are not only functional but also engaging and user-friendly, overcoming a key barrier to mainstream Web3 adoption. Navigating Challenges and Maximizing Benefits in Solana’s Mobile Expansion While the potential is immense, Solana’s mobile journey isn’t without its hurdles. Successfully integrating Web3 into the mobile experience requires careful consideration of: Challenge Consideration User Education Many mobile users are unfamiliar with crypto and Web3 concepts. Apps need to be intuitive and educational, with seamless onboarding processes. Security Concerns Mobile devices are often targets for security threats. Robust security measures are paramount to protect user assets and data within Web3 mobile apps. Gas Fees and Transaction Speed While Solana is known for speed and low fees, optimizing transactions for mobile users and ensuring a smooth experience is critical. Competition from Web2 Giants Existing Web2 mobile platforms have a massive user base. Web3 mobile apps need to offer compelling value propositions to attract users away from established platforms. To overcome these challenges and maximize the benefits, Solana and its app developers should focus on: Prioritizing User Experience (UX): Apps must be incredibly easy to use, even for crypto novices. Focus on simple interfaces and clear value propositions. Building Strong Communities: Foster communities around mobile dApps to provide support, feedback, and drive organic growth. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborate with mobile carriers, device manufacturers, and other relevant players to expand reach and accessibility. Continuous Innovation: The mobile landscape is constantly evolving. Solana needs to stay ahead of the curve, continuously innovating and adapting its mobile strategy. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For crypto enthusiasts and developers, Nikita Bier joining Solana as an advisor is a significant signal. It indicates a serious commitment from Solana to conquer the crypto adoption challenges by focusing on mobile accessibility. For Users: Expect to see more user-friendly and engaging Web3 mobile apps on Solana in the near future. Keep an eye out for innovative applications that simplify your interaction with the crypto world, directly from your smartphone. For Developers: Solana is signaling that it’s a prime platform for building mobile-first Web3 applications. With Bier’s guidance and Solana’s robust infrastructure, there’s a significant opportunity to create impactful and widely adopted mobile dApps.

As of now, ETH is trading just above the crucial support level of $2,000, reflecting a year-to-date decline of 43%. This stark contrast is particularly notable when compared to Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP, which have seen gains of 23% and an astonishing 279%, respectively, during the same period. Could A 60% Surge In Q2 Bring It Back To $3,200? Market expert Lark Davis has drawn attention to the dramatic downturn in Ethereum’s price in a recent social media update, highlighting a 38% drop in Q1 of this year for the altcoin. This figure is alarmingly close to its worst quarterly performance of 46% recorded during the first quarter of 2018, as noted in the comparison chart shared by Davis. Related Reading: XRP Breakout On Hold? Financial Expert Reveals What’s Missing Following that troubling quarter in 2018, Ethereum saw a brief recovery of 15% in Q2, only to face more than 40% declines in the subsequent quarters, respectively, raising concerns for current investors that this pattern might occur once again in this cycle. Despite these discouraging figures, Davis posed an interesting question regarding the potential for an “explosive” second quarter for Ethereum. Historically, since 2016, ETH has averaged a remarkable 66% surge during this period. If this trend continues and the Ethereum price were to achieve a 60% increase in the coming months, its price could climb to $3,200 per token—levels not seen since early February of this year. Crypto Expert Predicts 1,100% Surge For The Ethereum Price While short-term challenges remain, many analysts retain a long-term bullish outlook for Ethereum. Crypto analyst Merlijn drew parallels between the current market conditions and Bitcoin’s past performance, suggesting that Ethereum is poised for a similar trajectory. The analyst noted, “Accumulation, breakout, and V-shape recovery loading,” implying that a new bull run could be on the horizon for ETH, with forecasts suggesting it could reach up to $24,000 during this cycle—a major 1,100% increase.

Expert Ali Martinez recently highlighted key resistance levels that Ethereum must overcome for a sustainable rebound in the short-term. Martinez noted that ETH’s price has reclaimed its realized price of $2,040, but the next significant challenge lies at the $2,300 mark, where strong resistance has been observed for the leading altcoin. Despite a recent recovery that saw a 10% spike in the past two weeks, Ethereum still faces notable monthly losses, down nearly 25% following a broader market correction.

The transition ends a long journey beginning back in July 2023 for the layer-1 blockchain that included a community vote in July 2024 and a fierce competition, won by Optimism , among layer-2 networks out to convince the Celo ecosystem to build with their technology. The improved network — like other layer 2s — offers faster and cheaper transactions on top of Ethereum's mainnet. The blockchain is powered by Optimism’s OP Stack, a customizable framework that lets developers build layer-2 networks based off of Optimism’s technology. “You know, whenever people ask us, we always recommend the OP stack, because the team there has been so helpful and so supportive,” said Marek Olszewski, the CEO at cLabs, the main developer firm supporting the Celo blockchain. A blueprint for other layer 1s According to Rene Reisberg, the CEO of the Celo Foundation, the migration is the first of its kind in the Ethereum ecosystem, and will probably be used as a blueprint for other EVM-compatible blockchains that are looking to become a layer-2 network. “This path of not just spinning up a new chain, but actually maintaining that history, and having everyone be on the new chain, while it's a lot more work, is great from a Celo perspective. It's becoming this kind of great case study for Ethereum,” Rene Reinsberg, the president at the Celo Foundation, said in an interview. “Even just based on outreach I've been getting from other L1 founders that are like, ‘hey, so what does it actually feel like on the inside of going through this transition, and how much work is it, and how you're thinking about it?’ And so it definitely feels like there's increased interest now,” Reinsberg added. Despite Ethereum's leaders experiencing backlash from the community because of the clunky experience of operating between the plethora of layer-2 blockchains, the lagging price of ether ( ETH ) relative to other cryptocurrencies and the blockchain losing mindshare and new talent to competitors like Solana, Reinsberg said other layer 1s similar to Celo are watching the transition and also considering moving into the layer-2 ecosystem. “As some of these short-term storms come down and sentiment starts to shift, I think you'll start seeing a series of layer 1s that will likely be more public about that,” Reisberg said. “But we're definitely already seeing these early conversations happening.” Celo’s new home According to the team, Celo end users won’t notice much of a difference in their setups, and will still be able to access key features like SocialConnect , a protocol that connects users' phone numbers or X handles to their Celo wallet addresses to make payments. Nevertheless, there are protocol-level changes. “Validator responsibilities have evolved from operating the consensus protocol to temporarily running community RPC nodes, with validator rewards now distributed via smart contract execution rather than at epoch blocks,” the team said in a press release. “Additionally, transaction sequencing — previously determined by validators running the consensus protocol — will initially be handled by a centralized sequencer, with a roadmap in place for transitioning to decentralized sequencing in the future.” Read more: Celo Community Ratifies Plan to Use Optimism's OP Stack for New Layer-2 Chain",Tech|Celo|celo-foundation|layer 2|Optimism|rollup|Optimism foundation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|OP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-26 05:02:26

Custodia said on March 25 that it tokenized US dollar demand deposits and facilitated the issuance, transfer and redemption of the stablecoin “Avit” on Ethereum via the ERC-20 token standard. “A new US dollar payment rail has now been activated inside the US banking system,” Custodia added. “We broke ground on the legal/regulatory front, proving that US banks can collaborate to tokenize demand deposits on a permissionless blockchain in a regulatorily-compliant manner,” said Custodia CEO Caitlin Long. Source: Caitlin Long Vantage Bank CEO and President Jeff Sinnott said the event was a “pivotal moment in reshaping the financial landscape, demonstrating how blockchain and stablecoins can revolutionize payments.” In a series of posts on X, Long explained that the Avit stablecoin was a “real dollar” and not a “synthetic” dollar, as Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller called stablecoins in a Feb. 12 speech. “Real” US dollars, Long explained, can only be issued by the Federal Reserve and a few legally authorized entities, including Custodia Bank. She added that Avit is a “real dollar” as it tokenizes a bank’s demand deposit — funds that customers can withdraw on-demand, such as money in a checking account. Ethereum backers cheer Custodia’s chain choice Custodia has historically championed Bitcoin, and Ethereum advocates were quick to note that the bank chose Ethereum for the stablecoin. “ETH fixed this. Bitcoin couldn’t,” wrote Ethereum advocate Evan Van Ness. Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano also posted to make clear the “permissionless blockchain” Custodia referred to in its announcement. “Just in case it wasn’t obvious, this is built on Ethereum.” Source: Matthew Sigel Related: Ethereum poised for record highs in Q1 2025, analysts predict Ethereum secures over $125.8 billion worth of stablecoins on its network, nearly doubling the second-place Tron blockchain at $64.8 billion, DefiLlama data shows.

The market takes notice—and fast. Bonk, the Solana-based underdog, just surged over 27% in the last seven days, gaining traction from its “for the people” vibe. Meanwhile, Ethereum-born Pepe isn’t sitting still either, chalking up a solid 13% gain this week and catching eyes with a 30% jump in trading volume. But while both Bonk and Pepe are flashing green, there’s something even bigger brewing in presale land—BTFD Coin. With just days left before its LAUNCH100 bonus code expires on March 30, BTFD is the best crypto to buy now for anyone chasing serious upside. The project is gearing up for a breakout, and early investors are already calculating what 2900% ROI could look like when this meme coin hits its predicted moon price of $0.006. Meme coins have always played the long game through community power and cultural hype, but BTFD’s setup is different. With a thriving referral program, an immersive P2E game launched earlier this year, and a 90% APY staking model, it’s not just another hype train—it’s an ecosystem stacked with utility and fun. And right now, there’s a chance to grab 2x tokens—but only if it’s done before the buzzer. BTFD Coin’s Moon Momentum: Referral Program and Bonus Code Fuel the Bull Rush Ever wonder what it’s like to get in early before a meme coin explodes across charts? BTFD is giving everyone that exact shot. At Stage 15 of its presale and trading for just $0.0002, this meme coin presale is packing some serious heat. With over $6.41 million raised and 71 billion tokens sold to more than 11,500+ bulls, it’s not just making waves—it’s setting the tide. BTFD’s most electrifying feature right now? The referral program . It’s not some low-key cashback gimmick—it’s a leaderboard-based system that’s turning community growth into token rewards. Refer friends, family, or fellow degens, and earn 10% of their token buy—if you land in the top 20, the payout is real. Those who get referred also score an extra 10% in tokens, so it’s a win-win hustle during this final stage. Combine that with the LAUNCH100 code that doubles your tokens, and the timing couldn’t be better. A $7,000 investment right now would secure 35 million BTFD tokens. Once the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, that bag’s worth a cool $21,000. But if BTFD rides the bull run to $0.006, that same investment could blast to $210,000. That’s 2900% ROI. Let that number sink in. How to grab BTFD? Just set up a wallet using MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with ETH, BNB, or USDT, then head over to the presale page . Connect your wallet, enter the LAUNCH100 code in all caps, type in your purchase amount, and confirm the buy. Done. Tokens get doubled instantly. It’s that simple. While other meme coins hype community, BTFD’s building it. From the Bulls Squad to the full-blown P2E ecosystem that went live on January 1, 2025, this isn’t just a presale—it’s a party for those who know how to own the dip and run with the bulls. Bonk’s Bounce Back: 27% Weekly Surge and Solana’s Dog Coin Darling Bonk is back in the spotlight. With a 27.99% weekly pump and a recent 2.24% daily gain, this Solana-powered dog-themed meme coin is barking loud again. Created “for the people, by the people,” Bonk’s rise has always been community-fueled, and now that it’s moving again, there’s renewed buzz about its potential to help push Solana even further into the meme coin space. Launched on December 25, 2022, Bonk started strong by airdropping 50% of its supply to the Solana ecosystem, immediately causing a 34% rise in SOL’s price in under 48 hours. Now, despite a 14.99% drop over the past month, Bonk’s rebound shows how fast things can flip in crypto when a project taps into culture. The vibe around Bonk isn’t just memetic—it’s strategic. With its decentralized supply model and loyal user base, this token is creating waves again. Its accessibility and brand power are giving traders serious FOMO. Pepe Pops Off: 13% Weekly Gain and Trading Volume Up Over 30% Pepe might’ve started as a meme, but it’s growing into something more. The Ethereum-based coin named after the internet’s most iconic frog is showing signs of strength again—up 3.99% today and 13.18% over the past seven days, with a trading volume jump of over 30%. Its origins are pure internet culture, but its traction is all blockchain momentum. Launched as a deflationary token, PEPE’s tokenomics are designed to keep things lean while rewarding early supporters. It doesn’t hurt that the meme it’s based on is legendary—giving it an instantly recognizable brand image with every TikTok and tweet. Pepe’s current uptrend proves that the community is still betting big on the frog. While its one-month drop sits at 17.99%, the short-term reversal is stirring attention from crypto analysts who see potential in the project’s bounceback. With whales and retail traders watching, PEPE is making noise again on the charts, and for meme coin enthusiasts looking beyond the hype, it’s one to keep tabs on this month. Final Verdict Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the best crypto to buy now. While Bonk and Pepe are riding solid green waves, BTFD is the only project that still lets investors enter at ground level—with a presale price of just $0.0002, a massive 2900% ROI potential, and a community growing faster than most meme coins in recent memory. The referral program, staking rewards, and full-fledged P2E game are giving investors more than just hype—they’re getting real features and long-term potential. But the window’s closing. The LAUNCH100 bonus code ends March 30, and once that’s gone, so is the 2x token bonus that’s got 11,500+ bulls stampeding in. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Get in now before the final stage closes . Buy BTFD, double your tokens, and ride the bulls to the moon. FAQs What is the best crypto to buy now with high ROI potential? BTFD Coin is considered the best crypto to buy now thanks to its presale price of $0.0002, projected moon price of $0.006, and 2900% ROI potential. How can I claim the BTFD Coin LAUNCH100 bonus code? Connect your wallet on the presale page, enter LAUNCH100 in all caps, confirm the code, and complete your purchase to receive 2x tokens instantly. What makes BTFD Coin different from Bonk and Pepe? BTFD Coin is still in its presale phase, offers 90% APY staking, has a live P2E game, and features a lucrative referral program—making it more than just a meme coin.

Sato was given a 2-year prison sentence and fined for buying shares in around 10 tender offers before they were made public. Sato’s defense reportedly argued that his investment of around ¥9.5 million (~$63,000 at current exchange rates) and subsequent profit of about ¥3.93 million, was not as bad as similar cases, but the 32-year-old former judge and FSA employee nonetheless received a 2-year prison sentence and fines adding up to around ¥11.2 million. Also tacked on to the sentence were four years of probation. According to local media, Sato argued that he (translated) “wanted to understand the market mechanism from the perspective of a shareholder,” elaborating: “I wanted to have financial security for my aging parents and young children. My awareness of the illegality faded away.” The former judge, indicted back in December, was in charge of reviewing information and documents related to takeover bids at the Financial Services Agency’s Corporate Disclosure Division. The info he had access to through his role as assistant director made him privy to lucrative investments. Judge Nomura noted: “The fairness and soundness of the market and the trust of ordinary investors in the market have been greatly damaged.” The sentence, dealt out today on Wednesday, March 26 (JST), comes at a time when residents of Japan are already losing faith in government’s ability to manage economic matters. As the FSA seeks to regulate finance and crypto through stringent regulations and surveillance, anti-crypto Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s approval rating is low, rice has doubled in price in the span of one year, and inflation continues to wrack the island nation.

While Solana attempts to catch up after recent volatility, a new contender Remittix is quietly building momentum. With real-world payment utility and a presale gaining rapid traction, Remittix is now on analysts’ radars as the ERC-20 token that could steal the spotlight in the next market surge. Ethereum Accumulation Zone Attracts Big Investors and Whales Ethereum is holding firm above $2,000, trading at around $2,071 after briefly touching $2,104 today. The recent 1% dip hasn’t shaken investor confidence, especially with analysts like MAXPAIN suggesting the pullback could open up a high-conviction buy zone near $1,900. Many see this potential dip as the calm before a storm one that could kick off Ethereum’s next explosive leg upward. On-chain signals continue to lean bullish. Daily volume remains strong above $10 billion, while ETH futures open interest is climbing clear signs that traders and institutions are circling with intent. Nearly half a million ETH has been scooped up by large players recently, with over 1.2 million ETH exiting exchanges and moving into private wallets and staking contracts. That’s a supply crunch waiting to happen, especially with retail investors now re-entering the market. The accumulation zone between $1,871 and $1,981 has become a stronghold, with both whales and long-term holders building positions. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s long/short ratio has jumped to 55% in favor of longs, further hinting at building bullish pressure in the derivatives market. As Ethereum gears up for what could be a textbook bullrun , traders are questioning whether Solana can keep up. But even more interestingly, some investors are already betting on newer Ethereum -based projects like Remittix. Solana Climbs Back After March Slump and Gains 6 Percent in a Day Solana price has been bouncing back after a rough stretch, clawing its way from a March 11 low of $118 to a current price near $145.74. That’s an 18.8% gain in just over a week, reigniting interest in whether Solana can keep pace as the broader market teases a potential bullrun. After reaching $298 back in January, Solana price has struggled to regain that kind of momentum but analysts believe the tide might be turning. Crypto analyst Satoshi Flipper pointed to a symmetrical triangle forming on Solana’s 4-hour chart, a pattern that typically suggests an impending breakout. If SOL can break and hold above the $132 resistance line, the triangle’s technical target suggests a move to $152 could follow. That’s a realistic 10% climb, modest in crypto terms but significant considering the recent sell pressure across the market. Remittix Gains Momentum as Ethereum Builds Toward a Bull Run Investors hungry for the next big winner aren’t just watching the legacy giants anymore, they’re turning to Remittix (RTX) , an Ethereum -based altcoin that’s rewriting what real-world utility looks like in crypto. While most tokens ride hype cycles, Remittix is riding a structural shift in the payment industry and that makes all the difference. Remittix is positioning itself as the go-to solution for crypto-to-fiat transfers, allowing users to send digital assets and have them arrive as cash in a bank account anywhere in the world. That may sound simple, but the underlying system challenges outdated financial rails, eliminates excessive fees and opens the door for the unbanked to tap into global finance. Its PayFi protocol bridges DeFi and real-world finance in a way few others have managed and the market is noticing. Already, the presale has pulled in over $14+ million, with more than 522 million tokens sold at just $0.0734. This isn’t just another early-stage token with big promises, it’s a functioning concept with a target market worth over $190 trillion. With that kind of runway, analysts say a 50x to 100x rally after launch isn’t just possible, it’s increasingly likely. Investors Bet Big on Remittix as the Best Crypto Presale of the Year While Ethereum’s long-term chart looks primed for a surge and Solana teases a technical breakout, Remittix offers something entirely different utility in motion. This is why seasoned investors aren’t just asking whether ETH or SOL will lead the next bull run. They’re watching which token brings lasting impact. For many, Remittix checks that box. And if the broader market turns risk-on, this could be one of the most explosive tokens heading into the next leg up.

A roundtable on crypto custody will follow on April 25, with another to discuss tokenization and moving assets onchain on May 12. The fourth roundtable in the series will discuss DeFi on June 6. A series of four crypto roundtable discussions are scheduled from April through to June.

Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez revealed that whales bought 200 million coins in the last 14 days. As a response, traders and investors project substantial bullishness over future DOGE price prospects. Dogecoin Whales Buy 200M Coins In Just 2 Weeks Analyst Ali Martinez revealed in an X post on March 26 that Dogecoin whales sacked 200 million coins over the past two weeks. This accumulation saga, occurring despite broader price volatility, has reinforced positive market sentiments on the meme coin’s price trajectory. Source: Ali Charts, X For context, rising whale accumulations underscore heightened market interest in the crypto. In turn, traders and investors anticipate that price gains loom, given the increased buying pressure and demand for the token. Is Dogecoin Recovering? It’s worth mentioning that the whale accumulations occurred as DOGE price recovered from $0.15 to $0.19 since March 11 to 25 (the past 14 days). The dog-themed meme token is up nearly 25% in two weeks, aligning with Dogecoin whales’ trade movers that offer price support. DOGE Price Rally Ahead? As of press time, DOGE token’s price was up nearly 5% intraday and exchanged hands at $0.1910. The meme coin bottomed and peaked at $0.1825 and $0.1955 in the last 24 hours. Furthermore, the weekly chart for the crypto showcased gains worth 14%, aligning with the massive buying in recent days. Market watchers continue to anticipate more gains ahead, escorted by whale data and other market dynamics. Crypto Analyst Sparks Market Optimism With Bullish Projection Another renowned market analyst recently posted on X, projecting a highly bullish outlook for the crypto. Analyst ‘Trader Tardigrade’ revealed that DOGE price is finalizing the last stage of ‘cycle 3.’ Based on historical price movements, this prediction highlights that a massive upswing awaits. Simultaneously, Dogecoin whales’ recent trade movers have further cemented market sentiments of an enormous rally ahead. Source: Trader Tardigrade, X Futures OI Adds Market Optimism It’s also worth mentioning that DOGE futures OI soared 6%, reaching $1.94 billion today. Moreover, the derivatives volume rose 16% to $4.09 billion, per Coinglass data. This statistic further underlined a significant rise in market interest for the crypto, adding to bullish sentiments over long-term prospects. Even a recent report by CoinGape spotlighted that Dogecoin price eyes gains worth 10x ahead, as confirmed by analysts. Overall, the meme coin currently surfs a highly bullish wave, securing a top spot on investors’ radars.

The Investment Modernization Act (House Bill 506), introduced by Representative Brenden Jones on March 24, would create an independent investment authority under the state’s Treasury to determine which digital assets could be suitable for inclusion into the state retirement funds. An identical bill, the State Investment Modernization Act (Senate Bill 709), was introduced into the state’s Senate on March 25. The bills define a digital asset as a cryptocurrency, stablecoin, non-fungible token (NFT), or any other asset that is electronic in nature that confers economic, proprietary or access rights. The North Carolina bills don’t set market cap criteria for digital assets, unlike other crypto bills that are working their way into law at the state level. Source: Bitcoin Laws The newly created agency, dubbed the North Carolina Investment Authority, would, however, need to carefully weigh the risk and reward profile of each digital asset and ensure the funds are maintained in a secure custody solution. Bitcoin legislation tracker Bitcoin Laws noted on X that House Bill 506 wasn’t drafted as a Bitcoin reserve bill as it does not mandate the investment authority to hold Bitcoin ( BTC ) — or any digital asset — over the long term. North Carolina wants in on Bitcoin bill race On March 18, North Carolina senators introduced the Bitcoin Reserve and Investment Act (Senate Bill 327), which calls for the treasurer to allocate up to 10% of public funds specifically into Bitcoin. The bill — introduced by Republicans Todd Johnson, Brad Overcash and Timothy Moffitt — aims to leverage Bitcoin investment as a “financial innovation strategy” to strengthen North Carolina’s economic standing. Related: GameStop hints at future Bitcoin purchases following board approval The treasurer would need to ensure that the Bitcoin is stored in a multi-signature cold storage wallet , and the BTC could only be liquidated during a “severe financial crisis,” with approval from two-thirds of North Carolina’s General Assembly. The bill would also create a Bitcoin Economic Advisory Board to oversee the reserve’s management. According to Bitcoin Law, 41 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced at the state level in 23 states, and 35 of those 41 bills remain live. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, both of which will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases.

He announced that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is following the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in removing “reputational risk” as a factor in bank supervision. This change effectively rolls back the controversial Operation Chokepoint 2.0 policies, which had led to the unfair debanking of crypto companies. Sacks said that this is a big step forward for crypto. Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which was supported by figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren, used vague criteria like “reputational risk” to target crypto businesses. This meant that institutions could be punished for negative publicity, whether true or not. The new policy change will make banking criteria more objective and fair, preventing political influence from hurting the crypto sector. Sacks also credited Senator Tim Scott for his leadership in pushing these changes, especially through the Financial Institution Reform and Modernization (FIRM) Act. This move is expected to create a better environment for crypto businesses and could lead to higher prices for digital assets in the future. Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett added more context, explaining why “regulation by enforcement” doesn’t work. She explained that Ripple has spent between $150 million and $200 million in legal fees over the years, only to end up in the same position it was in when the SEC first filed the lawsuit in 2020. The SEC likely spent taxpayer dollars as well.

Despite Bitcoin’s (BTC) uncertainty, Ethereum prices today hit a daily high of No data found for ethereum on 19 minutes ago after No data found for ethereum on 19 minutes ago% move on March 26. Why is Ethereum Price Down Today? The recent consolidation in BTC has caused Ethereum’s price to pause its bullishness, which is why it’s down today. However, if BTC regains its bullish momentum and hits $90K, ETH price will also extend its gains. Regardless, investors need to be careful as technical analysis points to a potential drop in BTC toward $85K to fill the CME gap formed over the previous weekend. *Ethereum price updated as of No data found for ethereum on 19 minutes ago. Fractals Forecast Five Digit Target For ETH Based on fractal analysis posted by two crypto analysts, the target for ETH is in the five digits. The first fractal shows a target beyond $10,000 per Ethereum token. The second analysis’ target is around $20,000. The former analysis notes a “1, 2, 3 bounce pattern” in 2017, 2018, and 2020. The rally that emerged after these three bounces led to a move from $100 to $4,900. If this outlook repeats, Ethereum price could hit $10,000 to $11,000. The second fractal shows a declining broadening wedge pattern. Ethereum Price Prediction & Analysis The technical analysis of the Ethereum price on the daily time frame reveals successive higher highs and higher lows, signaling an effort from buyers to flip the bearish trend. As noted in the chart below, the key resistance levels at $2,100 and $2,166 need to be flipped into support levels to confirm the start of a bullish trend. In such a case, ETH price could attempt 20%, 28%, and 40% rallies to tag the $2,600, $2,770, and $3,000 resistance levels. So far, Ethereum has already tagged the $2,100 level and is currently retracing to find its footing. As long as this digital asset forms a higher low above $1,934, the recently formed bullish trend will remain intact. In this case, investors can expect the next leg to tag the $2,166 hurdle and the subsequent level mentioned above. ETH/USDT 1-day chart Supporting these bullish Ethereum price prediction targets are the CME gaps at $2,623, $2,888, $3,237, and $3,930. If the buying pressure remains strong coupled Bitcoin’s macro bullish outlook , the momentum will be enough to push ETH price to $4,000 in April. ETH/USDT CME 1-day chart On the other hand, if Ethereum price breaks the $2,134 low, it will suggest that the bears or selling pressure is dominant. In such a case, ETH will revisit the $1,756 key support level. A breakdown of this level will invalidate the bullish thesis and potentially crash the altcoin down to $1,500. Other Factors That Affect Ethereum’s Predictions and Analysis Spot Ethereum ETF outflows have been reducing since February 26 and hit zero on Monday. If this trend continues, ETH ETFs might see an inflow, adding to the overall positive outlook for the cryptocurrency. Roughly $701 million worth of short positions will be forced to close, aka liquidation, if the Ethereum price hits $2,114, based on CoinGlass data . A forced closing of short position means that investors are forced to buy back, which adds buying pressure to the already bullish outlook for ETH.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped 0.59% in 24 hours to $2.44. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Following this, the SEC will file a motion to lift the injunction, which Ripple will not contest. Once the judge signs off, the case will be finalized, most likely within 60 days. Talking about the XRP price, it is currently up 0.97% to $2.45. If the bullish momentum continues, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.549. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price will remain range-bound between its key support levels at $2.364 and $2.33. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.45459950 0.94% Market cap $ 142,754,871,633.46 Circulating Supply 58,158,111,605.00 Trading Volume $ 2,687,164,687.6862 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as Franklin Templeton has announced filing for an XRP ETF. Once launched, it is expected to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). The exchange inflow vs outflow graph from March 1st to March 11th shows 501k outflows in comparison to 482k inflows. This signals a spike in strong investor interest, which is a big thumbs-up for XRP. XRP Exchange Inflow vs Outflow If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the long-term XRP price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

With this, it has extended its weekly losses to 28% amid delays in mainnet launch, Binance listing, etc. and initial investor sentiment waning significantly. Investors are turning anxious about whether the Pi Coin price could stage an upside above $1 anytime soon or not. Pi Network Core Team Needs to Step Up With delays in plans of a mainnet launch, listing on Binance, or the Pi Domain auction , the Pi community members are seeking answers from the Core team, asking them to step up the game, as the Pi Coin price faces a steep fall from $3 to $0.82. Community members believe that the recent turbulence comes as the Core Team (CT) remains silent on critical updates. Furthermore, there have been allegations that the Pi core team has been drifting away from its promise of full decentralization, to now attracting big institutions. Large corporations handling billions of dollars in daily transactions naturally prioritize security and transaction speed over complete decentralization. With these opposing interests, the Pi Network core team seems to have made some compromises while trying to strike a balance between inclusivity and global adoption. Popular community member, Dr. Altcoin noted: “We should embrace this collaboration between everyday users and big institutions. High-volume trading driven by businesses is what is required to drive our utilities, and that will ultimately push the price upward. The Core Team should also remain committed to rewarding the Pi community. Without the Pi community, the Pi Network would have been just another typical memecoin story”. What Happens to Pi Coin Price Next? Despite the strong community back, the Pi Coin price has been seeing a one-directional downside all the way to $0.82. Crypto analyst Moon Jeff has issued a bold prediction regarding Pi Network’s price trajectory. According to Jeff, the token is poised to decline to $0.60, which he identifies as its last significant support level. Source: Moon Jeff Despite this, the analyst remains optimistic of the Pi Coin price recovery , suggesting that a rebound from this point could spark a rally toward the $5 mark. Dr. Altcoin also shared a similar outlook noting: “Let’s HODL and buy both Patience and Pi together while they’re still available. Let’s also not be surprised if Pi shoots up to $3.14 in the coming weeks or even to $10 in the coming months”. Recent reports also suggest a projected PI listing on the crypto exchange Upbit .

But 2025’s shaping up a little differently. A rising presale project, Remittix (RTX) , just blasted past $14 million raised, and analysts are starting to question whether the old guard can keep up. While Cardano continues to roll out updates and try to maintain relevance, Remittix is skipping the slow climb and heading straight for utility bringing swift payments, low gas fees and real-world use cases to the table. And with early growth this strong, some are wondering if we’re witnessing a major passing of the torch. Cardano (ADA): All Tech, No Hype? Cardano’s doing what Cardano always does building carefully, slowly and with a whole lot of peer review. But in 2025’s fast-paced market, that’s starting to feel like a bit of a liability. ADA is down over 2% in the past month despite a brief surge in the last 24 hours , and the much-hyped Plomin Hard Fork hasn’t made the impact many were hoping for. Some analysts still give Cardano a 1300% upside target but it’s going to need some serious firepower to hit that. On-chain stats show Cardano is largely held by long-term wallets , with low whale concentration giving it some stability. Meanwhile, projects like Remittix are flying out of presale with big promises and bigger momentum. ADA might still rise but it’s got competition. Remittix Disrupts The Status Quo In Global Payments For all the advancements in blockchain technology, using crypto for real-world payments is still far too difficult. Long withdrawal times, high conversion fees and banking restrictions have turned digital assets into a speculative investment rather than a practical financial tool. That’s where Remittix (RTX) is stepping in to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance. By offering instant crypto-to-FIAT conversion, Remittix enables users to send funds directly to any bank account worldwide, removing the delays and excessive costs that have plagued the industry for years. For Diego, a freelance software developer in Argentina, these issues meant that his USDT payments from clients overseas were stuck in processing for days before he could withdraw them in Pesos. With Remittix, he now converts and receives his funds instantly, avoiding the hassle of slow exchanges. Similarly, Sarah, an expat in Canada, used to deal with high remittance fees when sending money to her family in Nigeria. Now, with Remittix, she can send stablecoins and her family receives local currency in their bank account within hours without overpaying on transaction fees. Remittix is also changing the game for privacy. It offers a suitable alternative to highly monitored traditional systems instead of prioritizing privacy and control. When users send funds through Remittix, the recipient receives a standard bank deposit with no visible link to cryptocurrency, allowing for greater autonomy without excessive oversight. For users in countries where banking regulations are strict, this feature provides a crucial way to manage funds freely and securely. Investors Pour Into The Remittix Presale Investors are racing to get in on the Remittix presale, snapping up RTX tokens for just $0.0734 a piece. The project’s extensive value proposition has led analysts to project a steep 800% price rise before the presale’s end, with more growth expected post-launch. For any PayFi enthusiast or savvy investor looking to stay ahead of the game in 2025, this is not a project to pass up on.

Meanwhile, BlackRock launched its first Bitcoin ETP in Europe to capitalize on institutional interest with competitive pricing and regulatory clarity across the EU. On the geopolitical front, Donald Trump’s renewed trade war with China is pushing for stronger domestic Bitcoin mining, which may actually benefit US manufacturers like Auradine, especially as they roll out better mining rigs and off-grid solutions to meet rising demand and reduce reliance on Chinese tech. GameStop Turns to Crypto GameStop Corporation, which was once known primarily as a struggling video game retailer turned meme stock sensation, is making headlines yet again. This time, the company is turning heads for stepping into the world of digital assets. The company officially announced plans to invest in Bitcoin and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins, which is a major pivot in its financial strategy. According to a March 25 report by CNBC, GameStop’s board unanimously approved the initiative, which will see a portion of its corporate cash or future debt issuances allocated toward cryptocurrency holdings. This move was confirmed in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which explicitly states that GameStop’s investment policy now permits holdings in certain cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and stablecoins. As of Feb. 1, GameStop’s cash reserves stood at over $4.77 billion. This was a huge jump from $921.7 million a year before, and means that GameStop has a great foundation for its digital asset ambitions. The company also posted $1.283 billion in net sales for Q4 and $3.823 billion for fiscal 2024. GameStop's shift towards crypto is very similar to the strategic moves of companies like Strategy, whose Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has been one of Bitcoin’s most vocal corporate advocates. Speculation about GameStop’s crypto interest began in February when CEO Ryan Cohen posted a photo on social media with Saylor. This caused rumors of an imminent Bitcoin acquisition. That buzz has now materialized into concrete action. Just this week, Strategy announced another purchase of 6,911 Bitcoin, which brought its total holdings to 506,137 BTC. GameStop is now also signaling its belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Strategy controls around 2.4% of Bitcoin’s total supply, and GameStop may be looking to emulate that model as it continues its transformation from a meme-driven retail story into a modern, diversified company with a bold vision for the future. BlackRock Launches Bitcoin ETP in Europe Other companies are also expanding their business with Bitcoin. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently expanded its crypto offerings into Europe with the launch of a new Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP). The iShares Bitcoin ETP started trading on March 25 across several European stock exchanges, including Xetra, Euronext Amsterdam, and Euronext Paris. This move builds on the success of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in the United States, which attracted $50.7 billion in assets under management and currently accounts for around 2.73% of the total Bitcoin supply. Details about BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETP Despite the ETP’s strong debut, market analysts are cautious about expecting similar explosive demand in Europe. Stephen Wundke , director of strategy and revenue at crypto investment firm Algoz, stated that regulated crypto investment options have been more accessible in Europe than in the US, and Bitcoin is easier to purchase directly. He also believes that while the new ETP provides an avenue for traditional family offices to hold digital gold, the European market likely won’t see $60 billion in inflows any time soon. The ETP trades under different tickers depending on the exchange: IB1T on Xetra and Euronext Paris, and BTCN on Euronext Amsterdam. The product launched with a promotional fee waiver of 10 basis points, reducing the total expense ratio to 0.15% through the end of 2025. This makes BlackRock’s ETP one of the most competitively priced offerings on the market, especially compared to CoinShares’ Physical Bitcoin ETP that charges 0.25%. Wundke thinks that this aggressive pricing strategy is designed to limit competition and test the resolve of potential new entrants, ultimately benefiting investors and the digital asset space by pushing providers to offer better terms. This is BlackRock’s first crypto ETP launch outside of North America. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of Europe and Middle East iShares Product, described the launch as a tipping point for the industry, thanks to growing demand from both retail and institutional investors. Ajay Dhingra , head of research at Unizen, added that BlackRock’s decision reflects its confidence in the European Union’s regulatory framework for crypto assets. Unlike the United States, which has experienced policy inconsistency under different administrations, the EU has steadily pursued a regulated approach to blockchain adoption, offering the regulatory clarity that firms like BlackRock value. Trump’s Trade War Boosts US Bitcoin Miners Amid the renewed trade tensions between the United States and China, President Donald Trump’s push to strengthen domestic Bitcoin mining could greatly benefit US-based mining rig manufacturers. Although the US contributes more than 40% of the global Bitcoin hashrate, it still relies heavily on mining equipment made in China, where Bitmain dominates the market with an estimated 90% share . Industry voices, like Sanjay Gupta , chief strategy officer at Auradine, believe Trump’s focus on boosting the American Bitcoin mining industry proves the urgency of reducing dependence on foreign technology. The friction between the two nations already impacted Bitcoin firms operating in the US. Last year, thousands of mining rigs were reportedly delayed at American ports. This was allegedly due to confusion over their classification as unauthorized Chinese radio frequency devices. These supply chain issues were only exacerbated by escalating trade tensions, which Gupta said have led to growing uncertainty and delays in hardware shipments. While the US has been vying with China to gain an edge in high-end chip manufacturing, these challenges only intensified for American miners. Despite its dominance, Bitmain has begun expanding its footprint into the US to improve supply chain efficiency, and even launched a new production line in December. Auradine, meanwhile, sees an opportunity in Trump’s onshoring agenda. Gupta believes that rising domestic mining could increase pressure on the US electric grid, which means that there is a need for off-grid solutions. His company recently launched the Teraflux AH3880 hydro-cooled Bitcoin miner to compete with major players like Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan. On concerns over decentralization, Gupta believes increased US mining could benefit the Bitcoin network, provided that the growth remains aligned with sustainable and decentralized practices. Still, the growing concentration of hash power in the US and China raises some serious questions about long-term balance in the network’s security and distribution.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-26 05:59:14

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced plans to eliminate the use of “reputational risk” in bank supervision—an often-criticized factor in the debanking of crypto firms—while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) closed its investigation into Web3 gaming platform Immutable without pursuing enforcement action. FDIC Moves to Eliminate “Reputational Risk” as a Supervisory Tool in Shift Toward Crypto-Friendly Oversight The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has revealed plans to eliminate “reputational risk” as a factor in bank supervision. The shift is being heralded by digital asset advocates as a long-overdue step toward a more transparent and fair regulatory environment, especially for blockchain-based businesses long sidelined by traditional financial institutions. According to a letter dated March 24 from FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill to US Representative Dan Meuser, the agency has completed a comprehensive review of all mentions of reputational risk across its regulatory and policy frameworks. As a result, the FDIC now “plans to eradicate this concept from our regulatory approach.” “While a bank’s reputation is critically important, most activities that could threaten a bank’s reputation do so through traditional risk channels (e.g., credit risk, market risk, etc.) that supervisors already focus on,” Hill wrote, emphasizing a more objective and quantifiable framework for supervision. The letter, first reported by Politico , signals a growing recognition that reputational risk—a vague and often subjective regulatory standard—has been misused to marginalize certain industries. The Federal Reserve defines reputational risk as “the potential that negative publicity regarding an institution’s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.” Critics argue that this broad and nebulous standard has been weaponized to restrict banking access to industries that are politically or socially controversial, regardless of their actual financial or operational risk. Nowhere has the impact of reputational risk been more acutely felt than in the digital asset sector. Blockchain startups, cryptocurrency exchanges, and Web3 developers have struggled for years to obtain or maintain banking relationships, with some institutions citing reputational concerns as justification for abrupt account closures or rejections. This systemic issue gained national attention in 2023, following the collapse of several crypto-friendly banks, and the subsequent wave of what many labeled Operation Chokepoint 2.0—a reference to the Obama-era program that allegedly pressured banks to sever ties with industries deemed “high-risk,” including firearms dealers, payday lenders, and later, crypto firms. More than 30 digital asset and tech companies were reportedly debanked during this period, with no clear path to regulatory recourse. Critics argued that these decisions were not based on measurable financial risks but rather ideological or reputational judgments made behind closed doors. Acting Chairman Hill’s letter marks a notable change in tone and substance. In it, Hill acknowledges that the FDIC has been “closed for business” to institutions interested in blockchain or distributed ledger technologies. However, he also revealed that the agency is now “working on a new direction for digital asset policy” with the goal of providing a pathway for banks to safely and responsibly engage with the sector. The letter was sent in response to a February initiative from Rep. Meuser and several other lawmakers, who had urged US financial regulators to adopt clear digital asset policies and put an end to arbitrary debanking practices. Their communication included a list of recommendations for crafting digital asset rules that promote innovation while safeguarding financial stability. Hill’s response may signal that such recommendations are being taken seriously, at least at the FDIC. While it remains to be seen how other regulatory bodies—such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve—will follow suit, the move could lay the groundwork for a more inclusive regulatory environment for digital assets in the United States. Industry and Lawmaker Reactions The crypto industry has responded positively, with many seeing the move as a clear repudiation of the informal but damaging barriers that have long limited institutional engagement with Web3 technologies. The FDIC’s planned removal of reputational risk from its supervisory vocabulary does not automatically translate into regulatory clarity or guaranteed access for crypto companies. However, it eliminates a major institutional barrier and signals that the agency is willing to reevaluate the way it governs financial innovation. SEC Closes Investigation into Immutable, Signaling Major Win for Web3 Gaming Industry In other news, Ethereum layer-2 developer Immutable announced that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally ended its investigation into the company, deciding not to pursue any enforcement action. The development marks a critical turning point for the rapidly evolving GameFi space and adds momentum to a broader shift in regulatory posture toward blockchain innovators. In a statement issued on March 25, Immutable said the closure of the SEC’s inquiry effectively “closes the loop” on a Wells notice the firm received in late 2023. The Wells notice — a warning that the SEC may bring a lawsuit after believing it has uncovered violations of securities law — had sparked concern throughout the blockchain gaming world, which has long been in regulatory limbo. “We are pleased the SEC has concluded its inquiry. This marks a significant milestone for the crypto industry and gaming as we advance towards a future with regulatory clarity,” said Robbie Ferguson, president and co-founder of Immutable. An Immutable spokesperson said that the company received an unexpected termination letter from the SEC, which offered no rationale for why the agency had closed the case. The decision came without any further communication or demand for action, and appears to be based solely on the information Immutable had previously provided. Immutable was under scrutiny over a 2021 blog post describing the listing and private sale of its IMX token, including claims around pre-launch token pricing and valuation. The SEC reportedly took issue with a statement that pre-launch investors bought IMX at $0.10, issued at a ”$10 pre-100:1 split” — an assertion the SEC considered potentially misleading regarding the nature of the transaction. Immutable had previously expressed strong confidence in its compliance position, stating that there was a legitimate exchange of value and that it would “vigorously defend” itself if needed. With the investigation now closed, that defense will no longer be necessary — at least from the SEC. While the federal regulator has stepped back, Rosen Law Firm, a New York-based securities class-action specialist, has sought to use the now-defunct Wells notice as a foundation for a private lawsuit over the IMX token. Immutable’s spokesperson brushed off the potential legal challenge, saying the company is “not concerned” about it. A New Era of Regulatory Rollbacks? The SEC’s decision to halt its probe into Immutable is part of a broader pattern. Over recent months, the agency has also dropped investigations into high-profile crypto entities including OpenSea, Robinhood, Uniswap Labs, and Gemini. Many of these rollbacks have occurred under the renewed leadership direction of President Donald Trump, whose administration has taken steps to dismantle aggressive enforcement strategies that gained traction during previous years. Trump has repeatedly promised to “liberate” the crypto industry from what he characterized as stifling regulation and bureaucratic hostility. In addition to closing investigations, the SEC has scaled back or abandoned several lawsuits — most notably against Ripple Labs, Coinbase, and Kraken — which had once been seen as emblematic of the regulator’s hardline stance. The conclusion of the SEC’s investigation could be a significant confidence boost for Web3 gaming platforms and investors. For years, major AAA game studios and traditional gaming publishers have cited legal uncertainty as a key reason for staying on the sidelines of blockchain gaming. Immutable, which powers the Immutable X layer-2 network on Ethereum, has positioned itself as a pioneer in blockchain gaming infrastructure. With a strong lineup of partnerships and a growing ecosystem of Web3 game titles, the regulatory green light is likely to embolden other platforms to enter the space or scale their operations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|MX,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-26 06:00:00

According to Massad, the president’s crypto works are largely similar to pump-and-dump schemes, raising questions about Trump’s intentions and ethics. Trump launched his meme coin before taking office, and his family still has a giant stake in WLFI Trump isn’t the first president to come to office with side businesses or multiple assets. But, to preclude any conflict of interest, most former presidents, like Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, arranged to place their holdings in a blind trust. In contrast, Donald Trump handed day-to-day management to his sons but kept all his shares in his businesses during his first term. Despite facing criticism for violating traditional norms of conflict of interest, Trump did so again before taking office for his second term. This time, however, his conflicts of interest are larger than in his first term. In addition to his real estate projects, Trump has ventured into crypto. Days before being sworn in, Trump released his personal meme coin, which began to gain traction, going from less than $10 to above $75 in less than a week after launch. Additionally, by February’s start, Trump had earned nearly $100 million from token trading, despite criticism from ethics experts. However, the token has tanked in value since and is now worth just $11.37. Aside from his meme coin project, the Trump family still has a stake in World Liberty Financial, about 75% of the platform’s net revenue, and a 60% stake in the holding company. While Trump does not have any position in WLFI, his name and those of his three sons are on the whitepaper’s list of supporting teams as “Chief Crypto Advocate.” Massad believes Trump’s crypto projects may add no value to people The Trump administration has been actively involved in crypto policy development and even agreed to establish a BTC reserve and digital asset stockpile. However, crypto community members have questioned whether Trump means well for the industry or if he’s just looking for more ways to propel his projects. Some have pointed out that Trump’s crypto projects and political influence are now seemingly intertwined, presenting huge conflicts of interest. Tim Massad even commented, “I think it’s unprecedented and plainly wrong for a President of the United States to engage in commercial ventures or have his family and associates engage in commercial ventures that can be directly influenced by the policies he adopts as President or the statements he makes about those policies.” In his view, a US president should not participate in any economic ventures while in office, especially those that pose blatant conflicts of interest, given that crypto regulation is still a top priority for the administration. He added that he does not see any of Trump’s crypto businesses as valuable to people, saying that the projects “all just have a character of taking advantage of people.” Before WLFI was launched, Alex Miller, CEO of Hiro, a Web3 platform, called the project an “obvious pump scheme.” Similarly, influential figures Mark Cuban, Max Keiser, and Anthony Scaramucci pushed back against Trump’s decision to proceed with WLF’s token sales. To add to Trump’s controversial projects, TRON founder Justin Sun invested in WLFI, buying $30 million worth of WLF tokens in November, and got recruited as an advisor. Then, he invested another $45 million in the project on Trump’s inauguration. Sun’s involvement in WLFI came under heavy scrutiny, with some suggesting that his past run-ins with the SEC motivated his contributions. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The crypto asset showed upward momentum earlier in the week, briefly rallying beyond $88,000. Although the rally has slowed, the broader market remains focused on whether Bitcoin’s recent performance signals a temporary correction or a more substantial shift in trend. Market analysts have turned to on-chain metrics for additional clarity. One such analyst, Burak Kesmeci, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, recently examined four key cyclical indicators to assess whether Bitcoin’s bullish phase is losing steam. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Realized Cap and UTXO Data Signal a Major Shift—Here’s What to Watch Key Indicators Reflect Mixed Sentiment According to Kesmeci, while some metrics suggest weakness, they do not yet indicate a market top. Kesmeci’s first point highlights the Internal Funding Pressure (IFP) metric, which currently stands at 696K—below its 90-day simple moving average (SMA90) of 794K. Historically, a cross above the SMA90 tends to signal renewed bullish momentum, but for now, the metric suggests a lack of reversal strength. The second metric analyzed is the Bull & Bear Market Cycle Indicator. Kesmeci notes the current setup mirrors earlier soft bearish signals observed during this cycle. The 30-day moving average (DMA30) sits at -0.16, while the longer-term 365-day moving average (DMA365) is at 0.18. Until the shorter-term average crosses above the longer-term trend, the indicator remains tilted toward bearish sentiment. Do 4 Different Cyclical On-Chain Metrics Signal the End of Bitcoin’s Bull Market? “All of these metrics suggest that Bitcoin is experiencing significant turbulence in the short to mid-term. However, none of them indicate that Bitcoin has reached an overheated or cycle-top… pic.twitter.com/tPw74wqERy — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 25, 2025 Bitcoin MVRV and NUPL Provide Additional Clues Kesmeci also assessed the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) score, which remains below its 365-day SMA. Historically, this positioning tends to precede increased selling pressure, although a rebound is possible once the score crosses back above its moving average. The last such event occurred during the August 2024 carry trade crisis, which was resolved with a recovery after macroeconomic pressures eased. Similarly, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric sits below its SMA365. Currently, NUPL stands at 0.49, compared to a moving average of 0.53. While not a definitive end to the bullish trend, the metric’s position implies that further strength is needed for Bitcoin to regain bullish footing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom In Sight As Trump Expected To Soften Stance On Reciprocal Tariffs: Report Kesmeci concludes that these on-chain indicators collectively point to short- and mid-term uncertainty but fall short of confirming a market top. Drawing comparisons to last year’s macro-driven selloff, he suggests that external factors—such as recent economic uncertainty and tariff-related tensions—may be temporarily suppressing BTC’s performance. If macroeconomic conditions stabilize, BTC could resume its upward trajectory, mirroring the recovery seen in 2024.

The Immutable ( IMX ) token rose around 15% on March 25 to reach just under $0.74 shortly after the firm announced that the SEC shut its inquiry without any breach of violations, which Immutable said closed “the loop on the Wells notice issued by the SEC last year.” IMX matched crypto market downtrend It is the highest price that IMX has reached since March 3, before a broader market decline — driven by prolonged uncertainty over US President Donald Trump’s tariffs and US interest rates — pushed it down to $0.46 on March 11. At the time of publication, IMX had retraced back to $0.67, according to CoinMarketCap. A move back toward $0.70 would wipe approximately $449,500 in short positions, according to CoinGlass data. IMX is up 0.34% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap While the token price surged on the positive news, it barely moved when Immutable announced in November it had been issued a Wells notice. However, the broader market was already gaining momentum as Trump’s odds to win the election looked strong in the days before his eventual win on Nov. 5. Immutable co-founder Robbie Ferguson said in a March 25 X post that the SEC’s dropped investigation was “an enormous win for Web3 gaming.” “After a year of fighting, this threat to digital ownership rights has finally been put to rest,” Ferguson said.

IMX hit its all-time high of $9.32 in November 2021 during a major rally in gaming tokens. There’s been speculation about when gaming tokens will experience another significant uptrend, as they’ve historically surged after the broader crypto market moves first. However, over the past 30 days, the total market cap of gaming tokens has dropped 3.65% to $13.13 billion, while trading volume has taken a bigger hit, falling 33.45% to $1.75 billion.

Set to unfold between April 11th and June 6th, these sessions promise to delve into the most pressing issues facing the digital asset space. Are you ready to understand how these discussions could reshape the future of your crypto investments? Decoding the SEC Crypto Task Force Roundtable Schedule According to a recent update from Unfolded on X, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force is intensifying its engagement with the crypto industry. This initiative signals a proactive approach from regulators to grapple with the complexities of digital assets. The scheduled roundtables are strategically designed to cover a spectrum of critical themes. Let’s break down the key areas of focus: Regulation: The cornerstone of any established financial system. Understanding the nuances of crypto regulation is paramount for businesses and investors alike. Crypto Custody: Ensuring the safe storage and management of digital assets is non-negotiable. Crypto custody solutions are evolving rapidly, and these roundtables will likely explore best practices and potential regulatory frameworks. Tokenization: The process of representing real-world assets on a blockchain is gaining momentum. Discussions around tokenization will likely explore its potential benefits and regulatory considerations. DeFi: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is revolutionizing traditional finance. The roundtables dedicated to DeFi regulation are particularly anticipated, given the sector’s rapid growth and novel challenges. These roundtables are not just procedural; they are critical forums where industry experts, regulators, and stakeholders converge to shape the trajectory of crypto. The outcomes of these discussions could significantly influence future policies and enforcement actions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Why is Crypto Regulation a Central Theme? The spotlight on crypto regulation is no surprise. As the crypto market matures and becomes increasingly integrated into the global financial system, the need for clear and consistent rules becomes more urgent. But what exactly makes regulating crypto so challenging? Global Nature: Cryptocurrencies operate across borders, making jurisdictional enforcement complex. Technological Novelty: The underlying technology is constantly evolving, requiring regulators to stay ahead of the curve. Decentralization: The decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies challenges traditional regulatory frameworks designed for centralized entities. Investor Protection: Ensuring investor safety in a volatile and often opaque market is a primary concern for regulators. These roundtables present an opportunity to bridge the gap between innovation and regulation, fostering a framework that encourages growth while mitigating risks. The discussions around crypto regulation are expected to be robust, covering topics from security tokens to stablecoins and beyond. Crypto Custody: Securing the Digital Vault The security of digital assets hinges on robust crypto custody solutions. With high-profile hacks and thefts in the crypto space, secure custody is not just a technical challenge but also a regulatory imperative. What are the key aspects of crypto custody that these roundtables might address? Aspect Description Relevance to Regulation Security Protocols Measures to protect private keys and prevent unauthorized access. Regulatory bodies are concerned with establishing minimum security standards for custodians. Compliance Adherence to KYC/AML regulations and other legal requirements. Custodians must operate within legal frameworks, and regulations are evolving to address crypto-specific compliance needs. Insurance Coverage against loss of digital assets due to theft or other unforeseen events. Regulatory discussions may touch upon the adequacy and availability of insurance for crypto custodians. Operational Risks Risks associated with the day-to-day operations of custody services. Regulators aim to ensure operational resilience and business continuity for crypto custodians. The evolution of crypto custody is crucial for institutional adoption. Clear regulatory guidelines can foster trust and encourage larger players to enter the market, knowing their assets are safeguarded under established standards. Tokenization: Unlocking New Asset Classes Tokenization is often hailed as a game-changer, promising to democratize access to various asset classes and enhance market efficiency. By representing real-world assets like real estate, art, or commodities as digital tokens on a blockchain, tokenization offers numerous benefits. But what are the challenges and regulatory hurdles? Benefits of Tokenization: Fractional Ownership: Allows for dividing high-value assets into smaller, more affordable units. Increased Liquidity: Tokens can be traded more easily and efficiently than traditional assets. Reduced Costs: Streamlines processes and reduces intermediaries, potentially lowering transaction costs. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain technology provides a transparent and auditable record of ownership and transactions. Challenges of Tokenization: Valuation and Appraisal: Determining the value of tokenized assets can be complex. Legal Frameworks: Existing legal systems may not fully accommodate tokenized assets, requiring new legal interpretations and frameworks. Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving, creating uncertainty for issuers and investors. The SEC Crypto Task Force roundtables on tokenization are timely. They offer a platform to discuss these challenges and explore pathways for responsible innovation in this burgeoning field. Clarity on regulatory aspects will be essential to unlock the full potential of tokenization while protecting investors and maintaining market integrity. DeFi Regulation: Navigating the Decentralized Frontier Decentralized Finance (DeFi) represents a paradigm shift in financial services, operating outside the traditional centralized structures. While DeFi offers exciting possibilities for financial inclusion and innovation, its decentralized nature presents unique regulatory challenges. DeFi regulation is arguably the most complex and hotly debated topic in the crypto regulatory landscape. What are the core issues? Key Challenges in DeFi Regulation: Anonymity and Decentralization: Identifying and regulating decentralized protocols and anonymous developers is inherently difficult. Smart Contract Risks: DeFi protocols rely on smart contracts, which can be vulnerable to bugs and exploits, posing systemic risks. Cross-Border Operations: DeFi protocols often operate globally, making jurisdictional enforcement extremely challenging. Lack of Central Intermediaries: Traditional regulations often rely on intermediaries to ensure compliance, but DeFi often lacks these intermediaries. The discussions surrounding DeFi regulation at the SEC roundtables are eagerly anticipated. The challenge is to strike a balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks. Regulators are exploring various approaches, from adapting existing securities laws to developing new frameworks specifically tailored for DeFi. The outcomes of these discussions will significantly shape the future of DeFi and its integration with the broader financial system. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Stakeholders Do? These SEC Crypto Task Force roundtables are more than just meetings; they are signals of intent and direction. For anyone involved in the cryptocurrency space – investors, developers, businesses – staying informed and proactive is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow news and updates related to the roundtables. Organizations like Unfolded and crypto news outlets will provide coverage and analysis. Engage with Industry Discussions: Participate in online forums, webinars, and industry events to understand the evolving regulatory landscape. Assess Regulatory Risks: Evaluate how potential regulatory changes might impact your crypto investments or business operations. Prepare for Compliance: Begin to consider how you might adapt to stricter regulatory requirements, particularly in areas like KYC/AML and custody. Advocate for Balanced Regulation: Engage with industry associations and participate in consultations to advocate for regulations that foster innovation while protecting consumers. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto’s Future The SEC Crypto Task Force roundtables represent a significant moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The discussions around crypto regulation, crypto custody, tokenization, and DeFi regulation will undoubtedly influence the direction of policy and enforcement for years to come. By bringing together diverse perspectives and expertise, these roundtables have the potential to forge a path towards a more regulated, yet still innovative, crypto ecosystem. The coming months will be crucial in observing how these discussions translate into concrete actions and shape the future of digital assets.

Opportunities for profit—or potential losses—appear and disappear within minutes. Monitoring such a dynamic environment manually requires enormous human resources, and emotional pressure caused by fear or greed often leads to erroneous decisions. In situations where humans cannot respond promptly to every change, there is a need for an assistant that works 24/7, analyzes vast amounts of real-time data, learns from past events, and makes decisions faster and more accurately. AI agents in cryptocurrency trading serve precisely this function. AI agents are specialized software programs that use artificial intelligence algorithms to solve tasks related to cryptocurrency trading, market analysis, and risk management. Unlike traditional trading bots that operate on rigidly defined algorithms, AI Post’s in-depth analysis highlights that AI agents adapt to changing market conditions by learning from data obtained from the internet and social networks, such as X (Twitter). This adaptability makes them particularly effective in a volatile market, where every second counts. The main advantage of AI agents is their independence from human emotions. They do not experience panic during market downturns or greed during peaks, allowing them to act purely based on objective data. Their ability to operate continuously without breaks and improve through machine learning enables them to respond to any changes, even when the market operates 24/7. According to CoinGecko, by March 2025, the market capitalization of tokens associated with AI agents had reached $ 4.5 billion. Projects in the meme coin segment, such as Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), Ai16z, AIXBT, and Virtual Protocol, where the aggregate value of individual tokens exceeded $1 billion during peak times, played a particularly notable role. In this space, artificial intelligence is used not only for trading but also for generating memes, writing posts on X, and increasing audience engagement, which creates additional virality and boosts interest in assets. However, the significance of AI agents extends beyond meme coins, assisting regular traders with analytics and automation: perform several key tasks, helping traders cope with constantly changing conditions. They can be broadly divided into three main categories: 1. Trading Agents: Automate the buying and selling of assets, executing trades when prices reach predetermined levels. For example, AI agents on Binance processed over 1.2 million trades daily in 2024, per Binance Research. Use arbitrage strategies between exchanges to profit from price discrepancies. Respond to price swings in under 0.5 seconds, critical in a market where opportunities vanish within minutes. 2. Analytical Agents: Process vast amounts of data, including historical prices, trading volumes, and news from social networks. Analyze correlations between mentions on X and price changes, as demonstrated by Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), whose price increased by 161% within a week in November 2024 before falling by 27.1%. Predict market trends based on statistical models and real-time pattern recognition. 3. Risk Management Agents: Minimize losses by setting dynamic stop-loss orders, reducing portfolio drawdowns by an average of 15% during crashes. Activate protective measures during sharp market crashes to mitigate potential losses. Maintain control over situations even during extreme fluctuations, helping traders remain secure. The advent of AI into cryptocurrency trading has enabled new opportunities but at the same time many challenges too. AI systems are capable of consuming global market data in real-time and execute complex algorithmic strategies but their effectiveness is often disrupted by market turbulence, security breaches, regulatory ambiguity and potential overuse. In the shifting crypto-trading terrain, here are the top five major AI agent-based obstacles. Market Volatility and Its Impact on AI Agents AI Post has identified that the most challenging hurdle faced by AI driven trading systems is the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrency prices can surge or drop within a seconds (not to mention more unpredictable dynamics driven by social media discussions, macroeconomic phenomenon or regulatory decisions). And examples such as the $VIRTUAL seesaw illustrate how fast and unpredictable fluctuations can spoil the relatively obedient world where an even-keel AI model processes information. While AI shines at sifting through historical patterns of trading and real time data, sudden, strange market movements are disruptive to its analytical functions. But if an AI agent does not adapt fast enough with changes in context, the execution loses efficacy and results in massive financial losses for the portfolio. The market can sometimes move faster than AI can adjust, and perhaps training these systems better for extreme market turbulence is critical. Cybersecurity Risks in AI-Driven Trading More AI adoption increases cybersecurity risks. Hackers increasingly target automated trading systems, exploiting algorithmic vulnerabilities. The breach of an AI-driven exchange in 2024 led to $87 million of asset theft; AI can be tricked into bad decisions by bad actors who manipulate market data, using techniques like spoofs costing traders ~$150m/year. These systems need to be protected — robust defenses such as AI-driven anomaly detection (34% fewer breaches). Algorithmic Transparency and Accountability Issues Perhaps the biggest issue so far as adoption of AI in crypto trading is concerned is the black box of decision making, in a way one is governed by an untraceable algorithm. Most AI models are like black boxes, the logic and train of reasoning is completely opaque to human traders. Liability of an AI agent: Without transparency, this makes it difficult to ask the right question — Who is responsible for an AI agent when it makes a mistake or when they act rashly and trade on merriment? The trader? The AI developer? The algorithm. Algorithmic transparency is crucial for the sake of fairness and ethics of trading, especially from the end of institutional investors and regulators. Market participants might find themselves in trouble without audit trail of the AI-driven decision-making. For the Wide Acceptance of AI models in financial markets, we need to build interpretable AI models that have the same predictability as the traditional statistical models. Regulatory Uncertainty and Legal Complexities The lack of a legal structure for AI trading cryptocurrency negatively affects an additional layer. While US regulators have taken a cautious approach to digital assets (SEC and CFTC among others), AI-driven trading strategies are in effect mostly unregulated. The European Union has taken steps towards regulating AI governance by the AI Act, however, the full potential that it is going to have on crypto markets is not known yet. This muddy regulatory landscape is a perfect storm for businesses and investors who are in the gray zone of legality. When the AI agents take trading decisions which are never intended to infringe financial regulations, compliance problems may pop-up. If firms are deliberately using AI in trading, they will be open to legal action, penalties, or forced to shut down the operations. As the AI technology matures, regulators will also need to draw lines on its place in finance without cutting off innovation. The Risks of Over-Reliance on AI Agents AI may make actionable to improve the relevancy execution in trading but going overboard on reliance of automation can be dangerous too. Beginners who rely entirely on AI for trade decisions without oversight risk financial ruin. AI is powerful, but it struggles to interpret unrecognized signals or detect subtle market tipping points While AI drives how accurately a machine can predict, just as in the olden days, there are going to be things AI misses because it learns linear patterns in an unpredictable market. But when traders hand off decision-making entirely to AI, they swing wide open for catastrophic losses if the algorithm breaks. So, for now, dialing just the right step and using AI to amplify our trading strategy but not shock it in crypto, is the way to go. Conclusion AI Post’s research confirms that the future of the cryptocurrency market lies in deeper integration of AI agents. They already have the capability to automate processes in decentralized finance (DeFi), including lending and liquidity management, as well as creating decentralized networks to enhance transparency. Personalized assistants based on artificial intelligence will simplify trading for beginners, lower entry barriers, and improve overall operational efficiency. Nevertheless, the future evolution of these technologies is hampered by security issues, ethical implications and lack of a generally agreed upon legal framework. AI-powered agents have revolutionized cryptocurrency trading with their unmatched speed and enhanced market analysis. They protect traders from emotional mistakes, timely respond to the market and can use the short-term price swings. However, managing volatility, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory uncertainty requires long-term planning and technological advancements. As AI agents sound like a very natural extension of the crypto economy into sustainable development and innovation in digital assets, if only integrated correctly and aided by changing regulations. Thus, the modern cryptocurrency market, where every second matters, demands solutions that operate continuously and without emotions. AI agents have already proven their effectiveness and continue to evolve, opening new horizons for trading, analytics, and risk management. With a thoughtful approach and further technological improvements, they have the potential to ensure stability and transparency even under extreme volatility, AI agents must balance cutting-edge innovation with sound judgment to ensure sustainable growth in the crypto market.

42356992,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143331,1742969759,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Bitcoin Wallet Revelation: Fidelity Exec Exposes S-Curve Stagnation!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-wallet-s-curve-stagnation/,"Is Bitcoin adoption hitting a snag? While the crypto market buzzes with excitement and prices fluctuate wildly, a surprising observation from a Fidelity executive has sparked a crucial conversation. Jurrien Timmer, a respected voice in global macro strategy at Fidelity Investments, recently pointed out a fascinating anomaly: the number of Bitcoin wallets has barely budged in the last year. This revelation has left many wondering – what does this mean for Bitcoin’s growth trajectory and the widely accepted S-Curve model? Decoding the Bitcoin Wallet Mystery: Why Aren’t They Growing? Timmer’s statement, shared on X (formerly Twitter), isn’t just a random observation; it’s a potential indicator of a shift in how Bitcoin is being adopted and held. He suggests that the stagnation in Bitcoin wallets isn’t necessarily a sign of waning interest. Instead, it might reflect the increasing dominance of large institutional players in the Bitcoin market. Think about it – firms like MicroStrategy (MSTR), known for their massive Bitcoin treasuries, and the issuers of the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs. These entities don’t need millions of individual wallets. They operate with a few, highly secure, and substantial wallets to manage their holdings. To illustrate this point, consider the typical user versus an institution: User Type Typical Wallet Needs Impact on Wallet Growth Metrics Individual Retail Investor Multiple wallets for various purposes (trading, savings, privacy) Contributes significantly to overall wallet growth numbers Institutional Investor (e.g., ETF issuer, Treasury Firm) Few, large, highly secure wallets for managing vast holdings Minimal impact on overall wallet growth metrics despite large Bitcoin holdings This shift towards institutional holding could explain why, despite increasing institutional interest and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, the raw number of Bitcoin wallets isn’t reflecting the same growth trajectory we might have expected. The S-Curve Model and Bitcoin: A Love Story or a Fading Romance? For years, the S-Curve model has been a popular framework for understanding and projecting the growth of Bitcoin. This model, commonly used to describe the adoption lifecycle of new technologies, posits that growth starts slowly, then accelerates rapidly before eventually plateauing as saturation is reached. Think of the adoption of smartphones or the internet – they followed a similar S-shaped curve. Timmer himself has previously highlighted Bitcoin’s adherence to the S-Curve model . The core idea is simple: as more people join the Bitcoin network, its value increases. This “network effect” is a powerful driver of growth. More participants mean increased utility, security, and ultimately, demand, pushing the price higher. However, Timmer’s recent observation about stagnant wallet growth throws a curveball into this seemingly straightforward narrative. Understanding the Bitcoin S-Curve in Detail Let’s break down the S-Curve model in the context of Bitcoin: Early Adoption (Slow Growth): In the initial years of Bitcoin, adoption was slow, primarily driven by cypherpunks, tech enthusiasts, and early believers. Wallet growth was modest. Rapid Growth (Steep Ascent): As Bitcoin gained mainstream attention, fueled by price surges and increasing awareness, adoption accelerated dramatically. This period saw a significant increase in the number of Bitcoin wallets and users. Maturity/Plateau (Slowing Growth): According to the traditional S-Curve, as Bitcoin matures and reaches wider adoption, the rate of new user growth is expected to slow down. This is where Timmer’s observation becomes particularly relevant. Is the stagnation in wallet growth a sign of Bitcoin entering this maturity phase faster than anticipated? Is the S-Curve Model Still Relevant for Bitcoin Adoption? Timmer raises a critical question: will the S-Curve model remain a reliable tool for tracking Bitcoin’s future trajectory? His analysis suggests that relying solely on wallet growth as an indicator of adoption might become increasingly misleading. The influx of institutional capital and the concentration of Bitcoin holdings in fewer, larger wallets are changing the dynamics of the network. Here are some key points to consider regarding the S-Curve and Bitcoin’s future: Shifting Metrics: Wallet count might be becoming a less accurate metric for measuring Bitcoin adoption. Perhaps metrics like transaction volume, on-chain activity, or the total value locked in Bitcoin are becoming more relevant indicators. Institutional Impact: Institutional adoption, while bullish for Bitcoin’s price and legitimacy, can skew traditional adoption metrics like wallet growth. Large institutions operate differently from retail users. Network Evolution: Bitcoin’s network is constantly evolving. Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which facilitate faster and cheaper transactions, might also influence wallet usage patterns and how we measure adoption. Fidelity Investments’ Perspective: A Nuanced View on Bitcoin’s Future Fidelity Investments , a major player in the traditional financial world, has been increasingly embracing Bitcoin and the broader crypto space. Their perspective, as articulated by Jurrien Timmer, offers a valuable nuanced view. It’s not about dismissing the S-Curve model entirely but rather recognizing its limitations in a rapidly evolving landscape. Fidelity’s involvement in Bitcoin, including their application for a spot Bitcoin ETF, signals their belief in the long-term potential of this asset class. However, Timmer’s analysis serves as a reminder that the path to mainstream Bitcoin adoption is not always linear and predictable. We need to adapt our understanding and metrics as the ecosystem matures. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what are the takeaways from this shocking Bitcoin wallet revelation and the evolving relevance of the S-Curve model? Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Metrics: Don’t solely rely on wallet growth to gauge Bitcoin adoption. Look at a broader range of indicators, including transaction volume, active addresses, institutional flows, and regulatory developments. Understand Institutional Impact: Pay attention to the role of institutions in the Bitcoin market. Their actions and holdings significantly influence market dynamics and adoption patterns. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The crypto space is constantly changing. Stay updated on the latest trends, analyses, and perspectives from reputable sources like Fidelity Investments to make informed decisions. Long-Term Vision: Despite short-term fluctuations and evolving metrics, maintain a long-term perspective on Bitcoin’s potential. Technological adoption curves are rarely perfectly smooth, and periods of apparent stagnation can be followed by renewed growth. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Bitcoin Narrative Jurrien Timmer’s observation about stagnant Bitcoin wallets is not a cause for alarm but rather a crucial piece of the puzzle in understanding Bitcoin’s evolving narrative. It highlights the increasing influence of institutional investors and the need to refine our metrics for measuring adoption. The S-Curve model, while still relevant in principle, may require adjustments and supplementary indicators to accurately reflect Bitcoin’s unique growth trajectory in this new era of institutional involvement. As Bitcoin continues to mature and integrate into the global financial system, expect more such insightful observations that challenge conventional wisdom and deepen our understanding of this revolutionary asset. The journey of Bitcoin adoption is far from over, and navigating its complexities requires a keen eye, adaptable strategies, and a willingness to look beyond simple metrics.

These sentiments have intensified as the House of Doge (under the Dogecoin Foundation) launched the official Dogecoin Reserve with 10 million DOGE worth around $1.8 million. This is expected to speed up transactions and boost payment efficiency. Besides, the foundation is also in talks with the US government to accept DOGE for parking fees, utilities, and even major sporting events. These developments and the easing market dynamics have kept the DOGE price up by over 10% since the start of the week. This has not only made the market participants bullish on Dogecoin, but also has induced significant confidence among the whales. As a result, they have begun to accumulate DOGE heavily, fluttering bullish flags across the markets. As Santiment data shared by a known analyst, Ali , the wallets holding DOGE tokens between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 have accumulated over 200 million tokens in the past two weeks. This can be considered a rise in the confidence among the investors regardless of the rising volatility. Hence, this suggests the DOGE price is preparing for a strong bullish action that could elevate the levels above the bearish range. The weekly chart of DOGE price suggests the price has completed a decent retracement and hence could soon begin its journey back to the resistance. The DOGE price faced a rejection from $0.48, earlier this year and hence, the latest trade dynamics suggest the bulls are gearing up to push the price beyond the range. The weekly MACD displays a drop in the selling pressure, which may further lead towards a bullish crossover. On the other hand, the DMI is also attempting a bullish crossover that could validate a flip from the bearish trend. Meanwhile, the ADX is plunging, hinting towards a drop in the strength of the rally, which could slow down the progress of the rally. Therefore, the Dogecoin price has come under the bullish influence but a bullish confirmation could only push the token towards the upper range. This could happen when the DOGE rises and secures above $0.22 before the end of Q1. Once done, the price may not only rise above the yearly highs, but also mark a new ATH close to $1, later this year.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-26 06:16:43

LTHs are adding to their positions, with the 30-day accumulation rate near 6%—a noticeable shift in what seems like a now-getting-clearer picture of sentiment. And what’s even more interesting about the current state of Bitcoin’s LTHs is that their daily accumulation rate seems almost robust. Since February, the daily accumulation pace has been averaging around 7%. For long-term holders, this signals something almost like an insatiable appetite for Bitcoin. #Bitcoin Long-Term Holders have been in steady accumulation since Feb 23. The 30D accumulation rate is now near 6% – and the rate of this change is growing as well. Since late February, it has exhibited a daily increase averaging ~7%. pic.twitter.com/eeRD4FEFUC — glassnode (@glassnode) March 24, 2025 At the same time, the proportion of Bitcoin supply in the hands of long-term holders versus short-term holders is undergoing a sizable shift. This measure, which not long ago hit a trough in early February, has been climbing steadily since then. As of March 14, it’s been ascending even faster, at a compounded 0.42% per day on average. If those holds keep holding, this ratio is on pace to touch its 2025 target of 5.53 once again. That would be a nice rebound from its current level of 3.53 and continue to highlight what a long-term tuned-in audience Bitcoin now has. U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Significant Inflows The increased interest in Bitcoin is not just from individual investors, as increased optimism extends to institutional investors as well. U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have experienced net inflows of a not-so-subtle amount over the past week. For context, on March 24, Bitcoin ETFs saw a net inflow of $84.17 million, which represented the seventh consecutive day of actual inflows. And what these flows are saying at an asset level is that there is an increasing confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class, with institutional investors leading the way. On March 24, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow of $84.17 million, marking seven consecutive days of net inflows. The ETF with the largest single-day net inflow was Fidelity's Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), which saw an inflow of $82.85 million on the day. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 25, 2025 The most substantial net inflow received in a single day came from Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), which pulled in $82.85 million just on March 24. Fidelity has established a well-deserved reputation for being a significant institutional player in the adoption of Bitcoin. It is hard to imagine how we could fare better with an ETF on Bitcoin than with one from a company such as Fidelity, which oversees an ETF on Bitcoin that is not attracting much interest. The sequence of reassuring inflows indicates that Bitcoin is being warmly welcomed and not just tentatively embraced by the new category of institutional investor. We seem to be partaking of a Bitcoin oasis here, with no mirage in sight, unlike what we saw, for example, in early 2018 when we came off a similarly optimistic spell. Longer-term holders, presumably the same kind of people or organizations who were holding in 2018, are still holding; in fact, they’re accumulating in their currently unreported vaults. The only reported accumulators appear to be the new cohort of ETF buyers. Growing Confidence Among Bitcoin’s Long-Term Holders Data regarding Bitcoin’s long-term holders reflect a much larger trend in the market. This trend shows that long-term holders are not only sticking around but also seem to be in accumulation mode. The long-term holders of Bitcoin—those who purchase it with a multiyear time horizon—have been largely unfazed by the price ups and downs that affect the much-hated short-term market. Maybe the long-term holders know something we don’t. Bitcoin’s holders of long duration have been steadily adding to their positions since February 23, and this signals that they are not being swayed by short-term volatility. Accumulation for them is, of course, not just a matter of increasing the quantity of Bitcoin that they hold; it is also a sign of confidence in the notion that this asset has a long-term path of appreciation ahead. In terms of the current market dynamics, these long-term holders see this moment in time as an opportunity to add to their holdings at price points that are comparatively lower than the peaks endured in that ill-fated year of 2021. The metric of long-term holder accumulation is very important to watch. It is very telling of the current market sentiment. When accumulation is flat or decreasing, it shows that the holders are not confident enough in the current market to continue buying. Conversely, when accumulation is happening at a nice rate (like it is right now), it shows that there is a decent amount of confidence in the market. What’s more is that now, at this very moment, we have the accumulation rate increasing at about 7% per day. That is quite significant. Implications for the Bitcoin Market Examining the larger Bitcoin market, what seems to be emerging is a clear overall optimism. The picture painted by Bitcoin’s long-term holders and by the recent inflows of institutional capital is one of a Bitcoin that continues to be very much in demand. HODLing, as we all know, has historically been a stabilizing—and even price-supporting—force in the Bitcoin market. Meanwhile, the latest influx of capital via Bitcoin ETFs is another vote of confidence in Bitcoin as a meaningful part of the modern investor’s toolkit. As the long-term holder accumulation rate rises and institutional interest grows, Bitcoin’s market dynamics may well be shifting in favor of these holders. If this trend continues, the long-term holder accumulation rate could very well be playing a role, perhaps a more significant role than heretofore assigned, in the reduction of Bitcoin price volatility, in the provision of Bitcoin price support in downturn markets. The increase in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows suggests that substantial institutions see Bitcoin as more than just a speculative asset. They view it, in at least some dimensions, as a store of value—”like digital gold,” some have said. This only reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is now firmly a part of the traditional financial landscape. Considering these factors, the future of Bitcoin looks bright, and the present-day accumulation by a diverse group of long-term holders, including a number of institutions, serves as a not-so-subtle signal to the rest of the market that a more favorable environment for Bitcoin might be on the horizon. If this environment continues to develop, Bitcoin could be set up for some significant price appreciations. To conclude, the mounting rate of accumulation by long-term Bitcoin holders, together with the consistent inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, shows that both institutional and retail investors are remaining positive on the digital asset. The combination of these two groups continuing to invest in Bitcoin—plus the accelerating pace of this accumulation—undoubtedly sets up an increasingly bullish chart for the cryptocurrency.

Don’t Sleep on BTFD—The Best New Meme Coin with 100x Potential and 100% Bonus Until March 30!,https://thecoinrise.com/you-were-late-to-toshi-dont-sleep-on-btfd-the-best-new-meme-coin-with-100x-potential-and-100-bonus-until-march-30/,"Ever wondered what it feels like to turn a small crypto investment into a life-altering jackpot? Regret missing out on TOSHI when it was practically free? Well, here’s your second shot with the best new meme coin with 100x potential—except this time, the window’s closing faster than you think. While early TOSHI buyers are basking in their gains, a new name is dominating crypto circles: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . The presale has already raked in over $6.41 million, with more than 71 billion coins snatched up by over 11,500 holders. Stage 15 is now unlocked, and it might just be the last dip before the rocket takes off. BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the meme coin wave—it’s redefining the whole category with killer features like its Play-to-Earn game, an active 90% APY staking model, and the much-hyped Bulls Squad. But right now, what’s setting crypto Twitter on fire is its Referral Program and 100% Bonus Offer. Yup, if you enter LAUNCH100 during checkout before March 30, you’ll get double the coins. That means for every $1, you get $2 worth of $BTFD tokens. If you’re tired of market volatility and bearish hiccups, a meme coin presale like this is your haven. BTFD Coin: The Best New Meme Coin with 100x Potential It’s not often you get a clean slate in crypto, but BTFD is handing you one with a gold-plated opportunity. This Ethereum-based meme coin isn’t just another “degen gamble”—it’s got teeth, thanks to its gamified ecosystem, juicy 90% staking rewards, and an ultra-engaged community that calls itself the Bulls Squad. And let’s not forget the fully live Play-to-Earn game launched on January 1, 2025, letting users earn while having fun. But here’s where things go from interesting to can’t-miss: BTFD is running one of the most rewarding referral programs in the space. Share your custom code, and you’re in line to earn 10% of purchases made through your link—if you’re in the top 20 referrers by the end of the month. Your referrals also get 10% extra tokens when they buy $50 or more. It’s a win-win, with the best new meme coin with 100x potential ; Bulls-style. And this presale isn’t some “meh” early bird discount. It’s rocket fuel. With the coin priced at $0.0002 in Stage 15 and just one more stage left before its $0.0006 presale close, anyone jumping in now can ride a 200% ROI at launch. But here’s the real kicker: if analysts’ projections hit and $BTFD reaches its expected moonshot of $0.006, early investors could walk away with 2900% ROI. That’s 29x your bag—just for showing up early. Say you throw in $2000 right now at $0.0002 per coin. You’ll get 10 million coins. But apply the LAUNCH100 bonus code and suddenly you’re holding 20 million tokens. If $BTFD hits its predicted $0.006 mark, your stash could be worth $120,000. That’s not a typo. That’s what FOMO looks like when it pays off. This ain’t your average promo—this is a fire sale with rocket fuel. BTFD’s 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100) is giving you double the coins if you buy during Stage 15. Enter the code in ALL CAPS before March 30 and watch your bag double instantly. Want to claim it? Here’s how: Go to the BTFD Presale , connect your wallet, find the bonus field, slap in LAUNCH100, hit “Apply,” enter your amount, and click “Buy Now.” Done. You’re now holding double the tokens you paid for. Simple as that. No delays, no regrets. Just Bulls charging toward the moon. BTFD or get left behind. Toshi (TOSHI): The One That You Missed Initially Let’s rewind to early 2023, when TOSHI—a meme coin named after Satoshi Nakamoto—launched at fractions of a cent. Back then, you could scoop up TOSHI for around $0.000147 on average, and hardly anyone was paying attention. Fast forward to 2025, and TOSHI is trading at approximately $0.000339, with a market cap hovering near $138 million. That’s still a solid 130% gain for the early birds who saw the potential before the rest of the market caught on. The coin gained traction through a strong narrative rooted in the mystery of Satoshi and an active, loyal community—and it worked. But here’s the painful truth: Most folks who saw TOSHI under $0.0002 back then shrugged it off. “Too new.” “Too risky.” “Too meme-y.” They stayed on the sidelines while early believers banked serious returns. Now, with the market heating up again and fresh momentum building, the chance to find another TOSHI-like moonshot is slim—but not impossible. BTFD is shaping up to be that second chance. Unlike TOSHI’s retroactive hype, BTFD is actively building momentum with real products, daily wallet growth, and a presale that’s closing in on its final stage. And remember, presales don’t feel market tremors. While coins like TOSHI are swaying with the latest macro headlines, BTFD is protected from the outside noise—at least until it launches. So yeah, you might’ve missed TOSHI. But don’t let that regret define your next move. Final Thoughts: Blink and You’ll Miss It Here’s a fun stat to chew on: Most life-changing crypto wins happen when nobody’s paying attention. The big bags are always packed during presales, not after the launch. Right now, BTFD Coin is holding the door open, and all you’ve got to do is walk through. With Stage 15 currently live, the price sits at $0.0002, and once Stage 16 hits, it’s game over for this sweet deal. The best new meme coin with 100x potential is right in front of you. Invest now, use the LAUNCH100 code, double your stash, and maybe—just maybe—watch that $2K turn into $120K by the time $BTFD hits $0.006. Crypto history’s got a funny way of repeating itself. This time, make sure you’re on the right side of it. Join before the BTFD Coin presale rockets into its final stage.

BTFD Coin is currently priced at $0.0002 in Stage 15 of the presale. How do I claim the LAUNCH100 bonus code for 100% extra tokens? Visit btfd.io , connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in the bonus code field in ALL CAPS, apply it, then confirm your purchase. What’s the benefit of buying during the presale? Presales protect you from market volatility and offer the best prices before launch. With BTFD, early buyers also get up to 2900% ROI potential. How does the BTFD referral program work? Share your unique referral code. If someone buys $50+ with your code, they get 10% more tokens, and you can earn 10% of their purchase if you’re in the top 20. Is there still time to invest in BTFD Coin before it launches? Yes, but not much. Stage 15 is live, and Stage 16 is the last. Once it’s done, presale prices are gone forever.

The market is consolidating, with technical indicators signaling an imminent move in either direction. Daily Chart Overview On the daily chart, XRP continues to show bullish momentum, with strong support at $2.40. Resistance at $2.50 remains a key hurdle—if surpassed, the price could rally toward $2.70. However, failure to break through may trigger a pullback to $2.35 or lower. Buyers need to sustain momentum to avoid a potential reversal. 1-Hour Chart Insights Short-term analysis indicates that XRP is trading in a tight range, with resistance at $2.48 and support at $2.43. A break above $2.48, supported by strong volume, could push the price to $2.55 in the short term. However, a drop below $2.43 could invite further selling pressure, potentially testing the $2.40 level. Market Sentiment and External Factors XRP’s outlook remains positive due to increasing adoption and Ripple’s legal progress. Japan’s Open House Group recently started accepting XRP for property transactions, boosting confidence in its real-world utility.

This latest all-time high spotlights Ethereum’s enlarging presence in the burgeoning marketplace for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that aims to keep its value pegged to more traditional assets like the U.S. dollar. The upswing in stablecoin supply speaks to the upswing in activities of all kinds taking place on the Ethereum network. Total stablecoin supply on Ethereum just hit a new all-time high, passing $125b for the first time. Stablecoin supply on Ethereum is up $321m in the past day, $1.407b in the past week, and $2.786b in the past month. pic.twitter.com/NcrkAR7ziO — DefiLlama.com (@DefiLlama) March 25, 2025 Ethereum’s Stablecoin Market Surges The supply of stablecoins on Ethereum is growing quickly, and the overall trend is steering more and more stablecoin assets into the Ethereum ecosystem. Over the past 24 hours, the stablecoin supply on Ethereum has increased by $321 million. This equates to an average of a little over $13 million an hour. If you expand out the timescale to a week, you’re looking at an increase of $1.407 billion over the course of just seven days. The trend is similarly positive if you look at the month-long timescale; the current supply is up by $2.786 billion since the start of October. This expansion underscores Ethereum’s sustained supremacy as the primary platform for not just the issuance of stablecoins but also their use. Stablecoins have become a prime vehicle for a range of DeFi activities, and these activities are largely occurring on loans, borrows, and stablecoin trading are mainly occurring on Ethereum’s blockchain. The expansion in stablecoin supply signals not just the demand for stablecoins but also the demand for stablecoin The total net inflow for spot Ethereum ETFs was zero, with none of the nine spot Ethereum ETFs recording any net inflows or outflows. — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 25, 2025 Ethereum can accommodate a massive supply of stablecoins, which positions it as an essential player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi). Stablecoins are integrated into all sorts of financial operations; now, institutions along with temporary and permanent users of the cryptocurrency system are integrating them into their operations too. All these actions are resulting in even more Ether being locked up. The rapid increase in stablecoin supply is a sign of the overall growth in the world of cryptocurrency, as stablecoins are often used as a means to park funds during times of market downturns or to achieve certain kinds of payment that are more easily done with a stable medium of exchange. In this way, stablecoins are the emerging infrastructure of the global cryptocurrency markets. Spot Ethereum ETFs Show No Movement Although the stablecoin market has been a bright spot for Ethereum, the opposite is the case for the Ethereum ETF market. On March 24, the total net inflow for spot Ethereum ETFs was a goose egg; that’s right, zero. That means that there were no net inflows or outflows to speak of across the nine different spot Ethereum ETFs currently in operation. This was a true ETF market fiasco that didn’t even have the privilege of being called a market when you have the reigning champ of “no net movement” as the number currently being touted. Regardless of the continued growth of Ethereum-based stablecoins, the current stagnation within the spot Ethereum ETF market seems to be a real issue. Movement that is absent in spot Ethereum ETFs may reflect a few different conditions of the market. The ETF may be a vehicle for a cautious investor. Or perhaps the ETF and Ethereum itself are just caught up in broader trends that are impacting asset prices across the board. Another possibility—the one that seems most probable in light of recent events—is that the ETF just isn’t attracting much interest right now. The stagnation in the spot Ethereum ETF market—they’re not taking orders—runs counter to the growing usage of Ethereum in decentralized finance and its importance in the crypto ecosystem. The principal supply of stablecoins to the Ethereum blockchain presumably isn’t flat, so Ethereum is obviously seeing an influx sufficient to keep it in the decentralized finance game. This could mean that institutional interest will revive once the broader market stabilizes. A Bright Future for Ethereum Stablecoins Even while the spot ETF market remains quiet for Ethereum, the amount of stablecoins on the Ethereum blockchain is rising. There is now around $21 billion in stablecoins issued on Ethereum, an increase of about a third from a year ago, according to new data from two analytical firms. Despite the lull in the not-so-promising spot ETs market, the surge in stablecoins affirms that the digital economy is very much alive on Ethereum. Stablecoins are key to the DeFi and blockchain growth story, and Ethereum is just the right type of infrastructure to support them and their development. The fact that the stablecoin market grows steadily signals that Ethereum’s adoption is far from slowing down. More and more, as institutions and users see the benefits of stablecoins, they’re choosing Ethereum as the leading platform for these assets. Stablecoin dominance from Ethereum may also portend a future for digital currency that’s more like the present than many enthusiasts would like to admit. As more stablecoins are issued on the Ethereum platform—a refinement of what some purveyors, such as Circle, have called a “fully on-chain” stablecoin—it will become a kind of digital ATM at which the devices of the real economy can cash in for digital dollars, euros, or yen. This scenario presumes the “efficiency” of the Ethereum network in its current form. The implication is that crypto bad actors are less likely to be brought to justice if the issuing bank is on an unregulated side of the crypto divide. Looking Ahead To sum up, although the Ethereum spot ETF market has not experienced the same level of activity as the stablecoin sector, the ongoing growth in stablecoin supply on Ethereum illustrates the blockchain’s prominence in the increasingly digital economy. Reaching the mark of $125 billion is a significant milestone, and as Ethereum continually supports both stablecoins and DeFi applications, it is likely to remain at the heart of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Moreover, with stablecoins such as USDC and DAI playing prominent roles in the Ethereum economy, the future of Ethereum in the broader financial system looks bright and increasingly probable.

One of the largest asset managers in the world, Fidelity Investments , appears to be quietly piloting its own stablecoin as it expands further into digital assets. According to a Financial Times report , which cites two sources close to the matter, the $5 trillion fund giant is in the advanced stages of testing a token that would function as cash in cryptocurrency markets. While details remain unknown, the stablecoin is said to be managed through Fidelity’s digital assets arm. It remains unclear whether Fidelity intends to make its stablecoin available to retail traders in the same open manner as the two largest stablecoin issuers, Tether and Circle, or if access will be limited to institutional investors only.

After a unanimous approval from its board of directors, GameStop confirmed it will allocate a portion of its corporate cash, and potentially future debt issuances, toward acquiring digital assets like Bitcoin, a March 25 CNBC report claimed. The strategy was outlined in GameStop’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which noted the company’s updated investment policy now permits holding certain cryptocurrency assets. The report explicitly named Bitcoin and stablecoins as part of its new treasury approach. “The Company’s investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including Bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the Company acquires Bitcoin or U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, the Company will be exposed to certain risks associated with Bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively.” GameStop Q4 and fiscal year 2024 Results GameStop (GME) stock initially spiked over 6% in after-hours trading after news broke of its Bitcoin investment plan, but the rally lost steam, and shares ended the day down 0.82% on March 25. As of February 1, GameStop’s cash pile stood at over $4.77 billion, according to its Q4 earnings report, giving the company plenty of financial room to explore crypto exposure.

The buzz around GameStop’s crypto ambitions had already begun earlier this year , when CEO Ryan Cohen posted a cryptic photo with Strategy chairman and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor. Although the post contained no information, speculation that GameStop might be looking into something related to Bitcoin led to a 7% surge in its share price. Just days later, Strive Asset Management CEO Matt Cole publicly urged GameStop to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. In a letter addressed to Cohen, Cole argued that the move could reshape the company’s financial future and position it as a pioneer in the gaming industry. “We believe GameStop has an incredible opportunity to transform its financial future by becoming the premier Bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector,” he wrote on Feb. 24.

Banks, investment funds, and even governments are moving stocks, bonds, and real estate onto the blockchain because the old system is slow, expensive, and packed with middlemen who don’t add much value. A trade that takes two business days to settle in the stock market happens instantly on-chain. A corporate bond that once required a six-figure buy-in can now be fractionalized and sold in smaller pieces. The advantages are obvious. The problem? Traditional finance doesn’t change overnight. Institutions want efficiency, but they also want security, regulatory clarity, and liquidity. Tokenizing an asset is easy. Making it legally compliant, widely accepted, and integrated into real financial markets is hard. That’s why the future of RWA tokenization isn’t about who can mint the most tokens—it’s about who can build the legal and financial infrastructure to make them usable at scale. The Shift from Traditional Finance to Blockchain-Powered RWAs Traditional finance runs on old infrastructure. Stocks take days to settle, bond markets are fragmented, and real estate deals move at a snail’s pace. Every trade, every transfer, every investment is loaded with unnecessary friction, thanks to clearinghouses, custodians, and layers of legal paperwork. It works, but it’s outdated. Tokenization fixes these inefficiencies by putting assets on the blockchain. Instead of dealing with slow settlement times and geographic restrictions, tokenized assets trade instantly, 24/7, across borders. Instead of requiring a massive upfront investment, fractional ownership allows wider access to traditionally exclusive markets. Institutional investors see the potential, and that’s why banks are piloting tokenized bond markets and hedge funds are testing blockchain-based equity trading. But none of this matters if these tokenized assets can’t plug into the financial system in a way that institutions trust. That’s why the focus isn’t just on tokenization—it’s on building compliant, scalable, and regulated infrastructure that merges TradFi with DeFi without breaking the legal framework. Regulatory Hurdles and Institutional Adoption Blockchain moves fast. Regulators don’t. That’s the biggest challenge right now. Institutions love the idea of faster, cheaper, more liquid markets, but they won’t touch anything that doesn’t meet compliance standards. And the problem is, compliance varies. In the U.S., tokenized securities face strict SEC oversight. In Europe, certain tokenized bonds are already being traded under more flexible regulatory frameworks. Some governments are embracing tokenization, others are trying to shove it into outdated laws that don’t quite fit. This uncertainty is the biggest barrier to institutional adoption. No fund manager or bank executive wants to invest in tokenized assets if they might run into legal trouble later. That’s why the biggest players in RWA tokenization are taking a compliance-first approach. Instead of working around regulations, they’re building directly within existing financial rules—getting brokerage licenses, working with regulators, and structuring tokenized assets to meet institutional standards. The ones that figure it out first will dominate this market. The institutions are ready, the tech is ready, and once the regulatory frameworks are in place, the shift to on-chain finance will be unstoppable. How On-Chain Brokerage Improves Liquidity and Accessibility Tokenizing assets is one thing—creating liquidity for them is another beast entirely. Just because a stock or bond is tokenized doesn’t mean it automatically has an active market. This is where on-chain brokerages come into play. By combining regulatory compliance with decentralized infrastructure, they create actual liquidity pathways for institutions to buy, sell, and settle tokenized assets in a way that mirrors traditional finance—but without the inefficiencies. Instead of relying on centralized exchanges or off-chain settlement layers, on-chain brokerage models allow for: Instant settlement of trades Reduced counterparty risk with blockchain-verified ownership Cross-chain integration, enabling RWAs to be traded across different blockchain networks Essentially, an on-chain brokerage is the missing puzzle piece that makes tokenized assets usable at scale. And a few projects are leading the charge—each with a different approach. A Look at Different RWA Tokenization Projects and Their Approaches The race to dominate RWA tokenization is heating up, and several projects are positioning themselves as the leaders. Ondo Finance has gained traction by offering tokenized U.S. Treasuries, appealing to investors looking for blockchain-based exposure to traditional fixed-income assets. Polymesh, on the other hand, is focused on compliance-first infrastructure, ensuring that RWAs remain legally sound within various jurisdictions. Securitize is another player, bridging private securities with blockchain technology to enable fractional ownership and automation. Each of these projects tackles a different angle—whether it’s compliance, liquidity, or accessibility—but the underlying goal is the same: making traditional assets work in a blockchain-based world. And then there’s WhiteRock, which is taking a slightly different approach—one that prioritizes regulatory approval first, then scalability. WhiteRock’s Role in Securing a Broker’s License and Bridging TradFi to DeFi Most DeFi projects launch first and ask questions later. WhiteRock did the opposite. Instead of rushing into the market with an unregulated tokenization model, WhiteRock became the first RWA platform to secure a brokerage license before scaling operations. This move immediately sets it apart from competitors who rely on third-party regulatory partners to remain compliant. WhiteRock directly connects TradFi capital to blockchain infrastructure, removing unnecessary intermediaries while staying within the legal frameworks institutional investors require, simply by obtaining its own brokerage license WhiteRock’s model includes: Tokenized equities and bonds backed by real TradFi institutions Native exchange liquidity, ensuring assets don’t just exist but are actually tradeable Cross-chain compatibility, with integration across XRPL, Hedera, and other networks While competitors focus on compliance or liquidity separately, WhiteRock integrates both into a single ecosystem, offering a streamlined path for TradFi institutions to enter blockchain-based finance without sacrificing security or regulation. Final Thoughts: The Next Phase of RWA Tokenization The future of real-world asset tokenization isn’t just about technology—it’s about integration. Blockchain can solve inefficiencies in traditional finance, but without regulatory clarity, liquidity solutions, and institutional adoption, tokenized assets will remain a niche concept rather than a financial revolution. Projects like Ondo Finance, Polymesh, and Securitize are laying the groundwork, but platforms like WhiteRock—armed with a broker’s license and a compliance-first approach—are positioning themselves as the bridge between TradFi and DeFi. The shift is happening. The only question is how fast.

Over the last 24 hours, SHIB has shown a slight upward movement of 0.1%, indicating a period of consolidation after recent volatility. With SHIB hovering near its resistance and support levels across multiple time frames, traders are closely watching for its next breakout or breakdown. Key Support and Resistance Levels 15-Minute Chart Support Levels: $0.00001369, $0.00001269 Resistance Levels: $0.00001531, $0.00001955 The 15-minute chart indicates minor fluctuations, with resistance at $0.00001531, which aligns with a 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. If SHIB can break above this level, it could push toward the $0.00001955 target. However, if it fails, support at $0.00001369 will be critical. 1-Hour Chart Support Levels: $0.00001299, $0.00001248 Resistance Levels: $0.00001386 The 1-hour time frame presents a tighter range. Resistance at $0.00001386 has been tested multiple times. A strong breakout above this level could confirm an upward trend, while a drop below $0.00001299 could signal further downside pressure. 4-Hour Chart Support Levels: $0.000012, $0.000010 Resistance Levels: $0.000015, $0.000021 The broader 4-hour analysis suggests that SHIB’s major resistance at $0.000015 is a significant hurdle for bulls. If broken, the next target would be $0.000021. Meanwhile, strong support at $0.000012 could help prevent further declines. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Next Move Prediction Considering the current trend, SHIB is trading near its short-term resistance. A breakout above $0.00001531 could trigger a rally toward $0.00001955, driven by increasing bullish sentiment. However, if SHIB fails to break above resistance, a pullback toward $0.00001299 or even $0.000012 is likely. Bullish Scenario: If SHIB closes above $0.000015, we could see a short-term rally to $0.00001955. Bearish Scenario: Failure to break resistance could lead to a decline toward $0.000012, or even $0.000010 in a worst-case scenario.

Now, Fidelity Investments—one of the biggest names in traditional finance—is making its move. The company is reportedly testing its stablecoin, aiming to scoop a spot in the growing digital asset space. Fidelity’s digital asset team is leading the way, and their new token is designed to work just like cash in the crypto market . This isn’t just a small experiment—it’s part of a bigger plan to dive deeper into the world of tokenized finance. With Trump pushing crypto into the spotlight, the timing couldn’t be better. $6 trillion asset manager Fidelity to launch crypto stablecoin. pic.twitter.com/yKbr2LnIOF — BULLSTREET GROUP (@Bullstreetgroup) March 26, 2025 Fidelity’s Crypto Expansion Gains Momentum Fidelity’s latest stablecoin initiative is part of its growing interest in digital assets. The Boston-based firm has also filed to launch a digital U.S. money market fund, expected to go live by the end of May. This fund would compete directly with major players like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, both of which have been expanding their tokenized finance offerings. The asset manager is still in the early stages of testing its stablecoin, but reports suggest an official launch could happen soon. If successful, this would place Fidelity alongside other financial giants entering the stablecoin market, including Ripple’s RLUSD and Tether’s USDT, which currently dominates the sector. Trump’s Influence on Stablecoin Developments The political landscape has played a significant role in the recent surge of interest in stablecoins. Donald Trump has been vocal about his support for cryptocurrency , with stablecoins emerging as a key focus of his administration. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant recently emphasized the government’s strategy to use stablecoins to maintain the U.S. dollar’s dominance as the world’s reserve currency. “We are going to keep the U.S. the dominant reserve currency in the world, and we will use stablecoins to do that,” Bessant stated. Despite this push, critics warn that stablecoins come with risks. Some believe they could disrupt financial stability or become tools for fraudulent activities, raising concerns about regulatory oversight. Tokenized Finance vs. Stablecoins Alongside stablecoins, fund managers and crypto companies like Ondo Finance and Hashnote—both backed by stablecoin issuer Circle—are actively exploring tokenized money market funds. These digital assets function as regulated, interest-paying instruments that can also serve as collateral for trading. While these tokenized funds have already attracted over $5 billion, skeptics argue they lack the deep liquidity and usability of traditional stablecoins. However, Fidelity’s move into this space signals growing institutional interest, marking a new phase in the evolution of digital finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

42359866,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=699916,1742974200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42359866.jpeg,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Prediction: MUTM Tipped For Sensational Dogecoin (DOGE) Like 10,000% Run",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-price-prediction-mutm-tipped-for-sensational-dogecoin-doge-like-10000-run/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) headlines have been making waves as its presale picks up, seeing similarities with Dogecoin’s (DOGE) past surge. Phase 3 of its 11-phase presale has already seen 70% sold out at $0.02 per token, with $4.8 million raised and 6,600 holders onboarded. Investors are clamoring to stake out positions prior to a 25% price increase to $0.025 in Phase 4, echoing the same urgency observed during DOGE’s legendary run. The project’s tokenomics predict a 200% launch return—$0.06 per token—but analysts have called this a prelude to a much larger rise, with post-launch goals between $3 and $5. The Legacy of Dogecoin, and Opportunity for MUTM Dogecoin (DOGE) has previously turned small investments into earth-shattering amounts. A $100 investment in April 2019, when DOGE was worth $0.002552, would have swollen into $16,105 at today’s $0.4110 price—an increase of 16,000%. Such investments netted returns of 13,000% in its 2020 rally. Those numbers are small compared to its May 2021 high of $0.7376, where gains surpassed 28,000%. As DOGE’s momentum wanes, new competitor Mutuum Finance (MUTM) steps up as the next viral DeFi utility, harnessing exchange potential and rapid growth potential in its path to success. In contrast to DOGE’s meme-driven trajectory, MUTM establishes value within a decentralized lending ecosystem. Users deposit assets such as ETH or DAI, which mint interest-bearing mtTokens (mtETH, mtDAI) that increase in value over time. Overcollateralization allows borrowers to access loans, which both stabilizes the system and generates platform revenue. Some of this income powers automatic MUTM buybacks, establishing a constant demand. Combined with a presale structure that allows the price to jump stepwise, this mechanism sets up MUTM for exponential accumulation. Presale Gaining Traction Before Exchange Launch The early sell-out of Phase 3 reveals rising expectations. This means early participants locking in tokens at $0.02 could see 200% profit at the $0.06 exchange listing. However, after their launch, projections suggest stratospheric returns. And if MUTM hits $3—halfway between analyst forecasts—an investment of $1,000 today would explode to $150,000. This meteoric 14,900% ascent is reminiscent of DOGE’s heyday, but the real-world utility of MUTM mitigates the need for hype. That’s further incentivized by buy-and-distribute model of the protocol. This creates a reinforcing feedback loop, as regular token buybacks from platform fees increase scarcity and stakers receive redistributed MUTM, compounding returns on investment. This ecosystem is capable of cultivating loyalty, unlike DOGEs price volatility, especially with mtTokens being transferrable across DeFi platforms. The Mutuum Finance team are already working on a Certik audit of its smart contracts, a milestone that will serve as proof of trust. When finalized, the audit results will be made available through official channels providing participants reassurance regarding the platform’s strength. These unusual precautions for presale projects demonstrate MUTM’s desire to prioritize longevity over quick returns. A Defining Moment for Early Investors As Phase 3 draws to a close, the opportunity to grab tokens at $0.02 also the opportunity to grab tokens at $0.02 begins to close. Each successive stage raises the entry point, causing latecomers to pay higher premiums. As Phase 4’s 25% last-chance bump approaches, the project’s path closely mimics that of early-stage DOGE opportunities, with one key difference, however—whereas DOGE is a social media play, MUTM’s future in DeFi lending is replete with real-world application, aligning its growth prospects with repeated profit margins rather than social media virality. Seizing the Moment History rarely repeats, however Mutuum Finance (MUTM) mimics the conditions of memes that propelled Dogecoin (DOGE) to cult status. With a perfect mix of viral potential and robust tokenomics, MUTM goes beyond the meme coin price swings and allows two avenues for profit, both short during the presale and long with access to the ecosystem. With Certik verification on the horizon and exchange listings imminent, the project is well positioned for a defining rally. For everyone who missed DOGE’s surge, here is a second chance—anchored in innovation, buoyed by urgency. Buy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.02, before Phase 3 is sold out. Phase 4 transition marks a 25% price increase, eliminating the lowest entry tier. Go to the official website to join now.

In her spring statement on Wednesday, Reeves is expected to defend spending cuts as painful but essential to safeguard Britain’s future in a global economy that is changing fast. A ccording to excerpts released by the Treasury, Reeves will say: “Our task is to secure Britain’s future in a world that is changing before our eyes. The job of a responsible government is not simply to watch this change.” The Treasury says it will save about £10 billion ($13 billion) daily from government spending. However, a full breakdown of these cuts will be detailed in a multi-year spending review in June. Reeves under fire as economic challenges mount Since her last budget in October, Reeves has also been grappling with an additional £17 billion in borrowing requirements. She has already saved £5 billion by cutting welfare benefits. Her approach has drawn scorn from within the Labour Party, with some fearing that the spending cuts will resemble the austerity imposed by the Conservative-led government after 2010. She also faces opposition from Conservative critics who hold her responsible for the UK’s economic struggles. In January, the country found itself at the heart of a global bond market rout as fears of “stagflation” — a combination of stubbornly high inflation and stagnant growth—gripped investors. Critics argue that Reeves’ tax- and spending-heavy budget, along with Bleeker’s view of public finances, have shaken business and investor confidence. Tory Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride condemned Reeves’ comments as an attempt to blame others, arguing that her policies had been responsible for economic stagnation and increased government borrowing. He noted that t he chancellor needs to take responsibility for her own choices . Tory added that economic stagnation and higher government borrowing could not be blamed on external factors. He further noted that the country had been on this trajectory since her first “disastrous” budget. Labour Party faces internal struggle over spending cuts The planned cuts have alarmed Labour MPs and cabinet ministers. Others argue that Reeves should relax her fiscal rules or raise taxes instead. There is also deepening disquiet over reforms to disability benefits , which has prompted dissent within the party. To counter, Reeves will tout that she has rebuilt the £9.9 billion budget headroom that was wiped by soaring borrowing costs and softer economic growth. The government is also trying to cut operational costs by 15%, which could result in about 10,000 civil service job losses. The deepest cuts are expected from departments other than health, defense, and education. Ministers at these unprotected departments are expected to rebel as the row over spending cuts deepens. The government’s independent fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, will publish its new forecast for the UK economy. Growth in 2025 is tipped to be cut from 2% to 1%. Source: ONS Reeves blames global forces for the UK’s economic woes Reeves blames the UK’s growing debt outlay on elevating global borrowing costs. She also indirectly alludes to the re-election of US President Donald Trump, whose approach to tariffs and Russia’s war in Ukraine has led European leaders to reassess their trade models and devote more to defense. The UK is currently negotiating an economic side deal with the US to lessen the blow from Trump’s proposed tariffs, possibly by adjusting the UK’s digital services tax, which targets American tech companies. One of the few increases in spending in Reeves’ plan is a £2.2 billion boost in defense—funded in part by redirecting foreign aid. This enables her to remain within her rules on the public finances because capital expenditure does not count towards her most important fiscal target. Despite these steps, Reeves has been drawing fire from the public. A recent YouGov survey found that 73% of Britons believe the government is failing to manage the economy, with just 16% saying it is doing a good job. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The move is part of the company’s broader strategy to provide institutional and retail investors with regulated, cost-effective access to digital assets. New Listings for Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP ETPs 21Shares, which has filed for an XRP ETF in the U.S., introduced its Bitcoin Core ETP, Solana Staking ETP, and XRP ETP to the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange on March 24. These products are fully backed by their respective cryptocurrencies and are designed to offer an accessible and transparent investment option for those seeking exposure to digital assets. The listings align with the growing institutional interest in crypto investments and come at a time when Europe is seeing greater regulatory clarity under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. The presence of this regulatory structure has contributed to increasing confidence in digital asset markets, leading to a rise in demand for compliant investment vehicles. Mandy Chiu, Head of Financial Product Development at 21Shares, emphasized the significance of these listings in the European market. She noted that with institutional participation in crypto accelerating and regulatory frameworks becoming more defined, 21Shares remains focused on expanding its product offerings. The company’s commitment to providing simplified and regulated investment solutions is reflected in its decision to list these ETPs on Nasdaq Stockholm. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Growing Demand for Regulated Crypto Investment Products The European market has seen an increasing preference for structured crypto investment products that operate within a regulated framework. Institutional investors, in particular, look for reliable ways to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies while ensuring compliance with evolving financial regulations. Experts suggest that investors are transitioning from Bitcoin to altcoins, and XRP and XRP-backed financial products are receiving more global attention. By expanding its range of ETPs, 21Shares is responding to this demand with products that adhere to strict regulatory standards. The Nasdaq Stockholm listing provides a recognized and well-regulated environment for investors, further reinforcing the legitimacy of cryptocurrency as an asset class in mainstream finance. Offerings such as these help in bridging the gap between traditional financial markets and the digital asset ecosystem.

Majors were little-changed in the past 24 hours as Solana’s SOL, xrp (XRP), BNB Chain’s BNB, and ether (ETH) rose under 3%, while memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) outperformed with a 5.5% jump. That was the second-straight day for gains for DOGE, alongside continued bumps in pepe (PEPE) and mog (MOG), as a tendency among these tokens to act as a “beta bet” on ether’s strength showed no signs of reverting. Elsewhere, shiba inu (SHIB) zoomed 11%, buoyed by a rotation to riskier memes and a 228% jump in its native ShibaSwap exchange in the last 30 days. Open interest on SHIB-tracked futures has risen upward of 20% since Sunday, data shows , indicative of expectations of further volatility. Concerns about a U.S. economic slowdown remain, however, while a rapid unwinding of momentum trades in equities has led to money managers retreating to full defensive mode, some day. “We expect markets to continue their soft rebound from last week into month-end, with the next major catalyst being the 'liberation day' reciprocal tariff announcement from Trump scheduled for April 2nd,” Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Rumors of a softer tariff response will go a long way to recover some of the recent technical damage in US stocks, helping to spark a global rally along with the recent jump in EU/China stocks.” “Crypto will remain a close proxy of equities in the foreseeable future as we don't see a unique catalyst in the meantime, though the recent M&A announcements with Coinbase/Kraken give us faith that the long-term bull market remains alive and well,” Fan added. Meanwhile, traders at QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast that the upcoming quarter and April in particular, have historically been one of the best periods for risk assets, second only to the festive December rally. “The S&P 500 has delivered an average annualized return of 19.6% in Q2, while Bitcoin has also recorded its second-best median performance during this stretch - again, trailing only Q4, QCP said, pointing out caution among options traders. “Options markets remain cautious. Call skew hasn’t meaningfully shifted toward calls, with call skew only emerging from June onwards, suggesting traders are waiting to see how the tariff situation develops,” they said, adding that attention is turning to the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data, which could become the “next key catalyst.” The PCE index captures inflation (or deflation) across a wide range of consumer expenses and reflects changes in consumer behavior. Released monthly, the PCE is said to influence Fed interest rate decisions. High PCE readings signal rising inflation, potentially prompting rate hikes to cool the economy, which can reduce risk appetite and pressure bitcoin prices downward as investors favor safer assets. Conversely, low PCE data suggests tame inflation, possibly leading to rate cuts or steady policy, boosting liquidity and supporting Bitcoin’s price as a speculative asset or inflation hedge. The next release is on March 28 and could sway market sentiment, with bitcoin’s reaction tied to how the data shapes Fed expectations — volatility often follows as traders adjust positions.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-26 07:31:40

Despite this dip, making an investment of up to $15,000 in Pi Coin could deliver significant returns if the token resumes a bullish trajectory. At press time, Pi Coin trades at $0.836 after a 9.6% decline in 24 hours. This token has experienced intense volatility in the last seven days, with the price fluctuating between $0.82 and $1.19. Despite this decline in Pi Network price , it remains up by 36% from its all-time low of $0.61 registered about a month ago. This indicates that traders who bought the dip last month are sitting on gains. Returns On $1K, $10K, and $15K Investments on Pi Network at $0.90 Making an investment of $1,000, $10,00,0, or $15,000 on the Pi Network token at $0.90 will deliver significant returns if the price hits an ATH above $3. If a crypto trader buys $1,000 worth of Pi Coin at $0.90, they will receive 1,111 Pi Network coins. If this altcoin recovers to $3, the investment will be worth $3,333, marking a 233% return. Additionally, if a trader buys $10,000 worth of Pi Coin for $0.90, they will receive 11,111 tokens. This means that their investment will be worth $33,333 if the Pi Network price were to reach an ATH past $3. This trader will have made a nearly 3.5x return on their investment. An even bigger purchase of $15,000 will deliver higher returns. If you place a buy order for Pi Network tokens at $0.90 with this amount, you will get an average of 16,666 tokens. The final value of this investment will be $50,000 if Pi Coin rebounds past $3, which is also a 233% return on investment. A 233% ROI has been achieved before with Pi Coin. In the last week of February, Pi Network price jumped from $0.66 to $2.91 within days. Traders who bought at the time received a 340% return on their investment. Can Pi Network Price Bounce Past $3? Several analysts believe that Pi Network price can bounce from the recent price dip. One analyst observed that on OKX, which is one of the largest exchanges that have listed Pi Coin, 72% of traders have taken long positions on Pi Coin , which indicates a bullish bias. Meanwhile, popular analyst Kim Wong shared a bullish Pi Network price prediction saying, “After this initial boom and bust, Pi coin is going to trade as a regular crypto and is now waiting for news to drive its price. Of course, it is still a one-of-a-kind crypto with mega potential. It is a good time to keep buying and hold.” A recent Coingape article also revealed significant ecosystem growth after the Pi Network domain auction secured more than 200,000 bids, showing high market interest Amid these developments, it is possible for Pi Network price to recover above $3, delivering significant returns to holders. Pi Coin Price Analysis The Pi Network 4-hour price chart indicates this coin may have hit a local bottom. This is because of the oversold RSI that stands at 30. Looking at historical trends, Pi Coin has bounced with a God candle every time the RSI flashes oversold. The falling broadening wedge pattern also shows that a bullish reversal is likely to happen. If the coin can flip resistance at $0.95, it could spark a rally to the 423.6% Fibonacci level of $3.50. PI/USDT: 4-Hour Chart This technical setup shows that Pi Network price can rebound past $3. Therefore, a trader that buys $1,000, $10,000, or $15,000 worth of Pi Coin today can get a 233% return on their investment. However, traders should remain cautious as the broader crypto market is still registering choppy price moves.

The company’s board has unanimously approved a plan to invest in Bitcoin (BTC) and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins, marking a significant shift in its financial strategy. According to a March 25 report by CNBC, GameStop will utilize a portion of its corporate cash reserves or future debt issuances to acquire digital assets. The decision was confirmed in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which stated: “The Company’s investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including Bitcoin and US dollar-denominated stablecoins.” As of February 1, GameStop held $4.77 billion in cash reserves—a sharp increase from $921.7 million a year earlier. The company reported $1.283 billion in net sales for the fourth quarter and $3.823 billion for fiscal 2024, signaling a return to financial stability after years of struggle. Gamestop: Meme Stock to Bitcoin Investor GameStop’s pivot to Bitcoin comes after years of unconventional financial moves that began during the pandemic-driven meme stock craze. The retailer became a symbol of retail investor defiance against Wall Street short-sellers, with its stock price soaring unexpectedly in 2021. Since then, the retailer has gradually improved its financial footing, reporting a profitable fiscal 2023, which may have given it the confidence to diversify into crypto. Rumors of GameStop’s interest in Bitcoin had already been swirling. In February, CEO Ryan Cohen sparked speculation by posting an uncaptioned photo with Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy and a vocal Bitcoin proponent. The cryptic post fueled market chatter about the retailer’s potential crypto ambitions. A Strategic Gamble or Smart Hedge? GameStop’s foray into Bitcoin comes at a time when corporations are increasingly viewing the cryptocurrency as a strategic reserve asset. Just days earlier, Saylor revealed that MicroStrategy had purchased 6,911 BTC , bringing its total holdings to 506,137 BTC—equivalent to roughly 2.4% of Bitcoin’s total supply. With GameStop now officially entering the crypto arena, its decision to adopt Bitcoin as part of its treasury strategy could influence other publicly traded companies to follow suit.

Bitcoin & Altcoins Gain Momentum appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The wider altcoin market, led by Ethereum (ETH), has signaled a possible momentum shift following the recent Bitcoin (BTC) price pump towards $87.5k . The total crypto market cap rallied close to $3 trillion on Wednesday, March 26, during the mid-European session, The crypto market has attempted to mirror Gold price action in the recent past ahead of the April 2 sweeping new reciprocal tariffs from the United States, in addition to tariffs on some Canadian and Mexican goods. Is the Crypto Market Ready for Recovery The ongoing crypto mild recovery has been influenced by several factors including renewed interest from whale investors and macroeconomic conditions. For instance, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have already ended a five-week losing streak following last week’s $744 million cash inflow and $111 million cash inflow since the beginning of this week. The fear of further Bitcoin correction has significantly reduced, as shown by the BTC fear and greed index that hovered around 47 percent at the time of this writing. However, Santiment has cautioned crypto investors of potential selloff amid rising bullish optimism. Moreover, on-chain data analysis by Santiment shows an increased bullish optimism. “Remember that cryptocurrency markets have ALWAYS historically moved in the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations. When you see your timeline filled with “to the moon” or “Lambo time”, be cautious about upcoming prices. When you see “crypto is dead” or “bitcoin is a scam”, this should be music to your ears,” Santiment noted . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction April 2025: Will BTC Hit $100K or Face a Pullback? , What Next? The wider altcoin market, which has depicted a positive correlation with Bitcoin, is likely to follow BTC price action. From a technical analysis standpoint, Bitcoin price is likely to continue in a rising mode towards the resistance range between $89k and $91k. A consistent close above $91k will yield a rally towards $100k and beyond, which will positively impact the wider altcoin market. However, a rejection at the next liquified range will result in a renewed correction towards $77k. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Analyst Says Ripple’s Legal Win Changes Everything,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-etf-incoming-analyst-says-ripples-legal-win-changes-everything/,"With the saga pitting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Ripple Labs seemingly coming to a close after four grueling years, experts say the path is now clear for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Nate Geraci, a well-regarded ETF analyst, has voiced optimism about the future of XRP ETFs, stating that with the legal uncertainties resolved, major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity will likely apply for financial products tracking Ripple’s native token. The Path to XRP ETFs in the U.S. In a March 26 post on X, the ETF Store President wrote: “Seems obvious spot XRP ETF approval simply matter of time IMO. And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc to all be involved.” He also highlighted that XRP is one of the largest crypto assets by market cap, boasting a value of north of $144 billion. In his opinion, this will ensure that the largest ETF issuers in the country won’t ignore the potential the asset holds. While the SEC has been cautious about approving altcoin ETFs, Geraci believes the agency will eventually relent. He also emphasized the growing debate within the investment community over whether broad crypto index ETFs or single-asset ones will dominate the market. The analyst remains bullish on the expansion of such financial products, even though he thinks the regulator will “draw a line” at some point over what to approve or not. Ripple’s legal tussle with the SEC was always considered one of the biggest impediments to getting an XRP ETF approved. The clash started in 2020 when the financial watchdog alleged that the crypto payments company conducted unregistered securities sales using its XRP token. However, in 2023, in a landmark win for crypto, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP didn’t violate securities laws. However, she declared that institutional sales of the same asset were against the law, slapping Ripple with a $125 million fine . The SEC then filed an appeal against the ruling, with Ripple responding with a cross-appeal of its own, dragging the case even longer. A Long-Awaited Conclusion After months of legal back-and-forth, a new-look SEC dropped its appeal, with Ripple following suit days later. The company relinquished its complaint and agreed to pay a reduced $50 million fine out of the initial $125 million judgment, with the remainder refunded. The probable conclusion of the case and speculation of a likely ETF saw XRP surge past $2.5 before settling slightly lower. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading at $2.45, a slight 1.3% increase over 24 hours. However, it is up 7.3% across seven days, outperforming the broader crypto market, which registered gains of only 2% in that time. The post XRP ETF Incoming?

On Wednesday, March 26, Egorov again dumped nearly 2M CRV tokens, bringing his total selloffs to roughly 2.5M coins this week. Therefore, broader aspects surrounding the coin’s future price action remain clouded in an enigma despite an ongoing rally. Curve Finance Founder Offloads Coins Amid Price Rally CRV price is currently on a rally, as indicated by intraday and weekly gains of 12% and 23%, respectively. However, Egorov’s selloff transactions amid this upswing have sparked market concerns about a looming dip. How Many Tokens Have Been Sold? According to data from Spotonchain on X , the Curve Finance founder transferred 1.997 million tokens worth $1.03 million to the wallet address “0x5a8.” Subsequently, this address sold 1 million coins for 515,058 USDC at an average price of $0.515. Currently, this address still holds 997K tokens. Besides, Egorov sold 468,769 tokens for 238,171 USDC at an average price of $0.508, per March 24 data. Why Were The CRV Tokens Sold? Intriguingly, he purchased these tokens as of mid-December last year at an average price of $1.114. The initial investment made is now at a loss of 54.6%. While the selloffs come amid a price rally, they might be a potential move to mitigate losses incurred. Nevertheless, broader market sentiments in light of these selloffs remain bearish. CRV Price Overview As of press time, Curve DAO coin’s price defied usual market sentiments and pumped 12%, reaching $0.5560. The coin saw a massive pump after hitting a $0.4927 low intraday. Market analyst ‘CrediBULL Crypto’ posted on X, revealing bullish projections despite the crypto’s sluggish performance. As per the analyst, the CRV/XRP pair indicates a breakout for the Curve Finance token looms. Source: CrediBULL Crypto, X Considering XRP is still trapped in a range where it is looking for deviation below the lows, CRV is ready to pump, per the analyst. Market watchers reflect an uncertain approach towards the crypto amid recent developments that are unable to clear the muddy waters.

According to a report by Wu Blockchain, an insider whale spent 5 million UMA ( UMA ) tokens to vote on the final outcome for the Polymarket betting pool titled “Ukraine agrees to Trump mineral deal before April?” Because of the whale’s last-minute intervention, it was able to overturn the final results by shelling in 25% of the “YES” votes. Thus, the whale was able to manipulate the final outcome through the UMA oracle . Polymarket uses UMA’s Optimistic Oracle to settle market outcomes and verify real-world events. UMA’s oracle relies on community consensus, citing UMA token holders as “impartial arbiter of the outcomes of relevant markets.” The volume of funds that flowed into the betting pool amounted to more than $7 million. Due to the incident, many Polymarket traders who were betting “NO” suffered thousands in losses. When the final outcome was issued, many traders argued that there was no official confirmation that indicated an agreement between President Trump and the Ukrainian government had been formally signed. According to a report by Reuters, on March 25, Trump claimed that he expected a revenue sharing agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine will be “signed soon.” However, traders disputed that this was not enough to confirm the results of the betting pool.

Which means there was no deal before, wow real scam,” said one Polymarket trader in the comments section of the betting pool. “In the 2028 US presidential election, whoever owns more UMA will decide who wins the presidency, and Polymarket will become a joke,” said another trader. A user on X with the handle @Web3Marmot called out Polymarket in a recent post , accusing the prediction market platform of scamming its users. They stated that event outcomes are not determined by real world events. Instead, they alleged that final outcomes are determined by a “influential users who secure positions and then vote in their favor, regardless of the actual results.” Moreover, they explained that UMA whales had voted “YES,” despite the deal not having been officially signed nor announced. This means that UMA token holders ultimately decide the final outcome, not real world events. “The rules clearly state, “The resolution source for this market will be official information from the governments of the U.S. and Ukraine.” Yet, there is no confirmation of the deal or the outcome of the decision,” wrote Web3Marmot. Polymarket’s response to the controversy In a post shared on Discord , a representative from Polymarket acknowledged the controversy surrounding the “Ukraine agrees to Trump mineral deal before April?” betting pool. “We are aware of the situation regarding the Ukrainian Rare Earth Market. This market resolved against the expectations of our users and our clarification. Unfortunately, because this wasn’t a market failure, we are not able to issue refunds,” said Tanner, a Polymarket representative.

The announcement has fueled renewed interest in TRON-based meme tokens, reaffirming TRON’s position as a hub for innovation and high-performance infrastructure. To further engage the community, HTX and SunPump co-hosted an X Spaces session titled “TRON Ecosystem Evolution: Meme Coins Surge! Is SunPump Primed for a Spectacular Ascent?”. The session featured Justin Sun’s broader vision for the TRON meme economy and included participation from notable ecosystem players such as TokenPocket, SunDog, SunCat, $PUSS, and Cyber Dog, and community thought leader Trav. Why TRON Is Positioned for Meme Coin Momentum The rise of meme coins in the TRON ecosystem reflects the platform’s technical strengths and community-driven growth. Justin Sun emphasized that liquidity, seamless infrastructure, and a frictionless user experience make TRON a natural launchpad for viral Web3 assets. The TRON network currently hosts over $64 billion in USDT, a record high that directly benefits token trading pairs and meme coin liquidity. In addition, TRON’s newly introduced zero-gas model allows users to cover network fees using USDT, with 90% of costs subsidized, resulting in fees of less than 1 USDT per transaction—greatly enhancing accessibility and usability. The initiative is further supported by strong exchange partnerships. Major centralized exchanges including HTX, Poloniex, Kraken, Gate.io, KuCoin, and MEXC have committed to supporting TRON-based meme coin listings and trading, boosting exposure and liquidity across global markets. The Community as a Catalyst During the X Spaces event, Sun underlined the importance of community in shaping the meme coin movement, “It’s important to adopt the community values and see what people want. We need to follow where the traffic goes and what the community is interested in the most.” He added, “We have learnt a lot from previous cases and the mistakes. We will do it way better than what we have done before. 2.0 also represents the resilience of the team and the community. It shows a spirit that we will always do it.” Looking Ahead: AI Infrastructure and a Potential TRX ETF TRON Meme Season 2.0 marks one of the major highlights of Q1 2025, following the successful launch of USDD 2.0, which has now reached a market cap of nearly $300 million. In Q2, HTX and TRON DAO will continue to prioritize the growth of meme assets, while also introducing AI-driven infrastructure tools. Sun shared that an AI infrastructure layer is expected to go live in the coming months, which he described as “one of our top products.” Additionally, with regulatory sentiment in the U.S. becoming more constructive, Sun hinted that a TRX ETF listing may be possible within this year. Meanwhile, HTX continues its growth trajectory, recently ranking among the Top 5 CEXs globally by user funds, as reported by DefiLlama. Sun remarked, “HTX is growing to be a more and more competitive exchange. We’re making sure that people can trade safely on HTX.” About HTX Founded in 2013, HTX has evolved from a virtual asset exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, research, investments, incubation, and other businesses.

On Tuesday, Polymarket’s community users saw approximately $7 million wiped out from the event market after a large UMA holder allegedly manipulated the Oracle by using last-minute voting power. Many users who participated in this market event have been expressing their anguish on social media with some even calling it a “fraud” or “scam”. Addressing the issue on Discord, Polymarket team has denied the allegations of a “market failure” but have resolved to put in place a more defined and timely clarification system with the UMA team. What is the ‘Ukraine Rare Earth’ Incident on Polymarket The controversy which has broader implications for the emerging DeFi Prediction Markets, emerged last night on the potential Trump and Ukraine’s rare earth mineral deal. The exact question involved: ‘Will Ukraine agree to the Trump Mineral deal before April?’ Since there was no official confirmation of such a deal, the market was widely expected to settle as ‘No’ . However, in the final moments before settlement, whales—holding large amounts of UMA tokens—allegedly used their voting power to alter the outcome. And now traders who had made “accurate predictions” based on the expected result have lost their money allegedly due to a “manipulation and not because of a mistake in their analysis,” argued a reddit user. Notably, this year, Polymarket also faced a ban in Thailand. Why is the UMA Oracle Under Fire After The Attack Notably, UMA (Universal Marke Access) oracle which acts as a verification and security layer for Polymarket has come under fire for its role in the incident due to its centralized power mechanism. UMA’s Optimistic Oracle is used by Polymarket to verify real-world events and settle prediction markets. It works by allowing anyone to propose an outcome, which is then open for disputes before being finalized. Users are of the view that it has to be certainly held responsible as in this case too,UMA’s oracle was responsible for confirming whether Ukraine’s rare earth exports had increased as predicted. UMA’s oracle, which relies on an optimistic approach where proposed outcomes are assumed correct unless disputed, became the point of failure. The short dispute window and high economic barrier to challenging false claims allowed the misinformation to pass through before legitimate fact-checking could occur. Since UMA token is used for voting, a polymarket user on reddit alleged that someone sent million of UMA Tokens to the whales to tilt the result in favour of “yes”. In fact, a user was indeed seen casting 5 million tokens through three accounts, evidently playing a significant role in the outcome as he accounted for 25% of the total votes. Users have been expressing anguish on how would an ordinary player compete against the large holders can who can change the outcome with a single click. The outcome was decided by the UMA Vote Strengthening Monitoring and Security In response, Polymarket – which recently integrated on SOL – and UMA have committed to implementing several key improvements to prevent similar incidents in the future. They include building up enhanced systems and monitoring layers to avoid the recurrence of such event. It has also sought suggestions from the users to submit their feedback on strengthening the security of its systems. Certain things that Polymarket and UML can work on in near future include: 1. Additional Fact-checking Layers – Polymarket can integrate additional fact-checking layers before approving new markets. It can also work with independent verification entities to ensure the authenticity of information driving speculative predictions. 2. Stronger Oracle Verification Protocols – For UMA, it can consider a revamp of its oracle systems to introduce multi-source data aggregation. This will reduce its reliance on single data streams that could be manipulated. 3. Community-Based Reporting and Audits – Both platforms can introduce a decentralized reporting system that allows users to flag potentially misleading or manipulated market activity. Additionally, third-party audits can be conducted more frequently to assess market integrity. 4. Extended Dispute Windows – The time allowed for disputes can be increased, giving users more opportunity to flag manipulated or inaccurate data. 5. Community-Based Monitoring – A new system where users can flag suspicious oracle activity before claims are finalized can be given a thought about. 6. Stronger Economic Disincentives for Attackers – Last but not the least, UMA must explore ways to increase the cost of fraudulent data submissions – currently the penalty for an incorrect vote is only 0.05% – making it less risky and financially attractive for fraudsters to manipulate oracle outcomes. Implications for the Markets Nonetheless, this incident on Polymarket has highlighted the inherent vulnerabilities in decentralized oracles, especially in high-stakes financial markets. While blockchain-based systems like UMA – which recently launched Uma Oval – aim to provide censorship-resistant and trustless data feeds, they must also ensure robust security measures against governance attacks. Market participants and analysts will be closely watching the coming up and implementation of these new measures, as the outcome could set new standards for decentralized finance platforms dealing with real-world events. The effectiveness of these reforms may determine whether decentralized prediction markets can balance transparency with security, ensuring they remain a viable and trustworthy alternative to traditional financial systems.

Cryptocurrency exchange MEXC has frozen over 1,500 accounts linked to what it describes as a “large-scale coordinated group of market manipulators” after its internal investigation uncovered two coordinated groups operating in Vietnam and CIS countries, with some accounts showing daily trading volumes exceeding $20 million. In a blog post , MEXC said the groups engaged in practices such as “self-trading, spoofing, layering, front-running, quote stuffing” as well as other market manipulative behaviors. According to the exchange’s calculations, coordinated malicious trading activities “have increased by 60% from January to February 2025 compared to the end of 2024.” The exchange said these schemes are increasingly using “institutional-level access to liquidity, infrastructure, and algorithmic strategies.” “We are recording the transformation of manipulations from the retail to the group and even quasi-institutional level, which carries systemic risks for both individual exchanges and the market infrastructure as a whole.” MEXC You might also like: Hong Kong’s SFC warns of MEXC related suspected crypto fraud The exchange said it has taken steps to mitigate the impact, including rolling back suspicious transactions and suspending all identified accounts. It has also implemented a monitoring system for suspicious accounts, placing flagged participants under “enhanced surveillance for at least 30 days.” Earlier in March, blockchain sleuth ZachXBT called the nearly $1.5 billion Bybit hack “eye opening,” warning that the industry’s security problems might not improve without government regulations that could “hurt our entire industry.” Per ZachXBT, several “decentralized” protocols — e.g. eXch and THORChain, among others — have generated nearly all of their monthly volume and fees from transactions linked to North Korea.

A governance attack occurred on Polymarket, where a UMA tycoon used his voting power to manipulate the oracle, allowing the market to settle false results and successfully profit. The tycoon cast 5 million tokens through three accounts, accounting for 25% of the total votes.… pic.twitter.com/3xFuzdRfWJ — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 26, 2025 The market in question was about whether Ukraine would sign a mineral agreement with Trump before April. As of the market settlement, no official agreement had been made. While Trump said he “expected” to sign the deal soon, it was never formally signed or announced. Despite this, Polymarket decided the result as ‘YES’, which raised concerns about fairness, as the rules seemed to allow changing outcomes to prevent losses. UMA Tycoon Controls 25% of Votes to Profit A UMA tycoon used their voting power to manipulate the oracle, causing the market to settle on false results and make a profit. By casting 5 million tokens across three accounts, they controlled 25% of the votes. Polymarket acknowledged the issue with the Ukraine Rare Earth Market, where the outcome didn’t match user expectations. Since it was not a market failure, Polymarket shared that they cannot offer refunds. Polymarket is working with the UMA team to prevent this from happening again and is focused on improving their systems, rules, and clarification processes. Negligence or Manipulation? Polymarket and UMA’s Last-Minute Actions Lead to Controversy However, an X user noted that there was no governance attack and this was just extreme negligence from both Polymarket and UMAprotocol. It started with a user proposing a “Yes” answer to a market about Ukraine giving Trump rare earth metals before April, which was disputed, starting the UMA vote process. After all votes were committed, Polymarket issued a last-minute clarification saying the market wasn’t ready to resolve yet. Despite this, UMA whale voters revealed “Yes” votes to avoid penalties, as they could have abstained or rolled the vote. The “Yes” vote prevailed, and the market ultimately resolved in line with UMA’s decision, rather than Polymarket’s last-minute clarification. The user highlighted that the confusion stemmed from Polymarket’s late intervention, which would have been more effective if issued earlier. The UMA whales, who consistently participate in these disputes, voted strategically to protect their rewards, rather than attempting to manipulate the system.",Uncategorized|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|UMA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-26 08:02:21

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) rallied 10% to an intraday high of $0.00001485 on March 26, with its market cap seated at $8.6 billion, flipping major players like Sui ( SUI ) and Hedera ( HBAR ) while rising to become the 19th largest crypto asset per data from CoinGecko. Three catalysts are driving SHIB’s gains today. First, the Shiba Inu team has teased Shib Finance, a major DeFi upgrade that will introduce a suite of financial tools, including reputation-based lending and undercollateralized borrowing. The upcoming platform aims to merge TradFi and DeFi with ecosystem features like Karma Engine, Shib Attestation, and a privacy-focused identity layer. Second, SHIB got listed on BingX Futures, opening the doors for over 10 million global users to trade the memecoin with leverage. You might also like: Popcat price rally gains steam as tokens on exchanges dip Third, its burn rate has surged recently. On March 23, Shiba Inu’s daily burn rate increased by nearly 8,100%, reaching over 1 billion SHIB tokens in a single day. According to Shibburn, the network has burned more than 410.74 trillion tokens since its inception, leaving the circulating supply at around 589 trillion. On-chain metrics for SHIB are also showing signs of a growing bullish sentiment. The daily active addresses on the network have jumped over 20% since March 18 per Santiment data. Meanwhile, social sentiment around the token has also flipped positive, especially after U.S. President Donald Trump re-ignited interest in meme coins with a Truth Social post about the official Trump memecoin, TRUMP. SHIB price analysis On the daily chart, SHIB recently broke out of a falling wedge pattern that had been forming over the past four months, a classic bullish setup. This kind of breakout often signals a potential trend reversal, suggesting that SHIB might be gearing up for a stronger move to the upside. Over the short term, SHIB could be eyeing a 20% move after breaking through a key resistance and completing a textbook inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. As highlighted by pseudonymous trader Satori, this breakout confirms a bottoming structure, opening the door for further upside momentum if bullish volume holds up. If $SHIB can break through the resistance in the next move, it will confirm a bottoming pattern (H&S) 📈 This could lead to at least a 20% price increase! pic.twitter.com/NF9ncpFrPQ — Satori 🎴 💀 (@Satori_BTC) March 25, 2025 SHIB price has moved above the 25 and 50-day moving averages, which represent the first major signs of a reversal since February’s downtrend. SHIB price, 50-day and 75-day EMA chart — March 26 | Source: crypto.news The price bottomed out near $0.0000123, which is now acting as strong support. With SHIB climbing past those short-term moving averages, it looks ready to take aim at the 75-day EMA, which is around $0.00001575. SHIB MFI chart — March 26 | Source: crypto.news The Money Flow Index is also rising but still hasn’t hit the overbought zone. The MFI tracks buying and selling pressure, and with it heading up, it looks like buying pressure is overpowering the bears, which could help push SHIB even higher as long as the uptrend stays intact. Derivatives data also supports the bullish momentum. Open interest has climbed over 26% to $160 million, indicating a rise in capital flowing into SHIB futures markets. At the same time, its OI-weighted funding rate has turned positive. Given these positive signs, SHIB’s next potential target appears to be $0.00002485, which is around 65.7% above the current price level of $0.000015 and also marks its yearly high-to-date.

While the trading landscapes have changed, it appears highly bullish on the daily chart following a 35% surge overnight. The last four months have been tough for CRO following a back-to-back drop, but it stayed well above $0.068 this month and mounted support. It later initiated a buy and increased to $0.1, but quickly lost steam due to a rejection. This subjected the market to a two-week consolidation phase before starting this week on a strong note. That came with a quick surge, and the price exploded massively to a daily high of $0.116. The latest surge marked the asset’s biggest daily gain in four months, and from the look of things, it may repeat last November’s rally that sent the price to a new high. If not, it may resume bearish under $0.13. Now that the price has broken out from the consolidation phase, we can anticipate a trend shift if CRO reclaims the $0.24 level that stopped the bulls last December. The current monthly low is considered a crucial level for the bears in case of an extension. CRO’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview CRO’s latest surge is targeted at the $0.123 resistance that flipped as support during last month’s breakdown. Going higher, other resistance levels to watch above it are $0.1495 and $0.17. Currently, there are no signs of drops. Though, we may see a small retest at $0.103 and $0.09 if a drop occurs. Lower support levels stand at $0.077 and $0.0682.

Interestingly, someone even launched a crypto token on this, which was widespread in the crypto industry. Every time the stock’s worth grew, so did that token’s as investors built a connection between them. Interestingly, the gaming firm has also taken a step toward crypto adoption as the firm’s board member approved adopting Bitcoin, resulting in a 30% GameStop token price. Why? Let’s discuss this. GameStop Token Price up 30% Amid Bitcoin Adoption Approach GameStop’s board of members has unanimously approved the decision to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) for its treasury reserve. With an X post, the firm revealed the updates in the company’s investment policy, which now includes Bitcoin as a Treasury Reserve Asset. Interestingly, this decision aligns with MicroStrategy and Tesla’s BTC integration. More importantly, CEO Ryan Cohen had already hinted. Previously, he posted a photo of himself with Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor. The CEO of Strive Asset Management, Matt Cole, also urged the gaming firm to allocate nearly $5 billion in crash reserves to Bitcoin. Although the firm has not disclosed the allocation, this news was significant enough to boost the stock price. More importantly, the GameStop token price surged 30% and currently trades at $0.002365 with a market capitalization of $16.28M per CoinmarketCap . Additionally, investor enthusiasm has been heightened since Donald Trump signed the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, so this news is another bullish add-on. As a result, the investors jumped into the opportunity, increasing the trading volume by 82% to $9.18M. Experts believe the GameStop BTC adoption could influence the government’s decision to launch the reserve. GME Price’s 93% Drop from ATH Sparks Concern Although the recent surge is significant, there is more to go due to its prolonged downtrend. Under the influence of the bullish crypto market and Roaring Kitty’s post, GME token hit the ATH peak of $0.03201 in January 2024. However, ever since then, the downtrend has been persistent. It is now 93% down from the ATH as it lacked any significant bullish uptrend this year. More importantly, the market is also not entirely favorable as the investors’ bearish sentiments overtook. The firm’s decision to adopt Bitcoin for its reserve holding is the much-needed bullish push. Will the GameStop Token Price Rally Sustain? As the GME token price has moved down from the peak, it indicates that the investors’ sentiments aren’t confident enough. Moreover, its prolonged downtrend is still in the chart, and the short-term surge could result in sellers jumping into taking the profit. If the investors’ optimism remains high around this Bitcoin integration, the rally can be sustained. However, it will require further updates, BTC buying news, and similar factors. Notably, MicroStrategy’s BTC buying resulted in the MSTR stock price rally ; the GME stock price may witness similar results, directly influencing the GameStop token price.

This renewed push follows a major legal win: the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple , marking a significant milestone for both the company and the wider crypto industry. The SEC first sued Ripple in December 2020, claiming its XRP token was an unregistered security. That case now appears closed. The SEC has returned the $75 million fine and withdrawn its appeal. Ripple is now allowed to sell XRP to institutional investors without restrictions. “This is the moment we’ve been waiting for,” Garlinghouse said, celebrating the outcome. Despite legal challenges in the U.S., Ripple has continued its operations in payments and securities. Garlinghouse says the U.S. remains a key market . With the legal cloud lifted, Ripple is aiming to grow its American client base and reduce reliance on international customers. Ripple’s expansion aligns with a more crypto-friendly political climate. Under President Donald Trump’s second term, policies supporting digital assets are gaining ground. Trump recently created a Crypto Advisory Council, and Garlinghouse is reportedly in discussions to join. This adds to the momentum behind Ripple’s U.S. ambitions. Another boost comes from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which now allows U.S. banks and savings associations to offer crypto and stablecoin custody services without prior approval. This change follows past backlash over Operation Choke Point 2.0, which was seen as overly aggressive against crypto companies. With new regulatory guidance, U.S. banks are becoming more open to blockchain-based financial tools. Ripple now has the chance to work with banks on cross-border payments using XRP , as well as digital asset custody services. This opens the door to fresh partnerships and growth. Still, Ripple faces stiff competition. Dominant stablecoins like USDT and USDC continue to control most of the crypto payments market. Ripple must also deal with lingering uncertainty in U.S. crypto regulations, even if the SEC has stepped back. Overall, the end of the lawsuit gives Ripple room to grow and refocus its energy on U.S. expansion. With changing laws, friendlier leadership in Washington, and ongoing banking reforms, the environment is shifting in Ripple’s favor. Garlinghouse’s optimism reflects this opportunity, though the road ahead still requires navigating competitive and legal hurdles. Ripple is banking on its technology, partnerships, and reputation to stand out in a crowded field. The U.S. push is a key part of its strategy, especially now that the SEC is no longer blocking its path.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-26 08:12:22

Wilson says in a CNBC interview that the stock market rally currently being experienced is unlikely to last long. “It’s going to remain volatile through the end of the second quarter. So whatever rally we’re getting now, we think probably ends up fading into earnings into May and June, and it will probably make a more durable low later in the year.” According to Wilson, fundamental factors are driving the stock market lower. “At the end of the day, I mean, everybody’s talking about tariffs right now. But the reason the markets are lower over the course of the last three or four months has nothing to do with tariffs. It’s mostly to do with the fact that earnings revisions have rolled over, the Fed stopped cutting rates, you had stricter enforcement on immigration, you have DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency). All those things are growth-negative. And then tariffs is just kind of the final piece that kind of got people really kind of bearish at the end.” The Morgan Stanley chief investment officer further says that President Donald Trump’s presumed nonchalance over the stock market has had a negative impact. “And I would say the thing that really got the S&P going down at the very end was when it became clear that the [U.S.] President does not care about the stock market, at least for now. And that that, you know, lack of a Trump put was like really new news to people.” The S&P 500 is down by around 6% from the all-time high of 6,147 points reached on February 19th. ?

42364047,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143365,1742980551,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Bitcoin Investment Alert: T. Rowe Price Exec Says Now Is the Smart Time to Buy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/smart-time-bitcoin-investment-exposure/,"Is now the right time to jump into the world of Bitcoin? A top executive at investment giant T. Rowe Price seems to think so! Dominic Rizzo, a global technology portfolio manager, recently shared some compelling insights at the Exchange conference in Las Vegas that have the crypto world buzzing. Let’s dive into why he believes now is an opportune time to gain Bitcoin exposure and what this could mean for you. Why Now is an Opportune Time for Bitcoin Investment? Rizzo’s optimism isn’t based on hype or speculation. It’s grounded in market fundamentals. He highlighted a key factor that often goes unnoticed by casual observers: Bitcoin’s price in relation to its mining cost . According to a CoinDesk report, Rizzo pointed out that Bitcoin is currently trading very close to its average mining cost. This is a crucial point because, in the world of commodities, this alignment has historically signaled a prime buying opportunity. Think of it like this: Mining Cost as a Floor: The cost to mine Bitcoin represents a sort of ‘floor’ price. Miners, who invest heavily in equipment and energy, are less likely to sell Bitcoin below their cost of production for extended periods. Historical Precedent: Historically, when Bitcoin’s price nears its mining cost, it has often preceded periods of price appreciation. This is because it becomes less profitable for miners to operate, potentially reducing supply and creating upward pressure on price. Current Mining Cost: MacroMicro blog estimates the average Bitcoin mining cost to be around $84,770. While this figure can fluctuate based on various factors like energy prices and mining difficulty, it provides a valuable benchmark. The Commodity Comparison: A Smart Perspective on Bitcoin Exposure Rizzo draws a parallel between Bitcoin and traditional commodities, and this comparison is quite insightful for understanding the current Bitcoin investment landscape. Commodities, like gold or oil, have production costs that influence their price. When the market price dips close to the cost of production, it often signals undervaluation and a potential buying opportunity. Here’s a breakdown of why this commodity comparison is relevant: Feature Traditional Commodities (e.g., Gold, Oil) Bitcoin Production Cost Mining, extraction, refining Bitcoin mining (electricity, hardware) Price Floor Cost of production acts as a natural price floor Bitcoin mining cost can act as a price floor Investment Signal Price near production cost can signal undervaluation Bitcoin price near mining cost may indicate a buying opportunity By viewing Bitcoin through this lens, Rizzo offers a more grounded and less speculative perspective on its investment potential. It’s not just about hype; it’s about fundamental economics. Beyond Bitcoin: Embracing Cryptocurrency Exposure in Fintech and AI Rizzo’s bullishness extends beyond just Bitcoin. He’s a strong advocate for broader cryptocurrency exposure , particularly within the rapidly evolving sectors of fintech and artificial intelligence (AI). He emphasizes the crucial role of blockchain and digital payments in these domains. Why is this important? Consider these points: Fintech Revolution: Fintech is fundamentally reshaping financial services, and digital payments, often powered by blockchain technology, are at its core. Companies like Coinbase and Robinhood are leading this charge, offering accessible platforms for crypto trading and investment. AI and Crypto Synergies: The intersection of AI and crypto is becoming increasingly significant. Crypto miners, for example, are leveraging AI to optimize their operations, enhance efficiency, and manage energy consumption. This synergy presents new investment avenues. Diversification is Key: Rizzo suggests that every investor should consider having some level of exposure to these areas. This doesn’t necessarily mean going all-in on a single cryptocurrency, but rather diversifying across different assets and companies within the crypto and blockchain ecosystem. How Can You Gain Cryptocurrency Exposure? Actionable Insights So, how can you, as an investor, take advantage of this potentially opportune time to gain Bitcoin exposure and the broader crypto market? Rizzo suggests a few avenues: Invest in Crypto Stocks: Consider investing in publicly traded companies that are heavily involved in the crypto space. Examples include: Coinbase (COIN): A leading cryptocurrency exchange platform. Coinbase Official Website Robinhood (HOOD): A popular brokerage app offering crypto trading. Robinhood Official Website Explore Crypto Mining Stocks: Companies involved in Bitcoin mining, especially those innovating with AI, could offer interesting investment opportunities. Research publicly listed mining companies and their AI initiatives. Direct Bitcoin Investment: For those comfortable with the risks and complexities, direct investment in Bitcoin through reputable exchanges remains a viable option. Remember to do thorough research and understand the volatility involved. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes, including a mix of traditional stocks, bonds, and crypto assets, to manage risk effectively. Important Note: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky and volatile. Always conduct your own thorough research, understand your risk tolerance, and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions. Seize the Moment: Is Bitcoin’s Bottom Near? Dominic Rizzo’s perspective offers a compelling argument for considering Bitcoin investment right now. The alignment of Bitcoin’s price with its mining cost, coupled with the broader growth potential of fintech and AI-driven crypto innovations, paints a picture of opportunity.

In a recent X post , Pavlovski said the Canada-based online video platform plans to launch its own crypto wallet to help fund creators on the space. He informed his followers that the video platform will collaborate with leading stablecoin issuer Tether ( USDT ) to establish the Rumble wallet. “Rumble Wallet will be the vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets, and with the help of Tether,” said Pavolvski. The video platform CEO claimed the wallet will be “bigger and more than you think,” before saying that he will reveal more details about the firm’s plans to establish its own wallet on an interview with content creator Matt Kohrs. A wallet for the people https://t.co/lg6GRR6vfP — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) March 26, 2025 Not long after Pavolvski’s announcement, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino reposted Pavolvski’s post with the caption stating “A wallet for the people.” Ardoino’s post seemingly confirms that his firm is onboard to collaborate with the video platform in creating its digital wallet. In December 2024, Tether invested $775 million in the video platform to boost its development. The company used $250 million from Tether’s strategic investment to support its growth initiatives.

Recent reports reveal that Ethena now holds a massive $1.29 billion in BUIDL-I tokens. This substantial holding underscores the robust backing of USDe and signals a potentially groundbreaking shift in stablecoin security and transparency. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting news and what it means for you. Ethena and USDe Stablecoin: A New Era of Transparency? Ethena Labs, the entity behind this intriguing stablecoin, launched USDe in December of last year. What sets USDe apart in the crowded stablecoin landscape? It’s their commitment to transparency and a novel approach to backing. Unlike some stablecoins shrouded in mystery, USDe boasts a remarkable level of clarity, particularly in its asset reserves. And the latest data is nothing short of astonishing. According to a recent report from Arkham, a leading blockchain analytics firm, Ethena has just minted a further $225 million worth of BUIDL-I tokens. This activity, tracked on the blockchain just eight hours prior to the report, brings Ethena’s total BUIDL-I token holdings to a staggering $1.29 billion. This substantial increase reinforces the already strong foundation of the USDe stablecoin and signals a significant vote of confidence in Ethena’s strategy. Decoding BUIDL-I Tokens and BlackRock BUIDL Fund So, what exactly are BUIDL-I tokens, and why are they so crucial to understanding Ethena’s strategy? BUIDL-I tokens are essentially a representation of shares in BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) is a tokenized fund that invests in U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements, and cash. This fund is designed to offer institutional investors exposure to the U.S. dollar and short-term U.S. government debt securities in a tokenized format on the blockchain. Here’s why this is significant: Institutional Grade Backing: By holding BUIDL-I tokens, Ethena effectively backs a significant portion of its USDe stablecoin with assets managed by BlackRock, a globally recognized and respected financial institution. This institutional backing adds a layer of credibility and security to USDe. Transparency and On-Chain Verification: Because BUIDL-I tokens are blockchain-based, their holdings are transparent and verifiable on-chain. This allows anyone to independently verify the assets backing USDe, enhancing trust and accountability. Exposure to Traditional Assets: BUIDL Fund’s investment in U.S. Treasury bills and similar instruments links USDe to traditional, relatively stable assets. This blend of traditional finance with blockchain innovation is a key feature of Ethena’s approach. The fact that USDe is reportedly 90% backed by BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund, as mentioned in the initial report, further solidifies its connection to high-quality, liquid assets. This level of backing is a compelling factor for users seeking a stablecoin with robust and transparent reserves. The $225 Million Mint: Why Now and What’s the Impact on BUIDL-I Tokens? Ethena’s recent minting of $225 million worth of BUIDL-I tokens raises some interesting questions. Why this significant increase now? And what does it mean for the BUIDL-I tokens themselves? Possible reasons for this substantial minting activity could include: Growing Demand for USDe: Increased demand for the USDe stablecoin would necessitate a corresponding increase in its backing reserves. Minting more BUIDL-I tokens allows Ethena to scale its reserves to meet this demand. Strategic Reserve Expansion: Ethena may be proactively expanding its reserves as a strategic move to further strengthen USDe’s stability and resilience in the face of market fluctuations. A larger reserve base can provide a greater buffer against potential market volatility. Capital Inflow and Growth: The minting could be a result of capital inflow into the Ethena ecosystem. As more users adopt USDe and interact with the platform, Ethena needs to ensure adequate backing for the circulating supply. The impact on BUIDL-I tokens is also noteworthy. Increased demand for BUIDL-I tokens from entities like Ethena could potentially drive up their value and liquidity. Furthermore, it reinforces the utility of tokenized representations of traditional financial assets and their role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrency. What Does This Mean for Crypto News and the Stablecoin Landscape? Ethena’s massive BUIDL-I token holdings are more than just a large number; they represent a significant development in the crypto news narrative and the broader stablecoin landscape. Here’s why this is important: Raising the Bar for Stablecoin Backing: Ethena’s approach of leveraging BUIDL-I tokens and BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund sets a new benchmark for stablecoin backing. It demonstrates a move towards greater transparency, institutional involvement, and reliance on high-quality, liquid assets. This could pressure other stablecoin issuers to adopt similar, more robust backing strategies. Institutional Adoption of DeFi: This development highlights the growing interest and involvement of traditional financial institutions like BlackRock in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Tokenized funds like BUIDL are a crucial bridge facilitating institutional participation in crypto markets. Increased Investor Confidence: The transparent and institutional-grade backing of USDe, evidenced by the $1.29 billion BUIDL-I token reserve, can significantly boost investor confidence in stablecoins. In a market often plagued by concerns about stablecoin reserves and transparency, Ethena’s approach offers a refreshing level of clarity and security. Evolution of Stablecoin Models: Ethena’s model is contributing to the evolution of stablecoin designs. By combining decentralized mechanisms with traditional financial assets and institutional backing, they are pioneering a hybrid approach that could shape the future of stablecoins. For those closely following crypto news, Ethena’s progress is a story worth watching. Their innovative approach to stablecoins, particularly their strategic use of BUIDL-I tokens, is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and setting new standards for the industry. Actionable Insights: What to Consider For crypto enthusiasts, investors, and those curious about stablecoins, here are some actionable insights to consider in light of Ethena’s developments: Due Diligence on Stablecoin Backing: Ethena’s example underscores the importance of thoroughly researching the backing of any stablecoin you consider using. Look beyond just the peg and delve into the assets that actually secure its value. Transparency and verifiable reserves are key. Explore Institutional-Backed DeFi Projects: Keep an eye on DeFi projects that are increasingly incorporating institutional-grade assets and partnerships. These projects may offer a more secure and regulated entry point into the world of decentralized finance. Monitor Regulatory Developments: As stablecoins gain prominence and institutional involvement grows, regulatory scrutiny is likely to increase. Stay informed about regulatory developments in the stablecoin space, as they could significantly impact the landscape. Consider USDe for Stability and Transparency: If you are seeking a stablecoin with a focus on transparency and institutional backing, USDe and Ethena’s approach are worth considering. Their use of BUIDL-I tokens offers a unique and potentially more secure model compared to some other stablecoins. Conclusion: Ethena’s Bold Move – A Glimpse into Stablecoin Future? Ethena’s accumulation of $1.29 billion in BUIDL-I tokens is a powerful statement. It’s not just about the sheer volume of assets; it’s about the strategic choice of backing, the commitment to transparency, and the innovative approach to bridging traditional finance with DeFi. This development could very well be a glimpse into the future of stablecoins – a future where institutional backing, on-chain transparency, and robust reserves become the norm. As Ethena continues to evolve and USDe gains traction, it will be fascinating to witness the ripple effects across the crypto ecosystem and the broader financial landscape. The game for stablecoin dominance is far from over, and Ethena is certainly positioning itself as a formidable player, armed with a billion-dollar BUIDL-I token reserve.

The price is currently testing some critical levels, and there are a few things to keep an eye on in the short term. Key Levels to Watch According to an analyst , it’s important to look at Bitcoin’s moving averages, which can give clues about its direction. Right now, the 50-day moving average is sitting at around $90,000, acting as a resistance point. The 20-day moving average is just below the 200-day moving average , and this setup looks similar to past moments when Bitcoin has made a strong move up after consolidating. However, before anything major happens, Bitcoin needs to break a key price level around $97,000. If Bitcoin can stay above this level for a few days, it could mean a move higher, but this might take some time. Price Targets: $97,000 to $102,000 If Bitcoin moves past the $97,000 to $102,000 range, more resistance might appear. In this area, Bitcoin could slow down and enter a consolidation phase. However, if Bitcoin can push through this resistance, the long-term outlook might remain positive. Looking back at previous price actions, Bitcoin has gone through similar consolidations before seeing bigger moves up. Even if the market looks stuck, it may just be a part of the process before a larger rally. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction April 2025: Will BTC Hit $100K or Face a Pullback? , Altcoins: Waiting for Their Turn While Bitcoin has been performing well , many altcoins (other cryptocurrencies) are still lagging.

Most altcoins haven’t reached their all-time highs yet, so there’s room for growth. A rise in Bitcoin’s price could trigger movement in altcoins soon, especially as liquidity in the market increases. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Brazil’s approach to cryptocurrency is evolving along two distinct paths. On one hand, fintech giant Nubank is expanding access to digital assets by adding four major altcoins to its platform, offering broader options to its 100 million customers. On the other hand, the country’s data protection agency is reinforcing its stance on privacy, upholding a ban on financial incentives for biometric data collection tied to the Worldcoin project. Nubank Expands Crypto Portfolio with Four New Altcoins as Brazil's Digital Asset Sector Heats Up Latin America’s largest digital bank, Nubank, has made another bold move in the crypto arena by expanding its cryptocurrency offerings with the addition of four prominent altcoins: Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), Cosmos (ATOM), and Algorand (ALGO). The announcement was made on March 25, signaling the bank’s continued commitment to digital assets as part of its long-term strategy, even as competition intensifies in Brazil’s growing crypto market. This latest expansion brings Nubank Cripto’s total coin offerings to 20 and gives its 100 million clients in Brazil access to a broader range of digital assets. The four newly added tokens — with a combined market capitalization of $34.6 billion at the time of announcement — reflect a mix of proof-of-stake platforms and interoperability-focused networks, reinforcing Nubank’s focus on providing both depth and diversity in its crypto portfolio. The inclusion of Cardano, Near Protocol, Cosmos, and Algorand comes at a time when Nubank is riding a wave of financial momentum. According to Statista , the bank’s revenue skyrocketed to nearly $3 billion by the end of 2024, a remarkable jump from just $245 million in the first quarter of 2021. This financial strength has allowed Nubank to aggressively expand its services, including its crypto platform launched in 2022. The crypto integration began with major assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), USD Coin (USDC), and XRP. Customers can currently buy, sell, and swap these digital assets through the Nubank Cripto interface, which has become a central feature of its super app ecosystem. One of the key factors contributing to Nubank’s credibility is its backing from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. The renowned investment firm first injected $500 million into Nubank during its Series G funding round in 2021, followed by an additional $1 billion investment. From 2022 to 2024, Berkshire quietly increased its ownership stake in the bank from 0.1% to 0.4%, underlining Buffett’s sustained confidence in Nubank’s trajectory — even amid his historical skepticism toward cryptocurrencies. While Buffett himself remains cautious about digital currencies, Nubank’s blend of fintech innovation and conservative financial governance seems to have struck a chord with his team. The bank has positioned itself as a disruptor in Latin America’s banking sector, while also embracing emerging technologies that resonate with a younger, tech-savvy demographic. Brazil’s Booming Crypto Landscape Nubank’s aggressive push into the crypto market mirrors the larger trend unfolding in Brazil, which is now the epicenter of digital asset adoption in Latin America. With a gross domestic product (GDP) of $5.4 trillion in 2024, Brazil is the region’s economic powerhouse. It also leads in crypto trading volume, recording $6 billion in crypto trades last year alone. The local crypto market is heavily skewed toward stablecoins, which accounted for a staggering 90% of all digital asset transactions in 2024. But as interest in altcoins and decentralized platforms grows, platforms like Nubank are expanding their offerings to meet this demand. Meanwhile, international players are making strategic inroads into Brazil. Binance became the first crypto exchange to secure a broker-dealer license in the country this January, while UK-based fintech Revolut launched its crypto services in Brazil to capitalize on the growing appetite for digital assets. Nubank’s crypto journey has not been without its hiccups. In 2022, the bank announced it would allocate 1% of its net assets to Bitcoin as a way to signal its long-term commitment to blockchain technology. That same year, it launched a loyalty token program on the Polygon blockchain — an ambitious effort to gamify and reward user engagement. However, the initiative was quietly shelved in 2024. Despite these setbacks, Nubank’s forward momentum remains largely unchallenged. With a massive customer base, a growing digital ecosystem, and deep-pocketed investors, the bank is well-positioned to shape the future of digital finance in Latin America. Brazil Upholds Ban on Worldcoin Crypto Compensation, Citing Privacy Concerns Over Biometric Data Collection In related news, Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) has reaffirmed its decision to suspend financial compensation tied to the controversial World ID project, effectively halting Tools For Humanity's efforts to promote its biometric digital identity initiative in the country. The move represents a significant setback for Worldcoin’s global expansion, as regulators crack down on attempts to trade sensitive personal data for cryptocurrency. In a formal announcement made on March 25, the ANPD rejected a petition by Tools For Humanity — the developer behind World ID and Worldcoin (WLD) — seeking to reverse the agency’s earlier ban on offering crypto rewards to users in exchange for iris scans. According to the translated statement, the agency will “maintain the suspension of the granting of financial compensation, in the form of cryptocurrency (Worldcoin - WLD) or in any other format, for any World ID created by collecting iris scans of personal data subjects in Brazil.” The World ID project had only been active in Brazil for just over two months before the ANPD stepped in to ban all data collection efforts in January 2025. At the heart of the issue is whether financial incentives, particularly in the form of cryptocurrencies, can undermine a user’s capacity to make free and informed decisions about sharing highly sensitive information like iris biometrics. The ANPD launched its investigation into Worldcoin in November 2024, voicing concerns that the use of crypto payments could skew the balance of consent, especially in a country with high levels of income inequality. Despite a global narrative around technological innovation and digital sovereignty, Brazil’s regulators are drawing a hard line on the monetization of personal data — especially when the data is of a biometric nature. Tools For Humanity now faces a daily fine of 50,000 Brazilian reais (approximately $8,800) if it resumes any World ID-related operations in the country. The idea of creating secure, verifiable digital identities has gained urgency as the internet becomes saturated with bots, deepfakes, and synthetic media. On platforms like X, it is estimated that up to 15% of accounts are bots. Meanwhile, generative AI is being increasingly used to create fake personas for online scams, as detailed in recent research by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. World ID, based on biometric verification through iris scanning, was pitched as a solution to this problem — offering a way to authenticate real humans online. The digital passport created through World ID was meant to act as a privacy -preserving identity layer for decentralized applications and platforms in a world overrun by automated fraud. However, Brazil’s regulatory pushback reveals a growing tension between privacy rights and digital authentication in the age of Web3. In countries with strong data protection frameworks, the tradeoff between biometric surveillance and financial incentives is proving to be a controversial one. Emerging Alternatives and Privacy-Focused Solutions As Tools For Humanity grapples with resistance in Brazil, other companies are stepping in with alternative digital identity frameworks that don’t require biometric input. Earlier this year, Billions Network launched a privacy-focused platform powered by zero-knowledge proof technology called Circom. Unlike Worldcoin, this solution enables user verification without exposing or storing sensitive personal data. The platform has already caught the attention of major financial institutions, including HSBC and Deutsche Bank, which have tested the technology for potential applications in Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes and identity verification for cross-border payments.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|FIAT|NEAR|WLD,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-26 09:30:00

In the meantime, Mutuum Finance is causing a stir when it comes to presales — the third phase is already an impressive 80% done and tokens are being sold at $0.02 each. Those who get in early can potentially lock in a 25% profit before phase four’s $0.025 price increase, while the project’s tokenomics suggest explosive gains after the asset has launched. Whale Activity Signals Confidence in Dogecoin Recent whale transactions of Dogecoin signal interest from institutional investors despite rising volatility on the market. According to strategists, DOGE’s 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is approaching a parabolic trajectory associated with price rallies in the past. One prediction envisions a rise to $4.50, though naysayers wonder if that’s possible based on the meme coin’s dependence on social sentiment. And, while DOGE’s community-based momentum is still powerful, its way to a $100 billion valuation depends on speculation — a more dangerous plan than MUTM’s structured development model. Mutuum Finance Presale Gathers Speed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) – now in its third presale phase – has seen an impressive total of 6,800 holders and has already generated a total of $4.9 million raised since launch. For just $0.02, with the next stage of the token priced at $0.025 current buyers will already net a 25% gain. Phase-three participants receive 200% return due to the high listing price of $0.06. The launch of MUTM has generated reassuring market expectations that its price will rise to $3.50 by late 2025 because of its buyer-distribution functionality. Stakers benefit from an ongoing demand source that receives compensation through token purchases that use part of this revenue stream. In contrast with Dogecoin’s the up and down of viral hype, Mutuum Finance’s lending protocols — overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer negotiations — Base value on real DeFi utility. Long term token economics sustain demand Mutuum Finance has its mtTokens distributed through its ecosystem that accrue interest on each passing block to provide incentives for depositing mtTokens with the protocol for longer. Liquidity providers receive variable yields dependent on pool utilization, and borrowers obtain capital by locking collateral. Such stability is critical, a necessity that is non-existent in other speculative tokens. 40% of MUTM’s supply is allocated for liquidity mining and partnerships as well as blocked of the risk of market saturation. And with a $100,000 giveaway that helped to skyrocket engagement, the project is looking to cement itself as a DeFi mainstay, not just a passing fad. Audit Before Exchange Listings With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) moving to exchange listings, developers are currently finalizing the Certik audit, which is ensuring the safety of the smart contracts. Once completed, the results of the audit will be posted on social channels, bolstering investor confidence. The transparency of the audit coupled with burns of tokens related to the platform’s revenue will serve to lessen sell pressure, a clear leg up over meme coins that can fall into precipitate declines. Dogecoin’s 100 billion dollar market cap and Mutuum Finance’s 14,500% rally projections reflect the different mechanisms driving their growth: cultural momentum and systemic demand. Despite DOGE’s speculative upside, MUTM’s presale structure and utility-driven model provide a more quantitative roadmap to profits.

Imagine a world where state treasuries hold Bitcoin alongside traditional assets. Well, that future might be closer than you think. A groundbreaking development is unfolding across the United States as 26 states are actively pursuing Bitcoin reserve bills . This isn’t just about dipping a toe into the crypto waters; it’s about potentially diving headfirst, with some states considering allocating a significant portion of their funds to Bitcoin. Let’s delve into this exciting development and explore what it could mean for the future of finance and cryptocurrency adoption. Why the Surge in State Bitcoin Investment Interest? What’s fueling this sudden surge of interest in state Bitcoin investment ? Several factors are likely at play, signaling a growing acceptance and strategic consideration of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Here are a few key drivers: Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets: States are constantly seeking ways to diversify their investment portfolios to mitigate risk and enhance returns. With inflation concerns and fluctuating traditional markets, Bitcoin presents itself as an uncorrelated asset, potentially offering a hedge against economic uncertainties. First-Mover Advantage: Wisconsin’s pioneering move to invest in Bitcoin ETF holdings has undoubtedly turned heads. Their substantial $588 million investment in Bitcoin ETFs, as of Q4 last year, serves as a powerful example and perhaps a catalyst for other states to explore similar strategies. It demonstrates a level of confidence and potential profitability that others are keen to examine. Future-Proofing State Finances: Proponents argue that incorporating Bitcoin into state reserves is a forward-thinking approach to future-proof state finances. As digital assets gain prominence in the global economy, holding Bitcoin could position states at the forefront of financial innovation and potentially unlock new avenues for economic growth. Decentralization and Financial Sovereignty: For some, the appeal of Bitcoin extends beyond mere investment. It represents a move towards decentralization and financial sovereignty, reducing reliance on traditional financial systems and potentially offering greater control over state assets. Bitcoin ETF Holdings : Wisconsin Sets the Stage Wisconsin’s early adoption of Bitcoin ETF holdings is a landmark moment. Their investment of $588 million in Bitcoin ETFs is not just a number; it’s a clear signal that institutional and governmental acceptance of Bitcoin is rapidly accelerating. This move by Wisconsin can be seen as a significant validation of Bitcoin’s maturity as an investment asset. It begs the question: Will other states follow Wisconsin’s lead and begin accumulating Bitcoin ETFs as a strategic part of their reserve portfolios? The fact that Wisconsin, a state known for its prudent financial management, has taken this step speaks volumes. It suggests a thorough evaluation of Bitcoin’s potential and a calculated risk assessment that has deemed it a worthwhile investment. This real-world example provides tangible evidence and reduces the perceived risk for other states contemplating similar actions. Navigating the Landscape of Cryptocurrency Legislation The push for cryptocurrency legislation at the state level is a complex and evolving process. Each of the 26 states considering Bitcoin reserve bills will face unique challenges and considerations. Here are some key aspects of navigating this legislative landscape: Regulatory Clarity: One of the primary hurdles is the evolving regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies. States need to establish clear legal frameworks to govern the acquisition, custody, and management of Bitcoin reserves. This includes addressing issues related to taxation, security, and compliance. Risk Management Frameworks: Implementing robust risk management frameworks is crucial. States need to develop strategies to mitigate the volatility associated with Bitcoin and ensure the security of their digital asset holdings. This may involve establishing clear investment guidelines, diversification strategies within the crypto space, and secure custody solutions. Public and Political Acceptance: Gaining public and political acceptance for US states Bitcoin initiatives is essential. Educating policymakers and the public about the potential benefits and risks of Bitcoin is vital for fostering support and overcoming potential resistance. Transparency and open dialogue are key to building trust and ensuring responsible implementation. Operational Infrastructure: States need to develop the operational infrastructure to manage Bitcoin reserves effectively. This includes acquiring the necessary expertise, implementing secure storage solutions, and establishing procedures for monitoring and reporting on Bitcoin holdings. Benefits of US States Bitcoin Adoption: Beyond the Hype While the concept of US states Bitcoin adoption might seem novel, the potential benefits extend beyond mere hype. Let’s look at some concrete advantages: Benefit Description Portfolio Diversification Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets can enhance portfolio diversification and reduce overall risk. Inflation Hedge Bitcoin’s limited supply can act as a hedge against inflation, preserving the purchasing power of state reserves. Potential for Higher Returns Bitcoin’s growth potential could lead to significant returns compared to traditional low-yield assets. Technological Innovation Adopting Bitcoin positions states at the forefront of technological innovation and the evolving digital economy. Attracting Crypto Businesses States embracing Bitcoin could attract crypto-related businesses and talent, boosting economic growth. Challenges and Considerations for State Bitcoin Reserves Of course, the path to Bitcoin reserve bills isn’t without its challenges. States must carefully consider these potential hurdles: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a significant concern. States need to develop strategies to manage this risk and avoid potential losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, creating uncertainty for long-term planning. Security Risks: Safeguarding digital assets from theft and cyberattacks is paramount. Robust security measures and custody solutions are essential. Public Perception and Education: Overcoming public skepticism and ensuring adequate education about Bitcoin is crucial for gaining broader support. Operational Complexity: Managing Bitcoin reserves requires specialized expertise and infrastructure, which states may need to develop or acquire. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? This wave of Bitcoin reserve bills in US states has implications for various stakeholders: For Investors: This development signals growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, potentially strengthening its long-term value proposition. It reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a maturing asset class with increasing mainstream acceptance. For the Crypto Industry: State-level adoption can be a massive boost for the crypto industry, paving the way for further legitimization and integration into traditional financial systems. It can attract more talent, investment, and innovation into the space. For Citizens: If successful, these initiatives could potentially enhance state finances, leading to improved public services and economic stability in the long run. However, it also necessitates informed public discourse and transparency to ensure responsible implementation. For Policymakers: States considering Bitcoin reserves must prioritize careful research, risk assessment, and public consultation. Developing clear regulatory frameworks and robust security measures is crucial for responsible innovation in this space. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Digital Future? The fact that 26 US states are actively exploring Bitcoin reserve bills is nothing short of revolutionary. It represents a bold step towards embracing digital assets and potentially reshaping the landscape of state finances. While challenges and uncertainties remain, the potential benefits of diversification, inflation hedging, and positioning states at the forefront of financial innovation are compelling. Wisconsin’s pioneering move into Bitcoin ETF holdings serves as a powerful example, and the coming years will be crucial in observing how these initiatives unfold and whether this trend truly marks the beginning of a new era in state-level financial strategy.

The crypto firm also filed last week to launch a digital version of a U.S. money market fund at the end of May, in direct competition with asset managers BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Fidelity plans to establish its own stablecoin 🚨 @Fidelity is planning to launch its own stablecoin, fully backed 1:1 with U.S. dollars and issued on a public blockchain. Which is bringing us one step closer to tokenized bonds. https://t.co/asqj5CKCZ8 — Constantin Kogan (@constkogan) March 26, 2025 Fidelity Investments is planning to establish its own stablecoin amid the U.S. preparing its first regulatory framework for digital assets. The leading asset manager is also in the advanced stages of testing its token and is planning to unveil it soon. Two people with knowledge of the plans revealed that the company’s stablecoin is designed to act as cash in digital currency markets. The two individuals also disclosed that the firm’s stablecoin will be managed through its digital assets arm. The asset manager is pushing to enter the crypto stablecoin realm, which is currently a leading agenda under Trump’s leadership and regime. The Trump family-backed project, World Liberty Financial (WLF), also revealed on Tuesday that its planning to launch its own stablecoin. U.S. President Donald Trump said during the White House Crypto Summit on March 7 that he hopes lawmakers will pass a comprehensive stablecoin regulatory bill before the August congressional recess. The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, also maintained that the U.S. government will use stablecoins to ensure that the U.S. dollar remains the world’s global reserve currency. “We are going to put a lot of thought into the stablecoin regime, and as President Trump has directed, we are going to keep the U.S. dollar the dominant reserve currency in the world, and we will use stablecoins to do that.” – Scott Bessent , The U.S. Treasury Secretary. Bessent also noted that he would partner with the Office of the Controller of the Currency and the IRS to withdraw any guidance that undermined the digital asset markets. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller said at a central banking-focused conference on February 15 that the popularity of U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins in decentralized finance (DeFi) may be helping secure the dollar’s dominance as a global reserve currency. Waller also noted that about 99% of stablecoin market capitalization is linked to the U.S. dollar. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress in June 2023 that the central bank considered stablecoins “as a form of money” and wanted a “robust federal role” in overseeing them going forward. Boston and New York’s Federal Reserve Banks acknowledged in September 2023 that stablecoins could inject instability into the U.S. financial system. Fidelity files for a tokenized Treasury fund Fidelity Investments filed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking to register a tokenized treasury fund called Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX). The firm also wants to use blockchains as a transfer agent. FYHXX was launched late last year and holds cash and U.S. Treasury securities. The filing noted that the OnChain share class of the fund currently uses the Ethereum network and the firm may expand to other blockchains in the future. The asset manager expects the product to become effective on May 30, but its registration is still subject to regulatory approval. Head of digital asset management at Fidelity Investments, Cynthia Lo Bessette, argued that tokenization could transform the financial service industry. She also maintained that one use case to improve the efficiency of capital markets was using tokenized assets as collateral to meet margin requirements in trading. The $5.8 trillion in assets under management firm is the latest company seeking to enter the fast-growing tokenized U.S. Treasuries space. BlackRock partnered with Securitize to launch a similar tokenized T-bill fund last March called BUIDL. Rwa.xyz analytic firm showed that BUIDL has become the market leader with nearly $1.5 billion of assets. Franklin Templeton’s fund has had around $689 million in assets since its 2021 debut. Co-founder of rwa.xyz, Charlie You, said that “Now they felt like they are able to do something and sped up their timeline a lot, whereas previously they were just watching.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Bitcoin Spot ETFs See $26.8 Million Inflows on March 25, Extending 8-Day Streak; Ethereum ETFs See Outflows In comparison, Ethereum spot ETFs faced net outflows of $3.21 million, with none of the nine Ethereum ETFs seeing any inflows. Steady inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs suggest that investors are growing confident in BTC as a long-term asset despite recent market volatility. This trend suggests continued demand for regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles, especially as institutions continue to show interest. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs struggled, reflecting a weaker sentiment in the ETH market. The $3.21 million outflow seen across all nine Ethereum spot ETFs highlights concerns about Ethereum’s current market position, especially in the face of competition from alternative Layer-1 networks. Market analysts suggest that the divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF flows could be due to factors such as institutional preference for BTC, uncertainties regarding Ethereum's regulatory status, and broader macroeconomic trends affecting investor sentiment. As Bitcoin ETF inflows remain strong, industry watchers will be looking to see if Ethereum can reverse its outflow trend in the coming days. *This is not investment advice.

However, now the wind is changing as the Pi Network community is buzzing with optimism as its domain auction sees overwhelming participation. With over 200,000 bids placed in just a week, excitement is building around the ecosystem’s growth and the potential for Pi Coin to reclaim the $1 mark . However, will this excitement stay as Binance has not listed Pi token yet, and the network is also dealing with other controversy and regulations yet the market hopes that it will make a comeback with this latest domain auction let’s see how true it will be. Pi Network’s Domain Auction Surpasses Expectations The Pi Core Team (PCT) has released an update on its domain auction, revealing that over 40,000 unique bidders are competing for 95,000 .pi domains. Nearly 3 million Pi tokens are actively being bid, with some domains fetching as much as 30,000 Pi. Notably, domains linked to big brands like Amazon and Samsung are attracting fierce competition. According to the PCT, this demand highlights Pi’s growing ecosystem, as businesses and developers see value in blockchain-powered domain ownership. These domains will help build Pi-based apps, businesses, and services, further integrating Pi into digital commerce. PCT’s Policy for Domain Auctions To guide the process, the Pi Core Team has released a policy document explaining how the proceeds will support Pi’s ecosystem. Funds from the auction will be reinvested into developer programs and Pi-focused events, encouraging further growth. Additionally, apps within the Pi ecosystem can secure domains without participating in auctions. However, . pi domains will require renewals, much like traditional domains, and currently function only within the Pi Browser. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Losing Trust? SuperNode Control Sparks Decentralization Controversy , Can Pi Coin Rebound to $1? In the meanwhile, Pi Coin’s price has slipped below $1, currently trading at $0.8862 after a 5% drop triggered by recent token unlocks and increased selling pressure. Despite this, community sentiment remains strong, with many believing a rebound to $1 is possible. A potential listing on Upbit is fueling speculation that Pi Coin could rally. However, skepticism remains due to ongoing concerns about the Pi Core Team’s transparency, which has kept major exchanges from listing the token. Whether this momentum will push Pi Coin back to $1 remains to be seen, but the enthusiasm within the community is undeniable. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The $5.8 trillion asset manager plans to launch the stablecoin through its cryptocurrency division, Fidelity Digital Assets, according to a March 25 report by the Financial Times citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter. The stablecoin development is reportedly part of the asset manager’s wider push into crypto-based services. Fidelity is also launching an Ethereum-based “OnChain” share class for its US dollar money market fund. Fidelity’s March 21 filing with the US securities regulator stated the OnChain share class would help track transactions of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), an $80 million fund consisting almost entirely of US Treasury bills. While the OnChain share class filing is pending regulatory approval, it is expected to take effect on May 30, Fidelity said.

The filing may provide insights about the SEC’s regulatory attitude toward Solana ETFs, according to Lingling Jiang, partner at DWF Labs crypto venture capital firm. “This filing is also more than just a product proposal — it’s a regulatory litmus test,” Jiang told Cointelegraph, adding: “If approved, it would signal a maturing posture from the SEC that recognizes functional differentiation across blockchains.” “It would accelerate the development of compliant financial products tied to next-gen assets — and for market makers, that means more instruments, more pairs, and ultimately, more velocity in the system,” Jiang added.

A positive sign for the industry is that the stablecoin bill may be on the president’s desk in the next two months, according to Bo Hines, the executive director of the president’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets.

42364665,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143447,1742982016,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Probe: Korean Regulator Investigates Coinone After Mysterious NIL Token Surge,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/korean-regulator-coinone-nil-probe/,"Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, but when a system glitch leads to a dramatic price surge and regulatory scrutiny, it’s time to pay attention. That’s exactly what’s happening in South Korea, where the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) has launched an investigation into crypto exchange Coinone following a peculiar incident involving the NIL token. Let’s dive into the details of this developing story and understand what it means for Coinone, Nillion, and the broader crypto landscape. Why is the Korean Regulator Investigating Coinone? The heart of the matter lies in a system failure that occurred shortly after the NIL token, the governance token of the Nillion network, was listed on Coinone on March 24th. Within minutes of listing, the price of NIL token experienced a significant spike. However, this wasn’t a typical case of market enthusiasm. Crucially, a system malfunction prevented users from selling their NIL tokens for approximately 15 minutes during this period of heightened price action. This inability to sell while the price surged raises serious questions about market manipulation and fair trading practices, prompting the intervention of the Korean regulator . Here’s a breakdown of the key events that triggered the investigation: March 24th: NIL token gets listed on South Korean crypto exchange Coinone. Post-Listing Price Spike: The price of NIL token jumps upwards immediately after listing. System Failure: A technical issue on Coinone prevents users from selling NIL tokens. Duration of Outage: The inability to sell lasts for about 15 minutes. FSS Investigation: The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), South Korea’s financial regulator, initiates a probe into Coinone’s handling of the situation. NIL Token Price Surge: System Glitch or Something More Sinister? The central question looming over this situation is whether the NIL token price surge was a direct consequence of a simple system error or if there were other factors at play. While system failures can occur in any technological infrastructure, the timing and impact of this particular glitch are raising eyebrows. Possible Scenarios: Scenario Description Implications Genuine System Failure A technical malfunction in Coinone’s trading system prevented sell orders from being processed. Potentially damaging to Coinone’s reputation, but may be considered an isolated incident if properly addressed. Market Manipulation The system failure was intentionally induced or exploited to manipulate the price of NIL token, allowing certain entities to profit at the expense of others. Severe regulatory penalties for Coinone and potential legal repercussions for those involved in manipulation. Inadequate Risk Controls Coinone’s risk management and system safeguards were insufficient to handle the volatility associated with a new token listing, leading to the failure. Regulatory pressure to enhance risk controls and compliance measures for crypto exchanges in South Korea. The FSS investigation aims to determine the exact cause of the system failure and assess whether Coinone took appropriate measures to prevent and manage such incidents. The outcome of this investigation could have significant ramifications for Coinone and the regulatory landscape of crypto exchanges in South Korea. Coinone Under Scrutiny: What are the Potential Repercussions? For Coinone , one of South Korea’s major cryptocurrency exchanges, this investigation is a serious matter. The FSS’s scrutiny can lead to various outcomes, ranging from warnings and fines to more severe penalties depending on the findings. The regulator’s primary concern is to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the financial market. Potential Repercussions for Coinone: Financial Penalties: Fines and financial penalties could be imposed by the FSS if Coinone is found to have been negligent or non-compliant with regulations. Operational Restrictions: The regulator could impose restrictions on Coinone’s operations, potentially affecting its ability to list new tokens or offer certain services. Reputational Damage: Negative publicity from the investigation can damage Coinone’s reputation and erode user trust. Enhanced Regulatory Oversight: Coinone will likely face increased regulatory scrutiny and stricter compliance requirements in the future. Legal Action: In extreme cases, if evidence of intentional misconduct or market manipulation is found, Coinone or its executives could face legal action. The investigation serves as a stark reminder of the regulatory challenges faced by crypto exchanges worldwide. As the crypto market matures, regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring fair and transparent market practices. The Broader Crypto Exchange Investigation Landscape This incident at Coinone is not isolated. Globally, we are seeing a growing trend of crypto exchange investigation and regulatory oversight. Regulators around the world are grappling with how to effectively supervise the rapidly evolving crypto industry while fostering innovation. Key Trends in Crypto Exchange Regulation: Increased Scrutiny: Regulators are paying closer attention to crypto exchanges, particularly concerning consumer protection, market integrity, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. Focus on Market Manipulation: Incidents like the NIL token surge highlight the potential for market manipulation in the crypto space, prompting regulators to enhance surveillance and enforcement. Licensing and Compliance: Many jurisdictions are implementing or strengthening licensing regimes for crypto exchanges, requiring them to meet specific operational and compliance standards. International Cooperation: Regulators are increasingly collaborating internationally to address cross-border issues in crypto regulation and enforcement. Evolving Regulatory Frameworks: The regulatory landscape for crypto is constantly evolving as regulators adapt to the dynamic nature of the industry. For crypto exchanges, navigating this evolving regulatory landscape is crucial for long-term sustainability and growth. Compliance, transparency, and robust risk management are becoming increasingly important for operating in the regulated crypto environment. Navigating System Failures: Actionable Insights for Crypto Platforms The Coinone-NIL token situation offers valuable lessons for all crypto platforms, highlighting the critical need for robust systems and proactive risk management. Addressing system failure effectively is not just about technical fixes; it’s about building trust and demonstrating a commitment to user safety and market integrity. Actionable Insights for Crypto Platforms: Invest in Robust Infrastructure: Crypto exchanges must invest in resilient and scalable technology infrastructure to minimize the risk of system failures, especially during periods of high market activity. Implement Redundancy and Failover Systems: Having backup systems and failover mechanisms in place is essential to ensure business continuity and minimize downtime in case of technical issues. Proactive Monitoring and Alerting: Real-time monitoring of system performance and automated alerts for anomalies can help identify and address potential issues before they escalate into major failures. Regular System Audits and Testing: Conducting regular audits and stress testing of trading systems can help identify vulnerabilities and improve system resilience. Transparent Communication: In the event of a system failure, clear and timely communication with users is paramount. Exchanges should provide updates on the situation, estimated resolution times, and any impact on user accounts or trading activity. Develop Incident Response Plans: Having well-defined incident response plans in place allows exchanges to react quickly and effectively to system failures, minimizing disruption and mitigating potential damage. By prioritizing system reliability and transparency, crypto exchanges can build stronger user trust and contribute to a more stable and mature crypto market. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Regulation The investigation into Coinone following the NIL token incident serves as a potent reminder of the ongoing challenges and growing pains within the cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the critical role of regulators in ensuring fair market practices and protecting investors. For crypto exchanges, the message is clear: robust systems, transparent operations, and proactive compliance are no longer optional – they are essential for navigating the evolving regulatory landscape and fostering long-term success. The outcome of the FSS probe will be closely watched by the crypto community and could set a precedent for future regulatory actions in South Korea and beyond. This incident is a wake-up call, urging the crypto industry to prioritize stability, security, and user trust as it continues to mature and integrate into the global financial system.

The company seeks to register an ""OnChain"" share class of its Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), which holds cash and U.S. Treasury securities and is available only to Fidelity's hedge fund and institutional clients. A Fidelity stablecoin could fill the role of cash in this fund. The stablecoin would enter an already crowded market dominated by the likes of Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC .

Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,612.24 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB’s price rose over the last 24 hours towards the resistance at $644.8. Buyers stepped in to buy the assets; moreover, the support floor at that level seems stable because the Bulls secured the level this week. In addition, the coin is still trading above the psychological mark of $600. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,612.24 by 2031. Recent news/opinion on BNB Binance founder and ex-CEO CZ reshared his post stressing mental health. He said if the crypto dip is stressful for you, then you should reduce your positions for peace of mind. He was replying to a question by a user who goes by the BillionAirSon, asking him his views on present markets. If you got shaken out during the dip, reduce your size to a level you can handle. Mental stability beats all market volatility. https://t.co/RRhEpBf3G6 — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) March 1, 2025 YZi Labs has announced an investment in Sign, a platform focused on on-chain infrastructure for token distribution and credential verification.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. In March 2025, BNB is trading near the psychological mark of $600.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-26 09:50:00
42364818,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143448,1742982618,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Crackdown: Google Play Blocks KuCoin & MEXC in South Korea,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-play-crypto-exchange-block/,"South Korean cryptocurrency users, brace yourselves for a significant regulatory shift! If you’ve been relying on certain foreign crypto exchange apps like KuCoin or MEXC through the Google Play Store, you might be in for a surprise. A recent crackdown by South Korean authorities has led to these apps being blocked on Google Play, impacting access for users within the country. Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it means for you. Understanding South Korea Crypto Regulation and VASP Registration South Korea has been stepping up its efforts to regulate the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. A key aspect of this is the requirement for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to register with the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). This registration process is designed to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, protecting users and maintaining the integrity of the financial system. Think of it as ensuring crypto exchanges operating in South Korea are playing by the rules, similar to traditional financial institutions. For foreign VASPs targeting Korean users, this registration is not optional – it’s mandatory. Operating without it puts them in a gray area, and now, the consequences are becoming very real. The FIU, operating under the Financial Services Commission (FSC), is taking decisive action to enforce these regulations. Google Play’s Crypto Exchange Crackdown: Why KuCoin and MEXC are Blocked? The recent action by Google Play is a direct result of this regulatory push. At the request of the FIU, Google has blocked access to the apps of 17 unregistered foreign VASPs, including prominent names like KuCoin and MEXC. This means: No New Installs: Users in South Korea can no longer download these apps from the Google Play Store. No Updates: Existing users will not receive updates for these apps through Google Play. Targeting Unregistered Operations: This move specifically targets platforms operating in South Korea without proper registration, aiming to protect Korean users from potential risks associated with unregulated exchanges. According to the Asia Business Daily, these platforms were actively targeting Korean users without going through the necessary legal procedures. The FSC confirmed that Google implemented the block on March 25th, following the FIU’s request. This isn’t just a minor inconvenience; it’s a clear signal that South Korea is serious about enforcing its crypto exchange crackdown and ensuring user protection. The Unregistered VASP Ban: What Does This Mean for Crypto Users? This unregistered VASP ban and the Google Play block have several implications for cryptocurrency users in South Korea: Limited Access: The most immediate impact is reduced accessibility to these specific exchanges via the Google Play Store. While users who already have the apps installed might still be able to use them (for now), they won’t receive updates and new users are completely blocked from downloading. Increased Scrutiny: This action highlights the increasing regulatory scrutiny on foreign crypto exchanges operating in South Korea. It signals a stricter stance and potential for further enforcement actions. Shift to Registered Exchanges?: The move might encourage Korean users to migrate towards domestically registered cryptocurrency exchanges that comply with local regulations. This could lead to a consolidation of the market and potentially benefit compliant platforms. Potential Workarounds (Use with Caution): Technically savvy users might explore workarounds like downloading APK files directly or using VPNs to access the Google Play Store from other regions. However, these methods carry security risks and might violate the terms of service of both Google Play and the exchanges, so they should be approached with extreme caution. Beyond Google Play: Is This a Broader Crypto Exchange Crackdown? While the Google Play block is a significant step, it begs the question: Is this just the beginning of a broader crypto exchange crackdown in South Korea? It certainly seems to be a strong indicator of the direction regulators are heading. The FSC and FIU are sending a clear message that operating in South Korea’s crypto market requires adherence to local laws and regulations. This action could be a precursor to further measures, such as: App Store Blocks on other Platforms: While Google Play is the dominant Android app store, similar actions could potentially be taken on other platforms like the Apple App Store. Website Blocking: Authorities could potentially move to block access to the websites of unregistered VASPs, further limiting their reach to Korean users. Enforcement Actions Against Users?: While less likely, there’s always a possibility of future actions that could indirectly affect users who continue to utilize unregistered platforms, though the focus currently appears to be on the platforms themselves. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users in South Korea If you are a cryptocurrency user in South Korea, here are some actionable steps to consider: Verify Exchange Registration: Before using any crypto exchange, especially foreign platforms, check if they are registered with the South Korean FIU. Registered VASPs are more likely to be compliant and operate within the legal framework. Explore Registered Korean Exchanges: Consider utilizing domestically registered Korean cryptocurrency exchanges. These platforms are subject to local regulations and offer a compliant way to engage with the crypto market. Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated on the evolving regulatory landscape in South Korea. Follow news from reputable sources and be aware of any new regulations or enforcement actions. Exercise Caution with Workarounds: While technical workarounds might exist to access blocked apps, be extremely cautious. These methods could expose you to security risks and potential legal issues. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Landscape in South Korea The Google Play block on unregistered foreign VASP apps marks a significant moment in South Korea’s cryptocurrency regulation journey. It underscores the country’s commitment to enforcing its rules and protecting its users. For crypto users in South Korea, this means adapting to a changing landscape, prioritizing compliant platforms, and staying informed about regulatory developments. The impact of this crackdown is likely to reshape the Korean crypto market, potentially favoring registered exchanges and pushing unregistered platforms to either comply or exit the market. It’s a clear signal that the era of unregulated operations is coming to an end, at least in South Korea.

XRP Price Predictions 2026-2030 Here we will analyse the price predictions for XRP for the next 5 years. Let's dive in. XRP Price Forecast for 2026 Looking at the XRP price prediction for 2026, the year kicks off with some momentum but it doesn’t stay consistent. Here’s a quick breakdown of what we can expect: Strong Start (Jan–Mar 2026) Average ROI in Q1: January: 19.54% February: 20.99% March: 21.11% Q1 could be a great time to buy XRP, especially for short-term gains Mid-Year Slowdown (Apr–Aug 2026) Average XRP price drops to as low as $2.22 ROI dips to single digits: June: 5.74% July: 7.01% August: 7.27% A clear shift in market sentiment, possibly driven by a lack of major regulatory developments Weak Finish (Sep-Dec 2026) Price stays flat, average tops at $2.30 in November ROI under 1% for most of Q4 December closes slightly higher with 6.41% return While early 2026 shows signs of life, the rest of the year feels like a consolidation phase. If you’re watching XRP predictions closely don’t ignore how fast things change in the cryptocurrency market. XRP Price Prediction for 2027 When looking at XRP price prediction models for 2027, we start to see more stability though not necessarily major growth. The year opens with mild momentum and finishes stronger in Q3 and Q4. Slow First Half (Jan–Jun 2027) XRP price ranges from $2.21 to $2.48 ROI stays modest, between 0.18% and 5.46% Technical indicators suggest consolidation with no major breakout Lack of institutional interest or surprises keeps things flat For those wondering, what is the XRP price prediction in 2025 compared to this? 2025 had some exciting spikes, while 2027 looks steadier, and more influenced by the broader crypto market. Momentum Picks Up (Jul–Dec 2027) XRP could climb to $2.87 by July July offers the highest ROI of the year at 17.27% August and November also show decent potential with over 10% ROI The average XRP price reaches $2.63 during strong months The most realistic XRP crypto price prediction here is continued growth at a moderate pace unless there’s a major shift in current XRP sentiment, partnerships, or regulatory clarity. If we zoom out, 2027 is a wait-for-the-moment kind of year. One solid quarter makes a difference, but we’ll need stronger price action or Ripple-driven catalysts to call this a bullish trend. In the meantime, if you're looking for the best cheap crypto options in 2025 with strong potential, $DAGZ is your top choice for future growth. XRP Price Forecast for 2028 The XRP price prediction for 2028 reveals a slow buildup until it suddenly doesn’t.Most of the year looks steady, then the last quarter comes out swinging. Slow & Stable (Jan–Oct 2028) For most of 2028, the XRP price stays in a tight range: Min price floats between $2.33 and $2.48 Max price stays under $2.71 until October Monthly ROI mostly sits between 1% and 7% If you’re wondering what is XRP price prediction for 2025 is compared to this year, 2028 is slightly stronger but still not explosive at least at first. While this period doesn’t signal a bullish trend, it may reflect Ripple’s continued efforts to push adoption while navigating the broader crypto market. Basic technical indicators show flat momentum with minor upside moves. November & December: Surprise Rally Out of nowhere, XRP surges in Q4: November max price hits $4.48 December max price skyrockets to $5.42 Potential ROI jumps from 4.80% to 121.35% This sudden climb could be triggered by external factors like: New regulatory clarity Large-scale adoption of Ripple’s ODL services Changes in current XRP price sentiment or trading volume It’s too early to say if this spike is sustainable, but it’s the most bullish signal since early 2026. While 2028 could be the beginning of something big for XRP, some investors might still be looking for faster gains elsewhere. That’s where projects like $DAGZ come in offering meme coin hype and smart contract utility backed by high-frequency bots. If you’re hunting for ROI while XRP crypto price prediction slowly unfolds, it might be worth diversifying. Will XRP Explode in 2029? If there’s one year in this whole XRP price prediction journey that grabs attention, it’s 2029. For once, XRP predictions look genuinely explosive and we finally get a peek at what the real upside could look like. Numbers Don’t Lie Just check the chart for 2029: Max price hits $7.72 in April Potential ROI peaks at 215.16% Consistent double- and triple-digit ROI from January to December Compared to the slow build-up of 2028, XRP’s price action in 2029 shows strength across the board. What’s Driving This Growth? Several factors might explain the shift: Ripple could win more exchange commission clarity in key regions Renewed partnerships and ODL expansion may increase the current XRP price A shift in bullish sentiment across the crypto market could lift all boats If institutional interest ramps up, we could see XRP close the gap with other altcoins Even with this momentum, XRP crypto price prediction models don’t yet support a full jump to $20. The max XRP price for 2029 sits under $8 still a massive jump, but not moonshot territory. Want in on faster returns while XRP builds slow momentum? A project like $DAGZ with staking, auto-bots, and meme energy might scratch the ROI itch while you wait for Ripple to deliver. Could XRP Hit $50 by 2030? Let’s be real most XRP predictions don’t back a $50 jump by 2030. Even with strong growth, the current price would need a 10x move. Unless something massive shifts like XRP becoming the go-to for digital assets globally it’s unlikely. Some technical analysis shows strength, but no confirmed bullish sign points to $50 yet. So while it's fun to speculate, even the most optimistic Ripple XRP price prediction doesn't call it a done deal. That said, if you're looking to buy crypto for faster gains, there are other plays worth watching.

Most XRP price prediction estimates for 2025 place it between $2 and $3, depending on recent developments and economic policies. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Highly unlikely. Based on its long-term outlook and current market cap, $100 would require an extreme and unrealistic surge. Will XRP reach $20? Possibly, but not by 2025. It would need massive adoption, regulatory wins, and a major push across social media platforms. Will XRP reach $500 by end of 2025? No. There’s no scenario in the current XRP price prediction models that supports a $500 price in that timeframe. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Crypto Options Signal Potential April Surge!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-volatility-crypto-options-april/,"Is the calm before the storm in the Ethereum market? Whispers of a potential volatility surge are circulating, and all eyes are on April. Decentralized options platform Derive suggests that Ethereum volatility might be gearing up for a significant climb. Despite the current subdued market sentiment, could this be the perfect setup for an unexpected price swing? Let’s dive into what’s fueling these predictions and what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. Why Ethereum Volatility Could Explode in April? According to a report from Decrypt, Nick Forster, the founder of Derive, a decentralized options platform, has highlighted key indicators suggesting a potential spike in Ethereum volatility . Forster points to the current state of implied volatility for ETH, which is hovering at monthly lows. Let’s break down the crucial points: Low Implied Volatility: Currently, Ethereum’s implied volatility for 7-day and 30-day maturities sits at a relatively low 59% and 45%, respectively. Forster emphasizes that these levels are historically unsustainable. Historical Precedent: Historically, periods of suppressed implied volatility in Ethereum have often been followed by sharp increases. This pattern suggests that the market might be coiling up for a significant move. Forward Rate Below Treasury Yield: Interestingly, ETH’s forward rate has dipped below the 5% yield offered by U.S. Treasuries. This unusual situation indicates a lack of short-term confidence in Ethereum’s price movement. Forster’s analysis suggests that this combination of factors – low implied volatility and weak short-term confidence – could be a potent recipe for a volatility breakout in April. But what exactly does this mean for traders and investors? Crypto Options Market Signals a Shift in Ethereum? The crypto options market provides valuable insights into future price expectations and potential volatility. Derive’s analysis of the options market is crucial here. Implied volatility, derived from options prices, reflects the market’s expectation of future price swings. When implied volatility is low, it suggests that options are relatively cheap, and the market is anticipating a period of stability. However, as Forster points out, this stability might be deceptive. Here’s why low implied volatility can be a precursor to a surge: Options are Undervalued: Low implied volatility means options are cheaper to buy. Traders might start accumulating options anticipating a future price swing, driving up demand and subsequently, implied volatility. Potential for Leveraged Positions: A lower forward rate, as observed by Forster, can make leveraged positions more attractive. Traders might be incentivized to take on leveraged bets on Ethereum, which can amplify price movements and increase volatility. Market Inefficiency: Sometimes, markets can be inefficient in predicting future volatility. Periods of low volatility can lull investors into complacency, leading to underestimation of potential risks and opportunities for sudden, sharp price changes. The crypto options market, therefore, isn’t just a side arena; it’s a vital indicator of potential shifts in the underlying asset, in this case, Ethereum. April Surge: Fact or Fiction for ETH Price? The million-dollar question is: will we actually see an April surge in Ethereum volatility? While predictions are not guarantees, the confluence of factors highlighted by Derive founder Nick Forster certainly paints a compelling picture. It’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and unexpected events can trigger price swings. However, the current technical setup, as analyzed through the lens of crypto options data, suggests that the probability of increased volatility in April is noteworthy. Key takeaways to consider: Monitor Implied Volatility: Keep an eye on Ethereum’s implied volatility metrics. A sustained upward trend could signal the beginning of the predicted volatility surge. Assess Market Sentiment: While short-term sentiment might be weak, as indicated by the low forward rate, changes in broader market conditions or news events could quickly shift sentiment and trigger price action. Risk Management is Crucial: Increased volatility means both increased potential for profit and increased risk of losses. Ensure your risk management strategies are in place, especially if you are trading or holding leveraged positions. The possibility of an April surge in Ethereum volatility is definitely something to watch closely. Whether it materializes as a full-blown explosive move or a more moderate increase, the signals from the crypto options market are worth paying attention to. As always, staying informed and prepared is the best approach in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Navigating Ethereum Volatility: Actionable Insights So, what should you do with this information about potential Ethereum volatility ? Here are some actionable insights: For Traders: Consider strategies that benefit from increased volatility, such as buying straddles or strangles in the options market. However, remember options trading involves significant risk. For Investors: If you are a long-term holder, volatility can present buying opportunities. Price dips during periods of high volatility might be attractive entry points, provided you have a long-term bullish outlook on Ethereum. Stay Updated: Keep abreast of market news and analysis. Volatility predictions are based on current data, but market conditions can change rapidly. Diversification: As always, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially in a volatile market. By understanding the potential for increased Ethereum volatility and leveraging insights from the crypto options market, you can better navigate the crypto landscape and make informed decisions. Conclusion: Brace for Potential Ethereum Price Swings The analysis from Derive founder Nick Forster paints a fascinating picture: Ethereum might be on the cusp of a significant volatility surge in April. Fueled by historically low implied volatility and weak short-term market confidence, the crypto options market is hinting at a potential breakout. While the future is uncertain, these signals are too compelling to ignore. Whether you are a seasoned trader or a long-term investor, being aware of the potential for increased Ethereum volatility is crucial. Keep your eyes on the charts, stay informed, and prepare for potential price swings. April could be an eventful month for Ethereum.

Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan delivered a detailed analysis in a dispatch dated March 25, 2025, stating, “Now is the best time in history to purchase bitcoin (on a risk-adjusted basis).” The memo, which includes reflections on Bitcoin’s early days and an assessment of its biggest milestones, offers insight into why Bitwise believes the leading digital asset’s risk profile has shifted dramatically in recent years. Best Time To Buy Bitcoin In his opening remarks, Hougan recounts his introduction to Bitcoin back in February 2011, when he was working as part of a financial analytics team at ETF.com. During a routine market review meeting, one of Hougan’s young analysts brought up the fact that Bitcoin had just crossed $1—a landmark event that triggered a discussion about its underlying technology and potential use cases. “If I had invested $1,000 in bitcoin after that meeting, it would be worth $88 million today,” Hougan laments in hindsight. This anecdote, however, is not simply a story of missed opportunity. Hougan underscores the risks that were pervasive at the time, emphasizing how the idea of transferring $1,000 to a “random PayPal address” through a nascent crypto exchange was a nerve-racking and largely untested proposition. Moreover, custody, regulatory clarity, and government oversight were virtually nonexistent, effectively turning any cryptocurrency exposure into a high-risk, high-reward gamble. “Throw in custody, regulatory, technological, and governmental risks … and putting $1,000 on bitcoin in 2011 was a massive gamble,” he explains. Related Reading: $31B in Stablecoins Piled Into Binance: Is Bitcoin’s Next Leg Up Loading? Central to Hougan’s thesis is that Bitcoin has, over the years, methodically overcome nearly every existential threat that once loomed. He notes that early attempts to create digital cash—such as the National Security Agency’s 1997 paper titled “How To Make A Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash”—never fully took off, making it far from guaranteed that Bitcoin itself would succeed. From there, improvements in trading venues and custodial solutions gradually reduced the barriers to entry. When Coinbase launched in late 2011, it marked a pivotal moment by offering a more user-friendly and trustworthy on-ramp for retail and institutional investors alike. Major custodial providers, including Fidelity, would later extend their operational and brand strength to crypto, further mitigating concerns over security and storage. Simultaneously, the once-pervasive fears of regulatory clampdowns began to wane. In 2024, the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US removed another major roadblock. Hougan observes that broader acceptance in traditional financial markets made it easier for institutions to justify adding digital assets to their portfolios without worrying about opaque regulatory regimes or insufficient market surveillance. “When bitcoin first launched, there was no guarantee it would even work. The incredible thing about bitcoin is it has slowly but surely knocked down each and every one of these existential risks over time,” writes Hougan, underscoring his view that Bitcoin’s evolutionary path has been one of measured resilience. Bitcoin Last Threat Is Removed One key question, however, continued to shadow Bitcoin’s rise: What if a major government decides to ban or severely restrict the cryptocurrency? Hougan points to a historical parallel: the US government’s gold confiscation order in 1933, enacted under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The measure aimed to consolidate gold holdings to strengthen government reserves, fueling a common fear among Bitcoin investors that a similar ban could stifle the cryptocurrency’s growth or outright render it illegal. “The US famously confiscated private gold holdings in 1933 to boost public coffers. Why would it allow bitcoin to grow large enough to threaten the US dollar?” Hougan acknowledges. This worst-case scenario, he adds, was often tempered by reminding people that if Bitcoin did become significant enough to rival the dollar, “you’ll probably have done pretty well on your investment.” Still, uncertainty remained—until what Hougan views as a decisive event occurred earlier this month. President Trump’s executive order establishing a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, signed in early March, seems to have addressed that lingering concern, Hougan says. By making a direct investment in Bitcoin, the US government effectively nullified the prospect of an outright ban, transitioning instead to a policy of strategic alignment. “And just like that, the last existential risk facing bitcoin disappeared before my eyes,” Hougan remarks. Related Reading: Bitcoin To ‘Brutally Bleed Lower’ Or Break New ATH In Q2, Expert Warns Critics have questioned why the US would endorse what could be construed as a competitor to the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency. Quoting Cliff Asness, founder of AQR Capital, Hougan points to the immediate query: “(I)f crypto is a viable long-term competitor to the US dollar, why on earth would we be promoting this direct competitor to our being the world’s reserve currency?” In Hougan’s assessment, the US government is positioning Bitcoin as a hedge rather than relinquishing monetary dominance. If the dollar’s primacy does come under threat, Bitcoin presents a more controllable or, at least, more transparent alternative than a foreign currency such as the Chinese yuan. “The best-case scenario for the US is that the dollar remains the world’s reserve currency. But if we get to the point where that’s at risk, we’re better off moving to bitcoin than something like the Chinese yuan,” he adds. Shifting Institutional Allocations On the institutional front, Bitwise has already observed a noticeable shift in how investors allocate to crypto. As recently as two years ago, holding 1% in Bitcoin or other digital assets was considered relatively aggressive for a diversified portfolio. This allocation was meant to capture speculative gains while limiting exposure to what still felt like a nascent, unpredictable market. Today, however, with a new level of government-endorsed legitimacy and more regulated pathways to invest, the firm is seeing more clients adopt allocations nearing 3%. Hougan notes that this trend reflects a profound change in perception: Bitcoin is no longer just a gamble; it is a credible alternative asset. “As more of the world wakes up to the massive derisking we’ve seen in bitcoin, I think you’ll see this number rise to 5% and beyond,” he forecasts. At press time, BTC traded at $87,865.

On-chain analysis (NUPL, holder behavior) indicates the current correction resembles previous healthy pullbacks rather than signaling a prolonged bear market. Institutional adoption, notably Citadel Securities' entry, strengthens long-term bullish fundamentals.

Click here to find out more » Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is currently at a price level of 84,000 USD, 23% below its ATH (109,000 USD) reached on Monday 20 January 2025, 60 days ago. In these 60 days, it has marked a local low of 76,000 USD as can be seen in the image below. The question here is, is Bitcoin entering a bear market, or is this a typical bull market correction, and will it continue to rise? We will address this by analyzing recent chain data, ignoring for a moment, that risk assets are influenced by macroeconomic factors, such as the recent proposed US tariffs. Price evolution (TradingView) What has happened in the chain? In the following graph, we compare the profit realised by STH (Short-Term Holders - seniority 155 days) when the circulating Bitcoin supply (orange) was at 95% or more in profit. We can see that there are sales and consequently profits made by holders at these points (green bars). The maximum profit-taking points in the 2018 and 2021 cycles have coincided with market caps or ceilings. In this cycle (from 2022 onwards) there are two major selling points, one at USD 74,000 levels and the other at USD 100,000. This was seen in the 2021 cycle, albeit less strongly in the second peak of realized gains. With this, we can conclude that a prior sufficient profit taking has occurred to consider a cycle change. Realized Profit vs Supply (Node Analytica) In the following image, we study the profit realized by bitcoin holders with respect to the NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit & Loss - color line). Here we filter by the peaks that have historically marked the top of Bitcoin cycles (NUPL: 0.72), which coincide exactly with extreme profit taking. In this last cycle those NUPL ratio peaks have not been reached, so we can expect that the market has not yet warmed up enough and there are Short-Term Holders who have sold as soon as they have taken profits. NUPL (Node Analytica) The BTC Net Realized Profit/Loss 30-Day Cumulative chart provides a clear overview of recent profit-taking and loss-taking activity in Bitcoin. It is evident that the red peaks coincide with significant local highs, indicating periods when holders have decided to make substantial profits. In the current cycle (2024-2025), two major profit realization events have been noted (around the psychological levels of $74,000 and $100,000), indicating significant profit taking. However, these events do not suggest the definitive end of the bull cycle. Instead, these corrections appear to reflect healthy and common patterns within an ongoing bull market. This lends further support to our primary thesis. The recent decline in Bitcoin prices is more likely to represent a strategic buying opportunity than the start of a prolonged bear market. Net Realized Profit & Loss Cumulative 30 day (Node Analytica) Below is a breakdown of the number of coins held by both STHs and LTHs. Historically, at market tops, the curves of the two lines have inverted until they are remarkably close together. This happens because the LTH investor, who is usually experienced, begins to make profits and a supply shift occurs from the hands of LTHs to STHs. In this cycle, although there has been a reversal of the two curves, we consider that it is insufficient to consider it an end of the cycle. Total Supply Held by LTH vs STH (Node Analytica) Continuing with our analysis, the next metric we propose is the Onchain P&L Index, developed by ourselves. It is calculated by linking three chain metrics, such as the MVRV (Market Value Realized Value, NUPL, LTH/STH Spent Output Profit Ratio) into one by means of a PCA (Principal Component Analysis). I won't dwell too much longer on the technical explanation so as not to bore the reader, but what the metric measures in general is the temperature of onchain activity at the profit or loss level. In this cycle, although we have briefly entered selling zones (coinciding with the profit taking discussed above), we believe that the metric is likely to return to that zone, with a corresponding price appreciation. On-Chain P&L Index (Node Analytica) On the other hand, and to conclude our presentation, we present the Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator metric. We have currently entered a ‘Bear’ market regime, but there are several reasons not to lose optimism despite this. The first is that, as the image shows, this cycle has not had any ‘Extreme Bull’ phases indicated by the red color, which is quite strange if we analyze previous cycles. The second important reason is that historically in bullish periods there have been corrections (30 - 35%) and we have entered ‘Bear’ regimes before reaching a market top. For all these reasons, we believe it is quite likely that Bitcoin has taken a breather, in order to continue its rise. Caused by the massive sales of some LTH at purely psychological levels (100,000 USD), the threats of the US government with its tariff hikes and the response of the financial markets to this new situation of tariff war. Bull - Bear Market Cycle Indicator (Node Analytica) Finally, institutional interest continues to grow significantly, exemplified by recent developments such as Citadel Securities' entry as a liquidity provider. Such moves by major financial institutions highlight a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, prompting additional inflows from large-scale investors. Furthermore, increased institutional participation typically translates into enhanced liquidity, reduced volatility, and more stable price action over time. Regulatory clarity from influential global economies—most notably the United States, which continues to implement supportive measures—adds further legitimacy and attractiveness to Bitcoin investments. This regulatory backing is pivotal as it encourages wider institutional and retail investor confidence, effectively laying a strong foundation for sustained long-term growth in Bitcoin's valuation.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-26 10:00:48

According to the Volusia County Division of Corrections, Armstrong was taken into custody at 7:18 pm local time and listed as a fugitive from justice. BitBoy Detained After Social Media Warning The arrest follows Armstrong’s March 21 social media post , where he confirmed that the warrant stemmed from emails he had sent to Cobb County, Georgia Superior Court Judge Kimberly Childs. Acting as his own attorney, Armstrong claimed his emails led to the judge deleting her social media accounts. This isn’t Armstrong’s first run-in with the law. In September 2023, he was previously arrested while livestreaming outside the home of a former business associate, accusing the individual of withholding his Lamborghini. Ongoing Legal Woes and Public Feuds Armstrong’s legal troubles extend beyond his recent arrest. In March 2023, he was also named in a class-action lawsuit alleging that he promoted Binance, which was accused of selling unregistered securities. The case was eventually settled in August 2024, with Armstrong and his co-defendant, NBA star Jimmy Butler, agreeing to pay a combined $340,000 without admitting wrongdoing. Earlier this year, Armstrong also made headlines outside the courtroom. On February 24, he participated in a combat sports event hosted by Karate Combat in Mexico, where he fought against the pseudonymous memecoin developer “More Light.” Armstrong emerged victorious by unanimous decision after three two-minute rounds. Following the bout, “More Light” described Armstrong as a “good guy” despite their public rivalry. Meanwhile, Armstrong’s professional life has also faced turbulence. In August 2023, Hit Network, the parent company of BitBoy Crypto, severed ties with him , citing alleged substance abuse and inappropriate conduct toward employees. Armstrong denied the allegations, claiming the move was part of an internal coup to oust him.

By merging meme culture with AI utility, Dawgz AI is positioning itself as more than just a joke—it’s a next-generation crypto project. Get ahead of your competition and join the Dawgz AI community The Strong Fundamentals and Real-World Utility of Dawgz AI According to their use and technology true cryptocurrencies better relate, as in, going for the long run. Meme coins can take off for remarkable, short term gains, but long-term growth potential is greater for projects that offer real solutions to problems or innovative alternatives. Dawgz AI is an example of such a project: It effectively combines that comic aspect of meme coins with the heads-up from the blockchain and AI technology in the company itself. The combination puts it in a unique position because, unfortunately, many projects miss the reflexive utility. The project has carefully structured its tokenomics to support sustainable growth, with 30% of the total supply allocated to the presale. This approach rewards early supporters while maintaining sufficient tokens for future development and ecosystem expansion. Dawgz AI’s roadmap outlines a clear vision through several strategic phases: Puppyhood : Foundation building and community development Growing the Pack : Expanding features and market presence Big Dog Stage : Major exchange listings and partnership development Alpha Dog Status : Market leadership and ecosystem maturity This structured approach differentiates Dawgz AI from many projects that lack clear direction or long-term vision. How Dawgz AI Stacks Up Against Other AI Cryptos While established AI cryptos like Fetch.ai (FET) and SingularityNET (AGIX) dominate the market, Dawgz AI brings a fresh approach by targeting meme coin enthusiasts with real AI applications. Comparison with Leading AI Tokens: Project Market Cap (2025) Key Focus Unique Feature Dawgz AI Growing rapidly AI + meme culture fusion Community-driven AI utility Fetch.ai (FET) $2.34B Autonomous AI agents Optimizes supply chains & DeFi Singularity NET $2.34B Decentralized AI marketplace 200+ AI services (healthcare, finance) Render (RNDR) $1.5B Decentralized GPU rendering AI-powered media creation While these projects excel in niche AI applications, Dawgz AI stands out by bridging the gap between meme virality and AI innovation. Why 2025 Could Be Dawgz AI’s Breakout Year Several factors suggest that Dawgz AI is poised for significant growth: 1. Rising Interest in AI Cryptos With AI adoption accelerating, investors are flocking to projects that merge blockchain with machine learning. 2. Strong Presale Performance Early-stage interest in $DAGZ indicates strong community backing—a crucial factor for meme coin success. 3. Ethereum’s Scalability Upgrades As Ethereum improves its transaction speed and fees, Dawgz AI benefits from a more efficient network. 4. Meme Coin Market Resilience Despite volatility, meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have proven their staying power. Dawgz AI adds AI utility to this formula, making it even more compelling. Conclusion: Is Dawgz AI the Next Big Crypto? The crypto market is full of surprises, but Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) has the right mix of community appeal, AI innovation, and strong fundamentals to stand out in 2025. While established AI cryptos continue to dominate, Dawgz AI’s unique approach could make it a sleeper hit. For investors looking for the next big opportunity, Dawgz AI’s presale offers an attractive entry point. Will this AI-powered meme coin become the next breakout star? Only time will tell—but the signs are promising. Check out the opportunities about Dawgz AI and its AI-driven ecosystem now, before it’s too late !

Nubank, a Brazilian neobank with over 85 million customers, is expanding its crypto offering with four new tokens, giving clients of its crypto arm, Nubank Cripto, access to Cardano ( ADA ), NEAR Protocol ( NEAR ), Cosmos ( ATOM ), and Algorand ( ALGO ). With this expansion, Nubank’s crypto portfolio now includes 20 assets, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and the USD Coin ( USDC ) stablecoin among others.

Shocking Decision About 17 Cryptocurrency Exchanges!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/south-korea-requested-google-accepted-shocking-decision-about-17-cryptocurrency-exchanges/,"According to a post by Chinese cryptocurrency journalist Wu Blockchain, Google Play has blocked unregistered foreign VASP apps such as KuCoin and MEXC in South Korea. Accordingly, Google has blocked access to 17 exchanges that are not registered in South Korea since March 25, upon the request of the South Korean government. South Korea's regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), said in a statement that 17 unregistered foreign exchange apps, including KuCoin and MEXC, have been blocked from the Google Play Store in South Korea. The FSC also stated that applications belonging to the exchanges in question cannot be installed and existing users cannot update. The FSC noted that these cryptocurrency exchanges were operating without proper registration while targeting Korean users. “It is expected that the domestic access blocking application of unreported businesses to Google applications will make a significant contribution to preventing money laundering through virtual assets and harm to domestic users in the future.” According to the FSC's statement, the blocked exchanges were listed as follows: “KuCoin, MEXC, Phemex, XT, Biture, CoinW, CoinEX, ZoomEX, Poloniex, BTCC, DigiFinex, Pionex, Blofin, Apex Pro, CoinCatch, WEEX and BitMart.” The FSC added that the criteria for evaluating the domestic business activities of exchanges are “1. Whether there is a Korean-language website, 2. Whether there are marketing activities to attract Korean customers, 3. Whether payments in Korean won are supported.” As a result, users in South Korea are no longer able to install or update affected apps via Google Play. *This is not investment advice.

According to data from crypto.news, Movement ( MOVE ) surged 32% to an intraday high of $0.594 on March 26 afternoon Asian time, while its market cap stood at $1.36 billion. Its daily trading volume also surged 7-fold over the period, reaching around $829 million. Most of today’s gains came after the Movement Network Foundation announced it had recovered around $38 million in USDT from a now-banned market maker that had been operating on Binance. The entity was originally brought in to provide liquidity for MOVE on the platform by placing buy and sell orders to help stabilize the price and support healthy trading. However, the market maker turned malicious and dumped 66 million MOVE tokens shortly after the token’s listing on Binance while placing almost no buy orders. Binance flagged this behavior as “market irregularities,” froze the market maker’s profits, and removed them from its platform. Movement Foundation, which has severed ties with the firm, has committed the full $38 million to a three-month buyback program called the Movement Strategic Reserve. Basically, they’ll be buying MOVE from the open market to ease selling pressure and pump more liquidity back into the ecosystem. You might also like: Here’s why SHIB rallied 10% today The buyback news kicked off a wave of whale accumulation . On March 24, wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion MOVE had about 553 million tokens. As of today, that number’s shot up to 953 million, meaning whales scooped up around 400 million MOVE in just the past 48 hours. At the current price, that’s over $185 million worth of tokens. On-chain metrics are also looking strong. Daily active addresses spiked by 265%, and social sentiment has flipped to positive over the past day. Source: Santiment MOVE price analysis On the 1-day/USDT price chart, MOVE has broken out of a multi-month falling wedge pattern, which is usually a bullish reversal signal and could mean a longer rally ahead. MOVE price, MACD and MFI chart — March 26 | Source: crypto.news The MACD and Super Oscillator lines are both pointing up, which confirms that the momentum is shifting in favor of the bulls and points to more upside in the short-term. Additionally, the Money Flow Index stood at 65, showing that buying pressure is picking up, but there’s still room for more before it hits overbought territory. Given these positive signs, MOVE could rally to its psychological resistance at $0.90, 65% above current levels. This has also acted as a key resistance level for the altcoin. A break above this mark could push it to target its yearly high of $1.12. However, if MOVE breaks below the lower trendline of the wedge, the setup might be invalidated. In that scenario, the altcoin’s value might sink to $0.37.

This adoption has sparked retail interest in Solana, with traders now wondering whether the altcoin could reclaim its previous all-time high and rally past $300. Solana Price in Focus as BlackRock Taps SOL For BUIDL Fund Solana price trades at $144 today with a slight 3.3% gain in 24 hours. SOL has been making a gradual recovery considering that its price has increased by 14% in seven days, indicating that a bullish momentum is building. SOL could extend its gains to a new ATH after the $1.7 billion BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) tokenized fund expanded to Solana. This move will bring real world asset tokenization to Solana, while bolstering institutional adoption. Securitize, a tokenization platform that is working with BlackRock for this product stated that the asset manager picked Solana for its scalability . “Why Solana? Solana’s high throughput, low costs, and scalability make it an ideal blockchain to support institutional-grade RWAs. By expanding to Solana, BUIDL is now more accessible to a broader range of investors and applications.” This launch highlights a bullish Solana price prediction and could aid a parabolic price rally. In this case, how high will SOL rally? Can Solana Reach $300? BlackRock’s adoption of Solana is bullish for price and could kickstart a rally to $300. A recent Coingape article also disclosed that Fidelity has filed to list a spot SOL ETF at the Cboe. This high interest from top institutions on Wall Street suggests that a major rally is bound to occur. Meanwhile, the daily Solana price chart also highlights a strong bullish momentum for SOL after it broke out of a descending parallel channel. This highlights a trend reversal as the bearish trend weakens. The RSI indicator stands at 52 after making higher lows. Its crossover above 50 for the first time in more than three weeks further suggests that buying pressure is gaining strength after sellers were exhausted. For Solana price to confirm the continuation of these bullish trends, the MACD line needs to cross over to the positive region. Once this happens and SOL breaks the resistance level at $177, it could fuel gains past the all-time high of $297 to $300. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Besides the bullish technical indicators and patterns, increased institutional adoption indicates that Solana price could rally to $300 soon. As buying pressure builds and SOL defends support at the upper trendline of the descending channel, a rally will happen.

This isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a powerful signal of institutional crypto adoption, potentially reshaping how mainstream investors engage with digital assets. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of finance and the cryptocurrency landscape. Fidelity Stablecoin: A New Era for Digital Assets? According to a recent report by the Financial Times, citing individuals familiar with the matter, Boston-based Fidelity Investments is in the final stages of developing its own stablecoin. This initiative will be managed under Fidelity’s digital assets division, indicating a serious commitment to expanding its footprint in the crypto space. Why is this significant? Institutional Validation: Fidelity, a titan in traditional finance, venturing into stablecoins lends immense credibility to the digital asset class. It signals to other institutions and retail investors that crypto is not just a fringe experiment but a maturing market. Expanding Crypto Use Cases: Stablecoins are crucial for bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto. They offer stability in the volatile crypto market and facilitate smoother transactions, making digital assets more accessible for everyday use. Fidelity’s Digital Asset Vision: This move aligns with Fidelity’s broader strategy to embrace the future of finance. Their dedicated digital assets division is clearly designed to explore and capitalize on the growing opportunities within the crypto ecosystem. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries: What’s the Hype? Fidelity’s stablecoin ambitions are intertwined with the emerging trend of tokenized U.S. Treasuries. Last week, the company took another significant step by submitting documents to launch a tokenized U.S. money market fund. Expected to launch by the end of May, this fund represents a groundbreaking move. But what exactly are tokenized U.S. Treasuries, and why are they gaining traction? Understanding Tokenized U.S. Treasuries: Digital Representation: Tokenization converts traditional assets, like U.S. Treasury bonds, into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token represents a claim on a portion of the underlying asset. Enhanced Accessibility: Tokenization can democratize access to assets previously limited to institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals. Fractional ownership becomes easier and more efficient. Improved Efficiency and Transparency: Blockchain technology offers enhanced transparency and efficiency in managing and trading these assets. Transactions can be faster, and settlement times reduced. Yield Opportunities in Crypto: Tokenized Treasuries can bring stable and regulated yield-generating opportunities into the crypto space, attracting investors seeking safer avenues within the volatile market. Benefits of Fidelity’s Tokenized Money Market Fund Fidelity’s move to launch a tokenized U.S. money market fund is not just about following a trend; it’s about strategically positioning itself at the forefront of financial innovation. What are the potential benefits? Benefit Description Low-Risk Crypto Exposure Offers investors exposure to the crypto market through a low-risk, regulated product backed by U.S. Treasuries. Yield Generation Provides yield opportunities that are often scarce in the traditional crypto space, appealing to risk-averse investors. Seamless Integration Facilitates easier integration of traditional assets into decentralized finance (DeFi) and other crypto applications. Regulatory Compliance Operating within a regulated framework enhances trust and attracts institutional capital that prioritizes compliance. Challenges and Considerations While Fidelity’s foray into stablecoins and tokenized assets is undoubtedly exciting, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that come with it: Regulatory Scrutiny: Stablecoins and tokenized securities are under increasing regulatory scrutiny globally. Fidelity will need to navigate complex and evolving regulatory landscapes to ensure compliance. Market Volatility: Even with stablecoins and tokenized Treasuries, the broader crypto market’s volatility can still impact investor sentiment and adoption rates. Adoption Hurdles: Educating traditional investors and ensuring widespread adoption of these new digital financial products will require significant effort and time. Security Risks: Cybersecurity remains a critical concern in the crypto space. Robust security measures are essential to protect investors and maintain trust in these digital assets. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Fidelity’s move into stablecoins and tokenized U.S. Treasuries offers several actionable insights for both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and those new to the space: For Investors: Keep an eye on Fidelity’s upcoming stablecoin and tokenized money market fund. These could offer new avenues for diversifying your portfolio with regulated and potentially lower-risk crypto exposure. For Institutions: Fidelity’s initiative serves as a blueprint for how traditional financial institutions can strategically enter the digital asset market. Explore opportunities in stablecoins, tokenization, and other crypto-related products. For the Crypto Community: This development is a positive sign of mainstream acceptance. Support and engage with regulated and compliant crypto projects to foster further institutional adoption and market maturity. Conclusion: A Transformative Step for Digital Finance Fidelity’s preparation to launch a stablecoin and its tokenized U.S. money market fund represents a transformative step in the evolution of digital finance. It’s a powerful signal that institutional giants are not just observing the crypto space but actively building its future. This move promises to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets, potentially unlocking new opportunities for investors and reshaping the financial landscape as we know it. As Fidelity pioneers this path, the world watches with anticipation, ready to witness the next chapter in crypto adoption.

As ETH investors eagerly await the new ATH, one analyst says Ethereum is preparing for a major breakout. Derive founder Nick Forster noted that Ethereum volatility could increase in April, which could be a sign of a potential breakout despite weak sentiment. The analyst said that Etheruem volatility is currently near monthly lows, with the 7-day and 30-day maturities at 59% and 45% respectively. Nick Forster noted that such low levels rarely persist and volatility could start to rise sharply in April. Forster noted that while volatility in Ethereum remains low, the ETH futures rate is now below the 5% yield on the U.S. Treasury, indicating weak short-term sentiment. But the analyst said this often leads to price increases because lower futures rates make leveraged positions more attractive and increase demand. “When forward rates are this low, leveraged positions become more attractive and demand increases. In the following weeks, we usually see sharp price increases.” Forster said that while investor sentiment may be in favor of Bitcoin in the short term, the Ethereum Foundation’s roadmap, which also includes the Etherealize and Pectra upgrade, could shift institutional interest back to Ethereum in the second half of 2025. The Derive founder recently predicted that there is a 30% chance that Ethereum will drop below $1,800 by the end of May, but a 19% chance that it will rise above $2,500. *This is not investment advice.

The geographical expansion is an important step in WhiteBIT’s ongoing efforts to expand its presence in the international crypto market. As of now, WhiteBIT has over 8 million registered users and offices in seven countries. WhiteBIT’s presence in Australia The WhiteBIT.au domain launched in December 2024, after months of paperwork and regulatory preparation. The company is now registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) as a Digital Currency Exchange Provider and Independent Remitter Dealer, meeting all financial regulations in the country. As for the features available to Australian users, WhiteBIT currently offers spot trading, with the rest of its product suite — i.e., those meeting the regulatory demands in the country — announced for the near future. Commenting on the expansion, Volodymyr Nosov, founder and president of WhiteBIT Group, stated: “Expanding into the Australian market presents a unique opportunity to engage with a highly crypto-savvy audience and a region that plays one of the crucial roles in the Asia-Pacific Region. Our goal is to contribute to the economic well-being and financial independence of both Australian and Asian communities while driving the adoption of blockchain technology on a global scale. This expansion marks a significant step in our mission to make crypto accessible to everyone.” Crypto adoption in Australia A part of the broader WhiteBIT Group serving more than 35 million users, the WhiteBIT exchange is well-positioned to capitalize on Australia’s growing crypto market . According to data published by Triple-A , around 9.6% of Australian citizens already own cryptocurrencies . This rate of adoption, coupled with the country’s stable economy in the post-COVID era, has made Australia an attractive market for the expansion of new decentralized finance ( DeFi ) services and crypto-trading tools. What makes Australia attractive is also the fact that cryptocurrencies and derivatives are emerging as viable investment options for younger Australians, especially, as these statistics suggest a potentially even higher adoption rate in the years to come. Australia also has a well-structured and clearly defined legal framework for crypto firms. This encourages domestic and international projects alike, meaning that WhiteBIT’s expansion aligns with the increasing mainstream adoption of blockchain technology in the country. To capitalize on the momentum even further, WhiteBIT will focus on creating a secure and user-friendly trading platform that caters to both novice and experienced traders.

There are rumours that the SEC will request the court to lift the injunction, which restricts the company from selling XRP tokens directly to institutional players. Ripple enthusiasts believe that if the injunction is lifted, the company will restart its institutional sales. Could Ripple resume selling XRP to hedge funds and private investors directly? Experts weigh in on what this development means for Ripple, the SEC and the broader crypto market. Read on! Ripple Withdraws Its Cross-Appeal Since the SEC legal battle against Coinbase was settled, there have been speculations that the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple might also be settled soon. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement about his company’s decision to withdraw its cross-appeal in the ongoing case between the company and the SEC confirms that the legal battle has reached its final stage. The injunction, secured by the SEC against Ripple, has affected the crypto company severely. It restricts the company from selling XRP tokens to institutional players directly. The SEC-Ripple Legal Battle: The Background Explained It was in 2020 that the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC commenced . The main accusation against Ripple from the US regulator was that the crypto company sold XRP without proper authorisation. In the US District Court in the Southern District of New York, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s institutional sales constituted an unregistered securities offering but determined that programmable sales did not fall under the same category. What Ripple’s Withdrawal of the Appeal Means for XRP The SEC has not yet made an official statement on whether it will request the court to withdraw the injunction against Ripple. Fred Rispoli opines that if the injunction is removed by the court at the behest of the SEC, Ripple can resume its institutional sales. Meanwhile, he emphasises that Ripple must revamp its institutional sales strategy even if the injunction is cancelled. He says: “Ripple’s institutional XRP sales still must conform to securities law but can now sell to say, hedge funds or private equity firms directly instead of to OTC desks first.” But they would have to do it a different way as the way they previously did it was found to be an investment contract and, although the injunction is lifted, the court finding has not been reversed on the cross appeal which is now not being pursued. https://t.co/Au5gqd8uMl — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) March 25, 2025 An X post by Bill Morgan notes: “the court finding has not been reversed on the cross appeal which is now not being pursued.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple’s $50M SEC Settlement Confirmed, But Where Are the Final Legal Papers? , Uncertainty in the XRP Community and Market Although the XRP community has welcomed Ripple’s decision to withdraw the cross-appeal, many XRP enthusiasts are unsure about how the development will influence the future of XRP. The XRP price stands at $2.47. In the last seven days, the XRP market has seen a growth of 6.6%. In the last one year, the market has surged by over 280.2%. At the start of this month, the price of XRP was around $2.14602. Currently, the price stands nearly 14.98% above where it was at the beginning of the month. Meanwhile, the price remains at least 18.73% below the peak of the month. In conclusion, Ripple’s withdrawal of its cross-appeal marks a crucial moment in its legal battle with the SEC. While the lifting of the injunction could allow the company to resume institutional sales, compliance with securities laws remains necessary. The XRP community remains divided, with some optimistic about growth and others cautious about regulatory uncertainty. As Ripple navigates this legal shift, its future market strategy and SEC decision will determine XRP’s long-term trajectory. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Recent analysis from BeInCrypto paints a concerning picture for PI, suggesting that the digital currency is grappling with significant downward pressure. Could this be a temporary dip, or is it a sign of deeper challenges for Pi Network as buyer interest seemingly wanes? Let’s dive into the details and understand what’s fueling this potential downturn in the crypto market analysis . Why is Pi Network Facing Downward Pressure? The core issue appears to be a decrease in buying interest. Imagine a tug-of-war where the sellers are pulling harder than the buyers. That’s essentially what’s happening with Pi Network (PI) right now. BeInCrypto’s analysis points to a critical indicator – the On-Balance-Volume (OBV). OBV Explained: Think of OBV as a volume detective. It tracks the flow of volume to predict price changes in cryptocurrencies. A rising OBV generally signals increasing buying pressure, while a falling OBV suggests the opposite – more selling than buying. PI’s Plunging OBV: For Pi Network, the OBV has taken a nosedive. It has plummeted to its lowest point ever, especially after a sharp decline since March. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a dramatic drop signaling a significant shift in market sentiment. Seller Dominance: This OBV trend strongly indicates that sellers are currently dominating the Pi Network market. More people are offloading their PI tokens than are stepping in to buy, creating a supply glut and naturally pushing the PI Network price downwards. Decoding the Price Chart: What Does the Trend Reveal About Pi Network Price? Let’s take a closer look at the price action on the charts. Analyzing the daily chart of PI against USDT on Gate.io reveals a clear and concerning trend: Downward Trajectory: The cryptocurrency price prediction for PI, based on recent trends, leans bearish. The chart illustrates a consistent downward trend. Since reaching a peak of $3 on February 26th, PI has been charting a course of lower highs and lower lows. This pattern is a classic sign of a downtrend in technical analysis. Resistance to Breakout: For PI to reverse this negative momentum, it needs to decisively break out of this downward trend. This would require a surge in buying volume and a shift in market sentiment. Lack of Tailwinds: Currently, there are no significant “tailwinds” or positive catalysts apparent that could propel PI upwards. Without a strong positive trigger, the path of least resistance for PI appears to be further decline. To visualize this trend more clearly, consider the following table representing potential price movements: Date Price Action Trend Feb 26 Record High of $3 Peak March – Present Series of Lower Highs and Lows Downward Future (unless breakout) Potential Further Decline Continued Downward Actionable Insights: Navigating the Pi Network Price Downturn So, what does this mean for you if you’re holding PI or considering investing? Here are some actionable insights: Exercise Caution: The current market indicators for Pi Network are bearish. Approach with caution and be aware of the potential for further price declines. Monitor OBV: Keep a close eye on the On-Balance-Volume indicator. A sustained increase in OBV could signal a potential shift in buying interest and a possible price reversal. Watch for Breakout: Observe the price chart for any signs of a breakout from the current downward trend. A break above recent lower highs, accompanied by strong volume, could be an early indication of a trend reversal. Stay Informed: The crypto market analysis is constantly evolving. Stay updated on the latest news and developments surrounding Pi Network and the broader cryptocurrency market. The Road Ahead for Pi Network Pi Network is currently facing headwinds. The declining OBV and the established downtrend on the price chart are clear warning signs. While the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and unexpected turns, the current analysis suggests that Pi Network needs a significant catalyst to reverse its fortunes. Whether that catalyst will emerge remains to be seen. For now, vigilance and informed decision-making are crucial for anyone navigating the Pi Network landscape.

Momentum is currently bearish but showing signs of potential bullish reversal; volume suggests institutional accumulation. Relative strength is flat; CLSK has underperformed the S&P 500 since March 2024 but could outperform if it exits the demand zone. Fundamentally, CleanSpark is an efficient Bitcoin miner, expected to increase earnings and revenues, and holds significant Bitcoin on its balance sheet. CleanSpark Overview In this article, I will outline a bullish thesis for CleanSpark, Inc. ( CLSK ) the Bitcoin miner , based on my technical analysis approach using price action, momentum, volume, and relative strength. I will also provide some key takeaways from the most recent earnings call. I last wrote about CLSK in February 2024 and a lot has changed since then from a technical and fundamental standpoint. Chart 1 – CLSK Weekly with 30-wk EMA, Momentum, Volume, and Relative Strength www.stockcharts.com When I am considering buying a stock, I always start with the price action. I prefer to buy stocks that are in uptrends. I use the weekly time frame to remove the day-to-day noise or fluctuations, and I like to use the 30-week exponential moving average ((EMA)) as a trend measuring tool. If the stock is above its rising 30-week EMA, I think that the stock is in a bullish uptrend. Conversely, if the stock is below its falling 30-week EMA, then I consider that stock to be in a bearish downtrend. CLSK falls into the bearish downtrend camp. It is below its 30-week EMA, and that EMA is trending lower. That’s the trend analysis. However, there is a bullish argument to be made regarding the price action of CLSK. CLSK is trading at a previous supply/demand zone. Supply zones are defined as price areas on the chart where sellers have come in and sold or distributed their shares to others. This is usually large institutional investors that unload their shares because they feel the stock is now fairly valued or perhaps overvalued after its previous advance in price. Another reason for the selling could be that a significant event happened in the company, industry, or economy that caused the investment thesis to shift negatively. Demand zones are the opposite of supply zones. Demand zones are price levels where big money comes into the market to accumulate shares after the recent decline because they think the shares are now undervalued. Institutional investors only accumulate shares because they think that those shares will rise in the future and become fairly valued. The blue rectangle in Chart 1 shows the supply/demand zone for CLSK. You can see that the blue rectangle acted as a supply zone in July 2023 when price reached that level after advancement and then sold off sharply over the next three months. CLSK then rallied past the blue rectangle toward almost $14 in December 2023. Then CLSK declined in price and there was a change in sentiment. The blue rectangle turned from a supply zone to a demand zone. Buyers stepped in when CLSK approached the $6.50 level. CLSK then advanced to $24, rewarding those who bought at the now demand zone. This action was repeated again in late August, early September 2024 as the price declined into the demand zone. Buyers again were rewarded as the price advanced from $8 to $18. Now the question is, if you buy shares here at this level, will you be rewarded? Only time will tell, but buying shares here gives you a couple of advantages. First, this demand zone has been tested two times before, so you know it is valid. Second, you know where the bullish thesis can be proven false. That would be a close below the blue rectangle. If the price plunged below the blue rectangle, then I would believe the bullish case for CLSK has run into serious issues. CLSK offers a bullish risk to reward ratio at this level, and perhaps starting a small position in CLSK at this level isn’t the worst investment decision. As a trend investor, I prefer to buy stocks that show bullish momentum, and I use the Percentage Price Oscillator ((PPO)) to help me measure momentum. When the black PPO line is above the red signal line, then the stock shows bullish short-term momentum. Conversely, when the black PPO line is below the red signal line, then the stock shows bearish short-term momentum, which is what CLSK shows now. When the black PPO line has a reading greater than zero, that shows bullish long-term momentum. If the black PPO line reads less than zero, which it does now, then the stock has bearish long-term momentum. CLSK has bearish short-term and long-term momentum, which makes sense as it is trading below a falling 30-week EMA. You can see that the black PPO line is flattening out and perhaps is turning higher, which is bullish. The black PPO line may cross above the red signal line in a week or two if CLSK moves higher from here. That would be a start of bullish momentum, at least in the short term. Right now, CLSK has bearish momentum and at best it is starting to turn bullish. Volume is the next technical element I consider when buying a stock. I want to own stocks that the institutional money managers are accumulating for the reasons I mentioned earlier. The volume pane in Chart 1 shows red and black volume bars. Red volume bars show the number of shares traded that week when price closed lower for the week. Black volume bars show the number of shares traded that week when price closed higher for the week. Last week there was significant volume and price closed lower for the week and price was inside that demand zone. It is possible that the high volume shown by the red bar was institutional money managers accumulating shares of CLSK. Relative strength is my last technical element to consider when I am interested in buying stocks. I want to buy stocks that are outperforming the SP 500 index. The relative strength ratio helps me determine that. When the black relative strength line is rising, that indicates that the stock is outperforming the SP 500 index. If the black relative strength line is declining, then the stock is underperforming the SP 500 index. CLSK has underperformed the SP 500 index since March 2024. You can easily see how the relative strength line is lower today than it was back in March 2024. Right now, relative strength is flat against the SP 500 over the last month or so. If the stock takes off as it did in previous times when it exited the demand zone, then CLSK has a chance to outperform the SP 500 index, but that is just speculation. Right now, if you buy CLSK you are not buying an outperforming asset, but that can change at any moment. From a fundamental standpoint, CLSK is a mining company that is expected to increase their revenues over the next two years and increase their earnings as well. On the most recent earnings call , CLSK management spoke about their plans to reach the infrastructure target of 50 exahash which is their next goal after achieving 39.1 exahash at the end of the most recent quarter. This infrastructure capability allows them to validate and mine bitcoin more efficiently than other mining companies, and this efficiency goes straight to the bottom line, according to CLSK CEO Zach Bradford. The hash rate subject is challenging to understand in my opinion. This article here helps explain the importance of hash rates to Bitcoin miners and the Bitcoin network. My main takeaway from a fundamental standpoint is that CLSK is a miner that holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet. CLSK has 11,177 Bitcoins on its balance sheet as of February 28th. Their average cost per Bitcoin is around $34,000. If you are bullish on Bitcoin, CLSK offers you a proxy vehicle to invest in besides Bitcoin itself. As Bitcoin moves higher, CLSK should move higher due to the fact that its most important asset is the Bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet. As I mentioned in another article , Bitcoin should do well in the future due to the United States and other countries seeing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. If my bullish thesis on Bitcoin proves false, then CLSK will continue to trend lower and eventually go out of business. Conclusion In summary, from a technical perspective, CLSK could merit a small position in a portfolio as it is coming out of a demand zone which has proven to be a good place to buy shares the last two times this demand zone was met. Buying at these levels gives you a good risk to reward opportunity. The momentum is bearish. Volume leans bullish, and relative strength is flat over the last month. From a fundamental perspective, CLSK is an efficient bitcoin miner that is expected to increase earnings and revenues over the next two years. It is investing in improving their infrastructure to be a more efficient miner. CLSK holds Bitcoin on their balance sheet and is a proxy for investing in Bitcoin. If you are a Bitcoin bull, starting a small position of CLSK at this price is not a bad idea.",CLSK,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-26 11:42:31

After years of legal battles with the SEC, which challenged XRP’s status as a security, the lawsuit is finally over. This newfound freedom has attracted interest from both retail and institutional investors, and with 17 ETF filings already in progress for XRP. According to an analyst, this combination of factors sets the stage for XRP’s price to surge in the near future. XRP Dominates ETF Filings XRP is currently the most popular cryptocurrency when it comes to ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) filings. In the United States, there are 17 separate XRP ETF applications. That’s huge because these ETFs can bring a lot of institutional investors into the market. ETFs help regular investors get exposure to crypto without having to buy coins directly, so it’s a big deal. Companies like Grayscale, Fidelity, and VanEck have already filed for XRP ETFs, which could boost the price significantly once approved. If XRP starts getting as much attention as Bitcoin and Ethereum, its value could rise dramatically. Big Institutions Are Buying XRP XRP isn’t just for regular crypto traders – big institutions are also buying up XRP. Ripple is working with 12 central banks globally to create their own digital currencies. Many of these banks are using XRP for their projects, and the demand for the coin is growing. Additionally, XRP is being bought up by major banks and financial institutions whenever new coins are unlocked from escrow. These buys are happening consistently, pushing the price up slowly but steadily. Ripple’s Global Partnerships Ripple’s partnerships with major companies and governments are another reason XRP’s price could jump. Ripple is talking to large banks in the U.S., and some of them are buying XRP in bulk. This adds more pressure on the price to rise. As central banks around the world build their own digital currencies on the XRP blockchain, the demand will only continue to grow. The Institutional Push The crypto space is seeing an influx of institutional money. Companies like BlackRock are now looking to invest in XRP, and when big players enter the market, they bring massive amounts of cash. This influx of money will push the price of XRP higher as demand increases. Conclusion: $20 XRP Could Happen Soon With 17 ETF filings and institutional money pouring in, XRP is on track for massive growth. When these ETFs get approved and more institutions start buying, the price of XRP could easily hit $20 – or even higher.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-26 11:45:06

Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) introduced the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in February. The legislation, which aims to establish regulatory clarity for stablecoins, passed out of the Senate Banking Committee on March 13th by a bipartisan 18-6 vote. In a speech to the committee earlier this month, Warren (D-Massachusetts) said the bill doesn’t protect consumers, national security or financial stability. “The bill lacks basic safeguards necessary to ensure that stablecoins don’t blow up our entire financial system. Under this bill, stablecoin issuers can invest in risky assets, including the very assets that were bailed out in 2008 and again in 2020. And anyone who thinks the US taxpayer won’t be called on, directly or indirectly, to bail out these guys out is kidding themselves. Circle, one of the largest stablecoin companies in the world, would have blown up in 2023 if regulators hadn’t bailed out its $3.3 billion of deposits at Silicon Valley Bank. This bill begs for more bailouts.” The potential legislation would require stablecoin issuers to maintain backing for their assets on a 1:1 ratio. The bill states that stablecoin issuer reserves can be made up of US currency; funds held as demand deposits or insured shares at an insured depository institution; and Treasury bills, notes or bonds.

The crypto market is buzzing with excitement as new meme coins take the stage, and investors are watching closely. One project making waves is Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), a meme coin presale that’s turning heads with its unique narrative and massive growth potential. While APC blazes a trail through uncharted crypto territory, other notable projects like Official Trump and Apu Apustaja are capturing attention in their own right. Official Trump has been stirring up headlines with its community-driven initiatives, and Apu Apustaja is gaining traction among meme coin enthusiasts. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Official Trump, and Apu Apustaja. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Burning Secret: Token Burn Mechanism Creates Scarcity One of Arctic Pablo Coin’s standout features is its revolutionary token burn mechanism. What makes it so exciting? Every week during the ongoing meme coin presale, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation, creating a deflationary environment that naturally boosts scarcity and, potentially, value. But that’s not all — once the presale concludes, any remaining tokens will also be burned, ensuring the supply is tightly controlled. These burn transactions are meticulously recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), enhancing transparency and trust. As supply diminishes, the value proposition grows stronger, making Arctic Pablo Coin one of the top cryptos to buy now for those seeking long-term sustainability in the meme coin arena. Crystal Cove Chronicles: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Adventure Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey has reached Crystal Cove — the 16th phase of its thrilling expedition. Each stage of this meme coin presale marks a new location in Arctic Pablo’s quest to uncover Earth’s hidden secrets. What makes this stage particularly special is the lightning-fast progression through previous stages, each selling out faster than the last. Currently priced at just $0.000083, APC offers a staggering ROI of 9552.41% from the Crystal Cove phase to the projected listing price of $0.008. With over $2 million already raised, investors are flocking to secure their tokens before the next stage pushes prices even higher. As each new location unlocks, entry points rise, making Crystal Cove a golden window to hop aboard before APC’s next leap. Official Trump’s Bold Move: Latest Developments Unveiled Official Trump is making headlines again, drawing attention with its latest community-driven initiatives. Recently, the project announced an exclusive NFT collection celebrating key milestones in Trump’s political journey. This limited-edition drop has sparked a buying frenzy, with collectors and crypto enthusiasts scrambling to own a piece of digital history. Adding to the momentum, Official Trump is enhancing its ecosystem by integrating cross-chain capabilities, enabling smoother transactions across multiple blockchains. This bold move is positioning Official Trump as a trailblazer in the meme coin space, solidifying its place among the top cryptos to buy now. Apu Apustaja Rises: Meme Power Turns Market Heads Apu Apustaja has been making waves with its rapidly growing community and playful, meme-centric branding. The project recently secured a major partnership with a popular social media platform, amplifying its reach and igniting interest among meme coin enthusiasts. Moreover, Apu Apustaja unveiled plans to launch a community-governed treasury, giving token holders direct influence over future project developments. This innovative step has strengthened investor confidence, cementing Apu Apustaja’s reputation as a rising star in the meme coin universe. Verdict: Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Tall Among Top Cryptos to Buy Now With meme coin presales capturing the imagination of investors, Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as a standout project. Its deflationary token burn mechanism, thrilling presale journey through Crystal Cove, and sky-high ROI potential make it a force to be reckoned with. Official Trump and Apu Apustaja each bring unique value to the table, but APC’s adventurous narrative and soaring momentum position it as one of the top cryptos to buy now. Don’t miss the chance to get in before the next location unlocks and the price rises again.

Technicals show 65% SOL price rally in play As of March 26, SOL’s price had entered the breakout stage of what appears to be a falling wedge pattern. A falling wedge forms when the price consolidates inside a range defined by two converging, descending trendlines. Meanwhile, the pattern resolves when the price breaks above the upper trendline. SOL/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView Solana broke above the upper trendline of its falling wedge pattern on March 19 and has since maintained bullish momentum. The breakout has held strong, with SOL continuing to climb in the days that followed. With the pattern confirmed, the SOL/USD pair is now eyeing $235, a target obtained by adding the wedge’s maximum height to the breakout level by April. Source: @THEFLASHTRADING The breakout is supported by improving momentum indicators. Solana’s relative strength index ( RSI ) has moved above the neutral 50 level, suggesting strengthening buying pressure. A move above the 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) at $154 could further validate the breakout. However, if SOL retreats from the EMA resistance, then the bullish reversal would be at risk of invalidation. Solana memecoin sector is in recovery Beyond the charts, Solana’s onchain activity is seeing a fresh wave of memecoin enthusiasm. Over 8 million tokens have been launched on Solana, and recent daily deployments have rebounded sharply. Notably, Solana-based memecoin launchpad Pump.fun witnessed the launch of over 34,000 projects on March 24, compared to around 20,190 launches at the month’s beginning, the lowest daily count since November 2024.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $36.8. By 2031, ICP’s price might reach a maximum price of $113.32. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. The network leverages advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $6.34 Market Cap $3,058,897,470.93 Trading Volume $69,260,079.36 Circulating Supply 482,042,497.24 ICP All-time High $750.73 May 10, 2021 24-h High $6.36 24-h Low $6.08 Internet Computer technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 9.41% 50-Day SMA $6.54 14-Day RSI 51.99 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 47 (Neutral) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $8.83 Internet Computer price analysis: ICP sees a strong uptrend TL;DR Breakdown ICP’s price analysis shows some gains. Resistance levels to watch are $6.340 and $6.446. ICP 1-day price analysis: ICP shows signs of recovery, but volume indicator is bearish The ICP/USDT chart for March 26 shows ICP in a bullish phase after testing the support levels around $5.60. However, the price still faces resistance at the 6.466 level, as shown by the recent rejection. ICP shows signs of recovery, but volume indicator is bearish The MACD supports the bullish turn, with green histograms solidifying. The OBV indicator shows a downtrend, indicating declining volume despite the recent price uptrend. This divergence suggests the bullish price action may lack the necessary volume support to sustain upward momentum. ICP price analysis for 4-hour: ICP approaches overbought conditions The 4-hour ICP/USDT chart shows the price closing in on the upper Bollinger Band at $6.340. The RSI is at 66.93, suggesting that the market is approaching overbought conditions. ICP approaches overbought conditions A positive CMF of 0.18 reflects buying pressure in the market, and the current bullish movement is supported by relatively strong accumulation. A break above the $6.340 resistance will confirm further upside. If this attempt fails, traders can expect a short-term pullback. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $7.58 SELL SMA 5 $6.91 SELL SMA 10 $6.71 SELL SMA 21 $6.08 BUY SMA 50 $6.54 SELL SMA 100 $8.29 SELL SMA 200 $8.83 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $6.13 BUY EMA 5 $6.62 SELL EMA 10 $7.72 SELL EMA 21 $9.01 SELL EMA 50 $10.03 SELL EMA 100 $10.04 SELL EMA 200 $9.85 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is making gains, and a strong CMF and nearly overbought RSI confirm bullish momentum in the meantime. However, a pullback might be imminent. A breakout above $6.340 could lead to further gains, while a rejection may bring a pullback to recent support levels. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Why is ICP up? ICP is up after bouncing off support at $6.15. The coin is now retesting resistance at $6.36, indicating growing buying pressure and the possibility of a breakout to the upside. ICP price chart Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 as early as 2028. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Will ICP reach $1000? Although its ATH sits at $750.73, attaining $1000 in the foreseeable future might be impossible. ICP is down 99% from its ATH and will require a massive turnaround in market fortunes to recapture previous highs. Does Internet Computer have a good long-term future? Yes, the Internet Computer coin shows a promising long-term future.

On March 21, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the South Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) said it was considering sanctions against operators that did not report to the relevant authorities. Authorities require virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to report to regulators under the country’s Specified Financial Information Act. At the time, the FIU said it was coordinating with the Korea Communications Standards Commission (KCSC), the regulator in charge of the internet, on how they could block access to the exchanges. By March 26, the FSC published a list of 22 unregistered platforms, highlighting 17 that had been blocked from the Google Play store. The move restricts new downloads and updates for affected apps, effectively limiting user access. A list of 22 overseas operators, highlighting the 17 blocked exchanges. Source: FSC Google Play restricts access to 17 unregistered exchanges The FSC said the 17 exchanges highlighted on the list were now restricted in the Google Play Store. This means their applications will not be available for new users to download and install. In addition, existing users will be unable to access updates from the apps. Exchanges in the access restriction list include: KuCoin, MEXC, Phemex, XT.com, Biture, CoinW, CoinEX, ZoomEX, Poloniex, BTCC, DigiFinex, Pionex, Blofin, Apex Pro, CoinCatch, WEEX and BitMart. The FSC expects the move to help prevent money laundering acts using crypto assets and potential future damages to local users. The FIU said it is also coordinating with Apple Korea and the KCSC to block internet and App Store access to the exchange platforms. KuCoin previously told Cointelegraph that it was monitoring regulatory developments in all jurisdictions, including South Korea. The exchange said compliance was essential for crypto’s sustainable growth. However, the exchange did not provide detailed information on its plans for South Korea.

In a post on X, he said the stablecoin could be ready for release within 4 – 5 weeks. Cronje tweeted on March 20 that his team had cracked the process and that work was ongoing with an algorithmic stablecoin. At the time, he added that the previous failure of algo stable tokens, particularly Terra UST, gave him PTSD, and he is not sure whether to implement this idea. He said: “Pretty sure our team cracked algo stable coins today, but previous cycle gave me so much PTSD not sure if we should implement.” Despite his worries, Cronje said the stablecoin will soon be ready. He went further to share projections of the stablecoin’s annual percentage yield (APY). At 10 million total value locked (TVL), it will generate 200% APY, at $100 million 23.5% APR, and $1 billion will bring 4.9% APY. The potential yield has now increased after recent developments. He said: “@YJN58 just found a way to turn this into 95.9% APY at $100m TVL, and 19.18% at $1bn+” While Cronje shared the potential yields that the stablecoin could generate, he did not provide any information on the project’s technical details, such as its collateral, on-chain controls, and algorithmic mechanics. Still, the new project appears separate from Sonic and Cronje’s other DeFi projects. His March 22 statement mentioned plans to “scale up and get a team for a full release.” Concerns trail potential algo stablecoin as many reference Terra UST Meanwhile, the crypto community’s reaction to plans for a new algorithmic stablecoin has been mostly negative, with many noting that it evokes memories of the failed Terra UST. The $40 billion crash of the UST in 2022 was the first domino that led to the eventual collapse of the crypto market at the time, leading to many firms going bankrupt. While the market has recovered, the idea of another algorithmic stablecoin promising significant yield has led many to compare the two incidents. Unsurprisingly, there have been many comments with an X user advising that Cronje should not take the lead on it so another person can go to jail. One user also suggested it should be named the Anchor protocol. Anchor was the DeFi protocol behind UST adoption. Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov also advised Cronje to rename himself Do Cron on X, a reference to the UST Terra founder Do Kwon . Kwon has been convicted of fraud and faces further criminal prosecution in the US. The failure of UST has also led many regulators to oppose algorithmic stablecoins Despite these concerns, some believe it is a good idea and will boost DeFi activity on the Sonic Network. Since rebranding from Fantom to Sonic, the layer-1 network has been focused on becoming the base-layer for DeFi with cost efficiency and speed. Stablecoins on Sonic is near $400 million. Source: Messari Efforts to attract DeFi instances have proven relatively successful, and Sonic’s stablecoin market has grown substantially in the past few months. According to data from Messari , Sonic’s stablecoin market cap is now close to $400 million, and it could soon go higher with native USDC coming to the network.

One moment you’re soaring with gains, the next you’re plummeting into uncertainty. Keeping a pulse on market sentiment is crucial, and that’s where the Crypto Fear and Greed Index comes into play. This insightful tool, provided by Alternative.me, just signaled a significant shift in the crypto landscape. Crypto Fear and Greed Index Climbs to Neutral: A Turning Point? As of March 26th, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stands at 47, a one-point increase from the previous day. This seemingly small jump is actually quite significant because it marks the index’s move from the “Fear” zone into the “Neutral” zone. For those unfamiliar, this index acts as a barometer of market emotions, helping investors gauge whether the crypto market is currently driven by excessive fear or exuberant greed. Think of it like this: when the index leans towards “Fear,” it could suggest that investors are overly pessimistic, potentially creating buying opportunities. Conversely, when it swings towards “Greed,” it might indicate an overheated market ripe for correction. The move to “Neutral” suggests a period of market equilibrium, where neither fear nor greed dominates, leading to a potentially more stable and less volatile trading environment. Decoding the Crypto Sentiment: What Does ‘Neutral’ Really Mean? So, what exactly does it mean when the Crypto sentiment shifts to “Neutral”? It’s not necessarily a signal to rush into buying or selling. Instead, it’s an indication of market indecision. Investors are no longer overwhelmingly fearful, but they aren’t aggressively greedy either. This can be a period of consolidation, where the market takes a breather before potentially making its next big move. A “Neutral” reading can be interpreted in several ways: Market Stabilization: After periods of high volatility and strong directional movements (either up or down), the market often needs to find a balance. “Neutral” can signify this stabilization phase. Indecision Among Investors: A neutral reading might reflect a lack of clear conviction among market participants. Investors might be waiting for more concrete signals or developments before committing to strong buying or selling actions. Potential for Breakout: Periods of neutrality can sometimes precede significant market breakouts. The pent-up energy during consolidation can lead to strong price movements in either direction once a catalyst emerges. It’s important to remember that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is just one tool in your investment arsenal. It shouldn’t be used in isolation but rather as part of a broader analysis that includes technical indicators, fundamental analysis, and your own risk tolerance. Understanding the Building Blocks: Factors Influencing Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn’t just pulled out of thin air. It’s calculated based on a weighted average of six different market factors, each providing a unique perspective on overall market sentiment . Let’s break down these components: Volatility (25%): Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the corresponding average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often correlates with fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares the current market momentum and trading volume of Bitcoin against its 30 and 90-day averages. Strong momentum and high volume can indicate greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment trends on social media platforms, primarily Twitter and Reddit, using sentiment analysis tools to gauge public opinion on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Surveys (15%): Conducts regular crypto market surveys, gathering weekly data from a large pool of crypto investors to directly measure their current sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s dominance in the overall crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal a “flight to safety” during fearful periods, while decreasing dominance might indicate higher risk appetite and greed. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Surges in searches like “Bitcoin” or “crypto” can reflect increased interest and potentially greed, while declines might suggest waning interest and fear. Bitcoin Sentiment and Beyond: The Index’s Broader Implications While the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is heavily influenced by Bitcoin sentiment due to Bitcoin’s market dominance, it provides insights into the broader cryptocurrency market as well. Changes in the index often reflect shifts in the overall risk appetite for digital assets. When the index indicates fear, it’s generally across the board – affecting not just Bitcoin but also altcoins. The recent move to “Neutral” could signal a potential easing of bearish pressure that has been prevalent in the crypto market for some time. It doesn’t guarantee a bull run, but it does suggest that the extreme fear that may have been driving prices down could be subsiding. This can create a more conducive environment for certain altcoins to potentially recover or even thrive, as investors become slightly more willing to explore opportunities beyond Bitcoin. Actionable Insights: Leveraging the Fear & Greed Index for Informed Decisions So, how can you actually use the Crypto Fear and Greed Index in your crypto investment journey? Here are a few actionable insights: Contrarian Investing: Many investors use the index as a contrarian indicator. Extreme fear (index values closer to 0) might be seen as a buying opportunity, as assets could be undervalued due to panic selling. Conversely, extreme greed (index values closer to 100) could be a signal to take profits or reduce exposure, as the market might be overextended. Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm signals from other technical or fundamental analysis tools. If your technical analysis suggests a potential bullish reversal, and the Fear & Greed Index is also showing a decrease in fear, it can strengthen your conviction. Risk Management: Be more cautious when the index is in the “Greed” zone and consider taking some profits off the table. Conversely, during periods of extreme “Fear,” you might consider dollar-cost averaging into positions you believe in for the long term. Market Timing (with Caution): While no indicator can perfectly time the market, the Fear & Greed Index can offer clues about potential market turning points. However, always remember that market timing is inherently risky, and the index should be used as a guide, not a crystal ball. Conclusion: Embracing Neutrality in the Crypto Rollercoaster The Crypto Fear and Greed Index shifting to “Neutral” is a noteworthy development in the ever-evolving crypto narrative. It suggests a potential pause in the prevailing fearful sentiment and opens up possibilities for a more balanced market. While “Neutral” doesn’t guarantee immediate bullish momentum, it provides a valuable perspective on the current emotional state of the market. By understanding and monitoring tools like the Fear & Greed Index, investors can gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics and make more informed decisions in the exciting, yet often unpredictable, world of cryptocurrency.

Santiment Warns,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-bounce-in-danger-as-market-greed-surges-santiment-warns/,"Bitcoin’s latest rally past $88,000 has reignited bullish sentiment across the market, with some traders predicting a surge to $159,000. However, blockchain analytics firm Santiment has issued a cautionary note, suggesting this optimism could backfire. Greed Could Spell Trouble Crypto markets thrive on sentiment, and right now, greed is creeping back in after a period in late February and early March that saw fear as the sector’s primary driver. Bitcoin’s recent resurgence to $88,500 has stirred fresh optimism among retail traders, with Santiment revealing that social media mentions of the cryptocurrency’s price targets above $100,000 have spiked. As crypto has bounced nicely in the second half of March, traders have swung the pendulum back toward mild greed. After showing major fear in late February and early March following two stints of Bitcoin dipping as low as $78K, it appears that this rebound to $88.5K has… pic.twitter.com/WGvmvKSv2X — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 25, 2025 Furthermore, in an ongoing poll on X by the analytics platform, more than 60% of respondents believe that BTC will break the $100,000 mark, while 40% anticipate a drop below $75,000. At the time of writing, over 892 people had participated in the poll, with 14 hours left until it closed. While the community is flooding social media with these lofty price targets, Santiment noted a troubling pattern: historically, markets tend to move contrary to public sentiment, meaning heightened greed could signal an incoming correction. Bitcoin’s upward momentum was halted just below $89,000, where strong resistance emerged. Analysts attributed this resistance to the convergence of the 50-day moving average and descending trendline from the asset’s all-time high. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered overbought territory, indicating that the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap may have reached a local top. Crypto watcher Ali Martinez previously pointed out that such instances have often led to significant corrections. Recent whale activity supports this concern. While these large holders resumed accumulation earlier in the month, contributing to BTC’s price jump from the $77,000 level to beyond $88,000, on-chain data shows that some have started offloading their holdings. Santiment recently reported that more than 20,000 BTC, worth about $1.8 billion, were sold around the local peak. Moreover, concerns over the defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox’s recent billion-dollar BTC movement have added to the uncertainty. History shows that such large transfers often create market fear, prompting sell-offs. Market Outlook Despite the worries, Bitcoin has gone back above $88,000 as of this writing after spending most of the morning at $87,000. The current price is a meager 1.4% rise from yesterday’s level, but it means that over the past week, BTC has gained 5.7%, outpacing the broader crypto market, which has only gained 2.3% in that period. However, the number one cryptocurrency’s dominance has dropped to 58.3% as altcoins like Cronos (CRO) and Dogecoin (DOGE) recorded significant gains.

Awareness is growing outside of the crypto world that tokenising assets really could be a ticket to doing finance differently. Traditional banking giants are busy working on projects to understand how best they can tap into this potential. Governments in major financial centres from the UK to Singapore have launched sandboxes to see how regulation could support capital markets infrastructure underpinned by blockchain technology. The blockchain and finance press have been littered with headlines of successful pilots, including Siemens’ $330 million digital bond, issued last year as part of the European Central Bank’s trial to settle central bank money on blockchains. These news stories have undoubtedly been positive for shining a light on tokenisation. But there’s a problem. Many of the reported ‘success stories’ are so far removed from what tokenisation could — and should – be, that they are essentially TradFi transactions in disguise. Take the Siemens example. It was undoubtedly a success insofar as it proved that digital bonds can be settled much more quickly than is currently possible via traditional means. But the bond was issued on a private blockchain, needed Deutsche Bank to facilitate settlement and seemingly offered no mechanism for self-custody. In my view, this is not what a tokenised bond should look like. The core of tokenisation is disintermediation, empowering users by streamlining the technologically obsolete parts of the capital markets ecosystem. Tokenisation replaces the work of transfer agents, central depositories and clearing systems, custodians and compliance reporting with cheaper, faster, and more transparent on-chain solutions. At the same time, they offer investors more flexibility, including by offering much lower entry points compared to the traditional markets. I fear that tokenisation could go further down the road of being commandeered by the TradFi behemoths looking for ways to create new innovative products for their client bases. Larry Fink’s recent call for the U.S.’s SEC to “rapidly approve the tokenisation of bonds and stocks” could mean that we’re edging closer to the point of no return. Despite President Donald Trump’s apparent embrace of the crypto community, the concrete announcements we have seen on the U.S.’s position on crypto — notably the strategic bitcoin reserve – have been viewed by some as underwhelming. This could prove to be pivotal for the incumbent banking sector. While the major crypto players are still grappling about where the industry is heading, this potentially gives the banking lobby an opportunity to capitalise on a crypto-positive U.S. administration. It would be a missed opportunity for tokenisation if we end up with a regulatory environment that means traditional finance players leverage blockchain technology for their own ends, improving their bottom lines while developing new products for their narrow client bases, while maintaining the status quo of our current capital markets. The investors that are likely to benefit from tokenised products from large banks are miniscule compared to the general population. There are millions of people all over the world who would relish the opportunity of being able to invest in stocks or corporate bonds, but can only dream of reaching the accredited investor or equivalent thresholds. Tokenisation also offers an opportunity for investors to regain control over their assets. Technology like Blockstream’s Liquid Network leverages whitelists to allow peer-to-peer trading, the ability to move assets across trading platforms and even to self-custody assets. In the future, we look forward to more granular voting and dividend payments. Integration with USDt and BTC is also important to allow a low friction flow of funds between conventional, RWA and crypto markets. Our current capital markets are only made for the few. Tokenisation allows us to untangle that. We now have the technology to enable any small business to raise the capital they need to grow, without having to engage banks and all within regulatory and compliance guardrails. For prospective investors, anyone with as little as $1 to invest can start to grow their wealth via tokenised U.S. treasuries. We’re already seeing this in El Salvador with NexBridge’s USTBL product. If we’re to avoid a TradFi takeover of tokenisation, we need regulators to understand the bigger picture promise of tokenisation. While it is important that tokenised versions of sophisticated investment products are appropriately regulated, we also need all major jurisdictions to provide clarity on how tokenised products can be opened up to any retail investor, regardless of how much they have to invest. Tokenisation represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to democratise access to capital. We owe it to the millions of underbanked people and businesses worldwide to not lose sight of this.

42370420,https://invezz.com/?p=2638084,1742989849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,The apex of Cardano: a pragmatic approach to UTxO and staking,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/26/the-apex-of-cardano-a-pragmatic-approach-to-utxo-and-staking/,"An unspent transaction output (UTxO) is an amount of cryptocurrency left over after a transaction. It is similar to the change you receive after purchasing a product, but with the distinction of a transaction output in the database the network generated to enable non-exact change transactions. Imagine that 100 Litecoin (LTC) is a bucket of coins, each representing a UTxO. If you buy something for 50 LTC, the network will give the seller the whole bucket and send back the 50 LTC they owe you in “change.” You now have a UTxO worth 50 LTC that you can’t divide into smaller amounts. Almost all transactions create UTxOs because the network must collect unspent outputs and transfer them to the recipient. Users rarely have the exact UTxO amount required. Litecoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and other cryptocurrencies use this model because it lets users track ownership of all the portions of those assets. UTxOs are linked to the public addresses the whole network can see. While you cannot identify the user based on ownership, the model enables transparency through the addresses. Cardano’s extended UTxO improves upon the traditional model US President Donald Trump recently announced plans to form a federal cryptocurrency reserve that will include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. People are less familiar with Cardano than the other four, but stockpiling ADA makes sense for a number of reasons. Cardano has adopted a peer-reviewed approach to research and is developing a sustainable and highly scalable blockchain platform that can support real-world applications in governance, finance, and other industries. Due to its proof-of-stake consensus, its blockchain relies on a unique architecture that supports fast, affordable transactions. The Extended UTxO (EUTxO) model achieves energy-efficiency gains, reduces complexity, and improves security. It also introduces smart contract capabilities to enhance the traditional UTxO model. Each UTxO can hold arbitrary scripts and data, allowing for more expressive smart contracts than Bitcoin. The model makes Cardano more secure by ensuring transactions have a well-defined execution path. Moreover, smart contract execution on Cardano becomes predictable, avoiding issues like gas fee spikes in Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum, where execution depends on the global state, Cardano’s EUTxO model allows transactions to be processed in parallel without conflicts. This improves scalability and efficiency since transactions don’t compete for the same state. Bridging Cardano with Ethereum to counteract tribalism As a multi-asset blockchain, Cardano can support different digital assets, including those running on other blockchains. It’s home to Apex Fusion, an interoperability-focused platform that is pivotal in bridging Cardano with Ethereum, the world’s biggest blockchain. Apex Fusion was created by a group of veterans who significantly contributed to the development of Cardano, Ethereum, and Polygon. They combined the best features of the UTxO and EVM models instead of arguing which ones were better. Ultimately, they created an integrated ecosystem that eliminates the barriers between siloed platforms and facilitates real-world adoption. Blockchains operate in silos, and the exponential rise in L2 solutions on Ethereum has deepened fragmentation, with blockchains effectively competing rather than enhancing Ethereum. There are currently at least 1,000 blockchains, and most fail to innovate, replicating a limited number of successful use cases. Users are unable to take advantage of the ecosystem in its entirety. The founders of Apex Fusion set out to counteract the tribalism dividing the blockchain space and shifted their focus to adoption, blending EVM’s flexible smart contract functionality with UTxO’s security and scalability. In keeping with their progressive mindset, they launched the Apex Fusion blockchain ecosystem, whose first chain, PRIME, helps deliver a solid staking and security model. More than 130 stake pool operators (SPOs) secured PRIME upon launch , affirming its status as the foundational layer of Apex Fusion. The platform also confirmed exchange listings for its AP3X token. Christopher Greenwood, Program Director of the Apex Fusion Foundation, elucidates upon Apex’s approach to staking: Apex Fusion uses the Ouroboros Proof-of-Stake protocol to secure and decentralize our Layer 1 network. For the protocol to function effectively, it’s critical that the community hold and stake the AP3X token. The Foundation sets optimal staking parameters to ensure participants, whether SPOs running infrastructure or users staking tokens are rewarded fairly. We’re supporting SPOs with token allocations to build profitable operations and offering a 10% APY on liquid, native staking—no lockups, full flexibility. This is the strength of our L1, setting the stage before connecting UTxO to our Ethereum-compatible Nexus chain. Aleksandar Veljkovic, Head of Research at Apex development partner Hal8, estimates that the number of tokens received through pool rewards will be around 10% after the first year based on the protocol parameters and the expected number of staking pools with the given saturation levels. A non-competing L1 with native liquid staking The founders of Apex Fusion have opted for best practice and business-based pragmatism based on their experience with Cardano. The platform offers businesses a non-competing L1 blockchain with native liquid staking and EVM, allowing them to create decentralized applications without compromising security or scalability. The staking layer is integral to Apex Fusion’s operation and involves delegating APEX tokens to support network operations, mainly on PRIME. The key elements of the layer are rewards and delegation. APEX token stakers earn rewards for participating in network maintenance and delegate tokens to staking pools to support community-centric projects. The long-awaited transition to collaboration and compliance Apex Fusion aids the transition from fragmentation to collaboration through its Reputation System, which ensures transparency and trust by quantifying and validating contributions. This development has given rise to “trust through reputation.” The launches of PRIME and the AP3X token are examples of effective measures to help unify blockchain ecosystems and enable Web3 networks to work harmoniously. Building and launching high-capacity, omni-chain decentralized applications will be more straightforward when that happens. Apex assists Cardano in its quest to become the most compliant blockchain. The US crypto reserve is expected to encourage TradFi institutions to explore cryptocurrencies, and blockchains will need compliant integrations with fiat. Apex Fusion’s FINMA (Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority) status renders its cross-chain interoperability mechanisms legally compliant, making Cardano even more attractive from a regulatory perspective.

The altcoin market has been facing headwinds, and investor sentiment has undeniably taken a hit. But what if this period of gloom is actually the precursor to a significant turnaround? Leading crypto market analyst Jamie Coutts from Real Vision believes just that. In a recent analysis shared on X, Coutts points to extremely low altcoin sentiment as a powerful signal for a potential altcoin recovery . Let’s dive into what this means for you and your crypto portfolio. Decoding Extreme Altcoin Sentiment: Is This the Bottom? Jamie Coutts, a respected voice in crypto market analysis , has highlighted a crucial observation: altcoin sentiment is currently scraping the bottom of the barrel. He describes this as a “structural breadth bear market,” which sounds intimidating, right? But bear with us. This term essentially means that across a wide range of altcoins, market participation and overall health have significantly deteriorated. Think of it like a widespread pullback, not just isolated dips. To back this up, Coutts points to specific metrics that offer a data-driven perspective on this sentiment. These aren’t just gut feelings; they are measurable indicators that historically have signaled market shifts. Let’s break down these indicators: Top 200 Equal Weight vs. Market Weight Ratio: This metric compares the performance of an equally weighted index of the top 200 cryptocurrencies against a market-cap-weighted index. When this ratio is low, it suggests that smaller altcoins (which are equally weighted in the first index) are underperforming compared to the larger cryptocurrencies (which dominate the market-cap-weighted index). Extreme lows in this ratio can indicate that altcoins are deeply oversold and potentially ripe for a rebound. Altseason Index: This index attempts to quantify the prevailing sentiment for altcoins versus Bitcoin. A low Altseason Index reading suggests that Bitcoin is outperforming altcoins, and interest in altcoins is waning. Similar to the Top 200 ratio, extreme lows here can also signal oversold conditions and a potential shift in momentum towards altcoins. Coutts emphasizes that historically, these extreme lows in altcoin sentiment have often been followed by periods of altcoin recovery , particularly for “high-quality” altcoins. This is a crucial point: not all altcoins are created equal. When the market turns, stronger projects with solid fundamentals are more likely to lead the charge. Why Now Might Be the Time for Altcoin Investment: Unpacking the Potential Recovery So, the sentiment is low, metrics are flashing ‘oversold’ – but why should this translate into an altcoin recovery ? Several factors could be at play: Market Cycles: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their cyclical nature. Periods of bearish sentiment and price declines are often followed by bullish phases. This ebb and flow is a fundamental characteristic of the market, and recognizing where we are in the cycle can be incredibly valuable. Mean Reversion: In financial markets, assets often tend to revert to their long-term average performance over time. If altcoins have significantly underperformed Bitcoin and their historical averages, there’s a statistical tendency for them to eventually catch up. This isn’t guaranteed, but it’s a powerful force to consider. Undervalued Assets: Extreme bearish sentiment can sometimes push the prices of even fundamentally strong altcoins below their intrinsic value. Savvy investors see these periods as opportunities to accumulate quality assets at discounted prices. Upcoming Catalysts: The crypto space is constantly evolving. Technological advancements, regulatory clarity (or shifts), and broader macroeconomic factors can act as catalysts for market turnarounds. Keep an eye out for potential game-changers that could reignite interest in altcoins. Navigating the Altcoin Recovery: Actionable Insights for Investors If you’re considering capitalizing on a potential crypto recovery and exploring altcoin investment , here are some actionable insights to guide you: Due Diligence is Paramount: Coutts specifically mentions “high-quality” altcoins. This is not a blanket endorsement of all altcoins. Thorough research is essential. Focus on projects with: Strong teams and active development Real-world use cases and adoption Solid tokenomics and community support Technological advantages and innovation Risk Management is Key: Altcoins are inherently more volatile than Bitcoin. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes and within the crypto space itself. Long-Term Perspective: Don’t try to time the absolute bottom. Altcoin recovery might not be immediate. Focus on a long-term investment horizon and be prepared to weather potential short-term volatility. Monitor Market Metrics: Keep an eye on the metrics Coutts highlighted (Top 200 Ratio, Altseason Index) and other relevant indicators like on-chain data, trading volumes, and social sentiment. These can provide clues about market momentum and potential shifts. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Stay updated on news, developments, and analyses from reputable sources to make informed decisions. Challenges and Cautions: Navigating the Path to Altcoin Recovery While the signals for a potential altcoin recovery are intriguing, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Even if sentiment indicators suggest a recovery, sudden price swings and unexpected events can occur. Identifying “High-Quality” Altcoins: Distinguishing between fundamentally strong projects and those that are purely hype-driven can be challenging. Scams and failed projects are a reality in the crypto space. External Factors: Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory changes, and geopolitical events can significantly impact the crypto market, including altcoins. Sentiment Can Shift Again: While current sentiment is low, it’s not guaranteed to reverse immediately or permanently. Market sentiment can be fickle and influenced by various factors. Therefore, while Jamie Coutts’ analysis offers a hopeful perspective, it’s essential to approach altcoin investment with caution, conduct thorough research, and manage risk effectively. This potential recovery signal should be seen as an opportunity to explore and potentially position oneself strategically, not as a guarantee of instant riches. Conclusion: Hope on the Horizon for Altcoins? Jamie Coutts’ analysis paints a compelling picture: extreme lows in altcoin sentiment , historically, have preceded periods of crypto recovery . Metrics like the Top 200 Equal Weight vs. Market Weight Ratio and the Altseason Index are flashing potential buy signals for those willing to delve into crypto market analysis and identify quality altcoin investment opportunities. While challenges and risks remain inherent in the volatile crypto landscape, the current sentiment landscape, as highlighted by Coutts, offers a glimmer of hope and a potential turning point for the altcoin market. Keep a watchful eye, do your homework, and prepare to potentially capitalize on what could be the next exciting chapter in the crypto story.

The recent drop in Cardano (ADA) and its lower trading volume suggest fading energy, while the latest XRP news highlights strength, with 6.87 million unique wallets now active. But beyond numbers, one network is clearly taking a new path— BlockDAG (BDAG) is rolling out a visibility plan that looks more like a global brand strategy than a standard crypto effort. Chief Marketing Officer Nicolaas David van den Bergh recently shared the plan: a major outreach push, stretching from crowded football stadiums with Inter Milan to major global events like ETHPanama and Token2049. While some projects stick to social media chatter, BlockDAG is reaching out to the real world. For those thinking about the best crypto to buy in 2025, this might be the right moment—before the campaign reaches full scale. Cardano Faces Price Decline Amid Weak Momentum Current trends show Cardano (ADA) losing traction, with its price falling to $0.7119 after a 0.80% drop within 24 hours from $0.7177. The recent 7.22% dip in daily trading volume, now at $1.18 billion, has added to the market’s cautious tone. With ADA’s weekly decline standing at 18.53% and a market cap of $25 billion, short-term excitement appears to be fading. This decline hasn’t been sparked by any major announcement or positive event, raising further concerns. As other altcoins focus on delivering clear narratives and engaging real-world efforts, ADA’s quiet performance raises questions about its ability to maintain relevance. While the network remains stable, its current sideways movement leaves it trailing behind more assertive names. XRP News: Wallet Surge Highlights Adoption Momentum Recent XRP news brings attention to its growing user base, with 6.87 million unique wallets now active on the XRP Ledger. This milestone underlines increasing engagement from both individual users and institutions. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity feature continues to bring in utility, especially from banks and cross-border payment firms. Beyond that, developers and users are becoming more active within XRP’s ecosystem. Features such as smart contracts via Hooks and growing DeFi participation show XRP expanding beyond just payments. With supportive rulings in 2023 and clearer regulations in regions like the UAE and Japan, confidence in the project is on the rise. These developments signal deeper strength beyond price movements for those closely watching XRP news. BlockDAG Broadens Its Reach with Real-World Strategy Rather than chasing likes or hashtags, BlockDAG is targeting large-scale reach. CMO Nicolaas David van den Bergh confirmed a campaign focused on physical visibility, not just digital presence. From Inter Milan stadium banners to appearances at global tech events like ETHPanama and Token2049, this approach marks a shift away from conventional marketing. It’s a move meant to bring BlockDAG to a worldwide audience beyond the usual crypto crowd. CMO van den Bergh’s plan includes not just attending events, but embedding BlockDAG into them. It’s a methodical strategy that stands apart from the trend of social media-heavy promotion. The aim is to make BlockDAG visible in major real-world venues where lasting impressions are made. For those weighing which project could lead in 2025, this wider approach to presence and branding sets BDAG apart. The progress in numbers supports this direction. BlockDAG has crossed $206 million in crypto presale funding, moving 18.9 billion BDAG coins so far. Currently, in batch 27, the coin is priced at $0.0248, reflecting a 2,380% rise from its early price. As the global visibility campaign gathers speed and the testnet release nears, BlockDAG is becoming less of a quiet name and more of a serious contender for 2025’s best crypto pick. Final Thoughts While XRP news reflects impressive expansion with 6.87 million wallet addresses and rising user interest, Cardano’s recent price slide and weaker volume point to slowing momentum. No clear updates or breakthroughs have helped ADA’s short-term position. In contrast, BlockDAG is rolling out a broad global visibility plan beyond typical crypto marketing, with appearances set at Inter Milan, Token2049, and ETHPanama, the project’s strategy is built for long-term reach. The presale has already collected $206 million, and with batch 27 priced at $0.0248, BDAG continues gaining traction. If there’s a moment to get ahead of a major push, it could be now.

Here’s The Likely IPO Date,https://coingape.com/ripple-ipo-delayed-again-heres-the-likely-ipo-date/,"As Ripple resolves uncertainty surrounding the XRP lawsuit settlement, speculation grows about its highly anticipated Initial Public Offering (IPO). Although the platform has not announced a specific timeline for the Ripple IPO, expert predictions suggest it may happen within the next 12 to 18 months. Let’s explore expert predictions over the possible dates and impacts of Ripple’s public offering over the broader crypto market. When To Expect Ripple IPO? With Ripple dropping its cross-appeal against the Securities and Exchange Commission, the XRP lawsuit takes a significant turn. This major development has sparked increased speculations about the Ripple IPO. During an interview with Bloomberg, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse remained vocal about the platform’s long awaited public offering. He posited, “The IPO is a natural step for Ripple to diversify and secure its future in the global market.” Shedding light on the capital, Garlinghouse stated that a portion of the amount raised could be used for further developments within the Ripple ecosystem. As Garlinghouse and Ripple remain silent about the exact date for the IPO, experts predict that the event could be possible within the next 18 months. In addition, there is a growing speculation that the platform will launch the IPO by the year end. Isn’t IPO a Priority for Ripple? Ripple’s CEO has downplayed the significance of an IPO for the company at present, despite growing anticipation. He stated, I think that’s available and the company is at a stage where we can consider that. That being said, it isn’t a huge priority… We are more proactive in looking at acquisitions. However, the public offering provides a strategic chance to strengthen Ripple’s presence among institutional investors, potentially unlocking funds that were previously withheld due to ongoing legal uncertainties. As the current regulatory environment in the US remains favorable, the platform is expected to utilize the opportunity well. IPO To Impact XRP Price Ripple proponent XRP Chancellor shared an enthusiastic and optimistic post, commenting on the potential impact of the imminent Ripple IPO. According to the expert, the IPO will drive up XRP’s value. Analysts like Egrag Crypto and Ali Martinez have provided bullish predictions on the XRP price post IPO announcement. According to Egrag, XRP is poised to reach $10, whereas Ali forecasted its hike to $15. Recently, All Things XRP, a prominent figure, shed light on the possibility of an IPO following the XRP lawsuit resolution. How Will Ripple IPO Impact Broader Market? Notably, the IPO is expected to have a significant impact on XRP. The IPO could spark increased institutional interest and a positive market sentiment. In addition, the IPO could bolster the platform’s legitimacy. Meanwhile, the public offering could also influence the broader crypto market. The IPO could lead to increased mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Ripple’s IPO could have a ripple effect on the cryptocurrency market, potentially boosting prices of other digital currencies as new investors enter the space. It could also lead to new partnerships and collaborations in financial and technological sectors. The post Ripple IPO Delayed Again?

Bitcoin mining difficulty explained,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-everything-you-need-to-know/,"While the costs of Bitcoin mining can be very high, the return on investment (ROI) is even higher for major operations with huge mining capacity. Therefore, a solo crypto investor must understand the workings of mining before diving into this world. This guide will explore one of the most prevalent terminologies in the mining industry, Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining difficulty. What is it, and what are its benefits? What is BTC mining difficulty? BTC mining difficulty is a measure of the complexity of mining BTC. It indicates how hard it is for an average miner to verify blockchain transactions and earn a new BTC. As mentioned above, BTC mining is a long process involving solving highly complex cryptographic equations. When the mining difficulty is great, miners use very high computing power to solve the cryptographic equations and complete transaction verification successfully; vice versa is also true. Many experts believe the mining difficulty should be reasonably high to secure the network. Crypto blockchains with super high mining difficulty akin to BTC are highly secure. BTC uses the mining difficulty to stabilize the average time between blocks as the network’s hash power changes. One thing to note is that mining difficulty is a protective parameter only in proof-of-work blockchains. This is because it’s only in PoW blockchains where miners perform auditory functions preventing fraud and validating available transactions. Mining difficulty in PoW essentially controls the time taken to complete new blocks. You might also like: Bitcoin mining stocks present ‘compelling buying opportunity, analyst says Why is cryptocurrency mined? Fiat currencies rely on printing. Central Banks like the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank can always churn out more paper. For cryptocurrencies, there is an inherent problem. Remember the part where no central entity was supposed to control issuance? Yeah, the option of having a central institution issue crypto is not possible. Therefore, Satoshi Nakamoto created a self-sustaining system of issuing new coins. Powerful computers help secure the network by confirming transactions, and they get new coins issued for successful blocks added to the blockchain. That process is called mining, and it is an indispensable aspect of decentralization. What is the relevance of BTC mining difficulty? So, why does the mining difficulty of a crypto matter? There are essentially two benefits of BTC mining difficulty, including; Network stability Network security Deflationary BTC value Network Stability One of the main pros associated with the mining difficulty is network stability. The BTC blockchain completes a new block every 10 minutes. Without the concept of mining difficulty, it would be hard to maintain stability in block release durations. Hence, mining difficulty ensures the 10-minute block creation cycle is stable. But, why would the network autonomously increase or decrease a mining difficulty? The number of miners within the network at a particular time drives the changes in mining difficulty. Take, for instance, a situation where many miners are concurrently fighting to mine BTC. In that case, the BTC network will increase the mining difficulty. The idea is to make it hard to mine the coins, so they maintain the stability of the 10-minute duration for releasing blocks. When the number of miners is low, the network autonomously reduces the difficulty. This reduction will help the few miners complete blocks within ten minutes. BTC mining difficulty ensures no unpredictable overflow of new BTC in circulation. Deflationary BTC Value in Long Term BTC mining difficulty also helps in ensuring that the value of BTC is deflationary in the long term. As mentioned above, the difficulty removes the unpredictability of the low of new BTC in circulation. The BTC release is expected, hence does not affect the prices of the coin in exchanges. Network Security Network security is another benefit of the BTC mining difficulty and any adjustments involved. Blockchain networks are susceptible to attacks from bad actors, including miners. Problems like 51%-attacks are primarily a result of network miners taking advantage of the system. BTC mining difficulty essentially increases the resources required to mine the asset. Increasing resources means increasing the costs of mining. By increasing resources, the network makes it hard for miners to attack the system since they may incur massive losses in case of failure. How is mining difficulty changed? As mentioned, adjustments to mining difficulty are necessary to ensure the network maintains stability. So, how does the network adjust the mining difficulty? When mining, miners have a target hash which they all try to beat. A target hash in BTC is a specific fixed length code with several zeros before the code itself. To be considered the winning miner; Before the hash, you must generate a code with either an equal or more zeros. You must be the first to generate this code. Hence, to ensure the blocks are not discovered superfast, BTC has algorithms that add or reduce the number of zeros preceding the target hash. Adding the zeros hardens the block discovery process while doing the opposite simplifies the block mining process. By making the mining process hard, the BTC network helps maintain the coin’s steadily growing value. How can you calculate mining difficulty? The calculation of BTC mining difficulty is also another vital factor to consider. How can a miner know their mining difficulty? There are many different formulas used today, but the most popular are; Difficulty Level = Difficulty Target/Current Target. Where; The difficulty target is simply the hexadecimal notation of the target hash with a mining difficulty of 1. Current target. Target hash of a most immediate block of transactions. Whenever you divide the difficulty target by the current target, you get a whole number: the difficulty level. If you get your answer as 25 trillion, that is the mining difficulty, meaning you must generate over 25 trillion hashes to get the winning hash. In some cases, miners could get the correct hash with fewer guesses. Adjustments to Mining Difficulty As mentioned earlier, the average time for releasing a single BTC block is 10 minutes. The difficulty adjustments compare the average time required to find 2016 blocks on the network versus the time it took to get the immediate 2016 blocks. The 2016-block interval is an epoch. After every epoch, the BTC network calculates and re-adjusts the mining difficulty. The standard time needed in mining the 2016 blocks is 20160 minutes (2016 X 10 minutes). 20160 minutes is the equivalent of a fortnight of block production. Now, the calculation for adjusting mining difficulty is as follows; 20160 minutes/actual time used in last 2016(epoch) X most recent difficulty level= Percentage upward or downward change in mining difficulty If the percentage change is over 300%(4X) to the positive, the network will only adjust to 300%. This +300% change was done on July 16th, 2010, after the hashrate grew from 300 to 1300 MH/s in the preceding epoch. The change can only be as low as -75%(¼) on the negative side of every epoch. The most minimal adjustment was -27.9% on July 3rd, 2021, after the Sicuan shutdowns. The limits to percentage upwards or downward changes in mining difficulty ensure there are no massive abrupt changes. While the epoch consists of 2016 blocks, only 2015 blocks are relevant in difficulty-level computations. What if all BTC is mined? So, what happens with BTC mining difficulty once the BTC mining process ends? Basically, after mining all 21 million coins, the idea of mining BTC could lose meaning. However, transaction verification and network security will remain highly relevant in the ecosystem. Hence, miners will still have to participate to ensure the BTC network continues to run. The reward, in this case, will not be new coins but transaction fees. Final Words This guide looked deeply into the concept of BTC mining difficulty and how you can calculate it and adjust your predictions accordingly. As severely reiterated, BTC mining’s difficulty is the complexity involved in releasing new BTCs into circulation. This process in the blockchain helps maintain the BTC network’s security and stability while also ensuring a deflationary value of BTC in the long term.

Bitcoin mining is a process in which computers do complex mathematical calculations to solve cryptographic puzzles and create new BTC. This process can be used to confirm transactions between two parties, verify BTC payments or create secure records. How much time do I need to mine Bitcoin? Mining BTC is not similar to mining other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin or Dogecoins. Each computer has a set amount of processing power which they use to solve mathematical equations for new blocks of currency to be added to the blockchain. The first person who solves the equation gets rewarded with new coins, while all participants are given some. Mining difficulty increases every 2016 block, making it increasingly difficult to find blocks. As such, miners must upgrade their hardware regularly. If done correctly, the process should provide a reward proportional to how much effort was put into solving the problem. One BTC equals 10^9 bytes of information, and it takes about 1 min to confirm a block. This means that the average confirmation time is 10 minutes. Is mining Bitcoin difficult? These days, mining BTC is challenging because of heightened competition and rising processing demands. As additional miners join, the complexity of the process, which entails solving challenging mathematical problems, is adjusted to maintain a 10-minute block period. Nowadays, most people cannot mine from home since it requires specialized ASIC equipment. The process also uses a lot of energy, and the cost of electricity has a big impact on profitability. All things considered, mining BTC is difficult and necessitates a large hardware and electrical expenditure. Is mining Bitcoin easier than mining Ethereum? Although mining is no longer feasible on the Ethereum mainnet, it is still feasible on Ethereum ( ETH ) Classic, which still employs the proof-of-work concept. ETH’s staking strategy uses a lot less energy than BTC mining, which uses a lot of power using ASIC technology. ETH staking is more accessible since it just requires 32 ETH or a staking pool, while BTC mining requires expensive equipment. While ETH staking provides consistent profits with less operational hazards, BTC mining has a tremendous earning potential but also substantial costs. What Causes Mining Difficulty To Go Up? The mining difficulty of a proof-of-work blockchain fluctuates, with the main driver being the number of participating miners. However, miners are profit-oriented, expecting revenue from block rewards to offset their resource expenditure. During periods of high prices, mining difficulty is often highest as more people get involved and even those with older equipment become profitable again. Therefore, the hash rate is also impacted mainly by the coin’s price. In a bullish market, a network’s mining difficulty will always rise as more miners connect, supplying a hash rate. In response, the network’s mining algorithm readjusts difficulty, raising it in response to increasing hash rate.",Learn|Mining,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|FIAT|MINING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-26 12:02:26

Lawmakers in North Carolina have introduced two separate bills to allow an independent investment authority to invest up to 5% of certain pension funds in digital assets—including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and NFTs—provided they use secure custody solutions and assess the associated risks. The first bill, House Bill 506 , was filed by Representative Brenden Jones, while the second, Senate Bill 709 , was submitted to the Senate. By submitting the bills in both chambers, lawmakers are increasing the chances that at least one version will pass and become law. Both bills aim to establish an “Investment Authority” that will operate independently of the State Treasurer and manage investments for various state retirement funds.

Earlier this year, Indiana introduced House Bill 1322 , allowing state-managed pension funds to invest in approved Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs. Around the same time, Kansas proposed legislation that would enable the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System to allocate up to 10% of its funds to Bitcoin-backed products, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs. Similarly, Republican lawmakers in Florida introduced bills that would authorize the state’s Chief Financial Officer to invest up to 10% of certain public funds, including retirement funds, in BTC and other digital assets. This trend extends beyond the U.S., with pension funds in other countries also increasing their exposure to cryptocurrencies. Australian pension funds have been early adopters, with self-managed superannuation funds boosting their cryptocurrency investments to $664 million by 2023. Most recently, Norway’s Government Pension Fund has also indirectly invested in cryptocurrencies by acquiring shares in MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital Holdings Coinbase, and Block Inc.—all of which hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets.

Let’s find out in this Zcash price prediction. Table of Contents What is Zcash? Zcash price prediction Zcash coin price prediction: short-term outlook Zcash price prediction 2025 Zcash price prediction 2030 Zcash is a cryptocurrency associated with anonymity and privacy. This cryptocurrency has been in the game for almost 10 years now, yet it hasn’t seemed to outgrow its downtrend over the years. Will this time be any different? That’s what we will find out in this article. Since its launch back in 2016, the Zcash ( ZEC ) token has seen an all-time high of $5,941.80 followed by a 99.41% drop in price. At the time of writing, it is now trading at $33.55, which is around a 4.23% increase from its previous weekly low. Zcash 1D chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the Zcash price prediction by giving you its short and price forecasts, and explore whether this token can continue its bullish run. What is Zcash? Zcash is a decentralized cryptocurrency that prioritizes anonymity and privacy. It makes use of zk-SNARK zero-knowledge proof technology, which enables network nodes to validate transactions without disclosing any private information about them. Contrary to popular belief, most cryptocurrencies, including BTC, are pseudonymous rather than anonymous. Although they do not explicitly disclose the identities of their users, each user has a public address or addresses that can be linked to them using data science and blockchain forensics techniques. In contrast to pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, Zcash transactions by default do not disclose the sending and receiving addresses or the amount being transmitted, but they still need to be relayed via a public blockchain. However, this data might be made public for auditing or regulatory compliance purposes. Now let’s discuss ZEC price prediction in this year and in the coming ones as well. Zcash price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the ZEC token? Let’s dive into the ZEC price prediction for 2025 and 2030. You might also like: Zcash community approves proposal to allocate 20% of block rewards toward grants Zcash coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s Zcash coin price prediction for the near future, the token is projected to rise by 23.50% and reach $39.66 by Apr. 24, 2025. As of Mar. 26, 2025, the overall sentiment of the ZEC price outlook remains bearish, with 20 technical analysis indicators showing bearish signals, 4 indicating bullish trends, and 11 indicators showing neutral forecasts. Zcash price prediction 2025 For the remaining months of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the ZEC token’s price could fluctuate between $30.15 and $73.62, and may likely hold a yearly average of $71.14. CoinCodex projects that the ZEC token can trade in the price channel of $28.82 and $51.73 While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence it is advised to do your research before investing in ZEC or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Zcash price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Zcash crypto price prediction for 2030, ZEC’s price could vary between $7.26 and $39.38. DigitalCoinPrice expects that ZEC’s price could climb to $159.15 or $183.95 by the end of 2030. Changelly’s predicts that by 2030, the ZEC token could range between $188.51 and $309.15. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict Zcash price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and like all other tokens, the ZEC token’s price can be highly volatile. This means that no one knows if this token can survive the next five years as there have been many instances where crypto tokens have lost their entire value while some are clear cases of rug pull. You should also note that crypto tokens experience higher volatility than other financial markets and this can cause big price fluctuations in its price.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency including ZEC, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a token that was once considered the future may also be delisted from major exchanges. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the ZEC token. Will Zcash go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the ZEC token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Zcash price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low ZEC can go. Should I invest in Zcash? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Zcash price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals which may very well decide the future of the ZEC token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda said the SEC is looking to resolve regulatory uncertainty through rulemaking and guidance, rather than enforcement actions. This is a notable change from the approach taken by the SEC under its previous chair, Gary Gensler, and has been welcomed by Web3 industry thought leaders. Many analysts have identified a potential reversal of the recent extended downtrend, citing signs that the crypto market may soon experience renewed capital inflows because of clearer regulations. Against this backdrop, investors are actively looking for high-utility tokens that will benefit when sentiment turns bullish again. Below are the four best cryptos to buy before the next bull run. Solaxy The top crypto to buy right now is Solaxy ($SOLX) , a Layer 2 (L2) solution that’s quickly gaining attention on the Solana network after raising $27.65 million in its presale. While Solana has made waves due to its massive transaction throughput and active developer community, it has encountered congestion and occasional slowdowns during periods of heavy activity. Solaxy aims to solve these issues using rollup technology, effectively bundling multiple off-chain transactions and then settling them on Solana’s mainnet. By offloading a portion of the overall network load, Solaxy will make Solana’s network cheaper, faster, and more reliable even under heavy demand. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6jxzeDsLZs The timing of the Solaxy project’s upcoming launch couldn’t be better. Solana recently celebrated its fifth birthday, but still has been struggling with fundamental scaling constraints—a problem that Solaxy has turned into an opportunity. The Solaxy team is also developing a cross-chain bridge to connect Solana, Ethereum, Base, and Solaxy, as well as a special launchpad for new projects to launch on Solaxy. With Solana futures launching on the CME derivatives exchange and a few Solana ETFs recently approved , Solaxy’s L2 solution could further boost Solana’s long-term prospects. Interested buyers can still buy SOLX in the presale for $0.001672 . Presale investors can also earn staking rewards of up to 147% pa. BTC Bull Token BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is next on our list of top cryptos that have attracted major investor attention, and has raised $4 million through its ongoing ICO. It’s the first meme coin to directly tie its reward mechanism to Bitcoin’s price performance. Each time Bitcoin reaches a significant price milestone for the first time (like $150,000 and $200,000), the BTC Bull Token project will send real Bitcoin airdrops to BTCBULL holders. The team has also set a burn schedule for BTCBULL tokens, with burns taking place when BTC reaches $125,000, $175,000, and $225,000 for the first time. When BTC reaches $250,000, the project will also distribute a BTCBULL token airdrop for its token holders. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ301MdIwMg There’s also renewed optimism following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting, which signaled potential rate cuts later this year—historically a positive catalyst for Bitcoin. If a bullish scenario plays out, there’s every chance that BTCBULL holders will profit not only from rising sentiment, but also from the scheduled bitcoin airdrops that will directly benefit holders. You can buy BTCBULL tokens for $0.002425 each, and stake them to earn up to 105% APY. XRP Next on our list is XRP, which has become a hot topic in the news lately. On March 19, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced that the SEC had dropped its appeal against Ripple , resolving a lawsuit that first began in December 2020. The SEC had sued Ripple on the grounds that its sale of XRP was an unregistered securities offering. Due to the potential ramifications of that claim, many see Ripple’s victory as a monumental win for the crypto industry—and it could set a precedent for US digital asset regulation. Following the news, XRP surged more than 10% on March 19 to $2.59. The current sentiment shows growing investor confidence in XRP’s prospects. This altcoin is currently trading at around 27% below its all-time high (ATH) of $3.40, indicating further upside for investors looking to capitalize on this opportunity. Many analysts predict XRP could see a new ATH as speculation over XRP spot ETF approval grows. In fact, the odds of approval increased after the withdrawal of the SEC’s appeal. Chainlink Chainlink ($LINK) is the leading decentralized oracle network (DON) provider, delivering data feeds and off-chain computation for DeFi protocols, RWAs (real-world assets), stablecoins, Web3 gaming platforms and more. It’s created critical infrastructure that enables smart contracts to fulfil their potential across a wide range of industries. Thousands of Web3 projects, top companies, and tradfi institutions from SWIFT and the DTCC to Vodafone, ANZ Bank, and major blockchains (such as Polygon and Avalanche) have already partnered with Chainlink to launch their own DON integrations or run pilot projects. Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is also growing in adoption, with the end goal of creating an “internet of contracts” that will enable even more innovation and connectivity. Many investors call CCIP the “TCP/IP of blockchain,” setting the stage for secure interoperability between chains. The LINK token has underperformed for a while, but has recently shown strength. It’s still 72% below its ATH of $52, trading at around $15.13, which represents a significant discount for bullish investors. Most importantly, despite its status as a utility token and its connection to the Chainlink development team, LINK is less likely to be in the SEC’s firing line after the latter dropped its lawsuit against Ripple and XRP. As a result, institutions have become more comfortable partnering with Chainlink and integrating its services into their own systems. As the RWA sector continues to grow in 2025, and the need for blockchain interoperability becomes more apparent, LINK could see a high upside during the next bull run.

The projection is based mainly on the current positioning of options market makers. Market makers , also known as dealers or MMs, are responsible for providing liquidity to the order book. They occupy the opposite side of investors' trades and work to maintain a market-neutral exposure by hedging in spot and futures markets. They make money off the difference between what they pay for an asset and how much they sell it for, known as the bid-ask spread. Deribit bitcoin options data tracked by Amberdata shows market makers are "" short gamma "" at the $90,000 strike. What that means is that as the bitcoin price moves closer to that level, market makers will need sell when the spot price drops and buy when it rises to keep a market-neutral position. These hedging activities could add to market volatility. ""Considering that negative gamma will still significantly impact the market after settlement, the hedging behavior of MMs may further promote price fluctuations,"" Griffin Ardern, the chief author of BloFin Academy and head of BloFin Research and Options, told CoinDesk. ""But the possibility of upward price movement seems to be greater for now."" Gamma represents the rate of change in delta, which itself measures the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the underlying asset's price. Holding short gamma means holding a short position in options, which can lead to financial loss, especially during periods of high volatility. So when market makers are short gamma, they must trade in the market's direction to maintain a market-neutral book. The opposite is the case when market makers are long gamma. Toward the end of last year, market makers were long gamma at $90,000 and $100,000, which led to consolidation between these levels. The chart shows gamma levels at strike prices across expirations. It's clear that the $90,000 strike will remain the one with the most negative delta following the quarterly settlement due this Friday. In other words, the hedging behavior of dealers could add to market swings at around $90,000.

Are They Working with Ripple? Big Claim from ETF Analyst!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/sec-ripple-case-over-will-blackrock-file-an-xrp-etf-application-are-they-working-with-ripple-big-claim-from-etf-analyst/,"The SEC-Ripple case is now coming to an end. Last week, Ripple CEO Brad Gralinghouse announced that the SEC would withdraw its objection, and yesterday Ripple withdrew its cross-objection. Ultimately, the SEC-Ripple lawsuit will result in Ripple paying $50 million. The SEC will keep $50 million, and Ripple will get back $75 million of the $125 million fine it paid after the court ruling. With the conclusion of the case, all eyes are now on the future of XRP and XRP ETF approval, with Polymarket data showing an 85% chance of an XRP ETF being approved by the end of 2025. As the probability of approval for the XRP ETF increases, Ripple CEO has raised speculations that BlackRock may apply for an XRP ETF in a recent interview. Garlinghouse was asked if they were collaborating with BlackRock to launch an XRP ETF. Although the famous CEO did not openly admit a collaboration with BlackRock, he did say, “We think it makes sense for the XRP community for the application to come,” adding to the speculation. “Two World Giants Will Not Ignore XRP!” While BlackRock's application for an XRP ETF is eagerly awaited, leading ETF analyst Nate Geraci claimed that both BlackRock and Fidelity will join the XRP ETF race. ETF Store founder Nate Geraci stated that he is certain that the XRP ETF will be approved from the X account, and that approval is only a matter of time. While Nate Geraci’s confidence in the XRP ETF approval stems from the end of the Ripple lawsuit, he argued that BlackRock and Fidelity will not ignore XRP becoming the third largest cryptocurrency and will eventually file an XRP ETF application. “Ripple case is ending… I think it's only a matter of time before spot XRP ETF approval is received. And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc. to all get involved. XRP is currently the 3rd largest volatile crypto asset by market cap. The largest ETF issuers will not ignore this.” Ripple lawsuit coming to end… Seems obvious spot XRP ETF approval simply matter of time IMO. And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc to all be involved. XRP currently 3rd largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by market cap. Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) March 26, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $27.61 level by 2027 and above $56.67 by 2031. Why is UNI up? The broader crypto market is experiencing a bullish spell today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are gaining value, and so is UNI. The cryptocurrency gained more than 0.22 percent of its value over the last 24 hours, and its price has increased to $7.073. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $13.08, while the average price is expected to be around $10.90. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading near the $7 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $8.2 and $9.1; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved the next year. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $56.67 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

And yet, most people who have heard about this niche Bitcoin community in Austin are probably unaware of their wins and influence. Started as a coworking space out of Capital Factory in 2021 by a couple of Bitcoin enthusiasts, PlebLab has grown into a Mecca of the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem in the United States. They host various events and meetups throughout the year and have become a reliable work environment for Bitcoiners, whether living in Austin or just passing through. “In art school, I had this professor who’d make us stop after an hour of creating, walk around, and give honest feedback on each other’s work—it built a collaborative vibe where we can grow together. That stuck with me,” Car González, CEO of PlebLab, recalls. So when I took over PlebLab, I asked: ‘How do I make it more collaborative? How do I make it more about that, not just coworking?’ When you say coworking, it’s literally just working. How boring is that—working among other people who are also working? That’s not fun.” Yet more than just a “coworking” space, PlebLab has become a “community accelerator for the Bitcoin era” with multiple successful Bitcoin companies and developer celebrities going through it since its inception. Genesis Car González, Keyan Kousha, and Kyle Murphy – foudners of PlebLab Founded out of the dream to build on Bitcoin and grow a local community, PlebLab got its first office in Capital Factory, a renown tech coworking hub in Austin in 2021. The three cofounders, Car González, Keyan Kousha, and Kyle Murphy started doing Bitcoin meetups that grew to crowds of over 200 people. Among them, various entrepreneurs and Bitcoin developers started to stick around, asking to co-work with them out of Capital Factory. Over time PlebLab grew into different office locations, currently installed next to the Unchained Capital offices and the Bitcoin Park (Formerly Bitcoin Commons) in downtown Austin (at 6th St. and Congress Ave.). With more space, talent, and experience, PlebLab transformed from a coworking space into a mix between a hacker garage and a start-up incubator. Today they offer various membership packages, mentorship, and a wealth of resources to start-ups that join them, but this is not a pay-to-play “Bitcoin We-work”: Memberships can be denied depending on the goals and purpose of the project. It’s more akin to a private Bitcoin club for builders and technologists than anything else. “I really think we’re an accelerator for the Bitcoin era. How you do that in an open source, cypherpunk way is you don’t give somebody 500k on day one and say, ‘You got three months to make it or see you later.’ To me, that sounds like a fiat-era thing,” said Car. Main Events The main events held by PlebLab are Top Builder and Startup Day . Often taking place within six months of each other. “Top Builder is the Top Chef of Bitcoin. We try to find the latest, greatest builders, pile them in, and get them to build an MVP or something pitchable,” said Car, describing the event which functions like a three-month hackathon, exposing finalists to VCs and angel investors. Startup Day on the other hand is a short conference that provides a platform for Bitcoin start-ups to present their work, meet talent, and get exposure in the Bitcoin world. In Car’s words it is meant to “inspire people to go from the sidelines to building their own company. They’ll see themselves in those people talking on stage.” Judge it by its Fruit A variety of big names within the Bitcoin start-up world have spent time in PlebLab, Car was very hesitant to take credit for the work of others, and stressed his admiration for the founders and leaders whose journey he has witnessed. “Seeing their journey go from a person you meet, shake hands with initially, to where they are—seeing the numbers they have, and when they get to a point like base camp, a raise, a pre-seed or seed”, Car said. “That base camp for me is just, ‘Cool, they did it.’ Now, let’s go help somebody else. That’s the thing I love—the shipment of the code, so to speak—We just try to be good stewards of that.” Nevertheless, the track record is impressive. Here’s a quick overview of Bitcoin projects, companies, and developer celebrities closely associated with PlebLab: Jippi – Winner of Top Builder 2025 Lead by Oliver , Jippi.app is a beautiful and fun Bitcoin app designed with Gen Z in mind. Echoing the success of Pokemon Go, Jippi invites young people to explore their cities in search of Bitcoin Beasts, charming little 3D creatures that hide in augmented reality, waiting for future owners with sats rewards. The app has been in development for over a year and just last week won the first prize in PlebLab’s Top Builder competition among fierce competition. Mind-blowing to the judges and audience alike, Jippi has a live, functioning app, man-on-the-street surveys, and app tests in a local university. As well as a masterful presentation of the rationale and vision for Jippi, the app may have the potential to go viral in the United States — and with it bring a new generation into Bitcoin. Quick shout out to @JippiApp for winning the Top Builder contest from @PlebLab , $15,000 is nothing to sneeze at. Here's a quick demo and interview with the founder. pic.twitter.com/Eu0Iy0RYp9 — JuanGalt.com (@JuanSGalt) March 25, 2025 Stacker.news Started in 2021 by one of PlebLab’s cofounders Keyan Kousha, Stacker.news has quickly become a hub of news for many tech-savvy Bitcoiners. Boasting an open source Lightning-powered Reddit, the platform has gathered an active and loyal fan base that reward each other with sats for every upvote, often being early to integrate the latest technologies in the Bitcoin-social media tech scene. Zaprite Started at the end of 2021 by John Magill, Zaprite has quickly grown into a full payment processing suite for businesses, supporting both Bitcoin and Lightning payment rails, settling to fiat as desired by merchants, supporting event ticketing and all the accounting and invoicing tools necessary for a modern merchant. Zaprite made recent history by being the interface Donald J. Trump used to pay for a burger with bitcoin at the Bitcoin Pub Pub Key in New York . (TRUMP BUYS BURGER WITH BITCOIN FROM ZAPRITE – EMBED) WATCH: DONALD TRUMP MAKES FIRST #BITCOIN TRANSACTION AT NYC BAR pic.twitter.com/rAjae6agH1 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 18, 2024 Mutiny Wallet Launched in early 2023 and led by celebrity Bitcoin developers Ben Carman and Tony Giorgio, Mutiny Wallet quickly gained popularity among Lightning power users as a fully featured and innovative Bitcoin app. It consistently integrated cutting-edge payments technology like e-cash-denominated payments and Nostr integration, while rocking its signature red-and-black color scheme. Following the arrest of Samourai Wallet developers and the consequent chilling effect on Bitcoin self-custody wallet development, Mutiny Wallet announced it would be sunsetting the project, nevertheless demonstrating incredible technical ability and leaving behind a sophisticated set of open source software tools for the Lighting, Nostr, and e-cash ecosystem. Nifty (Bitcoin++) As a Bitcoin and Lightning developer, Nifty became famous for her developer education efforts via Base 58 , her world-renowned developer events called Bitcoin++ , her relentless work ethic, impressive travel schedule, and of course her charm, bringing together Bitcoin developer communities all over the world, multiple times a year. Nifty has quickly become a recognized and influential figure in the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem, including a seat on the board of directors of Opensats , a public charity focused on funding open source Bitcoin projects of all types, with a special focus on Nostr – the Bitcoin native social media protocol. In her journey to stardom, she spent significant time at PlebLab, and is still often seen at Austin Bitcoin events. Speaking of which, Nifty’s next Bitcoin++ event will be in Austin, TX on May 7-9, diving deep into the Bitcoin Mempool . Supertestnet An early member of the Plelab and Bitcoin Austin scene, Supertestnet appeared out of nowhere in 2021, quickly mastering the art of creating Bitcoin prototypes in JavaScript. He has since implemented cutting-edge Bitcoin technologies like BitVM, even participating in the first Ark mainnet pool, the only other noncustodial Bitcoin layer-2 scaling solution, and is an avid user of X and Nostr. Supertestnet’s many open source projects , passion for Bitcoin, and unshakable integrity have granted him quick recognition in the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem and likely a fair mention in the annals of Bitcoin history. Cascdr Led by Jim, AI engineer and ruthless Bitcoin maxi, Cascdr’s mission is to bring the power of AI and Bitcoin together with strong privacy foundations and a full suite of cool AI apps and workflows . His most recent hit is PullThatUpJamie.ai a podcast search engine that transcribes voice content making it searchable, and facilitating the creation of sharable podcast clips. BRANTA Led by Keith, Branta is a cyber security company focused on limiting man-in-the-middle attacks for Bitcoin payments work flows, such as the injection of malicious addresses or invoices in a merchant interface. Grown from the PlebLab accelerator, Branta has already had successful pre-seed raises and was a top-five finalist at the Top Builder contest. Topher A renowned Bitcoin developer in his own right and a regular at PlebLab, Topher has shipped a variety of open source Bitcoin tools such as Tapscript , a library for managing Taproot, Schnorr Signatures, and Bitcoin transactions. Among other things, Topher and Austin (app developer) are currently working on Frostr , a key management solution for private digital identities. Specifically, Frostr is built to solve issues of the sort in Nostr, the Bitcoin-adjacent social network protocol that’s become very popular with Bitcoin users. It reimagines “ Frost ,” the new and rising multisignature standard in Bitcoin wallets, and uses it to solve key rotation problems in Nostr . A bit of a technical project, but one which I believe is profoundly useful and I’ll be covering in more detail very soon. Christopher David, Open Agents Christopher, a seasoned Bitcoin developer and entrepreneur, is currently working on Open Agents , an AI platform with deep integration with Git processes rocking a dark-cypherpunk aesthetic and a strong focus on the privacy of its users. There are many more projects that are either in development or have gone through PlebLab through the years, if you are interested you can find them at PlebLab.dev. As a bonus, I’ll leave you with this cool Bitcoin Magazine yoyo I happened to find at PlebLab.

On March 25, Taiwan’s FSC unveiled the draft of the “Virtual Asset Service Act,” outlining provisions for licensing of Virtual Asset Service Providers, standards for stablecoin issuance, and measures to enhance market integrity and protect investors. Specifically, the draft outlines standards for VASPs, including requirements for organizational structure, capital, and personnel qualifications. ​It also authorizes banks to issue stablecoins pegged to the New Taiwan Dollar, contingent upon obtaining approval from the FSC and meeting the specified criteria. To ensure market integrity, the FSC is also granted authority to conduct inspections, enforce compliance, and enact penalties for non-compliance. The FSC has initiated a 60-day public consultation period for stakeholders to provide feedback on the draft, with plans to submit the finalized law to the Executive Yuan by June 30. ​ You might also like: Taiwan FSC drafts new AML rules for crypto firms with penalties for non-compliance The “Virtual Asset Service Act” initiative underscore Taiwan’s commitment to providing greater regulatory clarity for virtual assets, ensuring investor protection, and combating money laundering. These efforts began in October 2024 when the FSC introduced updated Anti-Money Laundering measures, requiring all VASPs to register with the government by September 2025 or face penalties, with the regulations taking effect on Jan. 1. As part of these regulations, VASPs must also prepare a comprehensive risk assessment report each year and submit it to the FSC by the end of March of the following year. In addition to providing greater regulatory clarity for the crypto sector, FSC has been proactively encouraging institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies through several strategic initiatives. Notably, FSC has launched a pilot program for crypto custody services in early 2025. It has also approved several foreign crypto exchange-traded funds for professional investors.

However, low trading activity suggests a higher probability of rejection at this level, leading to potential consolidation in the short term. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin’s bullish retracement has continued after finding support at the crucial $80K threshold, leading to a steady climb toward its prior swing high. Recently, the asset experienced increased buying pressure at the 200-day moving average ($85K), pushing it toward the critical $90K resistance zone, where substantial supply may be present. However, the market currently lacks strong bullish momentum and trading activity, increasing the likelihood of rejection at $90K, followed by further consolidation. That said, if unexpected buying pressure emerges, a breakout above this level could trigger a liquidation cascade, propelling Bitcoin to new highs. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, BTC has been trading within a descending price channel, forming lower lows and lower highs, indicating a bearish market structure with sellers in control. Recently, Bitcoin initiated a bullish retracement from the channel’s lower boundary and is now testing the upper trendline at $88K. If buyers manage to reclaim this critical boundary, a rally toward the $90K resistance will likely follow. Conversely, failure to break above this level could result in rejection and continued consolidation in the short term. Sentiment Analysis By Shayan As Bitcoin adoption expands in the U.S., local investors have played a key role in shaping market trends. The Coinbase Premium Index is a useful indicator of their sentiment and trading activity. Recently, the metric has been fluctuating around zero, reflecting uncertainty among U.S. traders. However, it now appears to be turning positive, suggesting a potential resurgence of interest in BTC on the largest US-based exchange. Historically, a consistently positive Coinbase Premium has often coincided with upward price momentum, as rising demand from U.S. investors bolsters confidence in the broader market.

33767162,[object Object],1742995191,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,First US Bank Stablecoin & SEC Talks Fuel Crypto Momentum – Could This Help Best Wallet Token?,https://bitcoinist.com/first-us-bank-stablecoin-sec-best-wallet-token/,"The good news just seems to keep on coming for crypto. Two US banks – Custodia and Vantage – have teamed up to produce ‘America’s first-ever bank-issued stablecoin’ called Avit, and this first US bank stablecoin could prove to be good news for other coins like Best Wallet Token. One person who won’t be happy though is President Trump, who earlier announced plans for his own US dollar-pegged stablecoin, $USD1. With two other US dollar stablecoins in existence – $USDC and $USDT – is the market at risk of getting flooded with too many of these US dollar cryptocoins? Too Many US Dollar-Pegged Stablecoins, Too Few Users? There may be a risk that we’re going to have far too many US dollar-pegged stablecoins out there, and not enough adoption to sustain them. Two of them – $USDT and $USDC – are not bank-issued but they’re still popular and regularly used. In February 2024, Tether (the company behind USDT) announced profits of $13B , and Circle (the company behind USDC) said their profits had topped $1.6B. However, since they’re not public companies required to open their books, we have to take their word for it. So where does that leave the two scrappy incoming tokens, $USD1 and Avit? Will there be space for them to compete? Will President Trump’s backing be enough for $USD1 to muscle its way in? One thing is for sure – Avit’s adoption as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain has $ETH fans cheering – and Custodia CEO Caitlin Long crowing . However, Long went to great pains to push back on the Fed Governor’s remarks that ‘stablecoins are synthetic dollars.’ Long begged to differ . Gov Waller is right–to date, every stablecoin issued in crypto is a “synthetic dollar” – but what Custodia Bank issued yesterday is a “real dollar” precisely because it was issued by a bank authorized to take deposits. We tokenized a bank’s ‘demand deposit’ & that’s different. By bringing out Avit on the Ethereum blockchain, Custodia showed a big shift in their thinking. In the past, they’ve always championed Bitcoin. Choosing to bring out Avit as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum did not go unnoticed, including Ethereum advocate Evan Van Ness who was blunt. ETH fixed this. Bitcoin couldn’t. If Avit truly takes off, this would consolidate Ethereum as the GOAT in the room – and leave all other blockchains in the dust. SEC Roundtables Discuss More Crypto Adoption Plans The new Marvel-sounding SEC Crypto Task Force is planning 4 more crypto roundtables on the subjects of trading, custody, tokenization, and DeFi. With the first one on April 11th, the public are invited to attend in person or online. Get your popcorn and beer ready. The Crypto Task Force – launched one day after President Trump took office – has been told to come up with a workable crypto framework. This has involved abandoning long-running lawsuits against crypto companies and relaxing the rules in general towards crypto adoption. This new SEC-crypto bromance is widely expected to be extremely beneficial for new crypto – such as meme coins – currently in presale, such as Best Wallet Token ($BEST). Their plans align with what Custodia and Vantage are trying to do – bring crypto into the mainstream and make it a default form of payment. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Invest In a Wallet For Online & Offline Payments Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is shaping up as one of the best presales of 2025 , having raised more than $11.5M so far. It’s the native token of Best Wallet , and holders of $BEST will get exclusive benefits which won’t be available to the rest of the unwashed masses. These benefits include cheaper transaction fees, higher staking rewards, governance and voting rights to influence the Best Wallet token, and early access to new projects. Although those ‘new projects’ have not been specified yet. The current token price – which is set to increase today – is $0.024475 and the staking APY is 137%. The bigger picture though is the Best Wallet itself. Like the first US bank stablecoin, Best Wallet wants crypto payments to be something that people do by default. To that end, they want to introduce the BEST debit card, which will enable users to pay for online and offline purchases using their Best wallet balance. Cash could become a thing of the past. Do Your Crypto Research! We end with our usual disclaimers. All of this talk about the best altcoins is obviously very motivating. But nobody can predict the future. Therefore, you’re going into uncertain territory when you invest in crypto. Therefore, don’t take anybody’s word for it – do your own independent research, consult lots of credible sources (your uncle Chad doesn’t count), and make your own decisions. Plus the most important rule of all – don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose. That includes the kid’s college fund and your spouse’s 401K.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-26 13:19:51

This Cardano (ADA) killer is days away from a 13240% massive upside,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/26/got-500-this-cardano-ada-killer-is-days-away-from-a-13240-massive-upside/,"If you missed Cardano’s (ADA) early surge, another explosive opportunity could be right around the corner. ADA, currently trading at $0.71, remains a strong contender for 2025, but a new altcoin is performing well. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.02, is gaining momentum as analysts predict a run to $2.65, marking a massive 13,240% upside. A $500 investment today could skyrocket into $66,700, potentially outpacing ADA’s expected gains. With a $4.9 million funding boost and increasing investor interest, MUTM is positioning itself as this so-called ‘ADA killer’ could be one of the best bets of 2025. Mutuum Finance: a rising performer in DeFi lending Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by integrating a dual-model system that enhances accessibility and mass adoption. With over 6,800 investors backing the project, the platform has secured $4.9 million in presale funding. Currently priced at $0.02 in Phase 3, anticipation grows for a 25% increase in Phase 4, signaling strong profit potential. Analysts predict that upon launch at $0.06, MUTM could surge beyond $5 in the coming months, driven by its innovative lending framework that aligns with the increasing demand for DeFi solutions. Mutuum Finance differentiates its operations by uniting Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in its approach. Through the P2C system users can generate passive revenue by providing USDT as a loan through automatic liquidity pools based on smart contract technology. Through the P2P model users retain independence in asset transactions because they perform lending deals without intermediaries. Mutuum Finance offers P2C together with P2P features to establish a strong security foundation while simultaneously improving efficiency standards and bringing increased profitability for DeFi yield investors. A secure and transparent financial ecosystem Mutuum Finance creates a new stablecoin system that provides full USD backing through Ethereum blockchain infrastructure. Users gain stability from the asset’s over-collateralization features since it eliminates the risks that algorithmic stablecoins suffer from insolvency events. Security takes priority at this platform because it conducts an extensive smart contract audit process to establish complete transparency and build trustworthiness. Mutuum Finance achieves financial reliability excellence by resolving crucial weaknesses previously found in Defi projects. To accelerate growth, Mutuum Finance has introduced aggressive incentive programs. A $1 million giveaway will reward ten investors with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, while the referral system incentivizes users who bring in new participants. Early adopters gain exclusive benefits, including access to staking pools, governance rights, and VIP updates, strengthening their engagement and influence within the ecosystem. Sustainable tokenomics for long-term value Mutuum Finance sets its tokenomics strategy to manage circulation limits and elevate the token’s worth. The limited presale supply created alongside anti-inflationary practices ensures restricted availability that could potentially drive price appreciation. The platform maintains sustainability through staking mechanisms, which also drive token participation toward growth and long-term expansion. The crypto market will likely see substantial growth from Mutuum Finance because of its innovative lending system and strong security measures along with incentives developed by investors. Cardano network retains its market leadership position by trading at $0.71 while demonstrating positive forecasted performance for 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces its “dual-lending model” to challenge the crypto market through a revolutionary platform. The initial pre-sale price of $0.02 for MUTM led to a $4.9 million investment from 6,800 purchasers, which establishes strong foundations for a 13,240% market rise toward $2.65. With $500 invested today, one will gain $66,700 from Mutuum Finance and this amounts to more than projected ADA gains. The future price rise provides the opportunity to purchase during this critical window.

The biggest bulls even see potential for a price explosion above $2. Whales scooped up over 200 million DOGE (worth $41M) in the last two weeks, hinting at strong conviction and a possible supply shock that could push the valuation higher. DOGE’s Next Potential Targets The cryptocurrency market has entered green territory again in the past 24 hours, and Dogecoin (DOGE) is among the top performers. The price of the OG meme coin surpassed $0.20, the highest level witnessed in the last three weeks. Additionally, DOGE solidified its position as the eighth-biggest cryptocurrency after its market capitalization pumped above $30 billion. DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko Multiple analysts highlighted the surge, predicting this might indicate the start of a major bull run. The X user Henry reminded that the last time DOGE registered such a revival was in September 2024, which was later followed by a jump above $0.40. They believe the price can skyrocket to $0.50 or even $1 if history repeats itself. Another market observer, using the X moniker CryptoELlTES, was even more bullish, expecting a ten-fold price increase to a new all-time high beyond $2. The renowned analyst Rekt Capital chipped in, too. They told their over 500,000 followers on X that if DOGE reclaims a weekly close above $0.22, then the price action below that mark in the past few weeks “will have been a downside deviation as part of a very volatile retest of March highs.” Whales on the Move The latest actions of the large investors, known as whales, signal that Dogecoin might be poised for further gains in the short term . The popular analyst Ali Martinez estimated that such industry participants have bought more than 200 million DOGE tokens in the last two weeks. The stash equals over $41 million (calculated at current rates). Martinez claimed that these efforts show “strong confidence despite recent volatility.” Large purchases of that type may encourage smaller players to follow suit and distribute fresh capital into the meme coin’s ecosystem. In addition, this could lead to a supply shock. The reduction in circulating supply creates scarcity, which, combined with non-declining demand, should result in a price rally (at least that’s what fundamental principles of economics dictate).

Alongside this, Fidelity is also developing an Ethereum-based “OnChain” share class for its money market fund and has filed for a Solana ETF. Meanwhile, Custodia and Vantage Banks launched Avit, the first US bank-issued stablecoin on Ethereum, backed by tokenized demand deposits. USDC also continues to dominate the stablecoin market, and recently surpassed $60 billion in supply, with major growth on Solana and new infrastructure upgrades, including faster cross-chain transfers and a launch in Japan. Fidelity Prepares to Launch Stablecoin Fidelity Investments is reportedly nearing the launch of a US dollar-pegged stablecoin, which is yet another big step in the asset manager’s deepening involvement in digital assets. The initiative is being developed through its cryptocurrency arm, Fidelity Digital Assets, and is happening during a shift toward a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto under the Trump administration. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value. They are typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Stablecoins are also often backed by reserves like cash or short-term government securities, and are used to make fast, low-cost transactions or to store value without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Fidelity manages $5.8 trillion in assets, and is also preparing to introduce an Ethereum-based “OnChain” share class for its US dollar money market fund . This new class, once approved by regulators, will enable on-chain tracking of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), which is an $80 million fund primarily composed of US Treasury bills. The OnChain initiative was revealed in a March 21 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is expected to go into effect on May 30. Fidelity’s proposed Solana (SOL)-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) is also drawing a lot of attention. Filed on March 25 through the Cboe BZX Exchange, the ETF could serve as a “regulatory litmus test” for the SEC’s stance on blockchain diversity. Lingling Jiang , a partner at DWF Labs, said that the approval of this ETF will reflect a maturing regulatory posture that acknowledges functional differences between blockchain networks. According to Jiang, an approval like this will likely spur innovation, increase available trading instruments, and boost overall market activity. Meanwhile, the crypto industry is waiting for the potential passage of US stablecoin legislation in the next two months. The GENIUS Act — short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins — aims to create a clear framework for stablecoin collateralization and enforce Anti-Money Laundering compliance. Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, recently said that the bill could soon reach the president’s desk, which will further cement the United States’ pivot toward becoming a global hub for blockchain innovation. Custodia and Vantage Launch First Bank-Issued Stablecoin Custodia Bank and Vantage Bank also recently announced the successful issuance of what they call “ America’s first-ever bank-issued stablecoin ” on a permissionless blockchain. The stablecoin is named Avit, and it is issued on the Ethereum network using the ERC-20 token standard and is backed by tokenized US dollar demand deposits. Custodia revealed the development on March 25, and described it as the activation of a new US dollar payment rail in the US banking system. Custodia CEO Caitlin Long placed a lot of emphasis on the regulatory significance of the launch, and believes that the collaboration between banks proves how demand deposits can be tokenized on a permissionless blockchain in a compliant way. Vantage Bank CEO Jeff Sinnott described the development as a transformative moment for the financial sector, because of the potential of blockchain and stablecoins to modernize payment systems. In posts on X, Long clarified that Avit is a “real dollar” and not a “synthetic” version. She explained that real dollars can only be issued by the Federal Reserve or a small number of authorized institutions, like Custodia Bank, and since Avit tokenizes a bank’s demand deposits—like those in checking accounts—it qualifies as a true representation of the US dollar. The Ethereum community welcomed Custodia’s decision to build the stablecoin on Ethereum due to the platform’s dominance in the stablecoin ecosystem. Ethereum advocate Evan Van Ness commented that “ETH fixed this. Bitcoin couldn’t,” while educator Anthony Sassano pointed out that Ethereum is the permissionless blockchain referenced in Custodia’s announcement. Data from DefiLlama shows that Ethereum currently secures over $125.8 billion in stablecoins, which is almost double that of second-ranked Tron. Additionally, Ethereum leads in tokenized US Treasury bills, with over $3.6 billion compared to Stellar’s $465.7 million, according to RWA.xyz . USDC Growth Accelerates Although new stablecoins are entering the market at a rapid pace, USD Coin (USDC) proved its dominance once again. The supply of USDC surpassed the $60 billion mark, thanks to the stablecoin’s growing adoption and market strength. On March 25, USDC reached an all-time high supply of 60.2 billion, doubling from $30 billion in March of 2024. This milestone happened as the overall stablecoin market cap also hit a record high by climbing past $230 billion. Issued by Circle and backed by a consortium including Coinbase, USDC is pegged to the US dollar and stands as the second-largest stablecoin after Tether’s USDT, which holds a market cap of more than $144 billion. USDC's supply is spread across multiple blockchains, with Ethereum hosting more than $36 billion, followed by Solana with $10 billion. Some of the other blockchains supporting USDC include Base with $3.8 billion, Hyperliquid with $2.2 billion, Arbitrum with $1.8 billion, and Berachain with $1 billion. USDC supply by blockchain (Source: The Block ) Circle increased USDC issuance on Solana by a lot in the first quarter of 2025, minting multiple tranches of 250 million. This helped push the total supply on Solana beyond $10 billion by March 20. At the same time, Circle has been working to expand USDC’s global reach and enhance its infrastructure. This month, the company officially launched USDC in Japan through a partnership with SBI VC Trade. It also announced plans to upgrade bridged USDC on the Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain Linea to a natively issued version. This is the first instance in the industry of a bridged-to-native transition. In addition, Circle rolled out version 2 of its cross-chain transfer protocol (CCTP v2) on Avalanche, Base, and Ethereum.

In a March 26 X post , Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski said Rumble Wallet will be used for content creator monetization. He promised it would work better than most advertisers and that it would use Tether’s USDt ( USDT ). Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino showed his appreciation for the initiative, referring to it as “A wallet for the people” in an X post. Related: Tether seeks Big Four firm for its first full financial audit — Report A flurry of investments The announcement follows Tether investing $775 million in Rumble in late 2024. Ardoino wrote at the time that the company “deeply believes in the fundamental values of freedom of speech and financial freedom.” Source: Paolo Ardoino It is one of several major investments recently made by the $143 billion stablecoin issuer. Reports from 2024 indicated that Tether was the seventh-largest holder of US Treasury securities globally, surpassing many nation-states. In February, Tether acquired a majority stake in Juventus FC , a major Series A football club based in Turin, Italy. During the same month, the stablecoin operator sought to acquire a majority stake in South American agribusiness firm Adecoagro. Rumble also recently began investing its capital, acquiring over $17 million worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ) earlier this month. The firm announced its new strategy in late November 2024, when it voiced its intention to spend up to $20 million adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Rumble was founded in late 2013 as a YouTube alternative for small content creators. The platform saw a significant influx of users from 2020 onward, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Viewership increased from 1.6 million users in 2020 around the US election time to 31.9 million by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Related: Trump Media looks to partner with Crypto.com to launch ETFs Rumble’s foray into the US Venture capitalists backed the platform, including current US Vice President J.D. Vance and former PayPal CEO Peter Thiel. At the end of 2021, US President Donald Trump-linked Trump Media and Technology Group announced a partnership with Rumble, which would “deliver video and streaming for TRUTH Social.” Trump wrote in the announcement: “TMTG continues to align with service providers who do not discriminate against political ideology. Therefore, I have selected the Rumble Cloud to serve as a critical backbone for TMTG infrastructure.” In 2022, Trump’s social media platform Truth Social also migrated to Rumble’s cloud platform. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes said at the time that “Truth Social and Rumble took a major stride toward rescuing the internet from the grip of the Big Tech tyrants.” The partnership between the two companies grew stronger as time went on. Also in 2022, Truth Social joined Rumble’s ad platform as its first publisher. This year, TMTG joined Rumble in a lawsuit to halt alleged censorship in Brazil.

The move reflects the bank’s concern that rising global trade tensions, especially those driven by new U.S. tariffs, will hurt corporate earnings and stall growth across sectors. The new figure implies barely 0.3% upside from the index’s starting point this year. The downgrade came from Venu Krishna, Barclays’ head of U.S. equity strategy. His note, shared through CNBC, points to worsening trade friction under President Donald Trump’s second term. Krishna said the U.S. is already applying new tariffs on products from Canada, Mexico, and China, and that Trump’s administration will roll out more “reciprocal tariffs” on other countries in early April. Barclays sees tariffs slowing earnings and growth Krishna explained that his base scenario assumes “earnings take a hit” as higher tariffs remain in place without getting worse, while reciprocal tariffs on the rest of the world sit at about 5%. He said this would cause a major slowdown in U.S. economic activity, but not a full recession. He placed a 60% chance on this outcome and said it’s already weighing on the S&P 500 outlook. He added that the final scope and severity of tariffs will directly affect earnings forecasts. In the bull case, Krishna said the White House could back off tariff plans if pressure from industries and political groups grows. That, he wrote, would ease the drag on growth and let the S&P 500 retest last year’s valuation highs, potentially reaching 6,700. He gave that a 25% probability. But Krishna’s bear case is where things get ugly. If tariffs from Canada, Mexico, and China all hit at once, along with the new reciprocal levies, the index could fall hard. He said this scenario would cause a sharp drop in corporate profits and lead to a contraction in U.S. GDP. That, in turn, could push the S&P 500 into a bear market, down to 4,400. That’s a 25.2% drop from where the index began 2025. He assigned this outcome a 15% probability. The S&P 500 already looks shaky. After peaking at an all-time intraday high of 6,147.43 in February, the index slid 3% in the past month and briefly fell into correction territory, trading more than 10% below its peak before recovering slightly. Investors fear recession as data, sentiment break down Market volatility has been amplified by mixed signals in both hard and soft economic data. On Tuesday, the U.S. consumer confidence index showed Americans’ expectations for income, jobs, and business dropped to a 12-year low. That data point came ahead of more reports expected later in the week, including February’s durable goods orders and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate. Investors are also watching for the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, due Friday. Traders are using that number to gauge how much pressure remains on prices and how close the economy is to slowing down. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields edged higher on Wednesday morning. The 10-year yield moved up more than 2 basis points to 4.336%, while the 2-year rose 2.6 basis points to 4.01%. These small gains reflect growing expectations that recession risks are climbing. Barclays isn’t alone in sounding the alarm. The latest CFO Council Survey from CNBC showed that 60% of chief financial officers now expect a recession in the second half of 2025. An even bigger chunk—75%—said they’re “somewhat pessimistic” about the overall health of the U.S. economy. The survey also captured frustration over Trump’s economic policies. Corporate leaders described his second-term trade actions as “aggressive” and “disruptive,” with many pointing to sudden tariff decisions as a major cause of instability. Uncertainty around international trade is now one of the biggest risks to business outlooks. Liquidity shrinks, sectors shuffle, and tech stumbles At the same time, liquidity in U.S. equity markets is drying up. Krishna said ongoing trade worries are adding to already-thin trading conditions caused by tighter regulations and the rise of algorithmic trading. Institutions are having a harder time making large trades without pushing prices around. This has triggered bigger price swings and more volatility across the board. Despite the grim headline forecast, Krishna said some sectors might still do well. He upgraded financials to a positive rating and said he favors that space, along with health care and Big Tech, heading into the second quarter. So far this year, financials are up 4.6%, health care has gained 5.6%, and tech is dragging behind—down 7.7% in 2025. Markets opened quietly on Wednesday after the S&P 500 notched its third straight positive session the day before. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 19 points, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both down 0.1%. Still, not everyone believes the weak consumer numbers mean a full-blown recession is here. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” that people are feeling worse than the economy looks on paper. “The soft data looks terrible,” Hickey said Tuesday. “If you look at the soft data, you’d say we’re in a recession right now — especially after today’s consumer confidence report — but it’s a matter of actions speaking louder than words. When you look at the hard data, we’re not seeing nearly the collapse that we’re seeing in the soft data.” Hickey said metrics like housing stats, building permits, industrial production, and new home sales have all been either in line with or stronger than expected. He argued that while people may not feel great about the economy, the actual numbers don’t yet show a collapse. In other market news, GameStop shares jumped 7% in Tuesday’s extended trading. The move followed a decision by its board to invest part of the company’s corporate cash into bitcoin. That puts GameStop on the same path as MicroStrategy, which has famously built up large crypto holdings in recent years. The announcement didn’t include how much bitcoin GameStop plans to buy or when, but the board said the move was unanimously approved. Investors responded fast, pushing the stock higher after hours.

At the same time, they believe that the U.S. President, Donald Trump, nominated Paul Atkins for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could tackle these issues due to his positive regulatory stance. Interestingly, as Atkins is set to face the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow, he has revealed his crypto holdings. What’s he holding? Let’s discuss this. Paul Atkins Owns Nearly $6M in Crypto Holdings Donald Trump’s biggest promise to crypto investors included firing Gary Gensler from the SEC Chairman position. Although he resigned voluntarily, investors are eyeing Paul Atkins joining the role due to his positive crypto stance. Interestingly, he also served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008 under President George W. Bush. He is also the founder of the financial service consultancy firm called Patomak Global Partners. With his experiences in the government regulatory body and financial services, he is considered correct for this role. His recent crypto-holding revelation increased investors’ confidence, and he holds nearly $6 million in crypto investments per the ethics disclosure release on Tuesday. Out of this, $250k to $500k is equity in a crypto custodian called Anchorage Digital. Records also show that he previously held a board position at the BlackRock-backed tokenization firm and held nearly $250k to $500k in call options. $1M-$5M came from stakes of Off the Chain Capital, where he is a limited partner. The documents also revealed his and his wife’s collective net worth. According to the official documents, these two collectively have a net worth between $327 million and $588.8 million. There’s also stocks from his wife’s Tamko Holdings, a major building materials supplier. Lastly, he disclosed 32 financial positions, including nonprofits, family trusts, and LLCs. Will Paul Atkins Sell his Crypto Holdings Like David Sachs Did? The AI and Crypto Czar David Sachs joined the White House earlier in the month. Interestingly, days before joining this role, he made an unexpected decision and sold $200M worth of crypto holdings. He clarified his actions in a podcast interview and revealed that this decision aligned with his role with the government. More importantly, he did not want any pointed fingers. Experts related this decision to Senator Elizabeth Warren and others’ objection to his crypto portfolio and crypto Czar role, calling it a conflict of interest. Interestingly, Warren objected to the same from the SEC Chair nominee Paul Atkins. In a 32-page letter, she requested answers for a few things, including his role in the collapsed FTX. He has answered that by pledging to sell his crypto portfolio and resigning from any crypto-related roles. He also committed to making these changes within 90 days of his role’s approval. Final Thoughts Paul Atkins’s leadership could shift the SEC’s perspective from Gary Gensler’s regulatory enforcement approach. Investors are anticipating a crypto-friendly regulatory stance from Atkins as Gensler’s strict approach costs the industry millions. As he has decided to sell his $6M worth of crypto holdings within 90 days of confirmation, the conflict of interest isn’t an issue anymore. Crypto investors are now eyeing tomorrow’s Senate Banking Committee meeting and Atkins Sec Chairman joining next month.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana gains momentum for 2025 as a new altcoin emerges with massive growth potential. Is a monumental surge in Solana’s value on the horizon by 2025, matching the remarkable growth predicted for a hot new altcoin? This article delves into the factors that could propel Solana to unprecedented heights, drawing parallels with an emerging cryptocurrency that’s making waves in the market. You might also like: Which altcoins will dominate 2025? Examining XYZVerse, Pi Network, and Chainlink XYZVerse prediction: Can it surge 30x? XYZVerse enters the memecoin market amidst growing enthusiasm for community-driven tokens. The remarkable performance of coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk underscores the power of effective branding, viral marketing, and engaged communities in fueling substantial returns. Broader market sentiment also significantly influences XYZVerse’s potential. With altcoin season approaching, low-cap memecoins are attracting heightened investor attention. Since XYZVerse remains in the presale phase, strategic exchange listings and sustained community excitement post-launch could position it favorably for considerable gains. XYZVerse’s key market advantages: Strategic Branding: Sports-themed partnerships and influencer collaborations broaden its appeal. Deflationary Tokenomics: A 17.13% token burn reduces circulating supply pressures. Liquidity Support: A 15% liquidity allocation aims to provide post-launch price stability. Engaged Community: 10% allocation dedicated to community incentives encourages holding and active participation. Price outlook for XYZ Presale Price: $0.003333 Initial Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (project estimate) Potential Early ATH (1-2 weeks post-launch): $0.15 – $0.25, driven by strong demand, strategic exchange listings, and investor FOMO. Long-Term Potential (6-12 months): $0.20 – $0.40, achievable through securing major partnerships and additional listings. Is a 30x jump to $0.10 realistic? A significant surge to $0.10 is achievable, but dependent on: High-Quality Exchange Listings: Gaining placements on top-tier exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, or OKX could dramatically boost launch price. Continuous Community Expansion: Leveraging sports influencers to maintain viral momentum and social media buzz. Positive Market Conditions: Ongoing bullish trends in Bitcoin and major altcoins enhance speculative appeal for memecoins. Can XYZVerse achieve a 3000% increase? XYZVerse has all the components necessary for a robust launch. Achieving and surpassing the $0.10 price point (approximately a 3000% gain from current levels) hinges on effective execution — strong marketing campaigns, influential listings, and sustained community engagement. Early investment opportunity in XYZ Investors looking to maximize profit potential should consider early participation in the XYZVerse presale, anticipating significant price appreciation post-launch. Solana’s SOL coin: The fast lane of cryptocurrency Solana is shaking up the blockchain world with its focus on speed and scalability. Unlike some of its competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana doesn’t rely on sharding or second-layer solutions. Instead, it uses a unique architecture designed for swift transactions and high capacity. At the heart of this platform is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. SOL isn’t just a token; it’s the fuel that powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. In the current market, SOL stands out due to Solana’s growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps). Developers are drawn to its flexibility and support for multiple programming languages. This makes building on Solana more accessible. As the demand for faster and more efficient blockchain solutions grows, Solana’s technology positions it as a strong contender. While the crypto market is always fluctuating, Solana’s approach to handling high activity without sacrificing performance makes the SOL coin an interesting option to watch compared to others in the space. Conclusion While SOL may see gains in 2025, XYZVerse stands out by uniting sports fans in a memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth and promising significant community engagement.

Analysts See “Price Discovery” Mode After SEC Settlement,https://coinedition.com/xrps-next-chapter-analysts-see-price-discovery-mode-after-sec-settlement/,"XRP is trading around $2.46, up 1.66% in the last 24 hours. Predictions from one analyst range from $15 to $44 based on historical patterns. Ripple’s recent settlement with the SEC has improved long-term prospects for XRP. XRP is currently trading at $2.46, showing a 1.66% increase in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data . Fueling this positive sentiment are extremely bullish predictions emerging from crypto analysts who are closely watching key resistance levels now that the SEC has dropped its appeal. Crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has outlined multiple price targets for XRP: Conservative Target: $15 Normal Measurement: $22 Extended Target: $44 Personal Target: $27 These projections are rooted in historical price patterns observed in XRP’s past performance, combined with Fibonacci extension levels. The analyst suggests that if XRP follows its previous market cycles, it could potentially break above the significant $3.40 resistance level and enter a phase of price discovery , where new all-time highs could be established.

42373173,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/?p=41705,1742996706,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png,Congressman Ro Khanna Says Democrats Are Changing Their Tune On Bitcoin,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/congressman-ro-khanna-says-democrats-are-changing-their-tune-on-bitcoin,"Bitcoin Magazine Congressman Ro Khanna Says Democrats Are Changing Their Tune On Bitcoin On March 11, 2025, Rep. Ro Khanna gave a short but impactful talk at the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s Bitcoin for America summit. “Bitcoin is transformational for so many people around the world,” Rep. Khanna stated at the summit. “That is why the Democratic Party should be embracing it as something that can create financial empowerment for people not just in the United States, but around the world.” This is the type of message he’s been spreading for years now, and he’s urged his fellow Democrats to follow his lead. He’s implored them to not be scared of Bitcoin but to view it just as they view other major technological advancements of our time, including the internet itself. “My goal is to make Bitcoin bipartisan,” Rep. Khanna told Bitcoin Magazine. “I want to convince Democrats that bitcoin is a next-generation store of value that millions of people around the world use and that America showing leadership on it allows us to connect with these people, often some of the most disenfranchised.” For a party that often advocates for financial inclusion, it seems almost ironic that so many Democrats have looked past Bitcoin, an open-source technology that anyone can use with nothing more than an internet connection (and, in some cases, even without one ). With that said, Rep. Khanna made the point that, while he remains one of the few more vocal Democrats when it comes to being pro-Bitcoin, the number of Democratic politicians who have stated that they’re in favor of the technology has increased substantially over the past few years. “We went from just 10 of us or so supporting Bitcoin and crypto to almost 70 or 80,” said Rep. Khanna. “It’s happening slowly.” And while some have attributed to malice most Democrats’ historical stance on Bitcoin, Rep. Khanna claims the issue is more a lack of understanding of the technology’s purpose and use cases. “Some Democratic politicians are not aware of how helpful Bitcoin can be with remittances or how it can be used by those who don’t have access to U.S. dollars,” said the congressman. “Many people around the world use it for both reasons,” he added, alluding to the idea that many, including some Democrats, might not be aware of this fact. The Bitcoin And Crypto Voting Bloc In U.S. Swing States According to research from Coinbase , in each of the swing states in the most recent U.S. presidential election, there were about 10 times the number of crypto holders compared to the vote differential between Biden and Trump in 2020. Harris lost to Trump in each of these swing states, leaving some to speculate that the turnout of the Bitcoin and crypto voting bloc may have been one of the primary forces that swayed the election in Trump’s favor. While Rep. Khanna doesn’t know to what extent this voting bloc impacted the election results, he agreed that it was likely one of many major factors that affected the outcome of the election. “I think it made a difference,” said the congressman. “In such a close election, everything matters, and the fact that there were some Democrats who offended Bitcoin and crypto voters was not helpful.” And Rep. Khanna is not alone in acknowledging this. In December 2024, at the New York Times DealBook Summit, Van Jones — political analyst, media persona, and prominent voice within the Democratic party — stated that it was to the Democratic party’s detriment that it shut out pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto voters. Rep. Khanna sang Jones’ praises and said that we should be hearing more voices like Jones’ within the Democratic party speaking up in favor of Bitcoin in the near future. “I have a lot of respect for Van Jones,” said Rep. Khanna. “He spent some time in the Bay Area, so he gets technology. The party will be moving in a direction that’s going to embrace Bitcoin and other technologies,” he added. Will President Trump’s Embrace Of Bitcoin Deter Democrats From Supporting It? While it only seems logical that the Democratic party would reverse its stance on Bitcoin if it’s looking to pick up seats on the House and Senate come the 2026 midterm elections, it simultaneously seems difficult to imagine more Democrats coming out in support of Bitcoin given the highly partisan political climate in the U.S. coupled with the fact that President Trump is an ardent Bitcoin supporter . Rep. Khanna argued that Democrats shouldn’t be thinking along party lines when it comes to Bitcoin, but rather assessing the technology based solely on what it is. “Politicians are capable of evaluating Bitcoin on its merits,” said Rep. Khanna. “Bitcoin is just a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions without a need for an intermediary. People just need to study Bitcoin and learn that it’s just a medium of exchange,” he added. Rep. Khanna also took a moment to differentiate between Bitcoin and meme coins, highlighting the fact that the president’s recently released coin ($TRUMP) creates much confusion regarding the value proposition of crypto assets, including bitcoin. “We shouldn’t have elected officials like President Trump launching meme coins,” said the congressman. Getting Democrats on the Right Side of History At a time when many U.S. citizens are struggling to make ends meet, should Bitcoin be a front-and-center issue for Democrats, once widely regarded as the political party of the middle and working class? Rep. Khanna doesn’t necessarily think so, but he also doesn’t think the party should continue to pooh-pooh the technology. “There are far bigger issues at hand right now like the cuts in Medicaid, the firing of veterans, and the erratic policy of tariffs,” the congressman explained. “But the Democrats were on the wrong side of issues of innovation and Bitcoin in 2022 and 2024, and we now have an opportunity to get on the right side of it,” he added. So, how can pro-Bitcoin Democrat voters help to get their party on the right side of history when it comes to Bitcoin? Rep. Khanna had a few suggestions: “They should point to those of us who are leading on Bitcoin and crypto,” he said. “They can encourage members of government to study the issue, so that they’re not uninformed,” he added. “And they should talk about the enormous adoption of Bitcoin.” This post Congressman Ro Khanna Says Democrats Are Changing Their Tune On Bitcoin first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Frank Corva .",POLITICS|FEATURED|Bitcoin|Democrats|Politics|ro khanna|U.S. House of Representatives,EN,0,0,BTC|TECHNOLOGY|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-03-26 13:45:06

Bitcoin (BTC) saw a marginal rebound as it went from $86,380 to $88,447 before declining to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 1% and trading around $87,220. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) maintained its position above $2,000, registering a marginal increase over the past 24 hours and trading at $2,055. However, it has been unable to make any substantial gains. Ripple (XRP) is up almost 1%, while Solana (SOL) is up nearly 2%, trading at $142. Dogecoin (DOGE) continued its upward trajectory, registering an increase of over 4% and trading at $0.192. Cardano (ADA) is up almost 2%, while Chainlink (LINK) is up over 3% and trading at $15.65. Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases, but Toncoin (TON) continued to trade in the red, with its price down almost 1%. Donald Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve “Nothing New” The crypto and financial community are experiencing a significant buzz after the US’ policy pivot to crypto and the announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a crypto stockpile. However, a strategist from Deutsche Bank has dismissed Donald Trump’s crypto reserve as “Nothing New.” Marion Laboure, managing director and strategist at Deutsche Bank, disregarded the relevance of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a crypto stockpile, stating she saw it as a continuation of many of the moves the wider digital asset industry achieved in 2024. “I would see it more like as a reclassification, nothing really new given that there were already like a lot of talks going on mid-2024.” She added there were still many unknowns regarding the operations of such a reserve, which could explain the mellow response of the markets to these developments. “We don’t know which cryptos will be selected, we don’t know anything about the quotas, we don’t know much about the asset mix, and we don’t know much about the timeline.” Laboure’s views echo the sentiment of many who expected the US to start purchasing Bitcoin immediately. Strategy’s Michael Saylor suggested revaluing gold and selling it to buy a sizable amount of BTC. However, the order also called for budget-neutral strategies to grow the reserve and avoid imposing incremental costs on taxpayers. Trump Crypto Venture Set To Launch Stablecoin World Liberty Financial, the crypto venture run by President Donald Trump’s sons, has announced plans to launch a stablecoin pegged to the value of the US Dollar. The new venture significantly expands the first family’s ties to the crypto industry. The launch comes as the Trump administration and Republicans are gearing up to enact regulatory changes that could benefit the crypto industry, specifically stablecoin issuers. The new legislation would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, giving crypto legitimacy alongside traditional banks. World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin, USD1, will be backed by short-term government treasuries, US Dollar deposits, and other cash equivalents. The venture is the Trump family’s latest attempt to cash in on crypto. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump launched meme coins prior to the inauguration, while Trump’s social media company, Truth Social, has also been expanding its footprint in the crypto ecosystem. Zach Witkoff, co-founder of World Liberty Financial along with the Trump’s, stated, “We’re offering a digital dollar stablecoin that sovereign investors and major institutions can confidently integrate into their strategies for seamless, secure cross-border transactions.” XRP And SOL ETPs See Highest Inflows Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) registered the highest inflows among altcoin-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) during the week ending March 21. XRP ETPs registered inflows worth $6.71 million, while SOL ETPs saw inflows worth $6.44 million. Other altcoins registered significantly lower inflows, with Polygon registering inflows worth $400,000 and Chainlink with $200,000. On the other hand, Ethereum-based ETPs saw outflows worth $86 million, marking the fourth consecutive week of investor pullback. Despite Ethereum’s losses, the digital asset market ended a five-week streak of outflows by registering inflows worth $644 million. Bitcoin led the recovery with $274 million in inflows, the bulk of which came from the US, where BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) played a significant role. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) could suffer its worst quarter in years unless it pulls off a huge rally in the next few days. The flagship cryptocurrency is down almost 7% over the quarter, which ends on March 31 making it BTC’s worst Q1 performance since 2020, when it registered a decline of nearly 11%. However, analysts believe a substantial jump in prices before the quarter looks unlikely, with Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal saying the crypto market will be “flying a little blind” until the middle of April when the market will have clarity on Donald Trump’s tariff plans. However, he added that economic data shows the global economy is in decent shape. However, other analysts believe it's only a matter of time until Bitcoin sees its next significant rally. According to crypto commentator Colin Talks Crypto, BTC could begin its next major rally around April 30, while Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten believes there is a 50% chance BTC will hit a new all-time high before the end of June. BTC is trading around $87,850, up over 1% over the past 24 hours. The crypto market was highly optimistic going into 2025 after a strong finish to 2024 when BTC hit $100,000 for the first time. However, worsening macroeconomic conditions led to a substantial downturn at the beginning of February, primarily due to uncertainty around inflation and Trump’s imposition of tariffs on key trading partners. BTC has seen a substantial rally this week but struggled last week despite starting it on a bullish note, rising almost 2% and settling at $84,016. However, buyers lost momentum on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $81,187. It recovered from this level to settle at $82,725, ultimately registering a decline of 1.54%. Markets rallied on Wednesday following the FOMC meeting. As a result, BTC surged over 5%, moving past the 20 and 200-day SMAs to reach an intraday high of $87,038 before settling at $86,875. However, the rally was short-lived as BTC was back in the red on Thursday, dropping over 3%, slipping below the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settling at $84,215. Source: TradingView Price action remained muted on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $83,822. However, sentiment changed on Sunday as buyers returned to the market. As a result, BTC registered an increase of almost 3%, going past the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settling at $86,116. Buyers retained control on Monday as BTC rallied to an intraday high of $88,839 before settling at $87,523, an increase of almost 2%. However, buyers lost momentum on Tuesday as BTC registered a marginal decline. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Buyers will look to retain control and push BTC above $90,000. A break above this level could set it up for a push towards $100,000. On the other hand, sellers will look to regain control and push BTC below the moving averages and $85,000. The MACD and RSI are bullish, indicating buyers have the upper hand. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has held firm above $2,000 despite facing considerable selling pressure on Tuesday, indicating that bulls are not willing to concede ground to the bears. Like BTC, ETH is also on track to suffer its worst quarter in years unless it pulls off a huge rally before March 31. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has dropped almost 38% during the quarter, its worst Q1 performance since 2018, when it plunged over 46%. While it may seem ETH is struggling, positive momentum is building. While trading volumes have remained relatively stable over the past 24 hours, open interest in ETH futures contracts has steadily increased since the FOMC meeting. Additionally, despite market weakness and the growing competition challenging Ethereum’s dominance in the smart contract space, the network’s stablecoin balance has registered a noticeable growth. Despite recent price struggles, ETH has traded downwards since last Monday when it registered an increase of over 2% and settled at $1,928. The price registered a marginal rise on Tuesday despite facing considerable selling pressure and settled at $1,933. Markets rallied on Wednesday, and ETH surged over 6% to reclaim $2,000 and settle at $2,058. However, bulls lost momentum on Thursday after failing to cross the 20-day SMA and dropped almost 4%, slipping below $2,000 and settling at $1,983. Buyers retained control on Friday as ETH fell nearly 1% and settled at $1,965. Source: TradingView Sentiment changed over the weekend as ETH rose 0.79% on Saturday and settled at $1,981. Buyers retained control on Sunday as the price rose 1.33% to reclaim $2,000 and settle at $2,007. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as ETH started the current week with an increase of almost 4% and settled at $2,082. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday and registered a marginal decline to settle at $2,068. The current session sees ETH marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Buyers will look to establish control and push ETH past $2,200. On the other hand, sellers are still looking to push ETH below $2,000. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) faced considerable selling pressure last weekend but registered a notable jump of 1.58% on Monday to settle at $128. However, sellers returned to the market on Tuesday as the price fell to an intraday low of $121 before settling at $125, ultimately registering a drop of over 2%. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as SOL rallied over 8% to reclaim $130 and settle at $135. However, SOL lost momentum on Thursday, dropping almost 6%, slipping below $130 and settling at $127. SOL registered a marginal recovery on Friday despite facing considerable selling pressure to settle at $128. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Saturday as SOL registered another marginal increase. However, bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price registered a rise of 3.44% to reclaim $130, move past the 20-day SMA and settle at $132. Buyers retained control on Monday as SOL rallied over 6%, surging past $140 and settling at $141. SOL continued to push higher on Tuesday, increasing almost 2% and settling at $143. The current session sees SOL up nearly 1% as it sets its sights on $150. Uniswap (UNI) Price Analysis Uniswap (UNI) was bullish at the beginning of the previous week, registering an increase of almost 3% on Monday to settle at $6.31. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price registered an increase of nearly 1% and settled at $6.37. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as markets rallied. As a result, UNI surged almost 10%, going past the 20-day SMA and $7 to reach an intraday high of $7.39 before settling at $7. However, UNI lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 1.32% on Thursday, slipping below $7 and settling at $6.91. UNI continued to decline on Friday, falling almost 2% and settling at $6.78. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish over the weekend as UNI dropped 0.64% on Saturday and almost 1% on Sunday to end the weekend in the red at $6.68. UNI started the current week on a bullish note, rising over 6% to reclaim $7 and settle at $7.09. However, the price was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping almost 2%, slipping below $7 and settling at $6.97. The current session sees UNI up nearly 1%, having reclaimed $7 and trading at $7.02. Sellers will look to establish control and drive the price below $7 and the 20-day SMA. On the other hand, buyers will look to consolidate above $7 and push UNI past $7.50. Aptos (APT) Price Analysis Aptos (APT) has been trading in an upward trajectory since last Monday, moving past key resistance levels and moving averages. APT rose nearly 4% on Monday and settled at $5.34. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, rising 1.57% despite facing selling pressure and settling at $5.43. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as APT rose over 3% and settled at $5.60. The price faced considerable selling pressure after reaching this level and dropped to a low of $5.41 on Thursday. However, It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $5.62. Sellers gained the upper hand Friday as APT registered a marginal decline after facing considerable volatility and settled at $5.61. Source: TradingView Buyers returned to the market over the weekend as APT rose to an intraday high of $5.81. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $5.67, ultimately registering an increase of just over 1%. Buyers retained control on Sunday as APT registered a marginal increase to end the weekend at $5.71. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as APT rose by 5.51%, going past the 50-day SMA and $6 to settle at $6.02. Despite the strong start to the week, APT was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping almost 2%, slipping below $6 and settling at $5.92. The current session sees APT up nearly 1% and trading at $5.97 as it attempts to reclaim $6. Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Analysis Dogwifhat (WIF) had been struggling to build momentum and move past the 20-day SMA, which was acting as a dynamic resistance level. However, the weekend rally saw WIF break past the moving average and push beyond $0.50. WIF started the previous week on a positive note, rising nearly 8% to move past $0.50 and settle at $0.501.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/qcp-capital-evaluates-gamestops-bitcoin-purchase-could-trigger-a-new-uptrend-here-are-the-details/,"Digital asset trading firm QCP Capital is tactically bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) in the near term, citing increased speculative interest following GameStop’s (GME) unexpected addition of BTC to its corporate treasury. QCP: Bitcoin Poised for Short-Term Outperform Amid GameStop Treasury Move In a note to investors, QCP emphasized that while institutional adoption of Bitcoin is not new, GameStop's status as a meme stock carries significant symbolic weight. The move has the potential to reignite retail investor enthusiasm reminiscent of the 2021 retail trading frenzy, when coordinated action on social media challenged institutional market positioning. “As the 2021 playbook reminds us, retail flows, if coordinated, have the power to challenge institutional positioning,” QCP said. QCP sees a near-term tactical advantage for Bitcoin, citing the psychological impact of GameStop’s decision. The firm suggests that retail investors, emboldened by nostalgia for past market swings, could push Bitcoin higher as speculation increases. GameStop's decision to hold BTC follows in the footsteps of companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy, which have previously made headlines with their Bitcoin purchases. However, given GameStop's cult-like retail following, its foray into digital assets could increase speculative activity in crypto markets. As Bitcoin continues to trade near recent highs, the combination of institutional adoption and renewed retail participation could set the stage for increased volatility and upward momentum in the near-term. *This is not investment advice.

The IMF argued that the heightened volatility is particularly stark during times of market stress when instability often bleeds into real-world effects for corporate borrowers and the investors in their debt. The IMF analysis is one of the first reports to examine the impact of the growing institutionalization of the U.S. ETF industry. It also explores the varied investor profiles of ETFs and the return volatility of the securities they hold. The research highlighted that institutional ownership of U.S.-listed corporate bond ETFs has surged from 44% in 2012 to 70% in 2025.

The IMF believes that investors are fueling volatility by aggressively trading exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The financial agency also argued that a surge in volatility was particularly common during times of market uncertainty. The IMF stated that market stress occurs when instability flows into real-world effects for corporate borrowers and the investors in their debt. “U.S. corporate bond ETFs with a high share of institutional ownership show larger trading volumes during periods of stress.” -International Monetary Fund (IMF). The financial firm suggested that institutional investors use ETFs to manage risks and liquidity shocks that materialize during stress periods, which are then passed on to the underlying market. ETFs have surged to $15 trillion in assets, a fivefold increase in a decade and way above the $4.5 trillion held in hedge funds. The agency’s research highlighted that the growth of ETFs, at the expense of more traditional mutual funds, had reduced volatility in the corporate bond market. The firm attributed it to a belief that “the guaranteed redemption of mutual fund shares at the fund’s net asset value can incentivize run-like behavior by investors.” The IMF noted that mutual funds suffered average net outflows of 10% of their assets during the COVID turmoil of February and March 2020, which worsened the ongoing market sell-off. The firm also said that redemptions from ETFs do not necessarily lead to fire sales of the underlying bonds. The agency argued that market-makers that service ETFs may instead trade “in-kind”, which is taking the bonds to their own balance sheets and temporarily shielding the market from the full impact. ETFs own the largest share of corporate bonds The analysis suggested that a higher ETF ownership share may be associated with lower bond return volatility. There was a divergence between the behavior of institutional and retail investors and their impact on the market. The IMF also argued that volatility tends to be higher when institutional investors own a larger share of a bond through exchange-traded funds. Ownership of corporate bonds between exchange-traded funds and mutual funds. Source: International Monetary Fund . A 1 percentage point increase in the share of a bond held by retail ETF investors is associated with an 85 basis point decrease in volatility. The research found that a 1 percentage point increase in the share held by institutional ETF investors led to a 27 basis point increase in volatility. The researchers noted that “the role of institutional investors is amplified during periods of stress.” The IMF stated that intraday trading of ETFs encourages more aggressive short-term institutional investors who are more likely to sell during periods of stress, while institutions are also more likely to take short positions in bond ETFs. A trio of U.S. business schools revealed in 2023 that fixed-income ETFs can drain the liquidity from corporate bonds during market stress, potentially worsening price dislocations during crises. The agency also believes that markets are more liquid than the volatility induced by trigger-happy institutional ETF investors in the corporate bond market may not necessarily be replicated in government bonds or equities. A research by associate professor of finance at UCLA Anderson School of Management Valentin Haddad in 2022 found that the rise of passive investing of ETFs was distorting price signals and pushing the volatility of the U.S. stock market. Keneth Lamont, principal of research at Morningstar, said it was not surprising to hear that sophisticated investors were more likely to use ETFs tactically and that it results in higher levels of trading than retail investors.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , still priced at just $0.02 in its presale, is quickly catching attention for its real utility, fast-growing momentum, and clear roadmap. And with Phase 3 of its presale already 76% sold out, the window to buy at this price is narrowing fast. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike many tokens that enter the market without a clear product, Mutuum is already offering a working framework designed around lending and borrowing. The project is built as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users to lend crypto assets to earn interest or borrow against their holdings without selling them. By doing so, it combines the best of both DeFi and traditional finance in a way that can appeal to long-term users and active traders alike. What sets Mutuum apart—and puts it in direct comparison to XRP—is its emphasis on real-world value and practical use cases. While XRP focuses on payments and partnerships with financial institutions, Mutuum is building a financial ecosystem that gives individuals complete control over their assets. It doesn’t rely on intermediaries or custodians. Instead, all transactions run through on-chain smart contracts, offering transparency and full asset control. Users who deposit into Mutuum’s liquidity pools receive mtTokens in return. These tokens represent the deposited asset and the interest it earns. Over time, they increase in value and can be redeemed for the original token plus interest. This makes supplying liquidity on Mutuum not just safe but also rewarding. Meanwhile, borrowers can secure loans by locking in overcollateralized assets—keeping exposure to the market while gaining access to liquidity, which is a strategy many XRP holders use to manage capital. Mutuum’s model also adapts to different user strategies. Interest rates adjust automatically depending on how much liquidity is being used, and borrowers can choose between variable and stable rates. There are no fixed repayment deadlines, as long as the collateral remains strong enough. This creates a more flexible, user-first experience that’s hard to find in traditional finance. Beyond the product itself, the tokenomics are another reason analysts are taking notice. A portion of the protocol’s revenue will be used to buy MUTM from the open market, with those purchased tokens distributed to users who hold and stake their mtTokens. This setup not only creates consistent buying pressure but also rewards mtToken holders directly for supporting the ecosystem. As adoption grows and more users participate, this cycle is expected to strengthen MUTM’s long-term value and incentivize continued engagement. Now priced at $0.02, MUTM is still in Phase 3 of its presale, and the pace is accelerating. With 76% of the current round already sold, buyers are moving quickly to lock in before the price rises to $0.025 in Phase 4. That jump marks a 25% increase, and with each phase offering a higher entry point, those who wait may end up paying significantly more before launch. The final launch price is set at $0.06—already 3x from today’s rate—so the early-stage opportunity is clear. While XRP remains a major player, Mutuum is building something that addresses a broader need: a user-driven, accessible platform where control, earnings, and liquidity are in the hands of the individual. And with its presale selling out faster by the day, MUTM is quickly shaping up to be more than just a competitor—it might be the smarter play for the months ahead.

The announcement fueled a 14% XRP price jump within 24 hours. The XRP price rally is backed by strong technical momentum and increased buying activity, while the Ripple network’s activity has also reached record highs. These XRP price actions have caused a wave of excitement among investors. In the same session, IntelMarkets (INTL) also creates a buzz with a massive presale raise of $12 million. The INTL token is being called the best ICO of this bull run with unique features and unparalleled investors’ appeal. Experts claim that these two tokens are poised to touch the $4 mark very soon. XRP Prices Surge As Buyers Capitalize On Bullish Momentum XRP price has been on an ascending path as supported by the technical analysis. A critical technical indicator, the Directional Movement Index (DMI), indicates buyers are in control of the Ripple actions. Average Directional Index (ADX) has risen from 15.64 to 20.4. This means that the current trend is gaining strength for the XRP price. The ADX is not directional, meaning it doesn’t tell whether the trend is upward or downward. However, combined with the (Directional Movement Index) +DMI and -DMI indicators, they can indicate the market’s direction. In the XRP price case, the +DMI has spiked from 18.3 to 39, and the -DMI has fallen from 19.63 to 12.97. This indicates aggressive demand and a softening supply for Ripple tokens. If this momentum persists, the XRP price may increase further. The ADX must also be over 25 to indicate a strong trend — but this is already a good sign. Ripple Users Set New Activity Records Ripple blockchain activity is up, and active addresses reached a record 1.19 million in a week, an increase of almost five times from 237,000 on February 27. This fast pace of growth indicates a large increase in engagement and adoption of the Ripple network. This uptick in activity is indicative of interest from retail traders, institutional investors, and the market in general. This can result in lower Ripple volatility and greater XRP price movements. A rise in active addresses generally translates into a growth in transactions, which can drive price volatility. But XRP’s price action remains bullish, with a golden cross pattern—a key bullish indicator—just about to form as a short-term moving average closes in on a crossover with a long-term moving average. Should this trend continue, XRP price may retest the $2.648 resistance line and, if buying pressure increases, potentially hit $2.99. A breakout above this level could lead XRP price above $3. If the momentum wanes, Ripple will likely find it difficult to maintain its current range. The main level of support is at $2.47. If the XRP price drops below $2.90, the Ripple token may fall to $2.21 or even $1.90.

In a March 26 X post, Calacanis suggested that buying Bitcoin ( BTC ) was a solution well-suited for public companies that do not have a suitable business model: “If you’re a public company that can’t figure out a business model, buy Bitcoin! This might actually be great advice if [Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor] is gonna buy $1T in Bitcoin.” Still, Tomas Fanta, principal at crypto investment firm Heartcore, told Cointelegraph that there are tangible long-term benefits to holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet . Among those he listed were long-term price appreciation and theoretically lower correlation to equity markets over time. “I do disagree with the view, though, that failing companies should be using Bitcoin as the last-ditch strategy,” Fanta said. Related: GameStop hints at future Bitcoin purchases following board approval Source: Jason Is GameStop’s adoption part of a trend? Fanta said that while “one case is not enough to gauge a broader trend,” there does appear to be such a trend: “We may actually be witnessing one of the first experiments with corporate treasury diversification into crypto outside of tech or crypto-aligned companies such as Tesla or Coinbase.” Saul Rejwan, managing partner at crypto early-stage venture capital firm Masterkey, echoed the sentiment. According to him, companies are increasingly trying to secure themselves against long-term monetary shifts. “Bitcoin’s role as a corporate reserve asset is no longer fringe; it’s becoming a legitimate play for companies that want to align themselves with a digitally-native, inflation-resistant financial future,” he said. “While not every company will follow suit, GameStop’s move joins a growing chorus,” Rejwan added. Related: GameStop buying Bitcoin would ‘bake the noodles’ of TradFi: Swan exec Adopting Bitcoin is adapting to change Rejwan also noted that historically successful companies often falter when they resist change — citing Nokia as an example — and said adopting Bitcoin could be viewed as a strategic adaptation: “When done transparently and with proper risk management, Bitcoin can bring long-term resilience to corporate balance sheets — especially for brands with low time preference and strong alignment with digital-native values.” This idea was also repeated by Georgii Verbitskii, founder of crypto investment app TYMIO, who said that GameStop “could well become the example the market is waiting for.” He added: “Adding Bitcoin to a corporate balance sheet isn’t just speculative — it has real, long-term upside if executed properly.” Magazine: SEC’s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-26 13:58:08

With that said, the Dogecoin millionaire club is making big moves again. However, this AI contender could flip things around with its explosive presale performance and a potential grand listing in 2025 post-launch. Dogecoin Wallets Holding 1M Coins Spike As DOGE Targets $1 Along with many other memecoins and altcoins in the market, Dogecoin has faced a two-month market-wide retrace, but large holders appeared to be taking advantage of the price dip. According to reports from Santiment, the number of wallet addresses holding at least 1 million DOGE tokens has steadily increased, suggesting that whales are buying instead of selling. Since early February, the amount of DOGE millionaire addresses has soared by 62 wallets, which accounts for a 1.24% increase. Additionally, active addresses have multiplied past 150,000 per day, the highest since mid-November 2024. This increased network activity signals sustained user engagement and a surging interest and confidence from DOGE whales. Moreover, a rising wallet count outlines that users are reentering the market, driving adoption, and increasing trading activities. DOGE Technical Indicators Hint at a Potential Price Reversal If Dogecoin continues to see a surge in its high-profile wallets and active addresses, it could prepare the ground for a strong reversal once the market stabilizes. Santiment also shared a similar sentiment, as its report reveals that an increase in Dogecoin’s utility and smart money signals a potential turning point soon. Based on the technical factors, the memecoin’s price action appears uncertain due to the market’s broader downturn. The Dogecoin price has crashed by over 40% in the past month, pushing it down to $1.67. According to Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin’s weekly Doji candle indicates a reversal to the upside. If the memecoin can continue on its upward momentum, analysts say it could surge to $1 before the end of 2025. This surge would represent a massive 498% price increase from DOGE’s current market lows. IntelMarkets’ AI Robots Trained On 100,000 Data Points Turn Heads While the memecoin project DOGE is moving toward a recovery phase, IntelMarkets (INTL) is turning heads with cutting-edge AI robots offering mind-blowing trading opportunities. The platform’s AI trading robots are trained on over 100,000 data points and have self-learning abilities to train themselves and give users an edge over the shifting crypto market dynamics. DOGE investors and traders are shifting to IntelMarkets’ $0.09 INTL token for its robust trading signals. The platform is gaining traction for sharing in-depth market insights with its proprietary AI blockchain that offers dual-chain functionality featuring Ethereum and Solana. This way, investors can choose either of the blockchains depending on their preferences. IntelMarkets is a Backdoor to Dogecoin: Meta Ex-Employee Claims One of the main reasons IntelMarkets is gradually becoming a Dogecoin-killer is its strong platform fundamentals. The platform offers an exclusive ‘Quantum Levels’ system designed to provide whopping monthly income structures with capital gains through its advanced trading bot. This bot leverages over 10,000 data analysis points to execute trades with enterprise-grade accuracy. IntelMarkets (INTL) trades company funds, and a portion of the profits is distributed monthly to its ‘Quantum level’ clients, creating a steady income stream with the added benefit of potential capital gains as the presale price increases.

The current Dogecoin (DOGE) technical analysis points to a key support at $0.17, where a hold might lead to a recovery. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price outlook remains shaky, with persistent selling pressure keeping prices under the $2,000 mark. But while DOGE and ETH ride out market swings, BlockDAG (BDAG) is turning heads for all the right reasons. The presale has already brought in $206 million—one-third of its $600 million goal. With strong fundamentals, real-world adoption, and big-name partnerships, BlockDAG is gaining traction fast. Experts are now saying it could reach $1 by the end of 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis: Pointing to a Turnaround? Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading near $0.16 after falling 16% in just a week. Still, technical indicators—like the doji candle pattern and ascending triangle—are giving some hope. A solid bounce from $0.17 support could mark the start of a rebound. On the downside, if it slips past that support, further drops could follow. Some price models suggest DOGE might rise to $0.355 by March 2025, while others take a more conservative route, targeting $0.214 by 2030. For now, Dogecoin’s momentum hinges on holding that $0.17 level, as outlined in the recent Dogecoin (DOGE) technical analysis. Ethereum Faces Key Test Below $2K as Market Stays Bearish Ethereum’s price outlook is still uncertain. It has spent a week under $2,000, held back by resistance and consistent selling. Right now, $1,823 acts as support—if that breaks, ETH could fall further toward $1,759 or even revisit $1,700, a level it hasn’t touched since October 2023. There is some upside, though. If ETH finds stability and pushes above $1,956, it could gain momentum. Breaking past that point might set up a run to $2,106, and possibly $2,320 or $2,546. For now, Ethereum’s path depends on whether it can hold its ground and change sentiment around its price action. BlockDAG’s $206M Presale Sparks Buzz Over 3,932% ROI Potential BlockDAG is getting a lot of attention, and for good reason. It’s seen as the best crypto right now, raising $206 million and selling over 18.9 billion coins. What’s driving the buzz? A mix of advanced tech, real-world use cases, and powerful partnerships. The X1 Miner App has played a huge role in BDAG’s rise. With over 500,000 users, the app lets anyone mine coins from their phone—making crypto accessible and user-friendly. Add in the recent Inter Milan sponsorship, and BlockDAG has also gained global visibility, connecting with fans and growing its user base. The tech side is equally impressive. BlockDAG uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, letting it handle over 10,000 transactions per second. It also supports smart contracts, setting it apart from traditional chains. All this makes BlockDAG one of the most capable platforms being built right now. Looking ahead, the mainnet launch and 10 exchange listings are planned for 2025. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, analysts say it could reach $1 within the year. That’s a 3,932% return—one of the strongest projections in the current market. The presale is picking up pace, and batch 27 is almost fully sold. Traders are moving fast to lock in this price before it jumps. Cut It Short! Dogecoin (DOGE) might rebound if it holds the $0.17 support, and Ethereum could stage a rally if it breaks $1,956. Both are worth watching, but neither matches the upside currently projected for BlockDAG. With a price of just $0.0248 in batch 27, BDAG is seen as the best crypto right now for those looking ahead to 2025. Experts believe it could rise to $1, delivering a potential 3932% ROI. If adoption continues growing and development stays on track, waiting could mean missing out. BDAG might just be the coin that leaves others playing catch-up.

The company's business development unit, Bitso Business, has established Juno, a subsidiary dedicated to issuing and managing digital assets including stablecoins. Bitso Business also recently appointed Ben Reid as head of stablecoins to drive the firm's ambition in the stablecoin market. The first token Juno issues is a fully-backed Mexican peso stablecoin (MXNB), aiming to facilitate cross-border payments and financial transactions between businesses across the region. The firm deployed the token on Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum. Stablecoins, now a nearly $230 billion asset class , have been one of the biggest success stories in crypto adoption. With prices pegged to an external asset, predominantly to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, they offer a cheaper and faster alternative to traditional financial rails for payments, remittances, savings and currency conversion. They are especially popular in developing countries with large unbanked populations or fragile local currencies. Meanwhile, regulations around the world are being laid down or advanced to fit stablecoins into the global financial system. ""Global companies face significant monetary challenges when it comes to serving customers in new markets and conducting cross-border payments, including high intermediary costs and inefficient transaction times,"" Bitso's Reid in a statement. ""Stablecoins provide a fast, cost-effective and transparent fiat-pegged alternative and have been instrumental in expanding access to foreign markets and transforming payments worldwide. ""Juno's new MXNB stablecoin will help ""global companies to do business in Latin America in a more efficient way,"" he added. To support adoption of its stablecoin, Juno has rolled out the Juno Mint Platform, which provides APIs and tools for businesses to issue, redeem and convert MXNB.

This time around, they’ve got a weapon they didn’t have last time — generative artificial intelligence. And they’re not just talking about it. These guys are launching AI products every week, stacking up tools, updates, and revenue like it’s a clearance sale on innovation. The AI flood isn’t hype. In just the past two weeks, a long list of China-based companies have pushed out new tools or announced exactly how they’re making money from them. They’re not experimenting. They’re shipping. Chinese companies launch new AI tools and show profits Short-video platform Kuaishou said on Tuesday that its AI video-generation tool Kling pulled in over 100 million yuan (about $13.78 million) since launching last summer. That’s not testing — that’s market traction. Meanwhile, Tencent rolled out an updated version of its AI model for creating 3D visuals. Those visuals can be used in games or for 3D printing. It also pushed out the full release of its Hunyuan T1 reasoning model. Weeks earlier, Tencent had plugged T1 into its chatbot app Yuanbao, which also connects to DeepSeek’s R1. Tencent said daily active users on Yuanbao jumped 20x in one month. Some farmers are even using the app to check soil quality before planting. It’s a chatbot, but it’s farming now. Welcome to 2025. Baidu launched tools on Monday that let people build websites and simple games using plain prompts — no coding skills needed. One day later, Kunlun Tech, the company that owns the Opera browser, upgraded its Mureka app that uses AI to make music. China’s advantage isn’t just software. It’s machines. It has factories full of hardware that can collect useful data, making it easier to train models that fit real-world industries. Maxwell Zhou, CEO of DeepRoute.ai, said that gives China a physical edge. DeepRoute.ai, which launched in 2019, said last week it’s building a voice-controlled delivery system for autonomous vehicles. Zhou said the idea is to say stuff like “pick up coffee from this store and send it to the apartment,” and the car just does it. He hopes it goes live across China early next year. Beijing faces pressure as U.S. hits AI firms with blacklist While China pushes AI, the U.S. is doing the opposite — locking Chinese tech out. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security dropped the hammer this week, adding 80 organizations to its export blacklist. Over 50 of them are from China. American companies are now banned from selling to those on the list unless they get government permission. The agency said these firms acted against U.S. national security and foreign policy. That includes tech tied to exascale computing and quantum technology — stuff that processes massive amounts of data and pushes the military edge. Dozens of Chinese entities were targeted for helping develop advanced AI, high-performance chips, and supercomputers for military use. Two companies were flagged for supplying restricted tech to Huawei and its chip unit HiSilicon. In total, 27 Chinese firms were blacklisted for trying to use U.S. tech for military modernization. Another seven companies were linked to quantum computing advances. Even six subsidiaries of Inspur Group — a Chinese cloud company already banned by Biden in 2023 — made the list again. China’s foreign ministry wasn’t happy. It said Wednesday that it “strongly condemns” the move and urged the U.S. to “stop generalizing national security,” according to Reuters. The blacklist also took aim at anyone helping China access tech through backdoors. Alex Capri, from the National University of Singapore, said it’s about targeting third countries, transit points, and intermediaries. He said some Chinese firms got U.S. dual-use tech using loopholes. “U.S. officials will continue to step up tracking and tracing operations aimed at the smuggling of advanced semiconductors made by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices,” Capri said. AI helps offset earnings hit as tariffs rise again Chinese businesses aren’t just building AI for show. They’re trying to stay profitable while tariffs tighten the noose again. Ding Wenjie, investment strategist at China Asset Management, said the AI boom is lifting earnings expectations. That’s critical because profit numbers will show whether China’s economy is actually bouncing back or still dragging under Trump’s new tariffs. Analysts think AI tools will help cut costs and soften the blow from slowed growth. With AI running workflows and generating content, firms can do more with less — fast. But the hit is real. Back in February, Goldman Sachs said if the U.S. slaps a 20% tariff hike on Chinese goods, corporate profits in Hong Kong dollar terms could drop by 5%. And it’s not just about earnings or products anymore. The U.S. and China are headed for something bigger. After a trip to China, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman said the urgent topic isn’t Taiwan or tariffs — it’s AI. He compared it to nuclear arms talks during the Cold War. Friedman thinks U.S.-China AI cooperation might need a global agreement, just like the one Washington had with Moscow back in the day. That’s how seriously some folks are taking this tech war. Meanwhile, DeepSeek , a rising AI startup in China, is driving adoption of low-cost, open-source AI models. These are the opposite of the expensive, proprietary models pushed by American giants. DeepSeek’s rise is turning up the heat on those U.S. firms and giving China more local firepower. The Trump administration isn’t backing off either. It already rolled out sweeping export bans on chips, servers, and anything tied to high-performance computing under its “small yard, high fence” policy. That means the U.S. is trying to block a tight set of sensitive tech, while letting everything else flow normally. Jeffrey I. Kessler, Under Secretary for Industry and Security, said they’re sending a “clear, resounding message” that Trump will block U.S. tech from being used in military drones, hypersonic weapons, and aircraft training. “The entity list is one of many powerful tools at our disposal,” Kessler said, “to identify and cut off foreign adversaries seeking to exploit American technology for malign purposes.” China might be locked out, but it’s not slowing down. Companies are still building, launching, and finding ways to work around the wall. Whether that holds — or cracks — is what comes next. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

On March 19, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the case had concluded. In an X post, the Ripple executive said the SEC will drop its appeal against Ripple , ending the $1.3 billion unregistered securities suit that started in December 2020. Following the development, Nate Geraci, president of the advisory firm ETF Store, said on X that the approval of an XRP ( XRP ) ETF is next. Geraci said it was “obvious” that it’s only a “matter of time” before the SEC approves an XRP ETF. The executive predicted that asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity would be involved in offering the asset. Polymarket punters give 86% odds to XRP ETF approval in 2025 Aside from Geraci, users on the crypto betting platform Polymarket also expect approval for an XRP ETF in 2025.

Now, an innovative new platform, ZENMEV , has emerged, attracting a great deal of attention. ZENMEV is the industry’s first staking model based on MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) and is designed to allow ordinary users to easily earn MEV profits by leveraging an AI-based algorithm. Once monopolized by miners or validators, MEV earnings can now be shared transparently and securely with long-term holders. With the slogan “Crypto Staking Reimagined,” ZENMEV introduces a new paradigm in staking. MEV refers to the additional profit obtained by optimizing the order of transactions during block creation, something that in the past was captured mainly by advanced miners or automated bots. By combining its own blockchain infrastructure with an AI engine, ZENMEV is opening up MEV opportunities to all staking participants, heralding a major shift in DeFi’s revenue structure. According to a recent announcement, ZENMEV has also secured large-scale venture funding upon its launch, with plans for aggressive global expansion into Europe, Asia, and North America. ZENMEV: The First MEV-Focused Staking Model in the Industry What makes ZENMEV special is that it’s the first staking framework introduced within the MEV ecosystem. Traditional staking typically involves depositing tokens (e.g., on Ethereum’s PoS network) to receive fixed block rewards or a portion of transaction fees. In contrast, ZENMEV uses its own specialized MEV platform to generate additional revenue beyond mere block rewards. When users deposit assets like Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), or Solana (SOL) into ZENMEV, their funds are pooled into the protocol’s liquidity pool, where they are utilized by high-performance AI trading bots (dubbed Zenbots). Zenbots scan the blockchain mempool in real time to detect arbitrage, front-running, back-running, and other MEV opportunities, automatically executing transactions. Profits generated are promptly and proportionally distributed to staking participants via a smart contract, with no intermediary intervention. Anyone can view their stake and earnings through a dashboard, ensuring full transparency. In short, even without operating a complex MEV bot or possessing specialized knowledge, users can enjoy AI-driven, automated MEV profits through ZENMEV. Of particular note is ZENMEV’s Zenbots Shield engine, which detects and blocks external miners from monopolizing MEV opportunities, instead returning them to users. This approach transforms MEV from an “invisible tax” on blockchain users into a sustainable revenue model that benefits all ecosystem participants. Thanks to this innovative approach, ZENMEV is establishing itself as a first mover that sets a new standard in the DeFi space from the moment of its launch. AI Algorithms for Automated MEV Profit Discovery and Distribution The most significant technical differentiator of the ZENMEV platform is its AI algorithm-based automated discovery and distribution of MEV profits. The AI trading bots called Zenbots play a central role. These bots apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze large volumes of on-chain data, comparing prices across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to spot risk-free arbitrage opportunities, thus reacting much faster to market movements than human traders. For instance, if there is a large token swap or a price discrepancy between DeFi protocols, Zenbots detect and execute trades immediately to capture those profits. This MEV scanning and optimization process is fully automated, so users can benefit simply by “depositing and leaving it,” enjoying seamless income generation without any manual intervention. Any MEV profits discovered in real time by the AI system are instantly distributed through ZENMEV’s smart contracts. According to ZENMEV, each time an MEV trade is successfully completed, its net profits are automatically settled based on participants’ stakes. In high-volume market environments, this cycle can occur multiple times a day. Early users report that they receive interest payouts multiple times a day, indicating that rewards are effectively distributed in near real time. Moreover, as all profits and distribution details are recorded on-chain, users can transparently track the operation of the staking pool and the MEV income generated through the dashboard. In summary, ZENMEV is a next-generation staking platform that uses AI to capture MEV opportunities around the clock and automatically share those results with its users. Comparison with Traditional Staking Platforms: ZENMEV’s Strengths and Revenue Model How does ZENMEV’s revenue model differ from that of typical staking platforms? The biggest difference lies in the diversification of revenue sources and structure. Traditional staking usually involves depositing coins into a PoS blockchain network to earn relatively fixed protocol rewards (e.g., Ethereum validator rewards or staking interest). The yield is generally linked to the token inflation rate or transaction fees, making it relatively predictable but not designed to capitalize on market volatility or fluctuations. In contrast, ZENMEV encompasses not only these basic rewards but also “irregular” profits from on-chain transactions. By pursuing potential gains arising during block creation through MEV strategies, it can achieve higher yields compared to simple holding or existing staking. For example, sophisticated strategies such as flash-loan arbitrage or exploiting price disparities between multiple DEXs, which are difficult for ordinary investors to execute on their own, are handled automatically by ZENMEV’s AI, with the resulting profits shared among participants—no specialized knowledge needed. Another differentiator is multi-chain support and versatility. While many staking platforms focus on a single chain, ZENMEV plans to expand across various blockchains from the outset, starting with Ethereum and BNB Chain as core networks, and then branching into Solana, Cosmos, and others. Because transaction structures, speeds, and gas fee mechanisms vary across different networks, MEV opportunities also differ. ZENMEV has developed chain-specific MEV algorithms to execute optimized strategies on each network. As a result, staking income is stabilized and diversified by securing multiple revenue sources across various ecosystems. From the user’s perspective, depositing assets into the ZENMEV platform yields MEV profits not only from Ethereum or BNB Chain but also, eventually, from Solana and other chains all at once. Furthermore, user experience is significantly enhanced compared to other platforms. Typically, engaging in MEV strategies independently requires complex bot programming, node operation, and transaction fee optimization. With ZENMEV, all these complexities are handled internally. Users need only to connect their wallets and stake tokens—no need to learn about MEV or time the market. In short, ZENMEV represents a new evolution over existing staking platforms by offering advanced trading strategy returns, multi-chain diversified income, and straightforward ease of use. Core Features of ZENMEV: Security, Decentralization, and Real-Time Profit Payouts ZENMEV emphasizes security, decentralization, and real-time profit payouts as its core values—crucial foundations for long-term holders seeking a stable environment. Let’s look at each one: Security and Transparency ZENMEV is run through smart contracts with minimal human intervention, having undergone multiple security audits prior to launch to strengthen its defenses against vulnerabilities. The platform’s dedicated security module, Zenbots Shield, enhances transaction safety and reduces hacking risks. Operationally, ZENMEV has earned ISO 9001:2015 (Quality Management) and ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (Information Security) certifications, confirming adherence to international standards in security and operational processes. In managing user assets, ZENMEV employs partial key-splitting and end-to-end encryption—bank-level security measures that guarantee the secure custody of deposited assets. All transaction records and profit distributions are stored on-chain, ensuring high transparency and user confidence. Decentralization and Community Participation ZENMEV operates via smart contracts without centralized intermediaries and leverages multi-chain compatibility to utilize liquidity throughout the broader ecosystem. The platform roadmap includes plans to introduce its own governance token, $ZMEV, to enable community-based decision-making. Once governance is implemented, stakers can vote on profit distribution structures, adoption of new MEV strategies, and more, steering the platform’s direction in a decentralized manner. This community-driven governance is poised to enhance long-term sustainability and user trust. Real-Time Profit Payouts As mentioned, ZENMEV frequently settles and distributes profits earned from MEV transactions in near real time. While many staking services offer rewards once a day or at set intervals, ZENMEV can credit your wallet multiple times within a single day. For instance, if MEV arbitrage yields a profit in the morning, it’s immediately added to stakers’ balances, and if a new opportunity arises in the afternoon, those gains are again distributed instantly. Users can track these real-time profit flows via the web dashboard and can withdraw or reinvest rewards whenever they choose, granting significant flexibility in managing earnings. This instant payout system is advantageous for compounding effects and rapid response to market conditions, making it highly appealing for long-term token holders. Why It’s Attractive for Long-Term Holders ZENMEV’s emergence is particularly good news for investors who prefer holding (HODLing) assets long term, mainly because it offers a stable cash flow without having to rely solely on price appreciation. Key benefits for long-term holders include: Consistent, High Potential Returns: If you’re holding cryptocurrency for a long time, ZENMEV allows you to earn continuous revenue without selling. Because it incorporates multiple revenue streams, including market-neutral (arbitrage) strategies, it can pursue stable profits regardless of market conditions. Over time, the compounding effect can significantly increase total asset holdings. Diversified Investment Through Multi-Chain Support: ZENMEV simultaneously executes MEV strategies on Ethereum, BNB Chain, and eventually Solana, Cosmos, etc. This provides a multi-chain exposure with just a single deposit, thereby diversifying the investor’s risk. For example, even if the Ethereum ecosystem underperforms, profits may still be generated from MEV opportunities on Solana or other chains. User-Friendly Automation and Low Entry Barrier: Many long-term holders are not experts in advanced DeFi strategies. ZENMEV’s interface and one-click staking feature ensure even newcomers can participate easily. There’s no need to configure complex systems or continuously manage positions, and liquidity is readily accessible with flexible deposit/withdrawal. Essentially, your crypto is “worked” by AI in the background, allowing you to earn passive income with minimal effort. Transparent, Trustworthy Operation: For long-term investment, trust in the platform is essential. ZENMEV runs on audited smart contracts, offering transparency via real-time data disclosure. Additionally, the platform aims for an ethical approach to MEV that does not harm network health, supporting the sustainable growth of the DeFi ecosystem. These elements help secure the confidence of long-term participants. In short, ZENMEV is an ideal platform for investors who plan to hold crypto assets for an extended period and want to grow them steadily. It provides a new method of accumulating wealth that goes beyond simply waiting for price appreciation. How to Participate in the ZENMEV Platform Finally, participating in ZENMEV is quite simple. Provided as a web-based dApp, there is no need to install additional software. First, prepare a supported network wallet (e.g., MetaMask for Ethereum) and visit the official ZENMEV website to connect your wallet. After connecting, you can begin staking immediately—no account creation or KYC required—by depositing the cryptocurrencies you hold. Currently, ETH, USDT, SOL, and other assets are supported. Once you deposit, you receive a staking token (a deposit receipt) from the ZENMEV protocol representing your stake. At this point, you’re essentially set: ZENMEV’s AI engine takes care of all MEV-related strategies in the background. You can monitor your staking status and real-time profits on the dashboard and can unstake (withdraw) your assets and accumulated earnings whenever you wish. In other words, with just three steps—Connect Wallet → Deposit Assets → Confirm Staking—anyone can join ZENMEV’s MEV-based revenue sharing. There are no complicated configurations or ongoing management requirements. If you’ve ever used a standard savings account or a traditional staking service, ZENMEV will feel similarly straightforward. Conclusion The launch of ZENMEV introduces a new paradigm for long-term cryptocurrency investors. By combining the concept of MEV with a staking revenue model for the first time in the industry, ordinary users can finally enjoy a fair share of the hidden, additional profits embedded in blockchain transactions. Leveraging AI and multi-chain technologies, ZENMEV’s automated MEV strategies are contributing to the democratization of complex DeFi activities while maximizing earning opportunities. Its security and transparency measures, community-driven decentralization, and real-time reward distribution all make ZENMEV a trustworthy partner for those seeking consistent, long-term returns. Naturally, all investments carry risks, and MEV strategy outcomes can vary with market conditions. However, ZENMEV’s innovative approach and performance have already attracted considerable attention from DeFi investors. With substantial funding secured and plans for further growth, its future potential is worth watching. If you intend to hold cryptocurrencies for the long run, why not consider “doubling the reward of holding” through ZENMEV? As a transparent and sustainable model of revenue generation, ZENMEV could serve as a reliable companion in your long-term investment journey.

The automated market maker is in the middle of a short squeeze and could lose a fortune if the Solana memecoin continues to surge. Solana Memecoin Threatens Hyperliquid Vault’s Holdings According to a post by Wu Blockchain, Hyperliquid Vault is facing the possibility of a grim liquidation of its position. The decentralized exchange is in the middle of a short squeeze of JELLY JELLY after taking up the short position from a trader who voluntarily liquidated his position. At the moment, Hyperliquid Vault is grappling with an unrealized loss of over $9 billion since betting against the Solana memecoin. Hyperliquid will lose over $230 million to the Solana memecoin short squeeze should prices spike to over 1 cent. “If jellyjelly reaches $0.15374, Hyperliquid Vault will lose its entire $230 million in funds,” said Wu Blockchain. JELLY JELLY has risen by over 200% at press time and currently trades at $0.04281. Meanwhile, transaction volume has surged by 412% in hours as the battle between the short sellers and long buyers continues to rage. For Hyperliquid, things are even grimmer given the frenetic pace of the Solana memecoin short-squeeze. The move comes on the heels of Gamestop’s Bitcoin purchases , a company whose stock was the subject of the famous GME short squeeze in 2021. Binance and OKX List Futures On JELLY JELLY Centralized exchanges Binance and OKX have listed perpetual futures trading for JELLY JELLY amid the short squeeze saga. While the futures listing has elicited cheers from long buyers, critics are questioning the timing of the move. “What a truly scum of earth move by Binance and OKX,” said AviFelman on X. “Pure move to try and bury a competitor.” Following the future listing of the Solana memecoin, Hyperliquid has delisted the JELLY JELLY from its platform, effectively closing the shorts. Despite the buzz around memecoins, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Woods predicts that memecoins will be worthless in the coming years. “After evidence of suspicious market activity, the validator set convened and voted to delist JELLY perps,” read a Hyperliquid statement on X. Amid the chaos, Solana (SOL) is trading at $139, down 4% over the last day. Solana memecoins are rippling with frenetic activity with the ecosystem stealing a chunk of the market share from Ethereum.

In a market buzzing with revival energy, some meme coins are showing fresh signs of life, pulling Gen Z and crypto traders right back into the action. With projects like Baby Doge Coin amping up community attention and the Book of Meme going viral for its Web3 cultural twist, the meme market isn’t just alive—it’s raging. At the center of it all is BTFD Coin. From a viral meme coin presale to the explosive rollout of its Play-to-Earn game, BTFD is giving early buyers the full package: hype, rewards, utility, and community. And right now? It’s in Stage 15 of its presale—just one phase before launch. With the LAUNCH100 code offering 2x tokens and the projected moon price set at $0.006, this may be one of the best new meme coins to buy today before the rocket takes off. BTFD Coin: The Play-to-Earn Powerhouse with 2900% ROI Dreams Let’s talk numbers. BTFD Coin is sitting in Stage 15 of its meme coin presale , priced at $0.0002. So far, it has raised over $6.41 million, racked up over 11,500 holders (called Bulls), and sold more than 71 billion tokens. The current buzz? Analysts predicting a launch at $0.0006 and a moon price of $0.006. That’s a 2900% potential ROI just waiting to be claimed. Combine that with the 100% bonus code LAUNCH100 (ending March 30), and a $5,000 investment could secure $300,000 worth of tokens if BTFD hits its moon target. Here’s the kicker— BTFD’s P2E game launched on January 1, 2025. It lets players earn while they play, staking 90% APY along the way. That’s not just utility; it’s passive income fused with entertainment. The Bulls Squad, BTFD’s loyal, growing community, is also driving the hype hard with social media challenges, leaderboard events, and exclusive giveaways that actually matter. Want in? Buying BTFD is a breeze. Just connect your MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load up with BNB, ETH, or USDT, head to the presale site , type in the amount, enter LAUNCH100 (in all caps), and confirm. Your tokens will double on the spot. Claim them after presale ends and get ready for the launch ride. The best new meme coins to buy today aren’t just about fun—they’re about serious ROI. BTFD delivers both, with insane upside, active devs, and community events that keep users coming back. With just one stage left, the Bulls aren’t waiting—and neither should anyone else. Book of Meme: Web3’s Culture Vault The Book of Meme (BOME) is turning internet culture into blockchain permanence. It’s doing something pretty wild: preserving meme history on decentralized platforms like Arweave, Solana, and IPFS. Instead of just being another coin with hype, BOME is trying to immortalize memes in a way that lives forever on the blockchain. The reason BOME’s in this list of best new meme coins to buy today is because of its unique angle—it’s not trying to reinvent memes, it’s trying to protect them. And for Gen Z and meme historians, that’s actually a big deal. It’s like backing up the culture in a vault nobody can erase, but also being part of a crypto project that could rally fast thanks to its originality and tech stack. Why did this coin make it to this list? BOME brings an entirely new utility to meme coins—permanent cultural storage on-chain. That’s a long-term narrative that could keep buyers interested well beyond the next hype cycle. Baby Doge Coin: The Classic With Fresh Momentum Baby Doge Coin is no stranger to meme coin lists, but its recent community growth and deflationary setup are giving it new legs. As a BEP-20 token on Binance Smart Chain, it’s known for its fast transactions and 10% fee structure—split between rewards and liquidity. That’s helped build a loyal following that keeps the hype wheel turning. Its recent surge in attention makes it a strong candidate among the best new meme coins to buy today, especially for traders looking for legacy-meets-latest kind of plays. The team’s been pushing new listings, charity campaigns, and influencer shoutouts to keep momentum alive, and it seems to be paying off with increased social media activity. Why did this coin make it to this list? Baby Doge Coin continues to show community strength, tokenomics that support growth, and viral appeal—all without fading into meme coin obscurity. It’s staying relevant while others come and go. Turbo: AI-Born, Meme-Driven Turbo isn’t just another meme coin—it’s AI-engineered. Born from an AI prompt and launched with a fair token distribution, it’s got a different origin story that appeals to tech-forward investors. No team names, no taxes, no drama—just pure meme vibes with a twist of artificial intelligence. Its simplicity and origin give it a unique story to tell, which is why it’s been trending in crypto forums lately. It’s not trying to out-compete the big boys, it’s just cruising along with a clear mission: let the community run the show. For Gen Z buyers who want decentralization and creativity, Turbo checks the boxes. Why did this coin make it to this list? Turbo keeps things simple, transparent, and driven by AI and the people. It’s a perfect fit for today’s meme coin vibe where personality and originality matter just as much as utility. Pudgy Penguins: NFTs to Tokens—A Full Circle Move Pudgy Penguins started out as an adorable NFT collection that blew up during the last bull run. But now, it’s turned that viral success into a full-blown ecosystem, complete with merchandise, branding, and yes—the $PENGU coin. Backed by strong community IP and unique brand equity, Pudgy Penguins is more than just a cute face. It’s landing on this list of best new meme coins to buy today because the $PENGU token feels like a natural evolution for the brand. The crossovers with NFTs, IRL merch drops, and marketing collabs give it real-world flair that few meme coins even attempt. Why did this coin make it to this list? Pudgy Penguins is turning its viral image into a scalable ecosystem, bridging NFT culture with tokenomics and branding in a way that feels built for longevity. Conclusion: BTFD’s Moon Potential Sets It Apart Based on our research and market trends, this list features some of the best new meme coins to buy today, with BTFD Coin leading the charge thanks to its P2E launch, 90% APY staking, and bullish community energy. But more than that, it’s the numbers that are jaw-dropping. With the presale still in Stage 15 and the LAUNCH100 bonus code active, a $5,000 investment at $0.0002 could get buyers a whopping 50 million tokens. If BTFD hits its moon price of $0.006, that $5K could turn into $300K. And let’s not forget—there’s only one stage left in the presale. This window’s closing fast. With the Play-to-Earn game already live and rewards stacking up, this isn’t a wait-and-see moment. Jump in now. Own the dip. Stack up while the code’s still live. Join the BTFD Coin presale now .

According to Defillama, the stablecoin is now at $60.1 billion in circulating supply. With this milestone, USDC supply has doubled in the past year, as its market cap was $30 billion in March 2024. The quick turnaround highlights how USDC has been able to rebound after struggling in 2022 and 2023. The stablecoin reached its previous peak in 2022 with a $55 billion market cap but soon fell on hard times due to several reasons, including the collapse of the FTX in 2022 and the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in early 2023. SVB collapse particularly affected USDC, as the bank held around 8% of the stablecoin reserves. This caused the stablecoin to lose its peg to the US Dollar for a brief period before regaining it. All of these challenges led to the market cap falling to $23 billion by late 2023. So far, all of those struggles are in the past, with USDC seeing continuous growth over the last 15 months. Most of the USDC in circulation is on Ethereum, with the network accounting for over $36 billion of the supply. Solana comes second with around $10 billion, while Base, Hyperliquid, Arbitrum, and Berachain also have between $3.8 billion and $1 billion of the stablecoin supply. Interestingly, most of the USDC growth in the past few months has come from other chains besides Ethereum. According to Defillama, its supply of Solana increased by 5.4%, Arbitrum by 19%, and Berachain by 56%, while Sonic and Aptos increased by 104% and 105%, respectively. Its dominance on Solana is quite significant, with USDC accounting for more than 80% of the network’s stablecoin market cap. USDT dominance shrinks as USDC continues to gain momentum Meanwhile, USDC growth has been good for the stablecoin ecosystem, where the overall market cap has now reached a new all-time high of $234.6 billion. Although firmly rooted in the second position, the Circle-issued stablecoin is now the fastest-growing. According to Artemis Analytics, USDC has seen the most increase in value of all top stablecoins in the past three months. Over that period, its supply increased by $16.6 billion, which puts it ahead of Tether USDT, which had a $4.7 billion increase. USDS market cap also rose by $3.6 billion, and the newly launched Ethena-issued USDtb supply increased by $1.3 billion. Top stablecoin supply changes by tokens over the last 3 months (Source: Artemis) The massive growth of USDC is already affecting Tether USDT dominance. While the stablecoin with $144 billion in market cap remains the overall leader, its dominance has shrunk from around 70% to 61.67%, showing that USDC is also claiming more market share. Together, the two account for 87% of the total stablecoin supply. However, their dominance could soon be challenged by other stablecoins that are already emerging. More stablecoins are already emerging, leading to the sector gaining interest from regulators. Several countries are already regulating the issuance of stablecoins, with the US House of Representatives and Senate having different bills on the issue. More players are venturing into the space. According to a report by the Financial Times, Fidelity Investments, a $5.9 trillion asset manager, is working on its own stablecoins. If it happens, the firm will join the likes of Paypal, Ripple, World Liberty Financial, and Ethena as the newest entrant into the crowding sector. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The company reported net income of $131.3M, up from $63.1M last year, with EPS of $0.30, beating the $0.08 consensus and surpassing $0.22 from the previous year. Chewy ( NYSE: CHWY ) +6% - Shares climbed after the company reported a strong Q4, surpassing estimates on both revenue and earnings. Active customers grew 2.1%, with net sales per customer up 4.1%, while autoship sales surged to 80.6% of total sales from 76.4% last year. CEO Sumit Singh highlighted that both topline growth and profitability exceeded the high end of guidance, driven by strong customer growth and autoship loyalty. Looking ahead to 2025, he noted continued business momentum and a commitment to driving innovation in the pet category. Dollar Tree ( NASDAQ: DLTR ) +8% - Shares soared after the company confirmed a deal to sell its Family Dollar business to Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management for $1.01B, with net proceeds expected at $804M. The decision followed a strategic review, with CEO Mike Creedon calling it a ""major milestone"" in Dollar Tree’s transformation journey. The retailer plans to focus on expanding its core business with new store openings and other growth initiatives. The transaction is expected to close in Q2 2025, pending regulatory approvals. Dollar Tree originally acquired Family Dollar in 2015 for $9.2B. The retailer also posted a Q4 earnings report and outlook, which fell short of expectations. Paychex ( PAYX ) +5% - Shares gained after the company reported Q3 FY25 earnings and revenue growth both sequentially and year-over-year, though results were largely in line with expectations. Adjusted EPS of $1.49 edged past the $1.48 consensus, rising from $1.14 in Q2 and $1.38 a year ago. Total revenue of $1.51B matched estimates, up from $1.32B in the prior quarter and $1.44B in Q3 2024. The company reaffirmed its guidance, projecting an adjusted operating margin of around 43% for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025.",HUMA|GME|DM|CHWY|DLTR|PAYX|NNDM|BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-26 15:24:29

As a result, it showed less volatility and higher returns. Note that the Magnificent 7 (”Magnificent Seven”) index includes stocks of major U.S. technology companies, namely: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla. Standard Chartered's head of research Jeffrey Kendrick suggested bitcoin could also be added to the index, as it is more closely correlated to the stock market than gold in the short term. ”If it [bitcoin] were included, it would mean more institutional buying, as the asset can serve different investor purposes,” Kendrick noted. The hypothetical Mag 7B index excludes Tesla stock, an outsider among the other members of the Magnificent Seven in terms of capitalization, and includes bitcoin. On closer examination, Mag 7B has shown less volatility and higher returns compared to Mag 7. According to Kendrick, this suggests that bitcoin can be considered both as a risk hedge against TradFi and a contender for inclusion in technology investment portfolios. Mag 7B's average annualized return was 1% higher. It has performed better in five of the last seven years. In addition, its volatility level has been an average of 2% lower. For comparison, Kendrick chose a starting point in the form of December 2017 to make the analysis more honest. According to him, bitcoin is becoming more institutionalized. The way it trades can be compared to NVIDIA shares, while Tesla securities resemble Ethereum rather, the analyst said. CryptoQuant has named key bitcoin price levels for investors CryptoQuant experts named key bitcoin price levels for short-term investors. They added that investors who hold the first cryptocurrency for less than 155 days are classified as short-term. According to experts, those who hold bitcoin for one to three months should pay attention to the $98,000 level. The $89,000 zone is interesting for those who have held the asset for the past three to six months, while the $85,000 level is important for those who have held bitcoin for one to four weeks. Investors who have held their first cryptocurrency for six to twelve months should keep an eye on $63,000. ”These levels are critical support and resistance zones in the short term,” CryptoQuant explained. In addition, experts noted that the rise in open interest and bitcoin price could trigger the risk of cascading liquidations. They believe that if the rally continues, it could lead to a parabolic rise. However, analysts said a possible sharp correction due to the liquidation of positions with high leverage. the next CPI could catalyze an ”April rally” in the crypto market QCP Capital published a report on the crypto market. The company's experts emphasized that April is traditionally a month of growth for high-risk assets. The company believes that the catalyst for growth could come from the CPI report if inflation slowed in March. On April 10, 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor will publish the March value of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Experts at QCP Capital think that the favorable tone of this report may act as a catalyst for the growth of high-risk assets; As analysts noted, April is traditionally a period of growth for such positions, which include cryptocurrencies. This is confirmed by the data of the portal CoinGlass ; For example, bitcoin closed April ”in the minus” five times, ”in the plus” - seven. Ethereum, in turn, only three times was with a drawdown at the end of this month, with a gain - six times. ”Risk assets had one of their strongest sessions this year, helped by a temporary easing of concerns about the April 2 deadline for tariffs. On Monday, Trump twice signaled that trading partners could seek an exemption or reduction in tariffs, providing a delay that helped calm market swings,” the company said. This refers to the speech of U.S. President Donald Trump on March 24. During the speech, he announced the introduction of duties on cars and also pointed to the possibility of reciprocal benefits, according to Bloomberg . Despite the fact that the recent rise of bitcoin and the crypto market in the company is considered a short-term rebound, experts also see prerequisites for a more sustainable upward trend. The catalyst in this case may be the next CPI report. According to the official website of the U.S. Department of Labor, it will be released on April 10, 2025. A decline in inflation in March could be a factor that will change market sentiment and lead to sustained growth, the firm said. BlackRock has launched a bitcoin-ETP in Europe iShares, a subsidiary of the BlackRock fund, has launched a bitcoin-ETP in Europe, Bloomberg reports. It is supposed to be a spot exchange-traded fund that will invest directly in the first cryptocurrency. According to the product description on the official website , it is traded on the Xetra and Euronext exchanges (in Paris and Amsterdam). The fund's tickers on these exchanges are IB1T and BTCN. The portal states that iShares Bitcoin ETP was created on March 18, 2025. It will be traded from March 25. At the same time, until the end of 2025, the commission for managing the funds will be 0.15%, after that - 0.25%; The fund will invest directly in the first cryptocurrency. The custodian will be a service from the Coinbase exchange and the administrator will be The Bank of New York Mellon. The product is denominated in US dollars. Notably, this is BlackRock's first cryptocurrency exchange product to launch outside of North America; Manuela Sperandeo, head of iShares at BlackRock in Europe and the Middle East, commented on the fund's launch: ”This reflects what can truly be considered a turning point in the industry - a combination of established demand from retail investors and the arrival of more professionals.” As Bloomberg noted, bitcoin-ETP capitalization in Europe stands at $13.6 billion, with some products trading for several years, such as the Bitwise Physical Bitcoin ETP (BTCE), which launched in June 2020. This fund has an estimated $1.11 billion in assets under management (AUM), according to the official website .

Despite the token’s strong close in March—continuing a pattern of positive first-quarter performances—April has repeatedly delivered disappointing results. According to data from CryptoRank , XRP’s average return for April stands at 26.6%, a figure that might appear encouraging at first glance. However, a closer examination reveals that this statistic is skewed by significant price surges from earlier years. The median return, a more reliable indicator of typical performance, is only 0.79%. Three Consecutive Years of Losses Recent history paints an even more concerning picture. Over the past three years, XRP has recorded substantial losses in April, ranging from 12.4% to 27.8%. This consistent decline suggests that rather than being an outlier, April may have developed into a challenging month for the asset. Despite this trend, discussions surrounding XRP’s price movements often reference long-term averages while overlooking recent patterns. The expectation of a strong April performance appears increasingly disconnected from the reality observed in recent years. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Possible Factors Behind the April Downtrend The recurring losses in April raise questions about potential underlying causes. One possibility is a shift in institutional investment behavior, with liquidity tapering off following the first quarter. Another consideration is the influence of broader cryptocurrency market cycles, which may contribute to seasonal price movements. While historical data does not rule out the possibility of a positive performance this April, three consecutive years of declines suggest that traders should approach the month with caution. Market participants who rely on outdated trends rather than recent performance risk being caught off guard if the pattern continues. A Cautionary Outlook for Token Holders XRP’s historical performance in April presents a clear pattern of underperformance, contrasting with the optimism often associated with its long-term averages. While past data does not guarantee future outcomes, the consistency of April’s downturn in recent years suggests that traders should approach the month with caution. Whether driven by institutional trends, market cycles, or other factors, such as the Ripple vs SEC case , the data points to a recurring challenge for XRP holders.

This new crypto, Remittix ($RTX) , has defied the status quo with a presale smashing records and setting new highs. The acceptance and widespread adoption fueling the presale are thanks to the appeal Remittix real-world applications enjoy and how it solves crucial issues plaguing a massive PayFi market. Experts are confident this new presale crypto has the potential to outshine PayFi OGs like XRP and outdo the Dogecoin price surge and Shiba Inu’s popularity. This article explains why. Dogecoin Price Performance and Prediction Dogecoin began on a light-hearted note but quickly grew into a top-rated cryptocurrency with massive community support. In the last 24 hours, its price increased slightly by 6% to about $0.1830 . Market observers believe the boom is thanks to influential social media trends affecting cryptocurrencies and recent endorsements by Elon Musk. According to DOGE technical charts, the crypto relies on robust support at $0.10 but faces resistance at $0.15. Its moving averages show a strong positive direction if the uptrend continues. Chances are that the Dogecoin price will rise by 232.43% and smash the $0.585978 height by the end of April. Still, Dogecoin’s price relies heavily on social media buzz and sentiment. Hence, its price action would follow investor sentiment, meaning some negative tweets can trigger a price decline, unlike Remittix , which is surging through a downtrend thanks to its tangible use cases. Shiba Inu Price Analysis and Forecast Shiba Inu set out to be the Dogecoin replacement. But, after its previous surges, the project has dropped over the past month , plunging by almost 11% to sell at nearly $0.00001346 . With that price decrease, most SHIB holders are disappointed and stranded. Market analysts attribute this fall to the scarcity of new features and warning hype. Shiba Inu technical charts also show that the crypto has lost its previous support levels. SHIB’s 50-day moving average sits below its 200-day moving average, indicating that the downturn will persist unless significant change happens. Most market observers say Shiba Inu would not reclaim its glory of yesteryear if it fails to add a powerful upgrade or some new tangible use case. If that doesn’t happen, SHIB’s future remains bearish. Remittix ($RTX) Simplifies Real-Life Payment for Massive Adoption and Growth Remittix is the new fast-growing DeFi project solving one of the digital payments market’s most central issues: slow, pricey cross-border payments. While traditional banking systems often complicate financial services or payment processes for users living in rural areas or developing countries, Remittix offers a solution that connects the digital economy and conventional finance for simplified services. With Remittix, users can send cryptocurrency straight to a bank account, which seamlessly receives the payment converted to preferred FIAT currency. This process maintains the main tenets of cryptography—anonymity and control over one’s money—but with the robustness of conventional finances. The Remittix project has sold over 521 million tokens in its ongoing presale. With a low entry cost of $0.0734 and a clear path to the moon with its appealing use cases, Remittix continues to command robust support from institutional and retail investors. Savvy investors regard RTX as one of the best cryptos to buy as it solves a critical problem differently, positioning it to take over the global payments market.

42423934,https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-investor-us-5-million,1743003410,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Bitcoin investor who bought at $0.25 says US will never buy 5 million BTC,https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-investor-us-5-million,"Trace Mayer, a renowned early bitcoin podcaster and advocate who began purchasing the currency as an investment at $0.25, has expressed doubts about the US government’s ability to acquire a substantial portion of the bitcoin supply. While evangelists like Strategy Executive Chair Michael Saylor and Senator Cynthia Lummis have touted a 5 million BTC figure as an achievable, even desirable, goal for the country, Mayer cast doubt on the idea in his latest interview on the Supply Shock podcast . Speaking to host Pete Rizzo at the Digital Asset Summit in New York, Mayer, who is believed to hold over 25,000 BTC , noted that such a strategy would have a substantial impact on the global bitcoin price, stating: “They would have a hard time…Where are they going to get 5 million coins? How many coins got added into the ETFs?…[Meanwhile], the price moved from $30,000 to $80,000.” Elsewhere, Mayer suggested alternative strategies to encourage government bitcoin adoption and accumulation. “Maybe you don’t have to pay capital gains tax on bitcoin or crypto gains if you pay your taxes with them. That might be a way to induce more supply to come out,” Mayer said, arguing the government shouldn’t “go into the market and smash buy.” Still, while acknowledging that bitcoin is “a geopolitical asset,” Mayer questioned the urgency for the US to accelerate its dominance in the space. “Why would it be in the interest of the US to accelerate that any faster than it needs to? Because then it might be paying a cost that’s higher than what it otherwise needs to pay.” Mayer went so far as to speculate that America could pursue a strategy of maintaining the US dollar’s dominance while integrating Bitcoin into the US financial system. “Keep the world reserve currency, drain all the other nations of their physical bullion, and the thing that could potentially challenge gold, dominate that too,” he advised. “Have it integrated into your financial system, have it seated onto the balance sheets of your companies, have your individual citizens owning and holding it, have policy that encourages financial innovation, and that way you dominate.” Mayer also suggested that the US could “extend your dollar with the stablecoins” to exert influence on other superpowers’ “monetary sovereignty.” Though this might find America acting like a superpower, Mayer was quick to note that bitcoin is money, and that money is power on the global stage. While he was unsure of how bitcoin will reshape the global power structure, he noted it will undoubtedly do so. “This is incredibly exciting,” he told Rizzo, noting that bitcoin is simply “fulfilling its destiny” as a potential “world reserve settlement currency.” Editor’s note: This article was produced with the assistance of AI tooling.

The global cryptocurrency market capitalization is down 1.3% over the past 24 hours, currently standing at $2.99 trillion. At the time of writing, the daily crypto trading volume is $86.7 billion. It remains on the lower side compared to the amounts recorded over the past few months. Most of the top 100 coins per market cap are green today. Movement (MOVE) , Shiba Inu (SHIB) , and Pepe (PEPE) are the category’s best performers. These are the only three out of the 100 with a double-digit rise. MOVE is up 18.7%, SHIB 13.2%, and PEPE 12.8% to the prices of $0.5342, $0.00001522, and $0.000008924, respectively. At the same time, Pi Network (PI) fell the most and is the only coin with a double-digit drop: 10.8% to $0.811. The rest of the red list is down up to 3.6% per coin. As for the top 10 coins, only one is down. Binance Coin (BNB) fell 0.5% to the price of $630. The category’s best performer is Dogecoin (DOGE) . It’s up 9.3% to $0.2026. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) is up 0.5%, now changing hands at $87,693, while Ethereum (ETH) saw the smallest increase on this list of 0.1%, meaning that it’s practically unchanged, currently trading at $2,062. ‘ETH Poised for Explosive Movement’ Despite the recent drop in the ETH price, “all signs” signal a potential strong rebound later this year, according to Nick Forster, founder of the decentralized onchain options AI-powered platform, Derive.xyz . The coin could see “a significant resurgence” thanks to institutional adoption and upcoming upgrades, most notably the incoming Pectra . “ Solana and XRP are expected to lead the charge in the short term, with ETH likely to reclaim its position later in 2025,” Forster says in an email. Additionally, there is currently a 30% chance that ETH will dip below $1,800 by the end of May. At the same time, there’s a 19% chance it will rise above $2,500 in the same timeframe. Source: Derive.xyz Meanwhile, Forster noted that ETH’s implied volatility is at monthly lows of 59% for 7-day (red in the image above) and 30-day (blue) tenors, well below BTC’s 45%. “Historically, such low levels rarely hold, indicating we might be entering a period of heightened volatility for ETH in April,” Forster says. “Traders should expect a potential price surge as leverage becomes more appealing and the market becomes more reactive.” Additionally, the forward rate for ETH is currently below the 5% treasury bill rate. This signals bearish sentiment. However, when forward rates are low, there are typically sharp price increases in the following weeks as leveraged positions become more attractive and demand builds. Source: Derive.xyz Per Forster, “with ETH’s supply on centralized exchanges at a 9-year low, even moderate price movements could trigger significant price hikes as demand rapidly consumes all available supply.” You might also like Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade Goes Live on Sepolia Testnet in Second Test Phase TruBit Integrates Morpho to Enable High-Yield DeFi Access in Latin America TruBit , a major crypto payment and trading platform in Latin America , is launching Earn+ powered by decentralized lending protocol Morpho .

This cautious move comes as inflation risks remain high, and global economic uncertainty continues to grow. CNB Slows Rate Cuts Amid Risks After cutting rates aggressively last year, the CNB is now more cautious, balancing growth and inflation. Although inflation has slowed, it remains at the higher end of the bank’s target, with rising service costs and strong wage growth keeping pressure on prices. At the same time, food prices remain a major concern. After facing a period of double-digit inflation, Czech consumers are still highly sensitive to rising costs, which could influence overall inflation expectations. Beyond domestic concerns, the CNB is also keeping a close eye on global risks. New U.S. tariffs could trigger trade wars, affecting exports and slowing economic growth. Meanwhile, increased defense spending across Europe, led by Germany’s move to expand government borrowing, could introduce additional inflationary risks. These external factors make it difficult for the CNB to proceed with further rate cuts without careful evaluation. Analysts Predict Possible Cut in May Market expectations suggest that while the CNB is holding rates for now, another rate reduction could be on the table as early as May. Analysts believe that by then, new economic forecasts will provide clearer insight into inflation trends and overall economic stability. Some experts estimate that rates may eventually settle between 3.00% and 3.50%, aligning with the so-called “neutral” level that policymakers have previously indicated. Impact On Crypto Market The CNB’s decision to pause rate cuts could have ripple effects on crypto markets. With inflation risks still high and global uncertainty growing, investors may turn to Bitcoin and other digital assets as a hedge. Meanwhile, a delayed rate cut could also slow liquidity flow into risk assets, impacting short-term crypto price movements.",News,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-26 15:45:12

Yet, experts agree Rexas Finance (RXS) —a $0.20 presale token—holds potential to outpace PEPE, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu combined. With RXS poised to bridge real-world assets like real estate and gold to blockchain, its presale has already surged 6.6x, raising over $47 million. As PEPE rides meme-driven hype, Rexas Finance taps into a $16 trillion real-world asset market, positioning itself as the breakthrough crypto of 2025. Rexas Finance Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Ownership Rexas Finance transforms how global investors access high-value assets. By tokenizing real estate, commodities, and art on the blockchain, RXS removes geographical and financial barriers. Imagine a retail investor in Nigeria owning 5% of a Parisian apartment or a student in Brazil earning passive income from fractional ownership of Dubai commercial property. Rexas makes this possible through its ERC-20 token, enabling seamless fractional ownership and trading of physical assets. The platform’s Token Builder lets users convert any real-world asset into digital tokens within minutes. Coupled with the Rexas Launchpad, startups and asset owners raise funds globally, democratizing access to capital. Tools like QuickMint Bot simplify token creation, while AI Shield and GenAI enhance security and asset management. This ecosystem positions RXS not as a speculative token but as a utility powerhouse reshaping trillion-dollar industries. The RXS Presale Momentum Rexas Finance chose public presale over VC funding, reserving 50% of its 1 billion tokens for community access. Stages 1–11 sold out rapidly, raising $41 million. Currently in its final stage, RXS costs $0.20—a 580% jump from its initial $0.03. With 91.2% of presale tokens claimed, the $56 million target nears completion. Post-presale, RXS lists at $0.25 in 2025 on three top-tier exchanges, with analysts forecasting a climb to $10+—a 50x gain from today’s price. A significant transaction involving 1,000,000 RXS ($200,000) was recently recorded on Etherscan. The funds were transferred to a whale wallet, indicating a major accumulation move. Such large-scale purchases often signal confidence in the asset’s future growth, prompting market participants to take notice. The project’s CertiK audit ensures smart contract reliability, while CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listings amplify visibility to 100M+ monthly users. A $1M giveaway—distributing $50,000 each to 20 winners—fuels urgency, with entries surpassing 1.2 million. Unlike meme coins reliant on hype, RXS gains traction through tangible use cases and investor trust. Rexas Finance’s Path to Dominance RXS’s tokenomics prioritize sustainability: 15% liquidity ensures stable trading, 22.5% staking rewards long-term holders, and 10% treasury funds innovation. Early buyers at $0.20 could see life-changing returns if RXS hits $7–$10 post-launch. For context, a $5,000 investment today might exceed $250,000 within months. While PEPE’s 10x potential excites traders, its lack of real-world utility limits longevity. Rexas, however, merges blockchain with physical asset markets—offering stability amid crypto volatility. As institutional investors flock to tokenized assets, RXS stands at the forefront of this financial shift. Pepe’s 2025 rally may create millionaires, but Rexas Finance promises far greater upside. By unlocking access to global real estate and commodities, RXS transcends meme coin speculation, offering a concrete bridge between crypto and tangible wealth. With its presale ending soon and exchange listings imminent, the window to secure RXS at $0.20 is narrowing. Investors eyeing 50x gains must act before June 2025—Rexas Finance isn’t just another token; it’s the key to the next evolution of blockchain adoption.

With over $27 million raised in its ICO, there’s already strong interest, and if Solana’s ecosystem keeps growing, $SOLX could be in for a solid run. DeepNet AI ($DPN) , meanwhile, could also get traction with its own Layer-2 solution for AI applications. By potentially providing the infrastructure for decentralized AI projects, DeepNet AI sits at the intersection of two booming industries — blockchain and artificial intelligence — and could become a key player in powering future AI-driven dApps. Let’s check out the deets. Solaxy Price Prediction: Could $SOLX Pump After Listing with Successful ICO? Solaxy ($SOLX) is developing Solana’s first Layer-2 scaling solution to try and help Solana handle more transactions without slowing down or driving fees too high. By processing transactions off-chain before settling them on Solana’s mainnet, Solaxy could make things faster and cheaper, especially during busy periods when the network gets clogged. The idea sounds promising, especially for developers working on dApps, DeFi protocols, or NFT marketplaces that rely on fast, low-cost transactions. Solaxy’s presale pulled in over $27 million, which shows there’s plenty of interest — but that doesn’t mean it’s a guaranteed win. As for its price potential, $SOLX could see some action after its listing, especially if Solana’s ecosystem picks up steam. But without major partnerships or clear signs of developer adoption, it’s hard to say if that momentum will last. If you’re weighing your options, DeepNet AI is another project that might be worth watching. It’s building a Layer-2 solution specifically for AI-driven applications, a space that’s heating up fast, and could be interesting to keep on your radar. DeepNet AI Is Potentially Building The Future of AI on Blockchain with a Layer-2 Solution DeepNet AI could lead the next blockchain revolution by creating the foundation for AI applications. This Layer 2 solution could support AI-powered dApps, agent economies, and machine learning systems that need fast, scalable, and decentralized infrastructure. What makes DeepNet special is its timing, launching right as AI adoption is taking off globally. The global AI market is expected to hit $1.3T by 2030, and over 78% of companies are already using AI in their business operations, creating real market demand. The AI agent’s economy is set to grow from $5.1B in 2024 to an impressive $47.1B by 2030 (a 44.8% growth rate), according to recent research. This could make DeepNet a hot topic in the coming months. The platform could provide four main benefits – better scalability, lower transaction fees, compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and connection to the trillion-dollar AI market. The EVM compatibility is crucial because it could enable developers to move their Ethereum-based apps to DeepNet without starting over. This may create opportunities for DeFi, CeFi, and NFT markets to benefit from AI apps. DeepNet’s Mainnet Launch Is Just Around the Corner – Could This Also Help It Gain Traction? DeepNet AI is already catching momentum quickly with an active testnet that shows impressive numbers – 60,064 total transactions, 60,064 total blocks, 2,334 wallet addresses, and an average block time of just 2 seconds with a gas fee of 1 Gwei. The mainnet launch is coming soon, and it could further build anticipation among users. DeepNet is now listed on CoinMarketCap with active trading on Uniswap , and there are rumors about potential centralized exchange listings soon. $DPN is trading right at $0.9692, reflecting a 210% growth in one day, making it worth keeping an eye on in the following weeks. The project is also ramping up its marketing efforts, and it could potentially reach more users just as the market shows signs of recovery. The Bottom Line Solaxy might see some post-listing buzz, but without strong developer adoption, it’s hard to say if that momentum will stick. It’s one of those projects that could go either way. Meanwhile, DeepNet AI could tap into something far more concrete — the growing demand for AI-powered blockchain apps. With its Layer-2 solution designed specifically for AI-driven projects, DeepNet AI could build the tech that may power the next wave of decentralized innovation.

He also reflected on his missed opportunity with Ethereum and explained why the fundamentals of blockchain have remained the same despite shifting trends. A Changing Perspective on Meme Coins In an exclusive interview with Foresight News, the ex-crypto executive explained that he has taken a more active role on social media, especially when it comes to meme coins. Unlike previous market cycles where he distanced himself from the trend, CZ now engages with the community to understand its appeal. Previously, he described such tokens as “extremely weird and desperate,” urging builders to concentrate on more useful applications instead. However, his turnaround became apparent when he allowed the community to create meme coins based on pictures he shared of his pet dog. Interestingly, despite being asked to, he has never endorsed any of the meme coins as the official one, claiming such a move would alienate others. “There are quite a few users of the meme coins involved, and choosing one would definitely hurt the feelings of other users,” said Zhao. The Binance co-founder compared today’s meme-driven market to crypto’s earlier phases, recalling how, in Bitcoin’s early days, launching a new chain meant “writing 20,000 lines of code.” However, the launch of the ERC-20 standard allowed anyone to create tokens with a smart contract and only required a website and a whitepaper. Now, it’s even simpler since just a meme image suffices. Despite these shifts, CZ insisted that the core principles have remained the same: “The core logic is that as long as someone recognizes a certain concept to issue coins and someone participates, it will have a price, and if no one participates, there will be no price,” he stated. He believes meme coins have thrived because of frustration with traditional venture capital models and retail investors chasing life-changing gains. Additionally, such assets have escaped regulatory scrutiny, given they have “no practical use,” a somewhat ironic loophole fueling their rise. Missed Opportunities and Post-Prison Mindset In the interview, CZ also revealed he never put money into Ethereum, even though he had known its co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, since 2013. “I never invested,” said the 48-year-old, decrying the missed opportunity after ETH rose “thousands of times.” On a more personal note, Zhao reflected on his four-month prison term after being found guilty of anti-money laundering violations. “ It was a very bad experience,” he admitted, though he stressed that the ordeal wasn’t physically brutal. For him, the uncertainty was the most challenging part, and the episode reshaped his priorities. He says he now puts his health and relationship first.

However, while ETH remains a blue-chip crypto, a new Ethereum-based token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the top performer. The project is going through its third funding phase while demonstrating rapid growth at a price point of $0.02 and managed to secure nearly $4.9 million from investors. 6900 holders have entered the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale during phase 3 due to the system plans to double its price from $0.02 to $0.025. Investors have limited time to enter since over 80% of phase 3 has sold out. Those starting to invest now during this phase means investors can earn 200% return at launch price of $0.06. A DeFi Powerhouse Gaining Traction Mutuum Finance is transforming the decentralized lending market through its revolutionary dual-lending technology which drives its exponential growth. Approximately 6900 investors partook in support of the project by investing $4.9 million after recognizing its value potential during its presale period. The current price of Mutuum Finance Token stands at $0.02 in Phase 3 but investors will experience additional value from the upcoming Phase 4 price increase of 25%. Mutuum Finance brings out the revolutionary change to Defi by incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2P provides passive income opportunities to customers by placing them in USDT liquidity pools through smart contract managed automatic lending capabilities. The P2P method enables direct lending relations that allow customers to operate deals without intermediaries while keeping their capital intact. The linkage of P2C and P2P models at Mutuum Finance creates an investment opportunity with enhanced safety alongside improved efficiency and decentralized features as a DeFi investment solution for maximum-yield seekers. A Secure and Trustworthy Financial Ecosystem Mutuum Finance plans to construct a completely collateralized stablecoin backed by USD fixed within the Ethereum blockchain to support its entire ecosystem. This cryptocurrency exceeds algorithmic stablecoins’ requirements by using extra collateral thus reducing both the risks and maintaining stability over time. Such an approach provides complete investor confidence because it combines open financial architecture with audited smart contracts while avoiding the failures that devastated other DeFi projects. The company builds its community base through rewarding investors with attractive benefits. The fund will send 10 fortunate participants $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens through its million-dollar token distribution campaign combined with its award-winning referral system that rewards users for acquiring new participants. The platform offers exclusive staking pools and governance rights and VIP update access to its early adopting community members as they develop long-term loyalty with Mutuum Finance. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The tokenomics system of this project uses mechanisms which control token release and promote price stability for the long-term. Scarcity of tokens and deflationary mechanisms applied during presales lead Mutuum Finance to establish price appreciation potential in the long term. High incentive rewards and active token participation are possible through its staking feature which builds long-term functionality and maintains a healthy ecosystem. Mutuum Finance is rapidly gaining traction as a top Ethereum-based DeFi project, raising $4.9 million with 6,900+ investors onboard. Its dual-lending model and stablecoin integration offer security, efficiency, and high-yield potential. With a 200% return at launch, the presale is selling fast. Join now before prices rise.

The flagship crypto is now eyeing a bullish reversal, but the analyst warned of how things could still go wrong for BTC and mark the end of the bull run. Bitcoin Marks 114 Weeks In Active Buy Signal In an X post, Severino revealed that Bitcoin is still in an active buy signal on the SuperTrend weekly. He added that BTC has been in this buy signal for 114 weeks and roughly 800 days. This is undoubtedly a huge positive for the flagship crypto, especially as it looks to reclaim the psychological $90,000 level and rally to new highs. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Price Headed For $70,000 Or $300,000? What The Charts Are Saying However, the crypto analyst warned that a sell signal would be a strong sign that the bull run has ended. His accompanying chart showed that the sell signal could send BTC into a Supertrend DownTrend, with the flagship crypto dropping to as low as $22,000 in what could mark the peak of the bear market. Crypto analyst PlanB recently affirmed that the bear market is not here yet. Instead, he believes Bitcoin is still in the middle of a sustainable uptrend and predicts that the flagship crypto’s price could double this year. This could lead to a parabolic rally to as high as $180,000 for BTC. Experts like Standard Chartered have also predicted that a rally to $200,000 this year is achievable. In the meantime, the focus will likely be on how the Bitcoin price reacts to Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, which will go into force on April 2nd. The previous tariffs sparked a wave of sell-offs, causing BTC to drop to as low as $77,000. However, there is also the possibility that Bitcoin has priced in this development and could avoid any further downtrend when the tariffs are implemented on April 2nd. A New ATH This Year Is Possible Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has also affirmed that Bitcoin could see a new all-time high (ATH) this year. This came as he remarked that BTC’s uptrend is intact and that the flagship crypto reacted strongly around the weekly 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). His accompanying chart showed that Bitcoin could reach a new ATH of $121,000 before the year runs out. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin RSI Dominance Needs To Crash To This Level For The Bull Run To Resume In another X post, he again predicted that Bitcoin could reach this target while revealing a ‘Bump and Run’ pattern which was forming for the flagship crypto.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that over 22,000 coins were withdrawn from exchanges in the past week.

Bearish Pattern Spotted,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xlm-price-crash-incoming-bearish-pattern-spotted/,"The post XLM Price Crash Incoming? Bearish Pattern Spotted appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the ongoing market uncertainty, Stellar’s native token, XLM, appears bearish and is poised for a price decline due to the bearish price action it has formed on the four-hour timeframe. At the beginning of March 2025, XLM experienced impressive upside momentum, but it later formed a bearish rising wedge pattern. XLM Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, the asset is currently experiencing a price decline and is at a crucial support level. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if XLM fails to hold the $0.288 level and closes a 4-hour candle below it, the price could decline by 15% to reach the $0.23 level in the coming days. In addition to this bearish pattern, XLM’s price began falling after hitting a descending trendline with a strong history of price reversals. However, the asset has formed a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern, which is pushing XLM’s price lower. Source: Trading View Current Price Momentum At press time, XLM is trading near $0.288 and has recorded a 2% price drop in the past 24 hours. Despite the decline, its trading volume has spiked by 25%, indicating increased participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. Bearish On-Chain Metrics This bearish price action has been further reinforced by recent activity from whales and long-term holders, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . $1.40 Million Worth of XLM Inflow Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an inflow of over $1.40 million worth of XLM tokens in the past 24 hours, suggesting a potential sell-off by these holders, which could lead to a price decline in the future. $3.30 Million Worth of Bearish Bet In addition to the activity of long-term holders, traders are also following the bearish market sentiment, as they are strongly betting on the downside. Data shows that traders are currently over-leveraged at $0.305 on the upper side and $0.286 on the lower side, both on the verge of liquidation. At these levels, traders have built $3.30 million and $611K worth of short and long positions, respectively. Source: Coinglass When combining all these on-chain metrics with technical analysis, it appears that bears are currently dominating, and XLM’s price could see a further decline in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|XLM|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-26 16:00:10

Elizabeth Warren wrote to Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce, asking him to explain how the Trump administration plans to stop companies from using tariffs as an excuse to raise prices. According to Warren , there are times when tariffs are a smart way to help American businesses and create good manufacturing jobs. However, President Trump’s across-the-board tariffs have been chaotic and not strategic. She said, “I am deeply concerned that President Trump is now enabling this corporate greed, allowing companies to increase prices across the board, regardless of whether goods are actually subject to tariffs.” Although this is a good concern, Lutnick thinks tariffs don’t cause inflation. According to him, printing more money does. Scott Bessent, the secretary of the Treasury, has a similar view. At the Economic Club of New York earlier this month, Bessent said, “I would hope that the failed ‘team transitory’ could get back together and think that nothing is more temporary than tariffs.” In addition, other top government officials have said that the tariffs won’t cause inflation and will only be a one-time change at most. Fed Chair Jerome Powell supports that tariffs will cause a price rise Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell brought up this possibility last Wednesday at a press meeting. Powell made it clear that Trump’s trade plan would likely cause prices to rise, even though it wasn’t clear if the price changes would be transitory. Powell offered the example of washing machines that were hit with duties during Trump’s first term. He noted that as prices of washing machines went up, so did prices of dryers, which had no new tariffs attached. Powell said, “Manufacturers just kind of followed the crowd and raised it. So, things happen very indirectly.” In a speech earlier this month, the Treasury Secretary told the Fed to treat any price increases caused by tariffs in the same way. He also criticized the Fed for dealing with inflation during the pandemic, which it thought would be temporary but wasn’t. Another question that appeared in Warren’s letter is whether the Commerce Department has looked into how tariffs and tariff threats have affected prices so far and whether it is letting companies raise prices without a good reason. She also asked the president what specific steps he has taken on tariffs that would make it harder for businesses to charge customers more for tariff-related items or other large price increases. Warren said, “I have repeatedly called on [the president] to protect consumers from corporate price-gouging associated with tariffs Instead, he has made matters worse, simultaneously threatening to implement, implementing, and backing off of threats to implement his tariffs […] while creating widespread confusion and uncertainty that may give big corporations cover to increase their prices on all goods.” US consumers slow spending Synchrony Financial, a consumer finance business, says that Americans have been spending less because of high prices and a worsening economic outlook. The Federal Reserve said last month that Americans are taking on more debt because their funds are getting tighter. Delinquencies for auto loans, credit cards, and home credit lines are all going up. Chief Executive Officer of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Patrick Harker has also said that the U.S. economy may be in trouble because the consumer sector is showing signs of stress and trust is falling. Max Axler, chief credit officer of Synchrony, said Americans’ tightening purse strings show that they have been stretching their money because of ongoing inflation. Target, Walmart, and other stores have also said that customers are being careful with their money and are waiting for deals or giving up higher-priced things to buy lower-priced ones. Analysts say that a drop in household spending could be a sign that more people will be late on their credit payments or not pay back their loans. Default rates have stayed mostly the same, but spending is being closely watched as an early sign that people’s finances are getting worse. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

While the rise in BTC could not fully convince investors, Glassnode analyst explained the critical level that must be passed for the rally to begin. Glassnode analyst CryptoVizArt said that the BTC price needs to break the $90,000-$93,000 barrier to reach new highs. Stating that the average cost base of the majority of recent Bitcoin buyers is between $90,000 and $93,000, the analyst noted that the Bitcoin price may face selling pressure here. Stating that selling pressure could come from investors who are targeting their positions without making a loss, the analyst argued that a new ATH will not occur unless the $90,000-$93,000 range is successfully overcome. “The cost basis of the latest investors who bought during the euphoria from November 2024 to February 2025 is between $90,000 and $93,000. Any jump into this area is likely to encounter selling pressure from those aiming to exit without losing money. But without regaining this supply zone, a new ATH remains a pipe dream.” Keith Alan, co-founder of trading platform Material Indicators, also shared a similar analysis to the Glassnode analyst, who said that Bitcoin needs to reclaim its yearly opening of $93,300 in 2025 to reach the new ATH. Finally, Glassnode wrote in its weekly report that, according to on-chain data, the cost price of short-term investors (STH) is at $93,500. According to Glassnode, as long as this level is not regained in Bitcoin, it will not be possible to talk about a real bull momentum. *This is not investment advice.

The definition of the term “broker” includes individuals or entities that regularly provide services to carry out digital asset transfers. This definition ensures that only those truly “in a position to know” transaction details are subject to Form 1099-DA reporting requirements. These US Internal Revenue Service rules are built on prior rulemaking (T.D. 10000) from July 2024 and focus on extending broker reporting obligations to decentralized finance (DeFi) , which involves digital asset transactions without a traditional intermediary. T.D. 10021 introduces the term “digital asset middleman,” which the IRS previously delayed due to its complexity and controversy. The broker reporting mandate originates from the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. It expanded existing broker reporting obligations under Sections 6045 and 6045A to include digital assets. The provision is projected to generate nearly $28 billion in revenue over a decade. Entities classified as brokers include: Digital asset exchanges: Both custodial and non-custodial platforms that execute trades. Hosted wallet providers: Those managing wallets and verifying user identities. Digital asset kiosks: Bitcoin ATMs and other physical kiosks dealing in cryptocurrencies. Crypto payment processors: Platforms that facilitate digital asset transactions while verifying buyers and sellers. DeFi brokers: Only front-end service providers, such as token swap interfaces, are considered brokers. Activities like liquidity provision, staking and lending remain exempt from reporting requirements. Providers of “unhosted” wallets, where users retain full control over their private keys , are generally exempt unless they function similarly to an exchange. The definition of a digital asset broker has been highly debated after the enactment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in November 2021. How the IRS expands the definition of “broker” in digital asset transactions The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58), specifically Section 80603, broadened the definition of “broker” under Internal Revenue Code Section 6045 to include those facilitating digital asset transfers. Internal Revenue Service regulations broadly define brokers as entities engaged in digital asset sales or exchanges. Here is a timeline of the regulations: Custodial brokers (June 2024 — Treasury Decision 10000) Custodial brokers include operators of custodial digital asset trading platforms, such as centralized exchanges (CEXs) that hold customers’ private keys . It extends to hosted wallet providers, digital asset kiosks (e.g., Bitcoin ATMs ) and certain processors of digital asset payments, such as crypto payment processors. These entities must report because they have custody, making it feasible to track transactions. DeFi brokers (December 2024 — Treasury Decision 10021) The IRS’s December 2024 regulations focus on trading front-end service providers in the DeFi ecosystem, such as interfaces that connect users to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) . The Treasury and IRS use a three-part model (interface, application, settlement layers) to identify DeFi participants, focusing on those with sufficient control or influence, aligning with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidance. However, as DeFi platforms lack centralized control, there were concerns about privacy and compliance. Efforts to repeal the IRS broker rule In March 2025, discussions on repealing the DeFi broker rules intensified, with the Senate voting 70–27 on March 4 and the House voting 292–132 on March 11, to repeal the DeFi broker rules under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), as detailed in House Vote on Repeal. President Donald Trump has signaled support, with his crypto czar, David Sacks, affirming the administration’s backing to the repeal. If signed, this repeal would permanently bar the IRS from implementing similar regulations, significantly impacting DeFi reporting. With bipartisan support, including 76 Democrats joining Republicans in the House vote, this reflects broader political shifts toward supporting crypto innovation, especially under President Trump’s pro-crypto stance, as seen in his executive order for a national crypto stockpile . Did you know? Five draft Forms 1099-DA and three draft Final Instruction versions preceded the finalized IRS crypto broker rules. On Jan. 8, 2025, the IRS issued updated 2025 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns, which included instructions for Form 1099-DA. What is Form 1099-DA? The new crypto tax form for 2025 Form 1099-DA, titled “Digital Asset Proceeds from Broker Transactions,” is a new tax form introduced by the IRS to standardize the reporting of digital asset transactions, such as those involving cryptocurrencies. It was released on Dec. 5, 2024. It’s designed to help taxpayers accurately report their gains or losses from selling or exchanging digital assets and to ensure the IRS can track this income more effectively. Think of it as a specialized version of other 1099 forms — like the 1099-B used for stocks — but tailored for the unique world of crypto and other blockchain-based assets. The form requires “brokers” (like crypto exchanges or platforms) to report specific details about your digital asset sales or exchanges to both you and the IRS. For transactions in 2025, brokers must report: Customers’ name, address and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) The date and time of each transaction The amount and type of digital asset sold (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether), including a unique nine-digit code from the Digital Token Identification Foundation (DTIF) to identify it The gross proceeds (the total amount customers received in US dollars) from the sale. Along with the crypto brokers, if you (i.e., a taxpayer resident in the US) sell or swap crypto through a broker, you’ll get a Form 1099-DA to use when filing your taxes. You’re still responsible for reporting all taxable crypto events, even if no form is issued (e.g., for trades on non-reporting platforms). Key dates include: Gross proceeds reporting: Begins for transactions on or after Jan. 1, 2025, with reports due in early 2026. This means you’ll receive your first Form 1099-DA for 2025 trades, due to you by Jan. 31, 2026, and to the IRS by Feb. 28 (or March 31 if filed electronically). Basis reporting: Starts for transactions on or after Jan. 1, 2026, including cost basis and gain/loss character for certain brokers. Why is this new form required? Before Form 1099-DA, crypto tax reporting was a mess. Some exchanges issued Forms 1099-MISC or 1099-B, while others provided nothing, leaving taxpayers to manually track their trades. This inconsistency made it hard for people to report accurately and for the IRS to verify income. Thus, it’s part of a broader push to close the tax gap and bring crypto in line with traditional financial reporting. Did you know? Unlike stock reporting, where Form 1099-B covers everything cleanly, crypto’s decentralized nature and lack of universal identifiers posed challenges. Form 1099-DA tackles this with the DTIF code and a focus on digital assets — defined as any blockchain-recorded value, like cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), but not cash. How Form 1099-DA shifts crypto reporting On Jan. 10, 2025, the IRS released the final version of Form 1099-DA, titled “Digital Asset Proceeds From Broker Transactions.” Brokers have been instructed to use this form to report specific digital asset transactions occurring from 2025 onward. Herein are the key highlights of the new Form 1099-DA and its implications: Transition rule for tokenized securities Digital assets previously reported under Form 1099-B, such as tokenized securities, must now shift to Form 1099-DA. For instance, sales of tokenized stocks or bonds should be reported on Form 1099-DA instead of Form 1099-B. However, a transitional rule for 2025 allows brokers to report cash sales of tokenized securities on either Form 1099-B or Form 1099-DA. This flexibility gives traditional brokers — who may not typically handle digital assets — extra time to update their systems for full compliance by 2026, as outlined in Treasury Decision 10000. Exception in tokenized securities rule An exception to the general rule applies to tokenized securities settled or cleared on a Limited-Access Regulated Network (LARN). These transactions must be reported on Form 1099-B, not Form 1099-DA. If a LARN loses its regulated status, brokers can continue using Form 1099-B for affected transactions through the end of that calendar year, ensuring consistency during regulatory shifts. Customer-provided acquisition information Form 1099-DA includes a new checkbox (Box 8) that brokers must mark if they relied on customer-provided acquisition information to calculate the basis. This ties to final regulations allowing brokers to use such data for specific identification — pinpointing what units were sold or transferred — and requires them to disclose its use. This change, per Treasury Decision 10021, helps taxpayers align their records with broker reports. Did you know? According to the 2025 General Instructions, Form 1099-DA electronic filing is required through the Information Reporting Intake System (IRIS), and Filing Information Returns Electronically System (FIRE) is not an option. Noncovered status Like Form 1099-B, Form 1099-DA requires brokers to indicate in Box 9 if a digital asset is a “noncovered security,” meaning its basis isn’t reported to the IRS. Unlike earlier drafts, the updated form no longer requires an explanation in Box 10 for this status — Box 10 is now reserved for future use. This simplifies reporting for assets acquired before basis tracking rules apply (e.g., pre-2026 purchases). Number of decimal places Brokers were earlier required to report the number of units of digital assets sold and transferred up to 10 decimal places. This requirement has been extended to 18 decimal places, reflecting the precision necessary in reporting digital asset transactions.​ Proceeds clarification Total proceeds from the digital asset transaction should exclude gross proceeds from the initial sale of a specified non-fungible token (NFT) created or minted by the recipient. These amounts are instead reported separately in Box 11c, distinguishing creator earnings from secondary sales, per updated instructions. Transfer date Box 12b records the date digital assets were transferred into a custodial account. The final instructions specify that this box should be left blank if the digital assets were transferred on various dates, accommodating scenarios where multiple transfers occur.​ Qualifying stablecoins and specified NFTs Optional reporting for sales of qualifying stablecoins and specified NFTs comes with specific instructions. For specified NFTs, brokers enter code “999999999” in Box 1a and “Specified NFTs” in Box 1b. This ensures unique assets, like rare digital collectibles, are tracked distinctly from cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Applicable checkbox on Form 8949 Brokers must use new codes — G, H, J, K and Y — on Form 1099-DA to match the recipient’s Form 8949 (Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets) for the tax year. These codes help taxpayers correctly categorize gains or losses, linking broker reports to tax filings seamlessly. Did you know? If asset sales remain unspecified, the IRS will apply first-in, first-out, which might lead to the taxpayer paying higher taxes. How IRS crypto broker rules affect taxpayers The IRS rolled out new cryptocurrency tax reporting rules effective Jan. 1, 2025, targeting brokers and investors with stricter record-keeping and reporting requirements. These changes aim to boost tax compliance and ensure digital asset transactions are reported accurately, bringing crypto in line with traditional financial assets. Here’s what’s new and what it means for you. Cost basis tracking per account: Under the updated rules, crypto investors must now track their cost basis — the original purchase price — separately for each account or wallet, ditching the old universal tracking approach. For every transaction, you’ll need to record the purchase date, acquisition cost and specific details, like the wallet it’s tied to. Starting in 2025, brokers — like centralized exchanges — must report these transactions to the IRS using Form 1099-DA, mirroring how banks report stock trades. This shift, detailed in Treasury Decision 10000 (June 2024), closes loopholes by tying gains to specific accounts, making it harder to obscure taxable events. Specific identification required for transactions: The new regulations require taxpayers to use specific identification for each digital asset sale, pinpointing the exact purchase date, amount and cost of the asset sold. If you don’t provide this, the IRS defaults to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method — selling your oldest coins first — which could inflate taxable gains if early purchases had lower costs. Previously, many investors averaged their cost basis across all holdings, a simpler but less precise method. This change, effective in 2025, demands detailed records to avoid unexpected tax bills. Temporary safe harbor: To ease the switch, the IRS offers a temporary safe harbor under Revenue Procedure 2024-28. If you’ve been using a universal cost basis method, you have until Dec. 31, 2025, to reallocate your basis across accounts or wallets accurately. This one-time grace period lets you adjust records without penalty, but you’ll need to act fast — brokers won’t report basis until 2026 transactions, so 2025 is on you to get it right. Penalties for noncompliance: Messing up these rules comes with a cost. The IRS has upped the stakes for 2025, increasing fines for underreporting crypto income, adding interest on unpaid taxes, and ramping up audits for mismatched gains and losses. Notice 2024-56 provides penalty relief for brokers making a good faith effort in 2025, but taxpayers don’t get the same leniency — noncompliance could trigger scrutiny, especially with Form 1099-DA giving the IRS clearer data to cross-check. Notably, the IRS’s updated crypto broker rules also affect non-domiciled taxpayers — those living outside the US but subject to IRS reporting — by mandating detailed cost basis tracking for each account and specific identification of digital asset sales on Form 1099-DA, regardless of where they reside. For example, a US citizen in Europe or a foreign national with US-based crypto income must now maintain precise records of purchase dates and costs per wallet, facing increased compliance efforts and potential tax obligations on US-sourced gains. From tracking cost basis per account to facing steeper penalties, these changes aim to align crypto with traditional finance, offering a brief safe harbor to adapt but signaling a clear shift: Compliance is no longer optional, and the tax net now stretches globally, leaving little room for oversight as the crypto landscape matures.",IRS crypto broker,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-26 16:05:00

On Tuesday, during an interview with Newsmax, the president said he’s leaning toward a softer approach. “I’ll probably be more lenient than reciprocal, because if I was reciprocal, that would be very tough for people,” he said. The statement came with less than a week left before the April 2 deadline, when new trade levies are scheduled to kick in. He also mentioned that not everyone will get a pass. “I know there are some exceptions, and it’s an ongoing discussion, but not too many, not too many exceptions,” Trump added. This is the first sign that his administration might back away from a harsher tariff strategy. The reaction from markets was immediate. Investors respond as consumer outlook hits 12-year low On the same day as the Newsmax interview , the Conference Board reported that expectations around business, income, and labor have dropped to levels not seen since 2013. Stocks have been tumbling for weeks. The S&P 500 fell 3% this month and briefly dipped more than 10% below its February peak, slipping into correction territory. Trade fears are spooking both retail and institutional players. Barclays’ head of U.S. equity strategy, Venu Krishna , has slashed his 2025 S&P 500 target. He cut it from 6,600 to 5,900, citing lower earnings forecasts triggered by the ongoing tariff drama. That’s a projected increase of just 0.3% from the start of the year. “Our base case assumes that earnings take a hit as tariffs (higher China tariffs stick but do not escalate, reciprocal tariffs amount to 5% on RoW) contribute to material slowing in US activity that nonetheless stops short of outright recession,” Venu wrote. He put a 60% probability on this scenario playing out, tying it to the final size and strength of the tariffs. Meanwhile, China’s ready to respond. Beijing reiterates warning that it’s prepared for ‘any type’ of trade war Three weeks ago, Chinese officials told Washington they are ready to retaliate. After Trump announced fresh tariffs on all Chinese imports, China hit back by slapping 10–15% levies on U.S. farm goods. “If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” said China’s embassy on X, reposting words from a government briefing. The warning wasn’t just empty talk. It came during the National People’s Congress in Beijing. China’s leadership has been pushing the image of a calm and peaceful power, accusing the U.S. of staying caught in foreign conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Officials are now repeating that warning, preparing for reciprocal tariffs against America after they sued the U.S. government at the World Trade Organization. Beijing hopes to use Trump’s isolationist tactics to its advantage, especially with Canada and Mexico also facing U.S. tariffs. Jinping’s strategy now seems aimed at looking like the adult in the room while trying not to scare off other potential global partners. China’s tone may be sharp, but they’ve been setting the stage for this for a while. Last October, President Xi Jinping told his military to “strengthen preparedness for war,” during a drill near Taiwan. While there’s a difference between being ready and actually going to war, the language is still aggressive. At the same time, Beijing is calling out Washington over other issues. A spokesperson from China’s foreign ministry accused the U.S. of using the drug fentanyl as a pretext for more trade restrictions. “The fentanyl issue is a flimsy excuse to raise US tariffs on Chinese imports,” he said. “Intimidation does not scare us. Bullying does not work on us. Pressuring, coercion or threats are not the right way of dealing with China.” White House struggles to manage fraying global trade ties Trump’s latest comments suggest he might be feeling the heat. But inside his administration, the mood is mixed. Officials are divided over how far to push on trade. Some of Trump’s cabinet members are reportedly citing China’s online statements as proof that Beijing remains the country’s number one economic threat. The backstory between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is full of ups and downs. Xi was invited to Trump’s first inauguration, and Trump said the two had “a great phone call” just days before taking office. There were talks of another call last month, but it never happened. The silence hasn’t gone unnoticed. Xi is already dealing with big problems at home. China’s economy is struggling with low consumption, real estate troubles, and high unemployment. During the National People’s Congress, the Chinese government revealed it would inject billions into its economy, though most of those decisions had already been locked in behind closed doors. China’s military spending sits at $245 billion, the second largest in the world, but still behind the U.S. The country spends 1.6% of its GDP on defense, which is less than both the U.S. and Russia, according to numbers from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Despite the standoff with Washington, China has also been trying to stabilize regional relations. Last Saturday, Chinese and Japanese officials held their first high-level economic talks in six years. That happened in Tokyo. Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya described it as “a very lively discussion.” He met with China’s Wang Yi and later told reporters the meeting went longer than expected but was “fruitful.” When asked if Trump’s tariffs came up, Takeshi said it wasn’t the main focus of the conversation. “We agreed with South Korea to continue working together closely and also communicate clearly with the US,” he said, referencing another round of ministerial talks held the same day. He didn’t share details about what he and Wang discussed about U.S. trade moves. Still, markets are on edge. Beijing is angry. And Wall Street has no clue what to expect next.

Alleged Attack over Surprise Altcoin,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/breaking-has-the-battle-of-the-exchanges-begun-perhaps-the-most-important-event-of-today-alleged-attack-over-surprise-altcoin/,"As Bitcoinsistemi.com, we are explaining to you the critical event that happened today, which is important for the cryptocurrency market and perhaps constitutes today's agenda, but is also confusing. It all started when a crypto whale opened a massive $6 million short position in an altcoin called JELLYJELLY, which has a small market cap of $20 million today on decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Hyperliquid. After the whale opened this position, the JELLYJELLY price increased due to the short squeeze, and this whale was liquidated, in other words, he deliberately sabotaged himself, leaving the Hyperliquid platform with a dangerous short position of approximately $10 million. So much so that, at one point during the short squeeze, the altcoin's market value exceeded $50 million. If the JELLYJELLY market value exceeded $150 million, this would mean that the Hyperliquid platform would be liquidated. Related News: BREAKING: Binance Lists Today's Trending Surprise Altcoin on Futures While the price of the highly volatile altcoin fluctuated, news came from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and OKX to list JELLYJELLY on futures. This could increase the chances of Hyperliquid being liquidated. Some claim that this is why the first crypto whale was brought in by centralized cryptocurrency exchanges to liquidate the increasingly powerful Hyperliquid and to combat decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges in general. However, spokespersons for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges have not made any statements on the matter and the claims are unconfirmed. During the price fluctuation following the listing news, Hyperliquid closed its short position at the starting price and did not lose any money. The platform added that it will also compensate users who suffered losses other than the whale wallet. *This is not investment advice.

Brandt’s projection suggests that the asset could drop to $1.07, considering the chart is forming a textbook Head and Shoulders (H&S) pattern , a bearish signal, according to his March 26 X analysis . With over four decades of experience, the trader noted that XRP is range-bound between $1.90 and $3. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Peter Brandt In this case, the bearish formation from the technical indicators could be invalidated if the asset pushes above $3, making it risky for traders betting against XRP. However, if the price breaks below $1.90, it could confirm the H&S pattern and set the stage for a further drop. The Head and Shoulders pattern signals a potential trend reversal from an uptrend to a downtrend. It features three peaks: a left shoulder, a higher head, and a lower right shoulder. With XRP’s neckline at $1.90, a breakdown with strong volume could confirm the pattern and target $1.07, which aligns with Brandt’s analysis, although he didn’t offer a timeline for these price targets. XRP’s path to double-digit price On the other hand, pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Dark Defender offered a contrasting opinion in another analysis on March 26. The expert observed that XRP’s three-month candle closes on March 31, with bullish momentum signaling a potential breakout. This outlook aligns with the Elliott Wave Theory, which identifies market cycles in five-wave patterns, three impulse waves, and two corrective waves. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Dark Defender Currently, XRP is in Wave 3, with targets between $5.85 and $8.07. As per the expert, if Wave 5 is attained successfully, it would be even more bullish, with the token likely trading at a new record high between $18.22 and $23.20. It’s worth noting that DarkDefender is a pro-XRP analyst who frequently leans toward bullish predictions. While his insights are valuable, they should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism. Indeed, these double-digit valuations align with a projection by Ryan Lee, an analyst at Bitget, who foresees the asset trading at $10, albeit by 2030. Beyond technical indicators, XRP has Ripple-specific catalysts that will likely spur a bullish breakout. In this regard, investors will be anticipating the ongoing final stages of concluding the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) case, which might drive significant capital inflow. Additionally, the possible approval of a spot exchange-traded fund could trigger even more capital inflow. XRP price analysis In the short term, XRP is trading in tandem with the wider cryptocurrency market. As of press time, the token was valued at $2.41, down almost 1.4% on the daily chart, while the weekly timeframe is also in the red by 5.4%. XRP seven-day price chart.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $17,426 and $19,808, with an average expected price of $18,011. In 2031, ETH could trade between $50,195 and $58,140, with an average price of $51,602. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $2,017 Market Cap $234.29B Trading Volume (24h) $11.91B Circulating Supply 120.6M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24-hour High $2,084 24-hour Low $2,008 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 9.34% 50-day SMA $ 2,366.74 200-day SMA $ 3,018 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 47 (Neutral) Green days 13/30 (43%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-day chart Based on the 1-day chart on March 26, Ethereum (ETH) appears to be encountering resistance near the $2,160 level after a modest recovery from its recent low of around $1,800. The candlesticks show rejection at the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting bullish momentum is slowing. The RSI currently hovers below 44, indicating neutral to slightly bearish sentiment, with no clear overbought or oversold conditions. Meanwhile, price action remains below the midline of the Bollinger Bands, which often implies ongoing downward pressure. Unless ETH can break and close above the $2,160 mark, it risks sliding back toward the $1,800 support zone amid weakening bullish conviction. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart Based on the 4-hour chart, Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing downward pressure after a rejection near the $2,115 resistance level. The Bollinger Bands show price pulling back from the upper band toward the midline, hinting at weakening bullish momentum. The MACD histogram has flipped red with a bearish crossover between the MACD and signal lines, indicating potential short-term downside. RSI has dropped to around 44, suggesting a shift away from overbought conditions without reaching oversold territory. If ETH fails to reclaim $2,050, it may test support near $1,990. Continued weakness below this level could lead to further consolidation or decline. Ethereum technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $2,490.98 SELL SMA 5 $ 2,299.22 SELL SMA 10 $ 2,197.83 SELL SMA 21 $ 2,086.48 SELL SMA 50 $ 2,366.74 SELL SMA 100 $ 2,835.44 SELL SMA 200 $ 3,018.55 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 2,150.08 SELL EMA 5 $ 2,329.89 SELL EMA 10 $ 2,644.27 SELL EMA 21 $ 2,973.08 SELL EMA 50 $ 3,206.56 SELL EMA 100 $ 3,178.97 SELL EMA 200 $ 3,080.83 SELL What can you expect from ETH price analysis next? Based on the combined 4-hour and 1-day charts, Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of short-term bearish momentum following a rejection near the $2,115 resistance level. On the 4-hour chart, the MACD has turned negative, accompanied by a weakening RSI around 44, pointing to reduced buying pressure. Bollinger Bands are beginning to contract, suggesting a potential period of consolidation or further decline. Meanwhile, the 1-day chart indicates that ETH remains under the 20-day SMA, and the RSI hovering around 39 reflects overall bearish sentiment. If ETH fails to reclaim $2,050 soon, it could drop toward $1,900 or lower in the coming sessions. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $6,224 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $41,005 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $11.383. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029, with an average price of $24,930 and a potential high of $30,195. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $41,005 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $41,005 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Coinbase Ventures will “continue to invest steadily through market conditions” because it sees the “big picture,” Tejwani told Cointelegraph in an interview. “What we’re seeing as investors is an exponential technology change curve that is transforming the way people interact, how value flows, and how economies are run. And it’s being shaped by the people who are building on crypto infrastructure,” said Tejwani. Coinbase Ventures’ portfolio of investments includes Arbitrum, Dune, EigenLayer , Etherscan, OpenSea, Optimism and Uniswap, among others. Its mandate is to invest in project founders who share the namesake crypto exchange’s vision of creating more economic freedom through blockchain and Web3 applications. The company is especially “bullish on stablecoins,” thanks in part to recent crypto-friendly moves in the US Congress and by President Donald Trump , Tejwani said. The Senate Banking Committee forwarding a bill to regulate [stablecoins] “is a huge step for crypto,” he said, referring to the GENIUS Act , which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins. The GENIUS Act is on its way to the full Senate after clearing the banking committee in an 18-6 vote. Source: Bill Hagerty Although there was some partisan opposition, California Representative Ro Khanna recently said at least 70 of his fellow Democrats now understand the importance of stablecoins in maintaining the US dollar’s role as a global reserve currency. Khanna, like others, expects stablecoin legislation to cross the finish line this year. The dollar-denominated stablecoin market now exceeds $220 billion, representing roughly 1.1% of the US M2 money supply.

Some of these themes were also identified by Jeffrey Hu, the head of investment research at Hong Kong-based HashKey Capital, although HashKey is placing a bigger emphasis on tokenizing real-world assets and decentralized physical infrastructure networks, also known as DePINs. Nevertheless, Tejwani and Hu agree that institutional adoption and real-world use cases represent the major focus areas for venture capital firms. “We expect 2025 to be a banner year for crypto startup activity and VC investment, fueled by clearer regulations, institutional adoption, and the continued growth of real-world use cases,” said Tejwani. Business service providers, DeFi, security services and payments attracted the largest VC capital in February.

This marks a critical phase before the upgrade is officially launched on Ethereum’s mainnet. If all goes well, developers expect Pectra to go live in the next 30 days. With Pectra’s final test in motion, experts believe the ETH price will see a price surge. Pectra’s Final Test on Hoodi The Hoodi testnet is the last of three test networks to run the Pectra upgrade. The first two tests, on Holesky and Sepolia, faced technical issues, making this final test crucial. Meanwhile, Ethereum developers created Hoodi to ensure all bugs were fixed and that Ethereum’s network runs smoothly before the upgrade officially launches. Thus Pectra aims to improve Ethereum’s user experience by introducing smart contract functionality to wallets. This means users may soon be able to pay transaction fees using cryptocurrencies other than Ether (ETH), making transactions more flexible and user-friendly. Why Testnets Matter? Testnets like Hoodi act as practice grounds for major blockchain upgrades. Developers use them to check for bugs and prevent any issues before launching new updates on the main Ethereum network. If the Hoodi test runs without problems, Pectra will be closely monitored for 30 days before its official launch. Ethereum Price Outlook While the network upgrade is gaining attention, Ethereum’s price has also been making waves. Last week, ETH rebounded nearly 7% from the $1,861 support level and is currently trading around $2,025 . IF it maintains this momentum, Ethereum could aim for its March 7 peak of $2,258. However, for this to happen, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) must move past 39 and cross the neutral 50 mark. Further market sentiment is showing signs of improvement, with Ethereum’s long/short ratio reaching 1.2287, indicating that long positions are outpacing shorts by 55%. This signals strong buying interest, which could help Ethereum maintain its upward trajectory.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-26 17:09:03

The total crypto market cap failed to breach the $3 trillion mark, retreating to $2.95 trillion at the time of writing, down 2.67% on the day. Market sentiment held steady at 47, reflecting a neutral outlook amid broader market uncertainty. Momentum faded across the large-cap altcoin market, with most gains concentrated in small-cap meme coins that topped the day’s charts. Why is Bitcoin going down? Bitcoin retested the $86,000 support level today as traders offloaded risk assets ahead of US President Donald Trump’s new trade tariffs, with a fresh round of measures set to take effect on April 2. Bitcoin mirrored the sluggish mood in US equities, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq opening lower. Meanwhile, the US dollar index (DXY) climbed to a three-week high of 104.46. Traders typically view this as a bearish signal for BTC, given their inverse relationship. ​Despite Bitcoin exchange outflows reaching a seven-month high and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows turning positive after several days of outflows, bulls failed to push the price past the daily high of $88,430. Will Bitcoin price go up? ​ Analysts at QCP Capital pointed to lingering uncertainty around the US trade policy and upcoming tariff decisions. In a note to Telegram subscribers, the firm highlighted a lack of clarity on how broad or impactful the measures could be, warning that sideways volatility may stick around until more details emerge. Still, QCP flagged a potential catalyst, which was GameStop’s decision to add Bitcoin to its corporate treasury, which was announced earlier today. While not a first in the world of corporate adoption, the move could spark renewed interest from retail investors, especially given GME’s meme stock legacy. If retail momentum picks up, the firm expects Bitcoin’s upside to resume. On X, market commentator Colin Talks Crypto noted that Bitcoin had likely formed a short-term local top after entering the resistance zone between $89,000 and $92,000. He expects the price to cool off in the near term but believes the rally could resume within a few days. Colin Talks Crypto 🪙 @ColinTCrypto · Follow Bitcoin price has formed what I would consider a possible short term local topping pattern: three daily candles with tall upper wicks. (see white circle in 1st chart)This doesn’t mean BTC needs to correct for long. It could just be a matter of days. Or could be a bit longer. 8:07 PM · Mar 26, 2025 288 Reply Copy link Read 24 replies According to a well-followed analyst, Mr. Wall Street, retail is “worried about recession” and is currently staying out of the market, which he sees as a key factor behind the current slump in momentum. However, he called the fear cycle a “shake” tactic rather than a signal of real economic trouble, adding that a similar sentiment in 2022–23 paved the way for Bitcoin’s rally from $16k to $ 74k. Yet fellow trader Titan of Crypto made some optimistic projections, pointing out that BTC had broken out of a 3-month descending channel, which he labelled as a “key shift in market structure.” Historically, such breakouts have marked the start of strong upward trends, often signaling renewed bullish momentum. Titan believes this could pave the way for a fresh leg higher if key resistance levels are cleared. At press time, Bitcoin was down roughly 1.5% in the past 24 hours at $86,688. As of now, $85,000 remains the next key level to watch, according to market pundits. Over the past months, a break below that market has led to deeper corrections on every occasion. Altcoin markets see subdued price action The top altcoins saw little action as the sector’s total market capitalisation had dropped nearly 4% to $1.20 trillion at the time of writing. The altcion season index improved only slightly in the past 24 hours, at 18, up two points. Yet a number of analysts were calling out current levels as a precursor to the start of alt season. One such analysis came from Mister Crypto, who pointed out that the total altcoin market cap had once again bounced from a long-standing ascending support trendline. In his chart, Mister Crypto highlighted multiple successful retests of this trendline dating back to early 2020, suggesting the structure remains intact. Altcoin market capitalization. Source: Mister Crypto Meanwhile, fellow analyst Merlijn The Trader expects the “Altcoin bullrun phase” to begin soon, “10X gains are next. If you’re still here, congratulations – altcoins are about to explode!” the analyst noted in a March 26 X post. Nevertheless, such optimism was yet to reflect across major altcoins, with top performers, mostly meme coins, posting only single-digit gains on the day: Movement Movement (MOVE) rose 7.8% over the past day to $0.5065 at the time of writing while bringing its market cap to $719.6 million. The price jump came with a big spike in trading activity as daily volume shot up 300%, crossing $719.6 million. Source: CoinMarketCap Most of the gains followed an announcement from the Movement Network Foundation that it had recovered $38 million in USDT from a now-banned market maker operating on Binance. The firm had turned malicious, dumping 66 million MOVE tokens shortly after listing while placing minimal buy orders, causing the token’s price to tank. The Foundation has since severed ties with the firm and allocated the recovered funds to a three-month buyback initiative known as the Movement Strategic Reserve, widely seen as a bullish catalyst for the project. The move also led to an uptick in whale accumulation, further extending the rally. Pepe Over the last 24 hours, Pepe (PEPE) rallied 7.2%, exchanging hands at a four-week high of $0.0000058 as its market shot up to $3.65 billion. Its price rise came along with trading volume increasing 64% to over $940 million over the same period. Source: CoinMarketCap Today’s gains came along with a sharp rise in futures open interest, which surged to over $324 million, the highest since February 2 and nearly double this month’s low. A spike in OI is typically seen as a bullish signal, which indicates growing trader confidence and fresh capital entering the market. Investor accumulation also appears to be underway, with PEPE exchange reserves falling nearly 1% in the past week as holders are moving tokens off exchanges, likely with the intent to hold rather than sell. Pepe’s rebound was also helped in part by a recent Truth Social post from US President Donald Trump that reignited interest in meme coins. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) rallied 7.5% over the past day to $0.00001460, pushing its market cap to $8.6 billion and ranking it 16th among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Its daily trading volume also saw a strong jump over the period, nearly doubling to over $537 million. Source: CoinMarketCap SHIB prices stayed green as the Shiba Inu team hinted at the launch of Shib Finance, a major DeFi upgrade that will introduce features to enhance the meme coin’s ecosystem. The altcoin also gained broader exposure after its listing on BingX Futures, which added to the momentum. Adding to SHIB’s bullish momentum, its burn rate has spiked recently, with around 1 billion tokens burned in a single day. These tokens were permanently removed from circulation, driving scarcity, which in turn increased the value of the remaining supply.

With the digital asset market evolving unprecedentedly, community members closely watch projects delivering real-world utility and massive growth potential. Cardano and Quant have long been considered strong contenders, but Qubetics ($TICS) is quickly emerging as a top player, addressing industry challenges that traditional networks have struggled to overcome. As bullish predictions circulate, now is the perfect time to analyze what’s fueling the momentum behind these tokens. Unlike other blockchain networks, Qubetics is revolutionizing how financial institutions and individuals interact with digital assets. By bridging multiple blockchains and facilitating ultra-fast transactions, Qubetics is poised to be a game-changer. With its presale gaining traction, early adopters are seeing an exciting opportunity to be part of one of the best cryptos for the future. Meanwhile, Cardano’s price predictions hint at a potential surge, and community sentiment around Quant (QNT) is heating up, with over 68% of users on Binance feeling very bullish as the token climbs past $79 with growing confidence in its future trajectory. Qubetics: Transforming Cross-Border Transactions with Blockchain Innovation Traditional cross-border transactions have long been a slow and costly process, riddled with hidden fees and delays. Qubetics aims to eliminate these inefficiencies by leveraging its advanced blockchain technology to facilitate near-instant global payments. By creating a frictionless, low-cost environment, Qubetics is unlocking new opportunities for businesses, financial institutions, and individuals alike. This positions it as one of the best cryptos for the future, offering real-world solutions that legacy financial systems have failed to provide. For example, businesses that depend on global suppliers no longer need to endure costly intermediaries and prolonged settlement times. A tech startup in Silicon Valley can now pay a freelancer in South Korea within seconds, while an international e-commerce brand can streamline vendor payments without incurring excessive fees. Even individuals sending money abroad benefit from the efficiency of Qubetics, ensuring that remittances reach their families faster and at a fraction of the usual cost. Qubetics Presale: The Best Cryptos for the Future with High ROI Potential The Qubetics presale is proving to be one of the hottest opportunities in the crypto space, with massive growth potential for early adopters. Currently in its 27th stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.1300, with over 503 million tokens already sold. The presale has raised more than $15.5 million, attracting a rapidly growing community of 23,800+ token holders. With each stage lasting only seven days and a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM, the urgency to secure a position is driving significant interest. ROI projections for one of the best cryptos for the future are eye-catching. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, it represents a 669.13% ROI. At $5, the ROI skyrockets to 3,745.67%, while a $10 valuation would mean 7,591.33% ROI. A post-mainnet launch price of $15 could yield an astonishing 11,437% ROI. To put this into perspective, a $100 purchase today would acquire 769 $TICS tokens. If the price reaches $5, that initial investment would be worth $3,845, and at $10, it would surge to $7,690—a compelling reason why many are rushing to participate in this Qubetics presale. Cardano: Can ADA Hit $5? A Bullish Pattern Says Yes Cardano (ADA) has been making waves in the crypto space with technical indicators suggesting a potential price surge. Analysts have identified a bullish flag pattern in Cardano’s weekly charts, indicating the possibility of a strong upward movement toward $5. Supporting this momentum, lower timeframes are showing bullish structures that align with broader market recovery trends. These technical patterns are fueling speculation that ADA could soon see a significant price increase, drawing attention from traders and long-term holders alike. Despite Cardano’s strong technological foundation, one challenge remains: its relatively slow adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi). Currently, ADA ranks 19th in total value locked (TVL) across DeFi platforms, highlighting the need for stronger developer interest and integration with popular stablecoins like USDT. However, as its ecosystem grows and investor confidence builds, ADA’s price trajectory remains a focal point for those looking at the best cryptos for the future. Is Quant (QNT) About to Pop Off? Here’s What the Community Thinks Wondering if now’s the time to keep an eye on Quant (QNT)? You’re not alone. With the current price sitting at $79.39 and a 24-hour uptick of 3.82%, QNT is getting some serious attention — and not just because of the price. A whopping 68.18% of users who weighed in on Binance are very bullish about QNT’s future. That’s not just optimism — that’s confidence backed by strong sentiment from early adopters and longtime community members. Now let’s talk future predictions. The visual forecast tool lets users play around with growth estimates, and even a modest 5% growth prediction shows QNT climbing steadily toward $100 by 2030. That’s not moonboy behavior — it’s calculated outlooks from a community that sees real potential. Out of 22 user votes, only one leaned bearish. So whether you’re already in the QNT circle or still watching from the sidelines, this sentiment shift is definitely one to keep tabs on. Conclusion: The Future of Crypto is Here—Are You Ready? The crypto space is evolving rapidly, with projects like Qubetics, Cardano, and Quant shaping the future of digital finance. Qubetics presale stands out as one of the most promising investment opportunities, with a structured approach that rewards early buyers with substantial ROI potential. Meanwhile, Cardano’s bullish indicators suggest a possible price rally toward $5, and Quant is turning heads with over 68% of Binance users feeling very bullish about its future, especially as it climbs above $79 and gains strong community backing. For those seeking high-growth potential, the time to join this crypto presale is now, as the market continues to gain momentum.

With Q2 just days away, crypto investors are gearing up for the next explosive bull run. As the monthly and quarterly close approaches, multiple crypto assets are flashing signs of major breakouts. Among the front-runners, Pepe and Dogecoin are showing remarkable bullish strength — with new all-time highs potentially on the horizon. But for sidelined investors, one question remains: Which is the best crypto to buy now between the two? Some of the newer meme coins, including Fartcoin, Popcat and BTC Bull , are also in contention. Pepe Bullish Case: How High Can The Frog Meme Coin Go In 2025? It’s no surprise to smart money investors that Pepe is showing bullish strength ahead of Q2. As a reliable bellwether for meme coin momentum, Pepe’s breakout potential often signals the broader market’s direction. Since its local bottom on March 11th, the Pepe price is up by more than 60%, trading as high as 0.0000092 on Wednesday. It has followed an ascending trendline since the bottom. Sidelined investors looking to buy PEPE or open a long position do not need to FOMO. With its 4-hour RSI now in overbought territory, a short-term retracement appears likely. A retest of the trendline support could follow, offering a more favorable entry. Investors may consider dollar-cost averaging into a position in the $0.0000076–$0.0000078 range. In the long term, prominent analysts continue to view Pepe as a millionaire-maker. Team LAMBO Charts is seeing a “generational bounce”, which could result in a 6x upswing in the coming months. $PEPE a generational bounce is coming.I expect a 6x off here towards 0.00005$. #PEPE pic.twitter.com/xUetrMNNE0 — Team LAMBO Charts (@TehLamboXcharts) March 26, 2025 Indeed, a $21 billion market cap doesn’t seem out of reach for Pepe — especially with momentum building ahead of Q2. Dogecoin Price Prediction — Will DOGE Hit $1? The meme coin market leader is also gearing up for a major rally. Dogecoin also hit its local bottom on March 11th but has rallied by only 30% since, trading as high as $0.203 on Wednesday. At first glance, it could appear that Pepe has a higher latent demand, considering it has bounced harder in the broader market relief rally. However, DOGE’s 30% move has added nearly $6 billion to its market cap, as compared to the nearly $1.5 billion increase in Pepe. Moreover, Dogecoin tends to consolidate at a slower pace before going parabolic. Prominent analysts believe that “massive moves” are coming for DOGE as the top meme coin is forming a rounding-bottom pattern, similar to its 2014 - 2017 price action. #Dogecoin Massive Moves 🔥 $Doge pic.twitter.com/4VnauS9xyA — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) March 26, 2025 The Dogecoin bulls aren’t giving up on the $1 dream. With the US SEC expected to approve spot DOGE ETFs this year, a new all-time high for Dogecoin is certainly within reach. Which Is The Best Crypto To Buy Now? It is very unlikely that investors will go wrong with either Pepe or Dogecoin. Pepe is a beta bet on Ethereum and will likely act as a beta bet on it. On the contrary, Dogecoin typically doesn’t show much correlation with the broader market outlook and will likely explode towards the end of the rally. Smart money investors are, therefore, investing in both the meme coins, considering they both are expected to deliver outsized returns during different parts of the bull run. Fartcoin and Popcat are other meme cryptos that are in high demand, especially due to their significantly lower market capitalization. Low-cap crypto assets are also seeing significant demand from whales and retailers alike. For instance, BTC Bull (BTCBULL) has raised over $4 million in its presale, thanks to significant smart money investment. Unlike most new meme coins, which turn out to be fads, BTC Bull has managed to prove its long-term viability by tying itself to Bitcoin. $4M raised. The BTCBULL army moves with force! 🐂💥 pic.twitter.com/ItDMWMvPC3 — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) March 24, 2025 Unlike most new meme coins, which turn out to be fads, BTC Bull has managed to prove its long-term viability by tying itself to Bitcoin. BTCBULL holders will earn massive BTC airdrops whenever the Bitcoin price hits certain milestones. This is in addition to regular burn evens and a massive BTCBULL airdrop at other set milestones. Owing to its unique value proposition and small market cap, BTC Bull has found its way on the best-crypto-to-buy lists of prominent analysts. Many early buyers are even eyeing up to 100x returns.

With approximately $4.78 billion in cash —nearly 37% of its $12.9 billion market cap —this move marks more than just a diversification of reserves. JUST IN: @GameStop updates its investment policy to add #Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. The company holds ~40% of its $11B market cap in cash reserves—that's $4.62 BILLION of capital looking for a new home. pic.twitter.com/o62rrdwpKo — Bitcoin For Corporations (@BitcoinForCorps) March 25, 2025 It’s a signal that corporate treasury strategy is evolving. That excess cash on the balance sheet can—and perhaps should—be more than idle. And that new asset classes are gaining legitimacy in the boardroom, not just on message boards. GameStop’s move may not be typical. But it is highly strategic—and increasingly relevant for CFOs evaluating how to preserve capital and unlock value in a shifting macro landscape. Why Bitcoin—and Why Now? For companies with material cash holdings, the erosion of purchasing power is no longer theoretical—it’s measurable. Over the past decade, the U.S. dollar has declined in real terms by more than 25%, driven by inflation, expansionary monetary policy, and global fiscal uncertainty. Bitcoin presents a compelling counterweight to this degradation, particularly for balance sheets with the flexibility to tolerate mark-to-market volatility in pursuit of long-term strategic payoff. Consider its defining characteristics: Fixed supply: Bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, making it the only digital asset engineered to be verifiably scarce in a world of expanding monetary supply. Global liquidity: Bitcoin trades 24/7 in deep global markets, offering CFOs a high-liquidity, non-sovereign asset class accessible without jurisdictional constraints. Resilience to monetary intervention: Bitcoin is not subject to interest rate policy, quantitative easing, or the political whims of central banks. Long-term outperformance: With a 6-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 72.7%, Bitcoin has dramatically outpaced equities, bonds, and real estate over the same period. For CFOs thinking in 3-, 5-, or 10-year increments, the case for allocating even a small portion of excess cash to Bitcoin is no longer fringe—it’s prudent exploration. Accounting Clarity Unlocks Strategic Action Until recently, many finance teams ruled out Bitcoin simply due to unfavorable accounting treatment. Under legacy GAAP standards, Bitcoin had to be impaired when its price dropped, but could not be revalued when it recovered—an asymmetric model that distorted true economic value and discouraged adoption. In late 2024, that barrier was removed. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved new rules that now allow companies to measure Bitcoin at fair market value. Beginning in 2025, companies can: Reflect both unrealized gains and losses in earnings Report Bitcoin more transparently in financial statements Align accounting treatment with actual asset performance This change addresses one of the most common objections from CFOs and audit committees alike. It brings Bitcoin into compliance with modern reporting standards—making it viable not just for speculation, but for responsible treasury management . Why GameStop Was a Natural Fit Every company has a unique capital structure, investor base, and operational profile. GameStop’s decision to allocate to Bitcoin wasn’t just bold—it was structurally appropriate . High liquidity: With over $4.6 billion in cash and equivalents, GameStop’s balance sheet provides room for allocation without compromising near-term operations. Resilient investor base: GameStop’s shareholders have already demonstrated long-term conviction and a willingness to support unorthodox but calculated strategies. Cultural alignment: As a company that challenged Wall Street norms in 2021, GameStop’s embrace of a decentralized, digital reserve asset aligns with its identity as a financial outlier. This doesn’t mean Bitcoin is a fit for every public company. But for those with excess reserves and a forward-looking treasury mindset, it deserves serious consideration. The Bigger Picture: What It Means for Other Companies GameStop’s move is part of a broader rethinking of the traditional treasury reserve model. For decades, companies stored value in cash, short-term bonds, and dollar-denominated equivalents. But in today’s environment, those instruments may preserve nominal value while degrading purchasing power. Bitcoin introduces an alternative—and the macro backdrop is increasingly supportive. Ongoing inflation: Despite cooling from its peak, inflation remains persistently above central bank targets, steadily eroding the real value of corporate cash holdings. Elevated debt levels: Sovereign debt across developed nations continues to climb, increasing the likelihood of future currency devaluation and suppressing real yields. ETF-driven validation: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has introduced new channels for institutional participation, signaling broader market legitimacy. Shift in investor expectations: As digital-native generations begin to shape capital markets, shareholder interest in Bitcoin and hard assets is rising—especially among retail and growth-oriented investors. These tailwinds create space for CFOs to begin allocating conservatively—without needing to commit to a radical overhaul of reserve strategy. A Quiet Signal to the Market GameStop’s move didn’t come with a flashy press conference or social media fanfare. It came through a formal policy update—exactly how strategic treasury decisions are typically made. The signal it sends is simple but important: “We believe excess capital should be protected—and positioned for asymmetric upside.” Bitcoin is not a cure-all. But it is now, for the first time, auditable, liquid, and institutionally viable . For CFOs with flexibility and foresight, exploring Bitcoin is no longer about being first—it’s about preparing for what’s next.

A positive sign in favor of the bulls is that the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have witnessed net inflows for eight successive trading days , according to SoSoValue data. That indicates institutional investors are gradually buying again. In another positive, a Bitcoin whale bought 2,400 Bitcoin — worth over $200 million — on March 24 to increase the total holding to more than 15,000 BTC, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence said in a post on X. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 However, a Bitcoin rally may not be easy as bulls are expected to encounter solid selling near $90,000. Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson highlighted in a post on X that whales had closed long positions and initiated short positions on Bitcoin at $88,000 . He added that history says the whales are right. Could Bitcoin break above the stiff overhead resistance, pulling altcoins higher, or is it time for a short-term correction? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin is facing selling at the resistance line, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day exponential moving average ($85,825). BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattening 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint suggest that the bulls have a slight edge. A break and close above the 50-day simple moving average ($89,787) indicates that the correction may be over. The BTC/USDT pair could soar to $95,000 and later to the crucial resistance at $100,000. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it signals that the bulls have given up. That may sink the pair to $83,000 and then to $80,000. Ether price analysis Ether’s ( ETH ) recovery is facing solid resistance at the breakdown level of $2,111, indicating that the bears are unwilling to give up their advantage. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price continues lower and breaks below $1,937, it will signal that the bears are trying to flip the $2,111 level into resistance. If that happens, the ETH/USDT pair could decline to $1,800. This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above $2,111. That opens the doors for a rally to the 50-day SMA ($2,325) and subsequently to $2,550. Such a move will suggest that the pair may have formed a short-term bottom at $1,754. XRP price analysis XRP ( XRP ) is trying to take support at the 20-day EMA ($2.39), suggesting that the bulls are buying on dips. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to push the price to the resistance line. If the price turns down sharply from the resistance line and breaks below the moving averages, it will signal that the bears remain in control. That could keep the XRP/USDT pair stuck between the resistance line and $2 for some more time. Buyers will be in the driver’s seat on a break and close above the resistance line. The pair may rally to $3 and eventually to $3.40. BNB price analysis BNB ( BNB ) bulls are facing resistance at $644, but a positive sign is that the buyers have not given up much ground to the bears. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA ($616) has started to turn up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers drive the price above $644, the BNB/USDT pair could ascend to $686. This level may again act as a strong barrier, but if the bulls overcome it, the pair may rally to $745. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA. That may pull the price down toward the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $591. Solana price analysis Solana ( SOL ) broke and closed above the 20-day EMA ($136) on March 24, suggesting the start of a relief rally. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 50-day SMA ($155) may act as a resistance, but if the bulls prevail, the SOL/USDT pair could rally to $180. Sellers are expected to aggressively defend the $180 level. If the price turns down sharply from $180 and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will signal a possible range formation in the near term. The pair may consolidate between $110 and $180 for some time. Instead, if buyers drive the price above $180, it suggests that the pair has started its journey toward the top of the large $110 to $260 range. Dogecoin price analysis Dogecoin ( DOGE ) rose and closed above the 20-day EMA ($0.18) on March 25, suggesting the start of a sustained recovery. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The DOGE/USDT pair is facing selling at the 50-day SMA ($0.21). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will signal buying on dips. The bulls will try to propel the pair to $0.24 and later to $0.29. On the other hand, if the price skids below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that bears continue to sell on rallies. The pair may drop to $0.16 and then to the crucial support at $0.14. Cardano price analysis Cardano ( ADA ) bulls pushed the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.75) but are struggling to sustain the higher levels. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price breaks below the 20-day EMA, the bears will attempt to pull the ADA/USDT pair to the uptrend line. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. The pair could then descend to $0.58 and, after that, to $0.50. If buyers want to seize control, they will have to push and maintain the price above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could rise to $0.84. This level may act as a strong resistance, but if the bulls prevail, the pair may climb to $1.02. Related: Bitcoin price just ditched a 3-month downtrend as 'key shift' begins Chainlink price analysis Chainlink ( LINK ) has moved up to the 50-day SMA ($16.12), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA, the LINK/USDT pair may find support at the 20-day EMA ($14.75). A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA increases the likelihood of a break above the 50-day SMA. The pair could climb to $17.7 and later to the resistance line. If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to swiftly pull the price back below the 20-day EMA. The pair could slump to $13.82 and thereafter to the channel’s support line. Avalanche price analysis Avalanche’s ( AVAX ) relief rally rose above the 50-day SMA ($22.10) on March 25, indicating that the downtrend could be ending. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA ($20.42) has started to turn up, and the RSI has jumped into the positive zone, signaling an advantage to buyers. If the AVAX/USDT pair turns down from the current level but finds support at the 20-day EMA, it suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a rally to $27.23. On the contrary, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals a range formation between $25.12 and $15.27. Stellar price analysis Stellar ( XLM ) recovered to the breakdown level of $0.31, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. XLM/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price turns down from $0.31 and breaks below $0.27, it will suggest that the bears are active at higher levels. That heightens the risk of a drop to the critical support at $0.22, where buyers are expected to step in. Alternatively, a break and close above $0.31 signals that the markets have rejected the breakdown. The XLM/USDT pair may rise to the downtrend line, which could again pose a substantial challenge. A break and close above the downtrend line suggests a potential trend change. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The analysts indicate $2.80 is the primary resistance point that prevents market movement until investors confirm trending changes in broader market sentiment. The ongoing Ripple legal disputes together with market uncertainties have driven investors toward solutions that show definite expansion opportunities. Dogecoin (DOGE) along with Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) separate themselves from other choices yet their financial performances move in opposite directions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) achieved market distinction through its presale method combined with practical usage which led to obtaining 6,600 owners over recent weeks. Potential Cycle Of Dogecoin Dogecoin reflects its 2017 scenario, and it continues its 119-day rollover course. DOGE could reach $1 by mid-2025 in the event of a breakout, analysts say. Technical indicators such as the MACD suggest bullish crossovers, but volatility is still an issue. Currently, DOGE is trading at $0.1743, with resistance at $0.20, which, if surpassed, will provide enough steam for DOGE to avoid falling back below $0.15. Yet as historical trends inspire optimism, Dogecoin’s dependence on meme-driven surges makes its long-term prospects unclear. Unlike protocols that serve a physical purpose, DOGE flourishes on social sentiment which is a two-bladed sword in unstable sectors. The Momentum of Pepe Coin Despite wider market corrections, Pepe Coin is valued $0.000007249 with a 5% increase in the previous week. If yes, analysts view the $0.000008 as a key resistance area that, if closed above, would create a 100% rally. Elsewhere, PEPE RSI at 59 is neutral, suggesting a slight lack of directional conviction. Potential best of all would be tentatively bullishness that the token’s MACD is showing, though its meme culture dependence adds risk. A minor dip could take PEPE below $0.000007, eventually scuffling the recent profits. Because volatility can be processed to benefit short-term traders; Pepe Coin has no mechanism to sustainably create internal demand such as projects that manage utility by acting through custom ecosystems. Momentum Build for Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 3 presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on at $0.02, 80% of tokens already sold. Phase 4 sets $0.025 and after, a listing on exchanges are expected at $0.06, giving investors at this stage a 200% launch return. Based on tokenomics, this doubles in 20-24 weeks post launch to $1.50, yielding a staggering 7,400% ROI for early movers. MUTM distinguishes itself from speculative assets through its emissions model and its interchangeable mtTokens, which enable decentralized lending, borrowing, and yield-generate–driving organic, sustainable demand. The buy-and-distribute model of the platform redirects revenue to repurchasing MUTM tokens which distributes them to stakers generating perpetual buy pressure. Features like overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer lending options give rise to more stability, attracting more risk-adverse investors. Having raised $4.9 million and its presale phases now accelerating, Mutuum Finance is seeing tangible momentum lacking in much of the meme coin space. Mutuum Finance has begun a Certik audit on its smart contracts as a way of building confidence with investors. Final results will be released through official channels once they are tabulated. In an ecosystem where hype often takes precedence over security, this proactive move separates MUTM from the competition. Final Assessment If DOGE and PEPE are dependent on market sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) merges presale accessibility with a utility-driven model. MUTM Phase 3 sells out in record time, which signifies investor faith, as opposed to XRP, which has reached a plateau. Phase 4 adds up to a low, rare entry of $0.02 and provides a short period before an increase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors are running out of time to guarantee their exposure as the project prepares for stage two of its sale. Phase 3 is approaching capacity and a 25 percent price increase looms, so any delay risks missing the lowest entry point.

After enduring periods of uncertainty and downward pressure, DOGE has managed to reclaim the crucial $0.18 level, a price point that is now acting as a key battleground between bulls and bears. This level has emerged as a defining line in the sand; holding above it could fuel a strong rally, while dropping below might open the door for further declines. With increasing trading volume and renewed interest from investors, the stage is set for an intense showdown. Technical indicators suggest that momentum is shifting in favor of the bulls, but resistance levels ahead could still pose a challenge. As momentum continues to build, Will Dogecoin solidify its breakout and surge higher, or will the bears attempt to reclaim control? The Battle For $0.18: Why This Level Matters Dogecoin’s $0.18 price level has become the defining battleground between bulls and bears, marking a critical inflection point in its price action. This level has previously acted as both strong resistance and key support, making it a decisive line that could determine DOGE’s next move. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is ‘All Going To Plan,’ Says Crypto Analyst However, current price action suggests that bulls have taken the driver’s seat, showing strong buying pressure to help DOGE hold above the $0.18 level. The increasing demand and rising trading volume indicate growing confidence among traders, reinforcing the possibility of further upside movement. Furthermore, Dogecoin’s recent price action is backed by strong technical signals, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) climbing above the 50 mark, indicating a shift toward bullish momentum. Significantly, this rise in RSI aligns with DOGE’s breakout above $0.18, reinforcing the argument that bulls are gaining control. If this bullish momentum persists, and the RSI continues to trend higher without entering overbought territory (above 70), it could signal more upside potential, with resistance targets at $0.24 and $0.29. A successful break above this level will send the price upward toward other resistance levels such as $0.35 and $0.4. What If Dogecoin Fails? Potential Downside Risks Dogecoin’s price action is at a critical juncture, and its ability to maintain bullish momentum depends on key support levels that might prevent a further downside move. After breaking above the $0.18 level, DOGE may face a pullback to this level for a retest.

42438181,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=700463,1743010223,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42438181.jpeg,CBO predicts that US Treasury will default in August,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cbo-us-treasury-will-default-in-august/,"The Congressional Budget Office warned on Wednesday that the U.S. Treasury could run out of cash by August 2025 if Congress fails to act on the debt ceiling. The projection came straight from the CBO, which told lawmakers that unless the cap is raised or suspended, the government won’t have enough money to meet its legal obligations. That includes payments on federal debt, salaries, contracts, and benefits. Since January 21, the Treasury Department has been using emergency accounting moves to stay under the $36.1 trillion debt limit, which officially took effect at the start of the year. These temporary actions—called “extraordinary measures”—have kept things running, but the department hasn’t given a clear timeline for how long they’ll hold. CBO says cash may run out by May if revenue drops “If the debt limit remains unchanged, the government’s ability to borrow using extraordinary measures will probably be exhausted in August or September 2025,” the CBO said . “The projected exhaustion date is uncertain because the timing and amount of revenue collections and outlays over the intervening months could differ from CBO’s projections.” But the CBO didn’t stop there. The agency also flagged a scenario where the Treasury could run dry even earlier. “If the government’s borrowing needs are significantly greater than CBO projects, the Treasury’s resources could be exhausted in late May or sometime in June, before tax payments due in mid-June are received or before additional extraordinary measures become available on June 30.” The last time this happened was in 2023 when the U.S. got dangerously close to default. During that fight, former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said breaching the limit would force the department to miss “some obligation.” Her replacement, Scott Bessent, who took over in January 2025, told Congress at his confirmation hearing, “The US is not going to default on its debt” while he’s in office. Lawmakers now have a rough deadline—an X-date—based on the CBO’s projections. That’s the date when cash runs out, and decisions have to be made fast. It’s not just about theory anymore. This is about whether or not the government can keep the lights on and avoid financial collapse. House GOP ties debt ceiling to Trump tax package House Republicans have made it clear they want to fold a debt limit increase into a bigger package that would extend Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. Many of those cuts are set to expire at the end of this year. The House already passed a budget plan last month that includes a $4 trillion increase to the debt ceiling, tying it directly to Trump’s tax agenda. In the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune told reporters on Tuesday there’s “consensus forming” around attaching a debt ceiling measure to the GOP’s tax legislation. He said it could be passed using a reconciliation bill—something that would let Republicans bypass Democratic votes entirely. It’s unclear whether enough GOP senators are fully on board to push that through. The last time the debt ceiling was suspended, back in 2023, both parties voted on it. That bipartisan approach isn’t guaranteed this time, and that has Wall Street, D.C., and pretty much everyone watching nervously. This week, the Bipartisan Policy Center dropped its own estimate, placing the X-date somewhere between mid-July and October. Over on Wall Street, analysts are circling late July to late August as the likely window. A few predictions even suggest things could fall apart as early as late May. How fast we get there depends on tax revenue. The April 15 filing deadline is right around the corner, and if tax collections come in lower than expected, things could unravel a lot sooner. Earlier this month, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith said a breach could hit “as soon as mid-May” if the Treasury collects less than projected. And there’s more happening inside the Treasury Department. A federal court filing revealed that the department is preparing to lay off a “substantial number” of its more than 100,000 employees as part of a government downsizing program launched by President Trump. The plan is linked to his executive order to enforce the Department of Government Efficiency—also known as DOGE. According to the filing, the department is finalizing the layoff strategy. “Those plans will be tailored for each bureau, and in many cases will require separations of substantial numbers of employees through reductions in force (RIFs),” the document stated. This will affect major bureaus like the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Mint, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the DOGE initiative is focused on streamlining operations, not gutting them entirely. “DOGE stands for the Department of Government Efficiency, not the ‘Department of Government Elimination,’” he said. The information came out in a set of sworn affidavits filed in court on Tuesday. Trevor Norris, a senior Treasury human resources official, confirmed that the agency is responding to a 14-day temporary restraining order issued by a Maryland federal judge. That order forced the government to reinstate thousands of federal employees who had been fired but were still under probation. Those employees had been in their positions for less than one or two years, depending on their roles. The restraining order affects 18 different agencies, including all their component offices. The judge is still considering whether to turn that into a permanent injunction to protect their jobs. Norris also said that when the next round of layoffs takes place, the cuts will “disproportionately affect” the reinstated workers. That’s because RIFs are based on seniority, and probationary employees rank last. He didn’t give any date for when the department expects to finalize or carry out those plans.

BCBS, which focuses on setting measures to ensure the stability of banks, gathered voluntary and confidential submissions from 176 banks — of which 115 are internationally active — in June 2024. The data showed that just 29 banks contributed to the 341.5 billion euro figure, and the vast majority hold exchange-traded products tracking crypto over cryptocurrencies. Global watchdogs have been keeping a close eye on how interlinked the financial sector is with crypto following the collapse of crypto-friendly banks like Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Banks in 2023 . The BCBS also recommended that banks' spot crypto exposure should not exceed 2% in December 2022. Banks appear to be following through on this; their exposure to spot crypto holdings fell 44% between 2021 to 2022. As of the June 2024 survey, banks held almost no spot crypto, at 2.46%, instead preferring exchange-traded products. About 92.5% of banks' holdings are now in these more regulated products tracking crypto prices, rather than crypto assets themselves, the BCBS survey showed.

This price crash is due to several reasons, including Donald Trump’s fast-approaching tariffs on April 2nd, which could spark a wave of sell-offs for the crypto market. Crypto Market Crash: Why BTC, ETH, SOL, & DOGE Are Down CoinMarketCap data shows that a crypto market crash has happened with the Bitcoin price dropping below $87,000 and at risk of losing the $86,000 support level. Altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have also witnessed declines. This market crash has occurred following reports that US President Donald Trump could announce auto tariffs as soon as today. This provides a bearish outlook for the crypto market, as it will again raise concerns about a trade war. Given the market uncertainty that trade wars could cause, this will likely spark a wave of sell-offs This development could reverse all the gains that Bitcoin and altcoins recorded over the weekend and earlier in the week. The flagship crypto rallied to as high as $88,500 following reports that Trump’s tariffs wouldn’t be as severe as earlier feared. MicroStrategy’s purchase of 6,911 Bitcoin for $584 million earlier this week also contributed to the rebound in the Bitcoin price and other altcoins. However, the crypto market crash means these crypto assets risk losing their gains from earlier in the week. Other Reasons For The Crash Other reasons for the crypto market crash include institutional investors looking to be derisking ahead of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which will be released on Friday. The PCE is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, and it coming above expectations could spark a wave of sell-offs in the market. Meanwhile, the market crash has occurred as the Bitcoin price looks to fill the CME gap between $84,000 and $86,000. BTC closed within this range last week Friday but pumped over the weekend and has since failed to retrace back to this level, which it closed at on the CME market.

Fidelity, one of the world’s largest asset managers, has taken steps toward launching an ETF based on the sixth-largest cryptocurrency. Cboe Files SOL ETF Application On Behalf Of Fidelity In a 19b-4 filing on Tuesday, the Chicago Board Options BZX Exchange (Cboe) sought permission for the “Fidelity Solana Fund” proposed by the $5 trillion Wall Street giant. The 19b-4 form is a huge step in the SEC’s approval process, although Fidelity must still submit an S-1 registration statement describing the Solana-based investment vehicle. This filing comes a few days after Fidelity registered a new Delaware statutory trust for its Fidelity Solana Fund, which would be based on the performance of the sixth biggest crypto by market capitalization. Grayscale , Bitwise , Canary Capital, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck have also filed for spot SOL products. Earlier this year, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas pegged the odds at 70% that Solana ETFs would be approved this year, although he did not predict the exact timing. Altcoin ETF Craze Since pro-crypto President Donald Trump started his second term in January, the Securities and Exchange Commission has signaled a friendlier approach to the fast-growing crypto industry, such as dismissing enforcement cases against crypto players and establishing a crypto task force to formulate rules for the industry. The crypto-friendly policies have fueled a surge in ETF filings beyond Bitcoin and Ether. The torrent of filings rides on the momentum of both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot products securing the SEC’s regulatory blessing in early 2024. But, unlike the world’s two largest cryptos, Solana faces unique regulatory challenges. At the core is the question of whether Solana constitutes a commodity or security , a distinction that was critical in previous industry-related ETF approvals. Notably, Solana was one of the digital assets US President Donald Trump named for inclusion in the US crypto reserve before pulling back to include only tokens confiscated through enforcement actions. On March 17, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the US’s largest derivatives exchange, debuted SOL futures contracts. Analysts say this was further indication that spot SOL ETFs would soon be greenlighted in the US. Several firms have been vying for approval to launch a slew of altcoin funds in the US.

The gaming retailer reported holding $4.8 billion in cash during its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Company CEO Ryan Cohen weeks ago had teased an interest in purchasing bitcoin for the GME balance sheet. He was joined by Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Asset Management — an owner of GME via its ETFs, who urged the same. Though GameStop on Tuesday reported that a portion of its cash will go into bitcoin and U.S. dollar dominated stablecoins in the future, it did not disclose how much, or the timing of any buys. The plan kicked off a speculative frenzy on social media: How much bitcoin would Gamestop acquire? The company’s allocation will likely be significant, according to Anthony Pompliano, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, who said that GameStop wouldn’t be going through the very bureaucratic board approval process if it was only planning on allocating 1-2% of its cash into bitcoin. “Chairman Ryan Cohen is likely to take a big bet on bitcoin as a balance sheet asset,” Pompliano wrote in a note. “You only put the time and energy to get the change to your investment policy if you are looking to put a material amount of your cash into bitcoin.” Pomp also pointed out that Cohen currently follows three bitcoin-related accounts on X, which he sees as “behavior of a hardcore bitcoiner.” According to a poll posted by Michael Saylor — whose Strategy (MSTR) has spent $33 billion acquiring more than 500,000 BTC — on X, his followers believe that GameStop needs to at least hold $3 billion worth of bitcoin in order to “be respected by Bitcoiners.” Less clear is whether GameStop plans to be as aggressive inn buying bitcoin as Strategy. The company has deployed many creative fundraise mechanisms to fuel its war chest, including debt sales. But Strategy's BTC saga started as a more humble cash reserve of $250 million generated by COVID-era cost savings. Gamestop's share boost may prove resilient to bitcoin price swings because the company has only said it would buy BTC, but doesn't yet own any, mused Josh Mandell , a former bond trader.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) remained stuck above $86,000, while meme coins like Pepe ( PEPE ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), and Floki ( FLOKI ) soared by double digits this week. Mark Zandi, one of the top economists in the U.S. and Chief Economist at Moody’s, has warned that the country may be heading toward a recession. In a post on X, Zandi said that his top recession indicator was “flashing bright yellow,” signaling a potential downturn in 2025. He pointed to a sharp drop in consumer confidence—down 17 points over the past three months. His number one recession indicator happens when confidence drops 20 points over three months. He argues that consumers stop spending when this happens, leading to a recession. A technical recession happens when the US economy contracts for two consecutive quarters. FYI, consumer confidence as measured by the Conference Board is down 17 points over the past 3 months. Remember my #1 recession watch indicator is that if confidence falls by 20 points over 3 months, consumers stop spending and recession ensues about 6 months later. This… — Mark Zandi (@Markzandi) March 25, 2025 Bitcoin and altcoins would do well in a recession You might also like: Polygon price wedge points to more gains as addresses jump A recession is a bad period for any economy as the unemployment rate rises and businesses close. However, history shows that risky assets do well during a major downturn. For example, US stocks embarked on a decade-long bull run after the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. Most recently, after initially falling, stocks and cryptocurrencies embarked on a strong bull run. Bitcoin surged from $4,000 in March 2020 to $69,000 in November 2021. Similarly, Ethereum jumped from a low of $80 to $4,940 in the same period. This rebound was driven by the Federal Reserve, which has a long history of intervening during downturns through rate cuts and quantitative easing. Risk assets tend to perform well when the Fed lowers interest rates, as cheaper capital encourages risk-on sentiment across markets. If a recession occurs, as Zandi warns, Bitcoin and other altcoins may benefit from such a macro backdrop. At the same time, Bitcoin and other altcoins may do well if the US avoids a recession. That’s because this recession would be self-inflicted by Donald Trump’s tariffs . As such, his ending or scaling down his tariffs would also push investors back to risky assets.

The Senate is preparing to take a second and final vote on the bill Thursday, and if it passes again, Trump is likely to sign it into law the very next day. The rule, known as the DeFi broker rule, was pushed through during the last days of the Biden administration. It forces decentralized crypto platforms to report user activity to the IRS the same way traditional brokers do. Critics say that doesn’t make sense for systems that don’t actually hold user funds or run trades. The rule’s opponents say it would damage innovation and force devs to either break the law or leave the country. Senate prepares second vote before bill lands on Trump’s desk The Senate already passed the bill once, on March 4, with a 70–27 vote. That’s more than two-thirds, so it qualifies as a bipartisan supermajority. But under the Constitution’s origination clause, budget-related legislation must start in the House. So even though the Senate voted first, it has to do it again now that the House signed off. The House passed the same Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution on March 11 by a 292–132 vote. Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas who introduced the bill, called the Senate vote earlier this month “a victory for American innovation.” His bill blocks the IRS from enforcing its reporting mandate against DeFi protocols. Cruz wants to make sure software developers and permissionless platforms don’t get lumped in with centralized entities. The same exact bill is going through the Senate again on Thursday. If it passes, President Trump is expected to sign it into law on Friday. That would make it the first crypto-related bill ever signed into U.S. law. The CRA mechanism allows Congress to overturn recent federal rules, and this one targets the IRS rule directly. But that’s not the only battle going on in D.C. On Wednesday morning, over 30 crypto companies signed a joint letter demanding Congress rein in the Department of Justice. They say the DOJ is using vague money transmission laws to go after DeFi developers who don’t even touch user funds. The letter was organized by the DeFi Education Fund, a D.C.-based group that works on policy issues affecting decentralized finance. The letter went to the top members of the Senate Banking and Judiciary Committees, along with the House Financial Services and Judiciary Committees. It was signed by Coinbase, Kraken, A16z, Paradigm, Multicoin Capital, Exodus, and Ledger, among others. The industry is angry about how the DOJ is interpreting Section 1960 of the criminal code. That law makes it a crime to run an unlicensed money transmission business. But the DOJ wants to use it on DeFi platforms—even ones where devs don’t hold or transfer funds. The companies behind the letter say that interpretation is too broad and could lead to charges against people just writing code. The group is also accusing the DOJ of ignoring FinCEN’s 2019 guidance, which clearly stated that developers are not money transmitters. The current DOJ stance not only creates legal risks, but it also contradicts what FinCEN already said years ago. Industry leaders want Congress to fix this fast before any more devs get caught up in it. Developers raise alarms after DOJ charges Tornado Cash co-founder One of the main reasons the letter dropped this week is the ongoing case against Roman Storm, a co-creator of the crypto mixer Tornado Cash. In August 2023, the DOJ charged Roman with running an unlicensed money transmission business and helping launder money. It was the first time federal prosecutors hit a DeFi dev with criminal charges. The case shocked the crypto world. Roman didn’t hold funds, didn’t manage transactions, and wasn’t running a company. But the DOJ still charged him, saying that by writing code and deploying a tool others used to hide money, he was just as guilty. That move set off alarms across the crypto community. Many fear it opens the door to what the DeFi Education Fund calls “regulation by criminal indictment.” In other words, rather than writing new laws or regulations, the government is just charging devs under existing laws that were never meant for decentralized code. Amanda Tuminelli, who leads the DeFi Education Fund as Executive Director and Chief Legal Officer, said the group’s “number one policy priority is obtaining Congressional clarity on Section 1960.” Amanda also thanked the companies backing the letter, saying they all came together to “defend the rights of software developers and to push back on the DOJ’s misguided approach.” Members of Amanda’s team are meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week to talk about the issue in person. They want clear legal lines drawn between developers who write open-source code and centralized entities that move money for others. Without that clarity, they say, any dev working on a DeFi tool could be at risk. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

To read full editions, subscribe . The anime-inspired Ethereum NFT collection Azuki is releasing its Alpha Starter Decks this week. These decks consist of mystery loot, booster packs, and cards that will be playable in the brand’s upcoming trading card game (TCG). Each box — either a red “Shao” box or a blue “Raizan” box — will cost the equivalent of $95 of the ANIME token . Only Azuki community members will be able to buy these boxes, based on their predetermined status level. The eligibility snapshot was taken Tuesday morning, so it’s too late to qualify if you don’t own any Azuki NFTs. Azuki’s Games Division Manager Jon Chao is credited as the mind behind the upcoming game. He’s been working for Azuki since late 2023. Previously, he worked as a game producer at Timi Studio Group, Riot Games and Ubisoft. “A lot of collectors, a lot of degens [are] in our community,” Chao said in a video interview, speaking on why the Azuki team chose to build a TCG. “I do think we face major challenges that Pokemon or One Piece do not have… [for example,] they have so much content and lore,” Chao said. “All that can just be translated into card art and gameplay mechanics quite easily.” There are three allocation tiers for this Azuki drop: Grand Tier, Legend Tier and Order Tier. Grand grants you the ability to buy one deck, Legend grants the ability to buy up to four, and Order tier members can buy up to eight decks — if you feel like dropping $800 on cards for an unreleased game. Decks will come with a rulebook, but the team isn’t releasing its full guide on how to play the upcoming game just yet. That means we don’t know to what extent this game could feel like it’s pay-to-win when it finally comes out. If you got an allocation but want more packs (or didn’t get an allocation at all), you can enter their raffle to try to get one. After checking out, buyers will be given an NFT signifying that they purchased a pack. Physical cards won’t be sent out until July at the earliest, according to a post from the team. These proof-of-purchase NFTs can be traded before the physical card packs are issued, but Azuki warns traders that you do so at your own risk. Technically, though, if you get someone’s proof-of-purchase NFT, you would be able to claim a pack when redemption time comes. The Alpha Starter Decks drop begins March 27 at 1 pm ET, and will be live until April 3 at 1 pm ET. The Azuki team previously teased this drop two weeks ago via a blog post on their site, along with the note that different starter packs of cards will become available to the public later this year. They’re promising Waifus, too, don’t worry. Chao said that more than a third of the game’s budget has gone to designing its artwork — though they are outsourcing some of that art design to third-party firms. They’re also trying to release some of the cards as physical-backed tokens, or PBTs, meaning each physical card is tied to a token on the blockchain. Azuki waifu card design in progress The first Azuki collection launched back in 2022, in the form of 10,000 PFP NFTs. In 2023, they also launched the Azuki Elementals, a supplementary PFP collection with 20,000 NFTs. Azuki’s verified OpenSea page lists over a dozen different NFT collections in total, with some that redeemable for IRL merch or other NFTs. The Azuki Elementals were seen as controversial at the time of launch because of the quality of the art, as well as the perception that the additional PFPs in a similar style were diluting the value of the original collection. The team made $38 million in revenue from that second launch alone. The Elementals launch sparked the creation of the community-run AzukiDAO, but a hacker exploited the DAO’s governance token smart contract for 35 ETH. In 2023, Azuki’s X account was also compromised, resulting in the attacker swiping $750K in just 30 minutes by posting a malicious link to a wallet-draining scam. The upcoming Azuki game doesn’t seem to have a different name yet — it’s just called “Official Azuki TCG” on social media. The game’s X account bio states that the TCG is still releasing this year. I’m used to waiting for games to launch in this space, so I guess I’ll just… keep… waiting. Get the news in your inbox.

The cryptocurrency market showed a minor recovery, which pushed DOGE to gain 15% over the past week. The meme currency shows potential for additional price appreciation as top traders predict that the DOGE price could climb to $8 in the near term. Trader Says Dogecoin Price Will Soar to $8 After Breaking 3-Month Trendline A recent analysis by a top trader indicates that the Dogecoin price broke above its descending trendline, which dates back three months. Since the cryptocurrency’s formation in January 2025, it has encountered descending pressure within its downward trendline. The recent March 2025 price break represents an important development that has managed to spark widespread market interest. Dogecoin price experienced a major price change, which might indicate the beginning of an upward movement in its market. Market participants maintain close observation of this upward trend because it indicates upcoming momentum within the coming weeks. The leading trader just released his technical assessment which predicts Dogecoin (DOGE) will experience notable price fluctuation. According to his analysis the price movements in Dogecoin appeared as a bull pattern featuring two notable upward trends at periods in 2017 and 2023. The market analyst anticipates Dogecoin price will experience another bullish phase that will potentially reach a value of $8. The analysis shows a persistence of upward market trends which suggests potential similar growth could happen soon. How High Can DOGE Price Go In This Week? The latest DOGE price hovered at $0.19643 as of March 26, 2025, showing signs of growth following a brief period of consolidation. The DOGE price fluctuated between the range of $0.15, and $0.2, and it has maintained a steady upward trajectory within a rising channel. The analysis supported by the MACD indicator confirms a bullish stance through its positive histogram data while the signal line crosses. The market momentum remains with the buyer, which supports the expectation of an additional price rise. The present trend shows signs of continuing due to an upward crossing of the zero line by the MACD indicator. The Relative Strength Index currently holds a value of 65, indicating DOGE is entering an overbought state. Source: TradingView The attention of traders focuses on the upcoming breakthrough of $0.20 resistance which might drive the price to $0.220. The Dogecoin price prediction might use a potential rise above resistance to reach $0.25 during the current time period. Any major resistance encountered at the $0.20 price point might trigger a support shift toward $0.18.

A top analyst has predicted that Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity will soon enter the XRP ETF race. SEC vs Ripple Lawsuit Dropped On Wednesday, Ripple agreed to pay a $50 million fine to end the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s years-long enforcement case concerning the XRP cryptocurrency. The SEC sued Ripple in late 2020, accusing it of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering of XRP. As ZyCrypto reported , Ripple’s CLO, Stuart Alderoty, said that the company had meanwhile agreed to drop its cross-appeal of U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling , which found that XRP is “not necessarily a security on its face,” especially within the context of programmatic sales to retail customers. Alderoty’s announcement follows Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s declaration that the SEC’s case has ended. He described it as a “long overdue surrender” on the financial regulator’s part last week. The SEC’s about-face was widely anticipated following Trump’s return to the White House. Since Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda took over the commission’s reins, it has retreated from several lawsuits, including those against Robinhood , Coinbase , and OpenSea . XRP ETF Approval “Simply A Matter Of Time” The SEC’s retreat opens the door for mainstream institutional access to XRP, potentially transforming a once-embattled crypto into an approved financial product alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, is now convinced that the regulator’s approval of spot XRP ETFs is only “a matter of time.” At least seven major investment firms, including Bitwise, 21Shares, Grayscale, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton, have filed for XRP-focused ETFs in anticipation of regulatory greenlight. But despite the growing XRP ETF filing craze, BlackRock — issuer of the largest spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) — has yet to submit a filing for an XRP-based product. But the top ETF analyst sees this changing soon. “And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc, to all be involved. XRP currently the 3rd largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by market cap. Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this,” Geraci added . XRP was valued at $2.40 as of press time after shedding 1.6% over the last 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-26 17:49:33

Currently trading at $0.73, the top altcoin is moving closer to the apex of a symmetrical triangle pattern that has developed over several weeks. Technical analysis points to a potential breakout that may lead to a move toward the $1.1278 mark, representing a possible 50.95% increase from the breakout point. Cardano Price Nears Key Breakout Level; Targets $1.1278 According to analyst Trendxinc , the Cardano price is approaching a critical resistance near $0.80. A daily close above this level may confirm a breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern forming on the daily chart. The structure has been developing over several weeks, marked by lower highs and higher lows. Trendxinc’s analysis suggests that a breakout from this triangle could propel the Cardano price toward $1.1278. This level aligns with historical resistance zones. If the breakout is supported by strong volume, it may confirm trend continuation. Price consolidation in a tight range has created a build-up of momentum. Source: X Additionally, technical charts show that a sustained move above $0.80 may trigger follow-through buying. The pattern signals potential for a directional move. Volume confirmation is essential, as breakouts without strong volume may reverse quickly and fail to sustain the altcoin rally. A retest of the breakout zone could occur before a continued upward move. Meanwhile, ADA whale movements , with over 240 million tokens accumulated, reflect growing confidence in a potential price surge. This strategic buying, combined with long-term holder conviction, supports the case for a continued upward trend toward $0.85. Bullish Flag Pattern Signals Continued Strength Moreover, analyst Lucky Luciano identified a bullish flag on Cardano price charts. The flag pattern follows a strong uptrend and is defined by a downward-sloping channel. This structure generally precedes trend continuation when resolved to the upside. Luciano’s analysis points to resistance near the upper channel boundary. Previous attempts to break above this level have failed. However, current momentum and volume suggest the top altcoin may now be positioned for a stronger attempt. If successful, the next potential ADA price target is around $1.30. Source: X Luciano mentioned that the altcoin could reach $1.80 if momentum continues. The structure of the flag and its relation to past resistance levels provide traders with short- and mid-term targets. The Cardano price must maintain support and close above resistance to confirm this scenario. Gambardello Draws Long-Term Parallel with Amazon Meanwhile, market expert Dan Gambardello compared Cardano’s development to Amazon’s early growth phase. He referenced Amazon’s recovery after a deep decline during the dot-com era. According to Gambardello, the Cardano price movement resembles early Amazon charts in structure. He noted that ADA is still far from its all-time high but continues to build a scalable ecosystem. The altcoin’s development approach is focused on long-term growth. This has kept Cardano price stable during broader market corrections. Gambardello stated that macro conditions may support Cardano’s next growth phase. The comparison to Amazon is based on resilience, innovation, and long-term planning. Similarly, a recent analysis supports ADA price prediction to the $1 mark, highlighting strong bullish momentum driven by increased whale activity and rising investor interest. Technical indicators align with this outlook, suggesting that the altcoin could reach $1 within the week.

Price Outlook,https://bitzo.com/2025/03/can-polkadot-dot-and-avalanche-avax-reach-new-heights-this-cycle-price-outlook,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with speculation about which digital assets might lead the next bullish wave. Attention has recently shifted to Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX) . Both have shown potential, but can they truly break into new price territories this cycle? The following insights delve into the factors influencing their growth prospects. Polkadot Market Snapshot: Recent Flows and Key Price Levels Polkadot price action showed a 6.05% weekly rise dampened by a 4.44% monthly dip and a 1.87% decrease over six months. Price movements fluctuated, with gains and slight corrections marking the period. Shifts between bullish pushes and retracement phases kept the coin in a balanced state as it adjusted to market forces and investor sentiment over both the short and longer term. Trading now is centered within a range of $3.51 to $6.21. Immediate resistance lies near $7.69, with support around $2.31 and an extended ceiling at $10.38. Bulls are edging gains under resistance while bears hold near support. A watchful strategy between these levels capitalizes on moderate momentum and an RSI of 56.52. AVAX Trading Snapshot: Mixed Momentum and Key Levels in Play AVAX experienced a 7.92% price drop in the last month and a 21.58% decline over the past six months, counterbalanced by a strong weekly gain of 20.51%. Price movements proved volatile, with the coin oscillating as it recovers from recent losses while showing bursts of short-term strength. Current prices settle between $16.74 and $31.56. The nearest support at $11.10 and resistance levels at $40.73 and $55.55 set clear trading boundaries. The RSI at 58.57 along with modest momentum and oscillator readings suggest a market without a strong trend, inviting careful trades within these levels. Conclusion DOT and AVAX hold potential for significant growth in the current cycle. Both projects have strong technical foundations and active development communities. Market trends and increased adoption could drive their prices higher. Positive news and strong performance of the broader crypto market may further boost confidence in these coins. As the industry evolves, the potential for DOT and AVAX to reach new heights remains strong. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

GME stock, a viral sensation among retail traders in 2021, is up more than 14% the day after the company’s board approved a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Shares of GameStop are trading for $29.12 at time of writing. In a Tuesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company outlines its new Bitcoin strategy. “The Board approved the addition of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, alongside US dollar-denominated stablecoins, to diversify the Company’s investment portfolio… a portion of our cash or future debt and equity issuances may be invested in Bitcoin. We have not set a maximum amount of Bitcoin we may accumulate, and may sell any Bitcoin we may acquire.” The company also says it plans to shutter a “significant number” of store locations this year. Says the filing, “We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. This review, among other things, resulted in the closure of 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024. While this review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.” CNN reports that GameStop has already closed about 1,000 stores in the past year. Across the world, GameStop currently has 3,203 locations, down from 6,000 a decade ago. The US currently has 2,325 GameStop locations.

The announcement will arrive just days before the official rollout of Trump’s larger trade plan, the “reciprocal tariff” system, scheduled for April 2. Speaking Monday at a Cabinet meeting, Trump confirmed the auto tariffs would drop “fairly soon over the next few days, probably,” and made clear they would land before April 2, which he has repeatedly described as “reciprocal tariffs day.” The White House told reporters that today’s announcement is part of a broader trade overhaul targeting countries that apply import duties to U.S. goods. Trump pulls back on tough tariff language Trump has spent years teasing an aggressive approach to trade and said his team has been preparing a set of retaliatory tariffs that would hit nations taxing U.S. products. The plan, originally pitched as a country-by-country response, would match foreign duties and also respond to what Trump called “disfavored trade policies,” including value-added taxes (VATs), wage suppression, and currency manipulation. April 2 has been hyped repeatedly by Trump. He’s labeled it both “liberation day” and “the big one”—a reference to his long-standing promise to take direct action against what he claims are unfair trade practices. The reciprocal tariff plan was described as an attempt to level the playing field. But over the past several days, Trump and his team have taken a softer tone. Last Friday, Trump told reporters there “will be flexibility” in how the tariffs are applied. Then, during a Tuesday night interview with Newsmax, he stated, “I’ll probably be more lenient than reciprocal, because if I was reciprocal, that would be very tough for people.” He followed up with, “I know there are some exceptions, and it’s an ongoing discussion, but not too many, not too many exceptions.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent weighed in last week, confirming that some countries could avoid penalties if they pre-negotiate with the U.S. government before the April 2 deadline. The White House then told CNBC’s Eamon Javers that non-tariff barriers like VATs and currency manipulation will no longer factor into how tariff rates are calculated. That change marks a significant retreat from Trump’s earlier rhetoric, which promised a much stricter approach. VATs are consumption taxes collected at each stage of production and are common in many countries. Trump’s original plan involved retaliating against those as well, but that part of the policy has been dropped. The back-and-forth has created uncertainty among businesses and investors. Trump’s habit of making policy changes at the last minute—often through off-the-cuff remarks or late-night interviews—has made it hard for companies to prepare. Many are still unclear about which countries will face tariffs and how the exemptions will be handled. In recent weeks, the financial markets have responded with visible anxiety. On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that its index measuring consumer expectations on jobs, business, and income fell to a 12-year low. The drop comes amid increased fears of a global trade fight. The report shows that both consumers and businesses are growing concerned about the economic outlook. Stocks haven’t fared any better. The S&P 500 has fallen 3% over the past month. That dip pushed the index into correction territory, meaning it briefly dropped more than 10% below its most recent high, which was recorded in February. Analysts blame the tariff drama for fueling the decline. As today’s press conference approaches, the Trump administration has said little about the actual numbers behind the new auto tariffs. The White House has not confirmed which countries will be affected, how steep the duties will be, or whether any trading partners have already been granted exemptions. Leavitt told reporters only that “details will be provided during the president’s remarks.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

This ambitious project, which has been underway for nearly two years, marks a significant milestone for Celo (CELO) and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. The transition, culminating in a community vote in July 2024 after initiating in July 2023, positions Celo for enhanced scalability, faster transaction speeds, and reduced costs. Let’s dive into what this groundbreaking Celo Migration means for users and the future of decentralized applications. Understanding the Celo Migration to Ethereum Layer-2 For those unfamiliar, a Layer-2 network operates on top of an existing blockchain (Layer-1), like Ethereum. Think of it as an express lane on a highway, designed to alleviate traffic congestion and speed things up. In the context of blockchain, this means faster and cheaper transactions without compromising the security of the main chain. Celo’s decision to migrate to an Ethereum Layer-2 is a strategic move aimed at overcoming the scalability challenges that many blockchains face as adoption grows. Before settling on its final destination, Celo meticulously evaluated several leading L2 solutions. These included prominent names like Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and zkSync. This thorough review process underscores Celo’s commitment to selecting the best possible infrastructure for its community and future growth. Ultimately, Celo opted to build its L2 solution leveraging Optimism’s innovative OP Stack. Why OP Stack for the Blockchain Upgrade? So, why did Celo choose Optimism’s OP Stack for this crucial Blockchain Upgrade ? The answer lies in the power and flexibility of the OP Stack. OP Stack is Optimism’s open-source, modular development framework. It empowers developers to launch their own custom-built L2 networks on Ethereum. This modularity is a key advantage, allowing Celo to tailor its L2 solution to its specific needs and optimize performance. Here’s a breakdown of why OP Stack stood out: Open-Source and Community-Driven: OP Stack is built on open-source principles, fostering transparency and community involvement in its development and evolution. Modular Architecture: The modular design allows for customization and upgrades of individual components without disrupting the entire network. Optimism Proven Technology: Built by the team behind Optimism, a successful and established L2, OP Stack benefits from proven technology and expertise. Ethereum Alignment: OP Stack is deeply aligned with Ethereum’s roadmap, ensuring future compatibility and leveraging Ethereum’s robust security. Unlocking Crypto Scalability: Benefits for Celo Users The transition to an Ethereum L2 powered by OP Stack unlocks significant benefits, primarily focused on enhancing Crypto Scalability . For Celo users, this translates into a dramatically improved experience. Let’s explore the key advantages: Benefit Description Faster Transactions Layer-2 networks are designed to process transactions much faster than Layer-1. Users will experience significantly quicker transaction confirmation times on the upgraded Celo network. Lower Transaction Fees One of the most compelling advantages of L2s is reduced transaction costs. By offloading transaction processing from the main Ethereum chain, Celo can offer substantially lower gas fees, making the network more accessible and affordable. Enhanced User Experience Faster and cheaper transactions contribute to a smoother and more user-friendly experience for everyone interacting with the Celo blockchain, from sending payments to using decentralized applications (dApps). Increased Network Capacity The upgraded Celo network will be able to handle a significantly higher volume of transactions, paving the way for greater adoption and more complex decentralized applications. The Journey of Celo Migration: A Two-Year Endeavor The completion of the Celo Migration is not an overnight achievement. It represents the culmination of nearly two years of dedicated effort, planning, and community collaboration. Starting in July 2023, the Celo team embarked on a comprehensive evaluation process, meticulously analyzing different L2 solutions and engaging with the community every step of the way. The community vote in July 2024 served as a crucial validation point, demonstrating strong support for the migration and highlighting the decentralized governance that underpins the Celo ecosystem. This phased approach, from initial exploration to community consensus and finally, technical implementation, underscores Celo’s commitment to a secure and well-considered transition. What Does This Mean for the Future? Celo’s successful migration to an Ethereum L2 network marks a pivotal moment for the project and sets a powerful example for other blockchains seeking to scale. By leveraging the OP Stack, Celo is not only enhancing its own capabilities but also contributing to the growth and interoperability of the broader Ethereum ecosystem. This Blockchain Upgrade positions Celo as a more competitive and user-friendly platform for decentralized applications, particularly in areas like mobile-first DeFi and real-world asset tokenization. The enhanced Crypto Scalability and reduced transaction costs are expected to attract more developers and users to the Celo ecosystem, fostering innovation and driving further adoption. As Celo continues to build on this new foundation, the future looks incredibly bright for this mobile-first blockchain and its community. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Scalable Blockchain Technology Celo’s completion of its migration to an Ethereum Layer-2 network is a bold and transformative step. By embracing Optimism’s OP Stack, Celo has not only addressed its scalability challenges but has also positioned itself at the forefront of blockchain innovation. This strategic move promises to deliver faster, cheaper, and more accessible transactions, paving the way for wider adoption and a thriving ecosystem of decentralized applications. The two-year journey underscores the commitment and vision of the Celo team and community, signaling a new era of growth and opportunity for the Celo blockchain and the broader crypto space.

Growth in decentralized exchanges will be driven by new purpose-tailored platforms, such as exchanges for stablecoins pegged to different underlying fiat currencies, thus solving the foreign exchange problem in stable tokens, Egorov said in an interview with Cointelegraph. The Curve founder added: ""Exchanges between stablecoins of different denominations like the Euro, US dollar, and others are not yet properly solved. How to provide liquidity without losing money, but while earning a lot of money, is kind of an open question that I think will be solved soon."" The number of centralized and decentralized stablecoin offerings will also grow as financial institutions and blockchain developers create new alternatives, Egorov said. However, the regulatory landscape must catch up with the pace of innovation in the DeFi sector, and financial regulators are still using laws designed for the legacy system established in the 20th century, he said. DEX volume surged to new heights in the first several months of 2025. Source: DeFiLlama Related: DeFi lender Nostra pauses borrowing after price feed error US lawmakers vote to kill DeFi broker rule Lawmakers in the United States recently voted to repeal the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) regulation requiring decentralized finance platforms and protocols to report financial information to the government agency. On March 4, the US Senate passed a resolution repealing the IRS broker rule in a 70 to 27 vote, which was followed by the US House of Representatives voting to kill the IRS rule on March 11. The resolution will need to pass another Senate vote before being sent to President Donald Trump, who has signaled he’d support it. A report titled The State of Stablecoins 2025: Supply, Adoption & Market Trends from Dune Analytics and onchain analysis firm Artemis shows that stablecoin adoption surged by 53% year-over-year. Stablecoins hit a market cap of over $227 billion.

The move comes as the firm reported improved quarterly earnings, with net income more than doubling in the fourth quarter of 2024. Quarterly Profits Show Gains The Texas-based company announced on March 25 that its board has “unanimously approved an update to its investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.” In its latest fiscal filing , the firm disclosed that it will use a portion of its cash reserves or proceeds from future debt or equity issuances to invest in the number one cryptocurrency. However, the document did not specify the maximum amount it intends to allocate. This decision follows a social media post by CEO Ryan Cohen last month, in which he shared a picture of himself with prominent Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, fueling speculation about potential crypto involvement. GameStop’s latest report also reflected an improvement in its earnings performance. The company revealed a rise in last year’s fourth-quarter profit, with net income more than doubling to $131.3 million compared to $63.1 million during the same period in 2023. This performance was due to cost-cutting measures as the firm continues to address a slow turnaround in its core business of retailing video game hardware and merchandise. The outfit had previously expanded into digital services by offering crypto wallets that allowed users to manage their crypto and NFTs. However, it shut down the service in 2023, citing “regulatory uncertainty” in the industry. Shares Rise 8.27% in After-Hours Trading Reacting to the development, Google Finance data shows that GameStop shares rose to $27.50, reflecting an 8.27% increase in after-hours trading. The stock has also recorded a 63.87% increase over the past 12 months. The video game retailer is taking a similar approach to software company MicroStrategy, now called Strategy, which has invested billions in Bitcoin over the years to establish itself as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Other firms that have incorporated the flagship cryptocurrency into their treasury strategies include video-sharing platform Rumble , which plans on investing up to $20 million, and Japanese firm Metaplanet , now the biggest corporate BTC holder in Asia. Bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms and medical technology firm Semler Scientific have also joined the wave. Meanwhile, last week, Strategy announced plans to bid 5 million shares of its Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (PSPS) through a public offering, with proceeds directed toward further Bitcoin acquisitions. As of March 2025, the company holds approximately 506,137 BTC, valued at around $44 billion at current market prices.

According to a March 26 announcement, the platform has added Solana ( SOL ), Cardano ( ADA ), XRP ( XRP ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) for trading. The four coins have a combined market capitalization of $267.2 billion at this writing. The additions double Interactive’s crypto offerings to traders. Since 2021, it has enabled trading in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), Litecoin ( LTC ), and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) pairs. Both trading and custody services will be provided through Paxos Trust Company or Zero Hash LLC. Zero Hash said in a press release that as of June 2024, it had processed $20 billion in transactions across 200 countries. Financial firms have been expanding crypto token offerings. On March 25, Nubank announced the addition of ADA, Near Protocol ( NEAR ), Cosmos ( ATOM ), and Algorand ( ALGO ) to its over 100 million clients in Latin America . US exchange Kraken has been steadily adding memecoins for a number of months, while Binance introduced a way for community members to vote on the listing and delisting of tokens . Amidst an increasingly competitive crypto market, Interactive Brokers is promising low transaction fees — 0.12% to 0.18% per transaction value with a minimum of $1.75 per trade. The brokerage still faces competition from exchanges that offer “pro” platforms with similar charges.

Data shows Ether has underperformed the altcoin market by 14% over the past 30 days, leading traders to question whether the altcoin can regain bullish momentum and which factors might drive a trend reversal. Ether/USD (left) vs. total altcoin capitalization, USD (right). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Ether appears well-positioned to attract institutional demand and significantly reduce the FUD that has limited its upside potential. Critics have long argued that the Ethereum ecosystem lags behind competitors in overall user experience and still offers limited base-layer scalability, which has negatively impacted network fees and transaction efficiency. Will the Ethereum Pectra upgrade impact ETH price? Many of the Ethereum network’s challenges are expected to be addressed in the upcoming Pectra network upgrade , scheduled for late April or early June. Among the proposed changes is a doubling of the data that can be included in each block, which should help lower fees for rollups and privacy-focused mechanisms. Additionally, the cost of call data will increase, encouraging developers to adopt blobs—a more efficient method for data storage. Another notable improvement in the upcoming upgrade is the introduction of smart accounts , which allow wallets to function like smart contracts during transactions. This enables gas fee sponsorship, passkey authentication, and batch transactions. Additionally, several other enhancements focus on optimizing staking deposits and withdrawals, providing greater flexibility, and extending block history for smart contracts that rely on past data. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, set a $5,000 price target for ETH on March 25, stating that it should significantly outperform competitor Solana ( SOL ). Source: CryptoHayes Regardless of the rationale behind Arthur’s price prediction, ETH options traders do not share the same bullish sentiment. The Sept. 26 call (buy) option with a $5,000 strike price costs only $35.40, implying extremely low odds. However, Ethereum remains the undisputed leader in smart contract deposits and is the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, currently holding $8.9 billion in assets under management. Ethereum TVL growth and reduced ETH supply on exchanges Ethereum’s network boasts a total value locked (TVL) of $52.5 billion, significantly surpassing Solana’s $7 billion. More importantly, deposits on the Ethereum network grew 10% over the past 30 days, reaching 25.4 million ETH, while Solana saw an 8% decline over the same period. Notable highlights on Ethereum include Sky (formerly Maker), which saw a 17% increase in deposits, and Ethena, whose TVL surged by 38% in 30 days. Ether balance on exchanges, ETH. Source: Glassnode The Ether supply on exchanges stood at 16.9 million ETH on March 25, just 3.5% above its five-year low of 16.32 million ETH, according to Glassnode data. This trend suggests that investors are withdrawing from exchanges, signaling a long-term capital commitment. Similarly, flows into spot Ether ETFs remained relatively muted on March 24 and March 25, in contrast to the $316 million in net outflows accumulated since March 10. Related: Ethereum devs prepare final Pectra test before mainnet launch Lastly, the Ethereum network is gaining momentum in the Real World Asset (RWA) industry, particularly after the BlackRock BUILD fund surpassed $1.5 billion in capitalization. The Ethereum ecosystem, including its layer-2 scalability solutions, accounts for over 80% of this market, according to RWA.XYZ data, underscoring Ethereum’s dominance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Ether’s price drop below $1,900 on March 10 likely reflected overly bearish expectations. However, the tide appears to have turned as the Ethereum network demonstrated resilience, and traders continued to withdraw from exchanges, setting the stage for a potential rally toward $2,500.

While some investors see this as a bold but feasible forecast, others remain skeptical, waiting for market confirmations. As of report time, XRP is trading at approximately $2.38, marking a 2.73% decline in 24 hours. The asset has fluctuated between an intraday high of $2.48 and a low of $2.39, reflecting a consolidation phase after recent volatility. Breakout within 1 week.

Several crypto analysts have weighed in on XRP’s price action, offering both technical and historical perspectives : EGRAG Crypto : This analyst draws comparisons to XRP’s legendary 2017 breakout , which saw a 1,273% price explosion. If history repeats itself, XRP could indeed reach $5.30 or higher shortly. World of Charts: According to this analysis, XRP is approaching a key resistance level at $2.60. A clean breakout above this zone could open the doors for a push toward $3.50, a significant milestone. Dark Defender: Taking a bullish stance, Dark Defender predicts that XRP will not only break past $3 but also sustain levels above it, reinforcing upward momentum. What’s Fueling the XRP Breakout Speculation? Several factors support the bullish outlook for XRP: Technical Indicators: Analysts have identified bullish formations, including symmetrical triangles and flag patterns, both of which traditionally signal potential price surges. Regulatory Clarity: Positive legal developments—especially regarding the SEC lawsuit —could boost investor confidence and increase market demand. Market Sentiment: A rise in active addresses and trading volume suggests growing interest in XRP, often a precursor to significant price movements.

External Factors: Regulatory shifts, macroeconomic trends, and technological developments could impact XRP’s trajectory. Investment Strategy: Investors should conduct independent research, consider multiple perspectives, and seek financial advice before making decisions. CryptoBull’s $5.30 price target for XRP has generated widespread discussion, with various analysts backing the possibility of a major breakout. While technical indicators and market sentiment are encouraging, the unpredictability of the crypto market means investors should stay informed, exercise caution, and adapt to changing conditions. Will XRP truly break past its consolidation and reach $5.30? The coming days will be crucial in determining whether this bullish prediction holds weight.

Shares of crypto miners Bitfarms, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Marathon Digital and Riot dropped between 4% and 12% in tandem with the news, the data showed. The stock price retrenchments highlight cryptocurrency miners’ increased dependence on business from artificial intelligence models after the Bitcoin network’s April 2024 “halving” cut into mining revenues. CORZ intraday performance on the Nasdaq. Source: Google Finance Miners are “diversifying into AI data-center hosting as a way to expand revenue and repurpose existing infrastructure for high-performance computing,” Coin Metrics said in a March report. For example, in June 2024, Core Scientific pledged 200 megawatts of hardware capacity to support CoreWeave’s artificial intelligence workloads. In August 2024, asset manager VanEck said Bitcoin mining stocks could collectively see a roughly $37 billion bump to market capitalizations if they invest heavily in supporting AI. Nevertheless, miners have struggled this year as declining crypto prices worsen pressures on businesses already impacted by April’s halving, JPMorgan said in March. Waning demand for AI data centers could add further strain. Bitcoin miners could see gains in valuation from pivoting to AI. Source: VanEck Related: Bet more on the Bitcoin miners cashing in on AI Cutting back on compute On March 26, analysts at TD Cowen said Microsoft had abandoned plans to build several new data centers that would have generated some 2 gigawatts of power, according to Bloomberg. The analysts reportedly attributed Microsoft’s pullback to a perceived oversupply of computing capacity for AI models, as well as the tech giant’s decision to forgo some planned collaborations with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. In the past six months, Microsoft has canceled various data center leases and delayed plans to onboard more capacity, according to Bloomberg. Microsoft’s data center investments are expected to slow further in the second half of 2025 as the company finishes $80 billion in planned buildouts and pivots to outfitting existing centers with hardware and equipment, Bloomberg said.

Since its debut, the iShares Bitcoin Trust has accumulated nearly $51 billion in assets under management. BlackRock Brings Bitcoin ETP to Europe’s $13.6B ETP Market The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IBIT) started trading on March 25 on Xetra, and Euronext Paris under the “IBIT” ticker and on Euronext Amsterdam under “BTCN”. “Each ETP security corresponds to a specific amount of Bitcoin,” a prospectus on the iShares website reads. The new Bitcoin product features a temporary waiver of 10 basis points, reducing its fee to 0.15% until the end of this year. This marks BlackRock’s first major step to expand its crypto ETP product range outside the United States after the success of the spot Bitcoin ETF. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of iShares Product for Europe and the Middle East, told Bloomberg : “[This launch] reflects what really could be seen as a tipping point in the industry — the combination of established demand from retail investors with more professionals now really getting into the fold.” America’s leading exchange, Coinbase, will custody the digital assets for BlackRock’s new product in cold storage. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the fund’s administrator. IBIT is currently the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF, holding roughly $50.7 billion in net assets, accounting for about 2.73% of the top crypto’s total supply. When it was rolled out in January last year, it quickly garnered investor attention and began drawing in billions of dollars in investments. While there have been ETPs linked to cryptocurrencies already trading in Europe for several years, the local market is considerably smaller compared to the U.S. — $13.6 billion versus $105 billion assets under management. The largest crypto ETP in Europe is currently managed by CoinShares International Ltd, with $1.3 billion under management and a 0.25% fee. This makes BlackRock’s Europe ETP much cheaper while the waiver is in place.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Blackrock|Europe,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-26 19:20:12

The situation, confirmed during a White House press briefing on Wednesday afternoon, involves Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and others who discussed airstrike plans in a private Signal thread that accidentally included The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg. Goldberg received the real-time messages and later published them, triggering backlash across the government. During the press briefing, Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary, was asked whether anyone would be fired over the leak. She dodged the question. “What I can say definitively is what I just spoke to the president about, and he continues to have confidence in his national security team,” she said . The group chat in question contained detailed discussions about U.S. military operations against Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, including exact timing, weapons, and aircraft involved. The screenshots, published by The Atlantic , revealed that the administration used a nonsecure messaging app to share information that many defense officials have described as highly sensitive. In one of the leaked texts, Pete wrote that F-18s and drones would begin a strike at 2:10 p.m., and listed the types of missiles that would be used. In another message, Mike told the group that the airstrike had apparently taken out “the top missile guy” for the Houthis. He added that there were “multiple positive ID,” which suggested U.S. intelligence had successfully used either humans or tech to locate the targets. The messages also showed back-and-forth between Trump officials over trade benefits for Europe, discussed openly in the same thread. Leaked messages reveal strike details and trigger Senate hearings The Atlantic said on Wednesday that it published the messages because the White House was trying to spin the incident. The outlet wrote, “There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared.” Although not every message was made public, most were released in screenshot form. The one name left out was a CIA intelligence officer who serves as the chief of staff to CIA Director John Ratcliffe. But even without that, the content still triggered internal fallout. Some defense officials told The Atlantic that Pete’s texts were “reckless and dangerous.” The piece, co-written by Goldberg and Shane Harris, warned that the specifics could have compromised the safety of U.S. pilots if they had fallen into hostile hands. “If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests—or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media—the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds,” Goldberg and Harris wrote. “The consequences for American pilots could have been catastrophic.” The fallout led to hearings before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, where Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard were questioned by lawmakers. When asked whether specific times or weapons were discussed in the chat, Tulsi responded that she could not recall. Meanwhile, inside the White House, officials were unsure how to proceed. Some began questioning Mike’s cleanup approach, saying it was creating more problems for Trump. In an interview Tuesday night, Trump defended Mike. “Michael Waltz has learned a lesson and he’s a good man,” he said. But Trump said nothing about Pete or JD. Meanwhile, pressure was mounting on multiple fronts. Sen. Mark Kelly posted that Pete should resign. “The Signal incident is what happens when you have the most unqualified Secretary of Defense we’ve ever seen,” he said. “We’re lucky it didn’t cost any servicemembers their lives, but for the safety of our military and our country, Secretary Hegseth needs to resign.” Trump allies downplay scandal while lawmakers demand resignations Mike responded publicly on X on Wednesday, posting: “No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE: President Trump is protecting America and our interests.” JD also spoke out. “It’s very clear Goldberg oversold what he had,” he said. “But one thing in particular really stands out. Remember when he was attacking Ratcliffe for blowing the cover for a CIA agent? Turns out Ratcliffe was simply naming his chief of staff.” Tom Cotton, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also defended the administration, saying The Atlantic exaggerated. “The description of the conversation as ‘war plans’ is an embellishment and exaggeration by known left-wing partisan opponents of the president,” he said. “What I think is most important here is not the way this information was communicated, but the actions that were taken to actually attack the rebels.” Despite the defenses, several top Democrats called for immediate resignations. That included House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Whip Katherine Clark, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Sen. Mark Warner, and Rep. Don Beyer, all of whom demanded that Pete and others be removed. As the situation spiraled, Trump officials tried to shift the conversation. Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich, along with the Pentagon’s rapid response account on X, focused on the wording in The Atlantic ’s follow-up article. They pointed out that the publication had changed “war plans” to “attack plans” in its headline. That edit did nothing to slow down the scrutiny or the growing number of demands for firings. The Senate Armed Services Committee announced Tuesday that it would investigate how the chat ended up in Goldberg’s hands in the first place. The White House has not identified who added the journalist to the Signal group. But the mistake created a direct pipeline from the Pentagon to the press, giving The Atlantic access to internal war discussions in real time. Trump’s team is now trying to assess the damage while deciding who, if anyone, will be held responsible. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Users should verify accounts, avoid suspicious links, and report scams to protect the community. Watch Out The second-largest meme coin in terms of market capitalization – Shiba Inu (SHIB) – has emerged into a complex ecosystem in the past few years , while its community has reached multi-million members. However, some newcomers have little-to-no experience with the crypto world, making them perfect prey for fraudsters. Earlier today (March 26), the team behind Shibarium Trustwatch warned people that scammers have created fake profiles on X to deceive with “promises of giveaways, exclusive content, or investment opportunities.” The team revealed that LUCIE – the pseudonymous marketing strategist of Shibarium – is among the targets, with wrongdoers mimicking their X account. However, a quick look shows that the number of followers is 0, meaning people should have serious doubts. In comparison, LUCIE’s official account on X has more than 165,000 subscribers. Shibarium Trustwatch advised the SHIB Army to check for verification badges and trusted announcements to protect themselves. It also urged people never to click on suspicious links or share personal details online and to report and block fraudulent accounts immediately to safeguard the entire community. Previous Alerts The team issued a similar warning nearly a month ago. Back then, Shibarium Trustwatch cautioned users to stay away from a fake X account pretending to be the official one of the meme coin project. “This account is NOT official. Always verify the handle and followers. Stay safe! Stay vigilant,” the message reads. Towards the end of last year, the team claimed that malicious actors had misused the name of Shytoshi Kusama – the former lead developer behind Shiba Inu – to advertise fake tokens in fraudulent online groups. The community is urged to avoid interacting with these deceptive individuals and to refrain from sharing any personal details. It is worth mentioning that Kusama has been suspiciously quiet on X in the past several weeks. Not long ago, LUCIE explained this was normal since the former lead developer had taken an ambassador role. Many users appreciated the information, with some expecting “groundbreaking” partnerships for Shiba Inu once Kusama resurfaces.

This partnership is a big milestone, as Bitget is the first trading platform to sponsor a team in this racing series. The Porsche Cup Brazil, Latin America’s largest Grand Touring race, will begin its season in April 2025. Bitget Brings Crypto Into Motorsport As announced in a press release, Sampaio’s Porsche 911 GT3 Cup will be painted in Bitget’s signature black and cyan blue. By displaying its logo on the car, Bitget hopes to attract the attention of motorsport fans and potential crypto investors. Flávio Sampaio is also excited about the partnership. He believes motorsport and crypto have a lot in common, as both attract passionate people about technology, risk-taking, and high performance. He hopes to bring more fans into the crypto world as he joins forces with Bitget. Bitget Token Sees an Increase in Value Following the sponsorship announcement, Bitget’s native token, BGB, has seen a price increase. In the last 24 hours, the token skyrocketed by more than 2%, reaching a high of $5.09. Over the past week, BGB has increased 8.14%, while its daily trading volume has jumped by 34.4% to nearly $148 million. This growth shows that more people are interested in the exchange, especially with its new presence in motorsports. Bitget has made significant efforts to streamline its operations and boost its utility. Last December, the trading platform merged Bitget Wallet Token (BWB) with its native token BGB . This move was to create a unique token that bridges centralized and decentralized crypto platforms. Bitget Sees Growth Opportunity in Brazil Bitget CEO, Gracy Chen believes this sponsorship will help more people in Brazil learn about crypto. The Porsche Cup Brazil usually attracts a huge audience, making it a great way to introduce digital assets to new users. Brazil has become a major player in the crypto space . Recent data revealed that the country has the second-highest crypto transaction volume in Latin America, with Argentina in first place. The Brazilian government has embraced crypto and blockchain innovations and is working to make digital assets a bigger part of daily life. Officials have proposed a bill that would allow employees to receive up to 50% of their salary in crypto.

Early Wednesday, it climbed over 13% to tap $0.00001564 and extend its weekly gains. Despite the prior stagnation, several underlying factors suggest the asset may be gearing up for an even larger breakout. One of the most compelling signals comes from CryptoQuant data, which reveals a sharp decline in SHIB’s exchange reserves. At the start of 2025, centralized exchanges held roughly 135.3 trillion SHIB tokens. That number has since plummeted to just 96 trillion, indicating a shift toward accumulation and a significant reduction in selling pressure. Notably, a dwindling exchange supply is often seen as a bullish indicator, reinforcing the idea that investors are opting to store their holdings rather than liquidate them, a sign of growing confidence in SHIB’s long-term potential . Moreover, onchain data also shows an explosive growth of ShibaSwap, the ecosystem’s decentralized exchange. Over the past week, trading volume on the platform has surged by around 245%, reaching $10.09 million and outpacing key competitors like PancakeSwap and Hashflow. The platform’s total value locked has also skyrocketed from $2.98 million in February to $68 million, with liquidity pools expanding significantly as more participants contribute to the ecosystem. That said, with exchange reserves drying up and on-chain activity accelerating, analysts are also turning increasingly bullish. On Tuesday analyst CryptoELITES pointed to the formation of a classic cup-and-handle pattern, historically a strong indicator of massive upside potential. According to the pundit’s analysis, SHIB could rally 12,000% from current levels, reaching a target of $0.0001831. He believes key resistance points, particularly around $0.00003117 and $0.00008717, will play a crucial role in determining whether this breakout materializes. Notably, Lucie, Shiba Inu’s lead market strategist, agreed with CryptoELITES’ analysis, suggesting that SHIB’s upside potential could extend even further. Elsewhere, analyst Javon Marks echoed these projections, suggesting SHIB could climb to $0.0001553 based on Fibonacci extension levels. He noted that despite the asset already showing signs of strength, its current breakout structure leaves room for a much larger move. A run toward $0.000081, in his view , would represent a 415% gain, with even higher targets in play if momentum continues. That said, with technical indicators aligning, exchange supply tightening, and ecosystem growth accelerating, SHIB appears poised for an explosive move. At press time, the token was trading at $0.00001423, reflecting a 4.65% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,SHIB|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-26 19:26:29

Gracy slammed the platform’s response in a scathing statement, calling it “immature, unethical and unprofessional.” Hyperliquid, which presents itself as an innovative decentralized exchange, has come under fire for its operational practices that are similar to offshore centralized exchanges (CEX). The crux of the debate revolves around Hyperliquid’s decision to halt trading of JELLY and force positions to be closed at a price favorable to the exchange. Gracy argues that such actions set a dangerous precedent and erode user trust, which is a key element for any exchange, centralized or decentralized. Beyond the JELLY incident, Gracy pointed out fundamental flaws in Hyperliquid's product design: Mixed vaults: These expose users to systemic risks by mixing different assets together without adequate risk separation. Unrestricted position sizes: This feature leaves the platform vulnerable to price manipulation and utilitarian trading strategies. Gracy warns that if these issues are not addressed, more altcoins could be weaponized against Hyperliquid, potentially leading to its downfall. The recent JELLY attack on Hyperliquid involved a sophisticated trading strategy that could have resulted in over $10 million in losses for the platform. Here is a step-by-step analysis: The attacker (0xde95) opened a large short position in JELLY perpetual futures, predicting that the price will fall. Simultaneously, they purchased JELLY spot tokens on-chain to artificially inflate the spot price. Related News: Veteran Analyst il Capo Expects a 50 Percent Rally in One Altcoin and a Pump, Then a Dump in Another The attacker triggered a self-liquidation by intentionally removing margin from the short position. Since Hyperliquid’s HLP acted as a counterparty during liquidations, it took over the attacker’s massive short position (~$4.5 million). The attacker continued to buy spot JELLY, pushing the price even higher. HLP’s acquired short position lost value. A parallel long position was opened by a second wallet. JELLY’s low liquidity amplified the price action, making HLP’s losses even more severe. Small on-chain purchases pushed the price up disproportionately, pushing HLP’s losses to over $10 million. Hyperliquid closed its short position just in time, delisted JELLY and closed with a profit of approximately $700,000. *This is not investment advice.

With the market seeing some downward pressure, BNB’s price has been fluctuating within a tight range, creating uncertainty among holders. Moreover, accusations of market manipulation involving Binance have further complicated the situation, leading to increased concerns among investors. Binance Alleged Role in Market Manipulation The recent decline in BNB’s price comes amid Binance accusation of orchestrating a price manipulation attack on the HyperLiquid platform, leading to concerns about its market practices. According to reports, Binance was allegedly linked to aggressive trading tactics used to manipulate the price of the memecoin JELLYJELLY. Lookonchain reported a massive whale investor who utilized 124.6M $JELLY tokens (worth $4.85M) to manipulate JELLYJELLY memecoin price on the Solana blockchain. When the whale made its large $JELLY dump the token’s price plummeted and forced HyperLiquid’s liquidity provider (HLP) to absorb a passive short position worth $15.3M (398M $JELLY). The whale acquired $JELLY tokens after the price collapse, which restored market value but cost HyperLiquid nearly $12 million. This has drawn comparisons to the FTX collapse, as both scenarios involve large exchanges potentially using liquidity to target competitors. The funds used to open $JELLY (jellyjelly) positions and attack #Hyperliquid were withdrawn from #OKX and #Binance . https://t.co/X3bgxk1IQx pic.twitter.com/DU8WshGcoz — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 26, 2025 A blockchain analysis conducted by Zachxbt discovered that Binance wallets provided funds which were used for the JELLYJELLY price manipulation activities. Binance’s quick expansion of JELLYJELLY contracts raised suspicions of deliberate damage to its rival, HyperLiquid, through trading market manipulation. According to X user MartyParty Binance’s decision to list perpetual JELLYJELLY contracts constitutes a strategic move that intensifies market pressure against HyperLiquid. Binance Employee Suspended Over Insider Trading Allegations Binance remains under intense negative scrutiny as its platform experiences multiple internal operational challenges. A Binance employee received a suspension after being accused of conducting trades using confidential company information to gain a personal advantage. The employee utilized sensitive information from their BNB Chain employment to acquire tokens before the public launch, which resulted in a profit after the price increase. Binance took rapid steps by suspending the employee followed by verification that no additional insider trading activities existed inside their organization. The employee’s actions have created doubts about Binance’s operational integrity because they are linked to market manipulation claims. This scandal resulted in more market doubts about Binance’s business operations, even though the company took appropriate measures to handle the issue. BNB Price At Risk As Death Cross Emerges BNB price action remains confined by narrow trading boundaries under $600 support and $672.5 resistance levels. During the previous few months the Binance coin demonstrated reduced price movements as it maintained its position between established support and resistance markers. The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) currently holds a price value of $619 while remaining under the 200-day SMA standing at $630. When the 50-day SMA drops beneath the 200-day SMA it creates a pattern known as a “Death Cross.” The formation of this pattern points to deteriorating short-term market strength which indicates additional Binance coin decreases might occur. At press time, BNB price was trading at $620, a 2% decline from the intra-day high of $634 and 21% down from its all time high of $793 hit in December last year. BNB/USD 1-day price chart (Source: TradingView) The Relative Strength Index holds a value of 54.07 which points to a market condition that remains neutral. The RSI reading indicates the Binance coin price is currently not in either the overbought or oversold phase, but further bearish sentiment might emerge if the indicator falls. A drop of the RSI value below 30 indicates market oversaturation which introduces a risk of further BNB price decline . A rise in the RSI does indicate potential market recovery, but the current negative sentiment about Binance, together with recent allegations, opposes bullish momentum.

Could Bitcoin mining turn unused hydropower into a lifeline for local economic revival? Table of Contents Zengamina’s dimming vision finds a spark Gridless rigs offer a plug-and-play fix The fine line between boost and burden Can this model scale? Zengamina’s dimming vision finds a spark In the remote Ikelenge district of northwestern Zambia, a small hydroelectric plant has quietly been producing more electricity than its surrounding villages could ever use. Built in the early 2010s with $3 million in charitable funding, the 1-megawatt Zengamina facility was never intended to generate profit. Its purpose was to power a rural hospital, provide electricity to homes and schools, and support the foundations of local development. For years, however, much of that electricity went unused. With a population of around 15,000 and minimal commercial or industrial activity, the community lacked the infrastructure to absorb the surplus. As a result, more than half of the plant’s output was routinely diverted—sent back into the river, effectively wasted. By 2022, the project was facing mounting challenges. Planned expansions were on hold, revenue had slipped below breakeven, and the vision of broader energy access was fading. Then, a new partner arrived with an unconventional solution. Gridless, a Nairobi-based Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining startup, deployed a mobile unit to the Zengamina site—essentially a shipping container equipped with 120 ASIC mining machines. Connected directly to the local mini-grid, the setup runs continuously, consuming excess power that would otherwise go unused. In doing so, it converts stranded electricity into a stream of Bitcoin. At prevailing market rates, each machine generates approximately $5 per day, though returns fluctuate with the price of Bitcoin and mining difficulty . Gridless shares a portion of this revenue with the hydro plant, now contributing close to a third of Zengamina’s total income. This financial boost has had practical effects. Electricity tariffs have dropped, new households have been connected, and the plant is now operating closer to its full capacity—serving the community more effectively than before. Still, a broader question remains: is this a one-off success, or could this model offer a scalable path for rural electrification in regions where conventional economic incentives are lacking? Let’s dig in. Gridless rigs offer a plug-and-play fix Zengamina isn’t an isolated case. Across sub-Saharan Africa , small-scale energy projects often run into the same problem: plenty of power, not enough people to use it. Mini-grids—typically built with donor funding or development grants—frequently operate below capacity, not because they fail to generate electricity, but because there’s no industrial base to absorb it. According to the African Minigrid Developers Association, more than 65% of these systems remain commercially unviable, sustained by subsidies, carbon credits, or philanthropic capital. Gridless is trying to make that model work without external lifelines. The company has installed mobile Bitcoin mining units at six hydro sites across Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia—each one selected for its ability to produce clean energy in areas where demand is too low to support the infrastructure on its own. The mining rigs act as a kind of financial shock absorber: they operate continuously, regardless of when or how much electricity the local community consumes, and convert otherwise-wasted energy into revenue from day one. At Zengamina, the results have been immediate. With a stable offtaker in place, the plant has expanded coverage, reduced tariffs, and extended service into new parts of the community. Small businesses—including barbershops, kiosks, and internet cafés—are staying open later. Internet connectivity has improved. Electricity access has gone from symbolic to functional. Importantly, the arrangement was never meant to be permanent. Gridless views itself as a transitional player. As household and commercial demand picks up, its role winds down. Zengamina expects to connect to Zambia’s national grid within the next year, opening the door to better pricing through utility partnerships. When that happens, the mining rig will be removed, and Gridless will redeploy elsewhere. The fine line between boost and burden Gridless is now seeking capital to develop its own small-scale hydroelectric projects, with a focus on run-of-river systems that do not require dams and can operate in remote, off-grid environments. The company’s approach is to integrate Bitcoin mining from the outset—using it as an initial revenue stream while local energy demand gradually takes shape. Co-founder Janet Maingi describes this as a “consumer-driven, adaptive energy model,” one designed to begin with mining but ultimately transition toward long-term community electrification. There is evidence to suggest that the model could scale. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that Africa holds over 300 gigawatts of untapped hydropower potential, much of it located in areas with limited industrial activity—regions typically overlooked by traditional energy investors. In such environments, Bitcoin miners could serve as early offtakers, monetizing power infrastructure before broader economic demand materializes. However, the concept is not without controversy. Some policymakers across the continent have expressed concern that mining could eventually compete with local users for electricity, especially if Bitcoin prices surge and miners become more aggressive in securing low-cost power. These concerns are not merely theoretical. In 2021, Kazakhstan experienced significant disruptions after a wave of miners arrived following China’s crypto ban. National electricity consumption rose sharply—by 7% in a few months—resulting in blackouts, higher energy prices, and, ultimately, government intervention. Similar issues have emerged in parts of the United States. In New York and Texas, regulators have taken steps to limit large-scale mining operations during periods of high grid demand. Even smaller facilities have encountered pressure. In early 2024, Greenidge Generation—a gas-powered mining plant in upstate New York—was temporarily shut down during a cold spell to free up capacity for residential heating. The incident prompted regulatory agencies to begin drafting guidelines on when and how miners should reduce activity during energy shortages. Gridless maintains that its model avoids these risks. All of its operations are off-grid, powered by renewable sources, and developed in direct coordination with local communities. The company also states that residential and commercial users are always prioritized, and that mining is scaled back as local demand increases. Still, some observers note that market incentives can shift quickly. If Bitcoin prices rise dramatically—as some forecasts suggest—the financial appeal of mining could prompt even off-grid operators to favor crypto revenue over community supply. Without clear regulation or transparent agreements on power usage, the same approach that initially supports rural development could become a source of friction. Can this model scale? The results seen at Zengamina have begun to draw attention beyond Zambia. As global scrutiny over Bitcoin’s energy consumption grows, an increasing number of off-grid energy projects are exploring mining as a financial stabilizer—particularly in regions where electricity is available but remains underused. Off-grid mining, once considered niche or opportunistic, is gaining traction not only for its cleaner profile but also for its practical advantages: it enables miners to sidestep regulatory constraints, avoid peak-hour tariffs, and reduce exposure to political tensions tied to public grid infrastructure. Several real-world applications are emerging. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, a Bitcoin mining operation powered by Virunga National Park’s hydro plant is helping to fund conservation efforts and support park operations. In Ethiopia, the government has approved electricity sales from the Grand Renaissance Dam to industrial mining companies as a way to monetize excess capacity and manage debt burdens. Similar activity is underway in Paraguay and Suriname, where hydroelectric generation continues to exceed domestic demand. In such cases, the incentive structure is aligned. Energy developers gain a consistent and immediate revenue stream, while miners access reliable, low-cost power. These arrangements typically require no subsidies and do not depend on large-scale transmission infrastructure. However, these outcomes are not guaranteed. They rely on clearly defined agreements—ensuring community access is prioritized, revenue-sharing is transparent, and provisions exist to exit mining operations when alternative uses for the energy arise. Gridless, for instance, plans to end its Zengamina operation once the plant connects to Zambia’s national grid, as selling electricity directly to the utility is expected to offer greater long-term returns. This phase-out is a core feature of the Gridless model. Mining serves as a temporary financial mechanism—bridging the gap until local demand matures. The equipment is portable and designed to be redeployed elsewhere once its purpose is fulfilled. What this suggests is not that Bitcoin mining resolves deeper energy challenges, but that under certain conditions, it can serve as a transitional tool—monetizing stranded or surplus power that might otherwise go unused. It provides a way to activate infrastructure rather than letting it sit idle. With Bitcoin now trading near $88,000 and mining profitability facing tighter margins worldwide, more companies are turning to remote locations in search of low-cost, regulation-light energy sources. In regions with available capacity but limited investment, this model could scale—quietly and pragmatically—if allowed the operational space to do so.",Feature|Africa|Bitcoin|Mining,EN,0,0,MINING|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-26 19:36:19

Over the years, ancient whales mostly become active after a major price uptick to maximize gains. These new fund movements can affect other whales, depending on the dominant market sentiment. Whale Moves 3000 BTC Data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence shows the dormant whale transferred 3,000 BTC worth approximately $250 million. The whale’s stash grew from $3M in 2017 to the present levels. This transfer led to heated debates on the asset’s direction in the coming weeks. “ $250M BITCOIN WHALE WAKES UP AFTER 8 YEARS. A Bitcoin Whale that has held BTC since late 2016 has just moved over $250M in BTC last night. His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today – and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years,” Arkham wrote on X. The move coincided with a 4.7% weekly uptick in Bitcoin’s price. For most holders, the whale might seek to sell assets following the recent price recovery. This month, Bitcoin and the wider crypto market have faced significant headwinds, plunging over 20%. This also sparked a similar reaction from other whales looking to secure previous gains. This year, the market has recorded an outflow of large holders, leading to a price drop from its all-time high above $108k to present levels. Traditionally, whale movements swing the market due to the size of their holdings. Present market forces also led to huge sales from Bitcoin miners plunging reserves . On the flipside, previous dormant whales have added to their holdings or repositioned assets. What’s Next For BTC Price? Recent activities around the leading crypto have triggered a 4% jump in the last seven days. After weeks of negative trading, bulls set their sights on a renewed surge past the $90k mark. According to Arkham, BlackRock accumulated over $100 million worth of Bitcoin without making a sale last week. Most institutional investors have also followed this trend. Furthermore, Michael Saylor’s Strategy bought 6,911 coins last week, surpassing 500,000 BTC in holdings. Most traders remain positive on the upward asset trajectory, citing recent developments from whales. The U.S. regulatory space marking a handful of pro-industry wins heightened bullish confidence in the market.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ARKM|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-26 19:39:43

You’re not alone. A recent report from financial giant UBS has flagged a potential headwind for the crypto market: the upcoming U.S. trade review. This isn’t just background noise; it could translate to real pressure on various digital currencies. Let’s dive into what this means for you and your crypto investments. Understanding the Looming Cryptocurrency Regulation Pressure The world of cryptocurrency operates in a relatively nascent regulatory landscape, and this is precisely where the potential pressure stems from. Governments globally are grappling with how to classify, oversee, and tax digital assets. The U.S., being a major economic power, holds significant sway in shaping global financial regulations. A U.S. trade review, while seemingly broad, can have specific implications for the cryptocurrency market, particularly concerning how digital assets are treated in international trade and financial flows. But why is a trade review relevant to cryptocurrencies? Here’s a breakdown: Cross-border Transactions: Cryptocurrencies, by their very nature, are designed for borderless transactions. A U.S. trade review could scrutinize how these cross-border crypto transactions are impacting trade balances and financial stability. Regulatory Harmonization: The review might push for greater harmonization of cryptocurrency regulations across different jurisdictions. This could lead to stricter compliance requirements for crypto exchanges and businesses operating in the U.S. or dealing with U.S. entities. National Security Concerns: Digital currencies, while offering innovation, also raise concerns about illicit activities and national security. A trade review could assess the risks associated with crypto’s use in money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions evasion, leading to potentially tighter controls. Economic Impact Assessment: The U.S. government will likely evaluate the broader economic impact of cryptocurrencies. This includes assessing their role in financial innovation, but also potential risks to traditional financial systems and consumer protection. UBS’s warning highlights that this review isn’t just an academic exercise; it’s a process that could result in concrete policy changes that directly affect the crypto market. For crypto investors, this means bracing for potential volatility and regulatory shifts. Why is Digital Currency Pressure Increasing Now? Several factors are converging to increase the regulatory scrutiny and potential pressure on digital currencies: Increased Market Size and Adoption: The cryptocurrency market has grown exponentially in recent years, attracting both retail and institutional investors. This increased prominence naturally draws greater attention from regulators. Financial Stability Concerns: Market volatility and interconnectedness with traditional finance are raising concerns about systemic risks. Regulators are keen to ensure that crypto doesn’t destabilize the broader financial system. Consumer Protection Imperatives: Scams, hacks, and market manipulation in the crypto space have highlighted the need for stronger consumer protection measures. Governments are under pressure to safeguard investors from these risks. Geopolitical Factors: In a world of increasing geopolitical tensions, control over financial flows and technological innovation is becoming more strategic. Nations are looking to establish their dominance in the digital asset space and mitigate risks associated with decentralized finance. These factors, combined with the U.S. trade review, create a perfect storm of regulatory pressure. It’s not necessarily about stifling innovation, but rather about creating a framework that balances innovation with stability and security. Navigating the Crypto Trade Review: What to Expect? While the exact outcomes of the U.S. trade review are uncertain, we can anticipate some potential scenarios and their implications for the crypto market: Potential Outcome Possible Impact on Crypto Stricter KYC/AML Regulations Increased compliance costs for exchanges, potentially impacting smaller platforms. May enhance investor confidence in the long run by reducing illicit activities. Taxation Clarity and Enforcement Greater clarity on how crypto is taxed could encourage wider adoption by removing uncertainty. However, stricter enforcement might lead to increased tax burdens for some investors. Classification as Securities or Commodities Different classifications could lead to different regulatory frameworks. Securities classification might bring stricter rules, while commodity classification could offer more flexibility but still require oversight. CBDC Development Push The review could accelerate the development of a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as a response to the rise of private cryptocurrencies. This could reshape the digital payment landscape and potentially compete with existing cryptocurrencies. International Cooperation on Crypto Regulation The U.S. might push for global standards in crypto regulation, leading to more consistent rules across different countries. This could reduce regulatory arbitrage and create a more level playing field. It’s crucial to remember that regulatory developments are not inherently negative for cryptocurrencies. Well-designed regulations can provide legitimacy, reduce risks, and foster sustainable growth in the crypto market. The key is to find a balance that encourages innovation while mitigating potential harms. UBS Crypto Analysis: A Credible Warning Sign? When a major financial institution like UBS issues a warning about potential pressure on cryptocurrencies, it’s worth paying attention. UBS’s crypto analysis likely stems from a deep understanding of global financial markets, regulatory trends, and macroeconomic factors. Their perspective is informed by: Economic Expertise: UBS employs a team of economists and market analysts who closely monitor global economic developments and regulatory changes. Client Insights: As a major wealth manager, UBS has insights into the concerns and sentiments of institutional and high-net-worth investors regarding cryptocurrencies. Risk Management Perspective: Financial institutions like UBS are acutely aware of regulatory risks and the potential impact of policy changes on various asset classes, including crypto. Global Network: UBS’s international presence gives them a broad view of regulatory trends and policy discussions happening around the world, not just in the U.S. Therefore, UBS’s assessment should be considered a credible signal of potential shifts in the regulatory landscape. It doesn’t necessarily predict a crash or a crypto winter, but it does suggest that the market might face increased regulatory headwinds in the near future. Investors should take this into account when making their investment decisions and portfolio allocations. Actionable Insights: Preparing for Potential Digital Currency Pressure So, what can you do to navigate this period of potential cryptocurrency regulation pressure? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, particularly concerning the U.S. trade review and any policy announcements related to cryptocurrencies. Reputable crypto news sources and legal analysis can be invaluable. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes, including traditional assets, can help mitigate risks associated with crypto market volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Risk Management: Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your crypto portfolio accordingly. Consider taking some profits or reducing exposure if you are uncomfortable with potential regulatory risks. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that regulatory cycles are a normal part of market evolution. While short-term pressure is possible, the long-term potential of blockchain technology and digital assets remains significant. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals and long-term viability. Engage and Advocate: If you are passionate about crypto, consider engaging with industry advocacy groups and participating in discussions with policymakers to shape sensible and innovation-friendly regulations. Conclusion: Navigating the Regulatory Tide The UBS warning about potential pressure on digital currencies due to the U.S. trade review is a timely reminder that the crypto market operates within a larger regulatory and economic context. While the promise of decentralized finance and digital assets remains strong, navigating the evolving regulatory landscape is crucial for both investors and the industry as a whole. By staying informed, managing risks, and engaging constructively with regulators, the crypto community can help shape a future where innovation and responsible regulation coexist.

This sentiment is reflected in Polymarket , where bettors currently assign an 87% probability to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot XRP ETF by the end of the year. 87% chance of XRP ETF approval in 2025. Source: Polymarket Ripple’s legal victory fuels optimism for XRP ETF approval The newly gained confidence in an XRP ETF approval was sparked by the resolution of Ripple’s protracted legal battle against the SEC. With the lawsuit withdrawn, investors are confident that the key barriers previously preventing Ripple’s institutional adoption have been conquered. Nate Geraci, president of the advisory firm ETF Store, said on X that the approval of an XRP ETF is next. Geraci said it was “obvious” that it was only a “matter of time” before the SEC approved it. He believes that asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity would be involved in offering the asset. According to the ETFStore President, XRP might see massive adoption if it gains regulatory approval from the SEC. This could make XRP the next altcoin after Ethereum to clinch an ETF. XRP is currently occupying the fourth position in the cryptocurrency ranking by market cap and is about $2 billion away from claiming the third position from Tether. Traders on Polymarket show high confidence in XRP ETF Analysts agree with Geraci, pointing out that the current optimism for XRP ETF approval aligns with the shift in SEC policy. They argue that a regulatory green light for the ETF might not prove difficult with the U.S. now under a more crypto-friendly administration. An XRP ETF would allow traditional investors to access XRP through regulated financial instruments, further contribute to its adoption, and create additional demand, liquidity, and stability for the price of XRP. If approved, an XRP ETF will be a significant step forward for Ripple and the wider crypto market. It would act as an onboarding on-ramp for institutional investors, similar to what we witnessed with Bitcoin ETFs. The average ETF would expose investors to positive exposure to XRP without holding the actual tokens, allaying any concerns regarding storage and security, and the need for law observance. It will also grant XRP legitimacy and thus take up space as one of the most relevant assets in the crypto space. But while betting market Polymarket pegged the odds at an 87% chance that an XRP ETF would be approved by the end of the year, controversy surrounds the site itself. It is also accused of a governance attack, an alleged attack on its frontends by a whale holder of Universal Market Access (UMA) tokens. It stems from a $7 million bet placed on whether U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukraine signed a mineral agreement between March 24 and 25. The incident has raised questions about the trustworthiness of certain prediction markets, even as Polymarket maintains its reputation for forecasting accuracy. Despite this, the growing speculation around an XRP ETF highlights the increasing interest in regulated crypto investment vehicles, and its potential approval could serve as a game-changer for both XRP and the broader digital asset ecosystem.

Despite this strength, ADA has remained in a tight range since March 10, fluctuating between $0.75 and $0.68 as the broader crypto market stays muted. However, analysts suggest that a major breakout to $10 may be imminent. In a Tuesday tweet, crypto analyst Javon Marks projected that ADA could surge sixfold from current prices if historical patterns from the last bull run repeat, supported by Fibonacci extension targets. “Based on $ADA (Cardano)’s past bull cycle performance, we can watch for prices to push to the 1.272 Fib Level, currently over 585% away at $5.35933. A more than 6.8X move,” Marks stated . Elsewhere, prominent Bitcoin investor and analyst “Lucky,” who has over 2.2 million followers on X, highlighted a bullish flag forming on ADA’s daily chart, with price targets around $1.80. He also pointed to strong fundamentals backing ADA’s potential rally. “Keep an eye on ADA; I’m anticipating another big move. Strong fundamentals and increasing adoption make Cardano a reliable choice. The ecosystem continues to expand, solidifying its market position,” he noted . Meanwhile, Crypto Capital Venture’s Dan Gambardello compared Cardano’s current trajectory to Amazon’s early 2000s growth. He recalled how Amazon was dismissed as a failing dot-com stock in 2001 before becoming a dominant tech giant. Gambardello suggested that Cardano is laying a similar foundation for long-term success and predicted ADA’s market cap could skyrocket, potentially pushing its price to $10 sooner than many expect. These bullish projections align with a notable increase in whale accumulation. On Tuesday, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that whales purchased 240 million ADA over the past week. This follows his earlier observation on March 20, when whales bought 190 million ADA in a single day. While whale activity has slowed slightly in recent weeks, Cardano’s futures volume dropped from $10 billion to $940 million in two weeks as of March 19, February 2025 also saw a significant wave of large purchases. During that month’s 30% price decline, ADA whales holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA accumulated over 300 million ADA, valued at approximately $200 million. Additionally, since November 2023, wallets containing at least 1 million ADA have consistently increased their holdings, amassing an additional 1.41 billion ADA over 15 months, accounting for 2.35% of the total supply. Beyond price speculation, several factors appear to be fueling renewed whale interest in Cardano. Upcoming network upgrades promise improved scalability and transaction efficiency , making ADA more attractive to institutional investors. Additionally, optimism surrounding potential regulatory clarity in the crypto space may be encouraging large holders to accumulate ADA was trading at $0.72 at press time, reflecting a 1.94% gain on the day and an 8.34% increase over the past week.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-26 19:46:53

Due to bureaucracy-related delays, Atkins has yet to begin work. However, a recently published financial disclosure ahead of his confirmation hearing reveals a notable detail, Atkins is an avid crypto investor. Gensler’s tenure at the Securities and Exchange Commission was marked by an antagonistic approach toward crypto businesses. Many major companies were sued, and digital assets were broadly treated as unregistered securities, making it difficult for U.S. firms to engage with crypto without legal risks. Read more: Gary Gensler’s political testament. Digesting the SEC chairman’s exit interview Trump vowed to make America the crypto capital of the world, and his pick for the SEC chair position was a strong crypto advocate and investor, Paul Atkins, who invests in crypto himself. He even testified in court as an expert witness on behalf of finance companies sued by the Gensler-era SEC. It took too long for Atkins to finally participate in the Senate Banking Committee hearing that should vote on his confirmation as the SEC chair. Investments of Atkins On March 25, 2025, financial disclosures revealed that Paul Atkins and his wife hold between $327 million and $588.8 million in total assets. The report provides value ranges rather than specific figures. Roughly $6 million of their portfolio is tied to crypto investments. Atkins holds about $1 million in equity across two crypto firms and another $5 million in a crypto investment fund. Until February, he held up to $500,000 in call options for BlackRock’s tokenization company Securitize, where he also served on the board of directors. He held a similar equity stake in Anchorage Digital. Atkins also had up to $5 million invested in Off the Chain Capital, where he was a limited partner. He has allegedly agreed to divest these holdings upon confirmation as SEC chair. Elizabeth Warren’s letter Atkins’ confirmation faces opposition from Senator Elizabeth Warren, a ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies. Warrent sent a 32-page letter outlining questions Atkins would need to address during the hearing. She expressed concerns about his role at the SEC during the 2008 financial crisis, his advisory role at the collapsed FTX exchange, and potential conflicts of interest, citing his close ties with corporations advocating for deregulation. She also criticized his recent role as CEO of Patomak Global Partners, a consulting firm that advised multiple companies regulated by the SEC under Gensler. Notably, Patomak had also consulted for FTX, whose collapse in 2022 helped catalyze the SEC’s aggressive stance under Gensler. While Atkins has promised to divest his assets, Warren argued this was “not enough unless he agrees to disclose to Congress who the buyer will be and whether they are paying for access to the SEC chair.” What to expect? As both a pro-crypto advocate and an experienced financial insider, Atkins is seen as well-positioned to understand the crypto industry’s challenges. He is expected to continue the post-Gensler direction shaped by Hester Peirce, with the SEC already dropping several Gensler-era lawsuits against companies like Ripple, Coinbase, and Kraken. More than that, the SEC ruled out that memetokens are not securities but collectables. It was an important change in the legal perception of crypto tokens. Atkins is expected to work on favorable crypto regulation that will facilitate the functioning of crypto companies. The Atkins’ January meeting with Sen. Lummis hints a crypto-friendly period of the SEC is about to begin. According to Lummis, Atkins will provide regulatory clarity to the digital asset industry “quickly.” Fortune quotes Atkins, saying, “The collapse of FTX was this international debacle because I think the U.S. didn’t make our rules accommodating to this new technology.” The previous SEC chairman was trying to close down crypto companies and label nearly every token a ""security"". The new chairman holds those tokens & shares in crypto companies in his personal portfolio. And yet you're bearish? https://t.co/uVOCideYbs — Nic (@nicrypto) March 26, 2025 However, on top of setting a clearer regulation framework for the crypto businesses, Atkins will have to follow Trump’s course on minimizing the number of officials, departing hundreds of the SEC workers. The SEC currently consists of around 5,000 employees, 10% of whom will have to leave the agency in the following weeks. If confirmed, Atkins could lead the SEC toward a new era: one focused on regulatory clarity, innovation, and market growth, while reducing the agency’s size and operational footprint.

Data from Cointelegraph reveals that over 27,740 BTC, valued at approximately $2.4 billion, were withdrawn from exchanges. This marks the largest Bitcoin whale activity driven outflow in seven months, indicating strong accumulation rather than selling pressure. Whale Accumulation: Large investors, often referred to as ‘whales’, are making significant moves. One notable whale added 2,400 BTC to their holdings, pushing their total stash beyond 15,000 BTC. This kind of accumulation is a strong signal of confidence in Bitcoin’s future price appreciation. Reduced Exchange Supply: When whales move Bitcoin off exchanges, it reduces the available supply for trading. This scarcity, coupled with increased demand, can create upward pressure on prices. Long-Term Investment Strategy: Whales typically engage in long-term investment strategies. Their accumulation suggests they believe Bitcoin’s current levels are attractive for future gains. How are Bitcoin ETF Inflows Amplifying the Bullish Signal? Adding further fuel to the bullish fire are the remarkable Bitcoin ETF inflows . Spot Bitcoin ETFs have now recorded eight consecutive days of net positive inflows, totaling nearly $897 million. This consistent inflow demonstrates strong and growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Why are ETF Inflows Important? Institutional Adoption: ETF inflows are a clear indicator of institutional adoption. Large institutions are allocating capital to Bitcoin through these regulated investment vehicles, signaling increased mainstream acceptance. Demand Surge: ETFs make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This accessibility drives demand and contributes to price appreciation. Market Validation: The success of Bitcoin ETFs further validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, attracting more investors and capital into the market. Bitcoin ETF Inflow Metric Value Significance Consecutive Days of Inflows 8 Sustained positive sentiment Total Inflows ~$897 Million Substantial capital injection Institutional Participation Growing Increased market maturity Can Bullish Momentum Sustain? Key Bitcoin Price Analysis Levels to Watch While the signs are encouraging, sustaining this bullish momentum requires Bitcoin to hold critical technical levels. According to market analysts, these levels are crucial for confirming a continued upward trajectory. Key Technical Levels for Bitcoin: 20-Week EMA: Currently around $88,682, the 20-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a vital support level. Holding above this level indicates continued medium-term bullishness. Yearly Open: The yearly open price, approximately $93,300, acts as a significant resistance level. Reclaiming and holding above this level would signal a strong resumption of the bull run. Psychological Resistance: Round numbers like $95,000 and $100,000 often act as psychological resistance levels. Breaking through these could trigger further FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and accelerate price increases. Bitcoin price analysis suggests that if Bitcoin can maintain its position above the 20-week EMA and successfully reclaim the yearly open, the chances of a more pronounced bull run significantly increase. Conversely, failure to hold these levels could lead to a period of consolidation or even a correction. Navigating the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights So, what does all of this mean for you? Here are some actionable insights based on the current market signals: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on on-chain metrics like exchange outflows and ETF inflow data. These provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Monitor Key Levels: Track Bitcoin’s price action around the 20-week EMA and yearly open. These levels can offer clues about the strength and sustainability of the bullish momentum. Diversify (Wisely): While Bitcoin is showing strong bullish signals, remember the importance of portfolio diversification. Consider exploring other promising cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Manage Risk: The crypto market is volatile. Always invest responsibly and within your risk tolerance. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Conclusion: Is Bitcoin Ready to Explode? The confluence of massive Bitcoin whale activity , substantial Bitcoin ETF inflows , and crucial technical levels being tested paints a compelling picture of potential bullish momentum in the crypto market . While no one can predict the future with certainty, the current indicators strongly suggest that Bitcoin could be on the cusp of another significant price surge. Keeping a close eye on Bitcoin price analysis and market developments will be crucial in navigating this exciting phase of the crypto bull run. The stage seems set; will Bitcoin deliver the explosive performance many are anticipating?

Institutional numbers headlined the rebound in Bitcoin (BTC) and many altcoins despite creeping sentiments. Overall, a massive $644 million net inflow flipped consecutive five-week exits. The total market cap rose 1% to $2.8 trillion, with trading volumes marking sharp double-digit gains. Bitcoin Bulls Scoop $724 Million In Assets CoinShares Digital Asset Weekly Flow shows institutional investors poured $724 million in Bitcoin funds. This comes after five straight weeks of outflows due to wider bearish sentiments. As a result, total monthly numbers remain over $1 billion in the red zone, while year-to-date net inflows stand at $1.3 billion. Bitcoin remains the center for most wealth managers after reclaiming its $87k price setting the pace for new inflows. Previous outflows had topped $5.4 billion amid a heated macro market. The White House tariff policies as well as global trade issues weakened trader sentiments. This also led to slow growth in spot Bitcoin ETFs , a major driver for the leading digital asset. “ Notably, every day last week recorded inflows, following a 17-day consecutive run of outflows signaling a decisive shift in sentiment toward the asset class. The majority of flows originated from the US, which saw US$632m in inflows. However, the positive sentiment was broad-based, with Switzerland, Germany, and Hong Kong also recording inflows of US$15.9m, US$13.9m, and US$1.2m, respectively.” While total net inflows hit $644 million, assets under management (AUM) spiked 6% from its March 10 yearly low. For most analysts, this upward trend can fuel a major leap in terms of institutional capital in the market. Last year, institutional demand in crypto-dominated financial markets as traditional players grew more confident. Altcoin Holders Show Mixed Sentiments On the altcoin front, several assets posted gains after weeks in the doldrums while others continued in the red wave. XRP led gains with $6.7 million, with bulls showing slight signs of hope despite heavy losses. This month, the asset marked $548 million worth of outflows and $344 million net outflows since the start of the year. Solana and Cardano followed with $6.4 and $0.1 million inflows, respectively. Meanwhile, the leading altcoin, Ethereum, recorded $86 million outflows, stretching monthly exits over $350 million.

With the plan to fully back the stablecoins with the US Dollar, Wyoming is positioning itself as the first in the country to issue such payment tokens. According to Governor Mark Gordon, the state is making moves to jump onto the bandwagon as early as July. Wyoming Stablecoin Pivot Aligns With Federal Government Pivot According to a Bloomberg report , Governor Gordon is very positive about the stablecoin push. He believes most financial stakeholders are not bullish enough about the stable asset firm. The Governor reference the position of JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jimon Dimon a while back regarding plans to venture into the stablecoin niche earlier. He said he once pitched Wyoming to him and the bank as the state has the right “framework to do it.” While only a few mainstream firms have entered the stablecoin scene, Wyoming may be pioneering a new wave in the digital payments ecosystem. This move comes as the President Donald Trump administration is pushing for legislation for the ecosystem. At the Digital Asset Summit recently, President Trump urged Congress to pass stablecoin legislation . He believes this regulation can support entities looking to enter the space.

In a new report from Grayscale Research, the firm says Sui ( SUI ) provides “one of the highest throughput and lowest transaction costs of any single-layer network” without relying on additional scaling layers, as Ethereum does. Grayscale notes that Sui represents only 0.3% of its Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector by market capitalization. According to the firm, its Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector index includes crypto assets that serve as the baseline platforms upon which self-executing contracts are developed and deployed. “Although competition within the Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector is likely to remain intense, Grayscale Research believes that Sui is currently the best-positioned third-generation blockchain to capture share from the market leader Ethereum over time.” At time of writing, SUI has a fully-diluted valuation (FDV) of $25.9 billion, compared to Ethereum’s $242.9 billion. Says Grayscale, “Within just about a year, Sui has amassed a substantial $830 million in Total Value Locked (TVL), according to CoinMarketCap. TVL is a measure of the dollar value of digital assets deposited in smart contracts. Sui has also maintained a modest market capitalization of about $1.8 billion, according to CoinMarketCap as of July 31, 2024. This achievement gives Sui a TVL/market cap ratio of 2.16, the second highest among its peers. For context, this ratio indicates how much value is actively used on the network relative to its market valuation. Sui’s low ratio may imply that it’s undervalued compared to its competitors. Comparatively, Ethereum, the leading platform in the smart contract space, maintains a TVL/market cap ratio of 3.16.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

To read full editions, subscribe . Hello from Washington! I’m not here to see the cherry blossoms , although they’re providing a nice backdrop for the DC Blockchain Summit. It’s a busy week in the District. And I’m not just talking about the drama surrounding crypto’s favorite messaging app . Tomorrow, more Trump Cabinet hopefuls head to the Senate for nomination hearings. Paul Atkins (up to be the next chair of the SEC), will join Jonathan Gould (for Comptroller of the Currency), Luke Pettit (for Assistant Secretary of the Treasury) and Marcus Molinaro (for Federal Transit Administrator). We imagine Atkins and Gould will take center stage. In the House, Reps. Bryan Steil and French Hill are ready to formally introduce the STABLE Act. The legislation is “80% similar” to the Senate’s stab at a stablecoin bill (the GENIUS Act), Steil said Wednesday at the DC Blockchain Summit. The DC Blockchain Summit , the Digital Chamber’s annual policy event, drew the usual suspects today. Aside from Reps. Steil and Hill, Sens. Tim Scott, Tim Sheehy and Bernie Moreno were also speakers. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand represented the Democrats. World Liberty Financial’s founding team, including Donald Trump Jr. (appearing via Zoom), spoke as well. They talked a lot about the importance of stablecoins, saying the team hopes to see a digital dollar used for day-to-day payments in the future. They were tight-lipped, however, about their own USD1 token . Speaking of USD1, we heard Trump has been pushing Congress to pass stablecoin legislation ASAP. Now we have a pretty good guess as to why. I tried to catch Chase Herro, Zach Witkoff and Zach Folkman on their way out. Let’s just say the team wasn’t itching to talk to the press. If you know DC, you won’t be surprised to hear that most of my conversations today were off the record, or at the very least on background. Suffice to say there are some things I can’t share, but I’ll list a couple of policy-related things I’m keeping an eye on: Custody There’s a lot of talk around the strategic bitcoin reserve , but I think far too few people are talking about how the US government custodies digital assets. Sen. Lummis has been pressuring the US Marshals Service to release more detailed information about its security practices, and I’ll be curious to see if specific guidelines will be included in upcoming legislation around the bitcoin reserve. Executive Orders President Trump is not done with crypto-related executive orders, people familiar with the matter told me. Even though the OCC recently took a step in the same direction with its updated guidance on reputational risk , debanking in the crypto industry (so-called Operation Chokepoint 2.0) is still top-of-mind in the White House. SEC Rulemaking Though the SEC certainly hasn’t been idle in the weeks since Mark Uyeda became acting chair, commissioners have stopped short of creating new rules. We’ve seen guidance and staff accounting bulletins; we’ve seen motions for dismissal in some of the agency’s most high-profile crypto cases. But we have not seen any new rules. To be clear, even if Paul Atkins is confirmed and takes over as chair, it’s going to be a while before any new rules — crypto or otherwise — are issued. It’s a long process . But it’s a process that won’t get started until Atkins takes the helm. Get the news in your inbox.

It launched its third phase of funding during its altcoin presale where investors bought it at $0.02 while contributing over $4.8 million. More than 6600 investors have entered at the current price levels of $0.025 because they expect a projected 25% price surge before the upcoming stage. The launch price at $0.06 gives investors who enter during this period the potential to receive a 200% profit. Mutuum Finance could hit $5 after launch and could outspace Solana. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance attracts significant investor attention because it implements decentralized finance solutions for crypto loans together with decentralized finance funding mechanisms for its financial service development. The project grows steadily because it acquired more than $4.9 million from investors and now engages a growing number of 6900 investors. Investors face limited entry choices given a $0.02 Phase 3 token price because an approaching 25% price boost will finalize available early investment opportunities. Over 80% of the phase has already been sold out showing that investors have limited time before the window closes. Investors who participate in the current presale period will receive 200% profits from their investment because the platform already set a future price at $0.06. Mutuum Finance steers the Decentralized market market ahead using its innovative lending solution and its established market position. The Dual-Model System of Crypto Lending Mutuum Finance operates a contemporary lending platform which combines Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models to enable better access to assets and transparency for user empowerment. Smart contract pools benefit from Peer-to-Contrast model users who supply their stablecoins for instant borrowing access by platform users and receive passive income. Thanks to automated interest rate modification through smart contracts both lenders get better earnings and borrowers experience less expense in borrowing. The P2P model enables users to form decentralized lending relationships without middlemen while obtaining full negotiation freedoms. The transparent system allows borrowers and lenders to build customized loan arrangements for transactions so they can achieve better user-friendly options. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance continues expanding its community through the provision of rewarding program benefits and incentives. Participants receive $10,000 MUTM tokens from a total million-dollar prize distribution and the platform offers an innovative referral program with payment rewards for each new investor they introduce. Exclusively accessible staking pools, governance privileges and VIP updates are strategic benefits that early adopters obtain which motivates them to maintain their long-term engagement with the platform. Transforming Crypto Lending Mutuum Finance maintains price stability through its Ethereum integration by receiving deposits in USD funds. The stablecoin system runs using a resistant structure which stops algorithmic stability problems that are essential for financial transactions. Mutuum Finance reaches decentralized finance development through its implementation of advanced financial lending methods supported by robust infrastructure systems. The decentralized crypto lending market chooses Mutuum Finance as its leader due to its dual-model system along with robust investor backing which transforms the way people access financial services. A massive number of 6,600 investors have joined Mutuum Finance’s presale documentary since its launch yet the project is approaching its maximum funding goal of $4.8 million so rapid investment is vital because the prices will surge by 25%. Future investors who participate in the presale will receive approximately 200% in returns at launch while the platform anticipates expanding faster than Solana has managed thus far. The Mutuum Finance presale presents a transformative chance that you should seize right now by becoming a part of their decentralized financial success as they approach full presale subscription.

The top global crypto exchange didn’t identify the market maker but noted that it operated for the Ethereum ( ETH )-based layer-2 project Movement ( MOVE ). Movement uses Move, a programming language originally built by a consortium backed by tech giant Meta for the now-defunct Diem project. The language was then used to develop layer-1 blockchains Sui ( SUI ) and Aptos ( APT ). The project’s native token launched via Binance’s Airdrops Portal in December, but the exchange says that after MOVE was listed, the now-banned market maker sold approximately 66 million MOVE tokens on December 10th, with few buy orders. The market maker ended up netting a profit of $38 million worth of the stablecoin USDT before being offboarded last week. Binance notified the Movement teams and froze the market maker’s proceeds to compensate users. The exchange also notes the market maker was associated with another entity it banned earlier this month. The name of the other banned market maker also wasn’t disclosed, though Binance said it operated as a liquidity provider for the decentralized security layer GoPlus Security ( GPS ) and the AI consumer project MyShell ( SHELL ). MOVE is up nearly 24% in the past 24 hours. The 77th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $0.546 at time of writing.

Mubarak and Toshi both made bold entries into the meme coin space—Mubarak fueled by cultural appeal and high-profile nods, and Toshi driven by crypto lore and feline charm. Each delivered sharp price swings and fast gains, rewarding early speculators. But Dragoin ($DDGN) takes a different route. Instead of leaning on quick buzz, it focuses on long-term engagement through a clear, stage-based presale and real community incentives. With referral rewards, airdrops, and event access built in from the start, Dragoin doesn’t just promise value—it gives its community a reason to stick around. Mubarak (MUBARAK): A Meteoric Rise in the Meme Coin Arena Launched around March 12, 2025, on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Mubarak (MUBARAK) quickly captured the crypto community’s attention. The token’s name, meaning “blessed” in Arabic, resonated culturally, and its community-driven approach, bolstered by subtle endorsements from influential figures, fueled its rapid ascent. For instance, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s purchase of $600 worth of MUBARAK tokens added credibility. Since then, Mubarak’s price trajectory has been remarkable. After reaching an all-time high of $0.2147 on March 18, 2025, the token experienced fluctuations, with a current price of $0.133116 as of March 24, 2025. This means a 16.74% decline in the last 24 hours. Nonetheless, despite this volatility, early investors have seen significant returns, with the price up approximately 378.9% from it’s all-time low of $0.02801 on March 16, 2025. With a circulating supply of 1 billion tokens and a market cap of $133.38 million, Mubarak’s journey underscores the dynamic nature of meme coins and the potential for substantial gains within short timeframes. Toshi (TOSHI): From Feline Inspiration to Crypto Contender Toshi (TOSHI), a memecoin named after Coinbase co-founder Brian Armstrong’s cat and the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, launched in December 2023. With a total supply of 420.69 billion tokens and no presale, Toshi emphasized a fair launch and community engagement. In terms of price movement, the token’s history reflects its volatile journey. Starting at $0.000169 in December 2023, Toshi reached an all-time high of $0.00146 in January 2025, marking a substantial increase. As of March 24, 2025, TOSHI trades at $0.000330, down 1.12% in the last hour but up 1.34% over the past 24 hours. Even so, despite being approximately 86.21% below its peak, early adopters have realized significant profits. With a circulating supply of 408.07 billion tokens and a market cap of $134.72 million, Toshi’s trajectory highlights the rapid shifts characteristic of the meme coin sector. Fueling the Fire Together: How Dragoin Rewards Its Community from Day One Dragoin ($DDGN) doesn’t treat its community as an afterthought—it places them at the center of everything from the very first presale stage. Whereas many projects wait until post-launch to start building momentum, Dragoin flips the script by rewarding those who get involved early and stay active. From Stage 1 of its themed presale, users can unlock referral bonuses simply by inviting others to join the ecosystem. These aren’t symbolic gestures—they’re meaningful incentives that directly benefit participants and contribute to the project’s organic growth. Additionally, beyond referrals, Dragoin offers exclusive airdrops and early access to events that give engaged community members more reasons to stick around. Participation in official channels isn’t just for information—it’s a gateway to special perks and opportunities that aren’t available to passive holders. The more you contribute, the more you unlock. As a result, this community-first strategy builds momentum not through hype, but through real value shared across the ecosystem. By giving early backers more than just favorable token pricing, Dragoin cultivates a loyal base that feels connected to the project’s growth. It’s not just about holding a coin—it’s about playing a role in shaping what comes next. Where Community Incentives Separate Talk from Action Mubarak and Toshi proved that meme coins can move fast and reward early risk-takers, especially when backed by viral narratives and well-timed exposure. Their trajectories reflect the sharp highs and steep corrections that often define this category. Dragoin ($DDGN), however, opts for a more deliberate approach—one that doesn’t just reward buying early, but actively participating. With built-in referral bonuses, exclusive event access, and structured presale stages, Dragoin encourages involvement beyond the wallet. It’s not simply about riding price charts; it’s about building something with the people holding the token. That’s a different kind of value—and a more durable one.

Bitget CEO Gracy Chen compared Hyperliquid to the now-defunct exchange FTX after Hyperliquid’s response to unusual activity involving the JELLY token resulted in an estimated $10.6 million loss. The delisting of the token and forced settlement of open positions drew sharp reactions from the crypto community. Bitget CEO Warns Hyperliquid May Mirror FTX Collapse In a recent post on X , Bitget CEO Gracy Chen warned that Hyperliquid could follow a similar trajectory to FTX. Chen raised alarms over the platform’s decision to halt the trading of the JELLY token and forcefully settle open trades. According to her, this action created unfair outcomes, favoring some traders while causing losses to others. Bitget CEO labeled Hyperliquid’s actions as immature and unethical. The forced closure followed a 230% spike in JELLY price within one hour. A $5 million short position was liquidated during this time, raising concerns about market manipulation. The situation placed Hyperliquid’s treasury at further risk, with potential exposure reportedly nearing $240 million. Gracy Chen added, “Unless these issues are addressed, more altcoins may be weaponized against Hyperliquid—putting it at risk of becoming the next catastrophic failure in crypto.” A recent report highlighted how Hyperliquid Vault is at risk of losing its entire $230 million fund due to a surge in the Solana-based memecoin JELLY JELLY. The platform inherited a short position amid a short squeeze and now faces mounting pressure as the token’s price continues to climb. Concerns Over Compliance and Risk Structure Bitget CEO continued to criticize Hyperliquid’s lack of standard compliance practices. She pointed out the absence of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures. Chen stated that Hyperliquid, although presenting itself as a decentralized platform, operated similarly to an offshore centralized exchange. She added that this regulatory gap may allow illicit funds to move through the platform undetected. These concerns were echoed by others in the industry, including former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. Chen also warned that if left unchecked, the model could lead to the same vulnerabilities that contributed to the collapse of FTX. Mixed Vaults and Position Sizes Raise Risk The Bitget CEO highlighted structural concerns with the platform’s product design. She noted that the use of mixed vaults exposed users to shared risks. According to Chen, this could allow the actions of a few traders to affect all users on the platform. The JELLY token’s sharp price rise triggered emergency action from the exchange’s validator set. The platform cited suspicious market activity as the reason for delisting the token. However, the decision to settle trades at a specific price led to a backlash from affected traders. Bitget CEO described the settlement approach as a dangerous precedent. She stressed that trust, not just capital, is essential for the success of any exchange. Without addressing these vulnerabilities, Chen warned that Hyperliquid could face further threats from manipulated markets. Meanwhile, FTX bankruptcy case expenses reached nearly $1 billion, with legal and advisory firms receiving substantial payouts. Court records show that Sullivan & Cromwell LLP alone has earned over $248 million for handling the proceedings.

The price of Pi Network dropped below $1 while it tests the $0.9 support level after other altcoins along with Bitcoin showed a slight market recovery. The market trends and uncertain developments combine to worsen the existing value decrease experienced by Pi Network. The question remains as to how low will the PI price go as bear pressure mounts. After its launch in February, the Pi Network price experienced a rapid increase, yet it is now facing a notable downward movement. The currency attained its highest value point at $2.98 before experiencing a quick market downfall. The mainnet launch failed to meet expectations by driving up the PI price since its launch coincided with a price decline. On February 20, 2025, the lowest Pi price reached $0.6152 while experiencing an enormous 72.61% decline from its peak value. The market continues to show uncertainty because confidence levels are unstable despite some price recovery. Why Is Pi Network Price Crashing? The Pi Network value has dropped significantly because more than 99.3 million Pi currency tokens will soon become available for unlocking. Out of the total $91 million valuation the tokens represent, they will enter daily circulation using a 3 million token release schedule for the next 30-day period. The market will receive its biggest unlock of 6.8 million tokens when April 3 arrives. The upcoming large unlocks for May and June worry the market due to potential liquidity surges and increased sell-offs. The price devaluation becomes apparent because Pi Network missed the opportunity to be listed among the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase, and Upbit . Although users in South Korea find Pi Network very popular, many exchanges, including major platforms, have barred Pi from their platforms. Holders continue to display concern about Pi project tokenomics because the Pi Foundation holds a large percentage of the total supply which leads to increased fears and panic selling events. Will Pi Price Recover Soon? The price of PI has experienced major fluctuations during recent weeks. The price currently challenges $0.8304 support after losing ground from its initial $1.00 peak. The market value of PI Network currently exists within a consolidation pattern which presents an expected price region from $0.70 to $1.00. The MACD indicator signals bearish characteristics because both its lines exist under the zero threshold. The current RSI value measures 32 which suggests that BTC approaches a condition where it could become oversold. A market reversal might come into play whenever buying pressure strengthens. Pi Network Price Chart: TradingView The PI price shows signs of continued resistance at present support areas. The value retaining its $0.70 value could enable a positional shift toward the higher zone of $1.00. A failure at current market support might push the token toward $0.50 in relation to wider market conditions.

This move comes at a time when the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US has grown more favorable, particularly under the Trump administration’s friendly policies. Fidelity Testing US Dollar-Pegged Stablecoin According to the latest report by the Financial Times, the financial giant is in the final stages of testing the stablecoin through its digital assets division, Fidelity Digital Assets. The stablecoin is expected to debut by the end of May and is part of a broader push by the firm into the cryptocurrency sector. In addition to the stablecoin, Fidelity has recently filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an Ethereum-based “ OnChain ” share class for its Treasury Digital Fund, which invests primarily in US Treasury securities. Fidelity’s stablecoin initiative comes as the stablecoin market continues to grow, with companies like Tether with USDT and Circle with USDC holding the lion’s share. The market is currently worth around $235 billion and has seen an influx of traditional financial firms eyeing the space, spurred by regulatory clarity around stablecoin issuance. Stablecoin Innovation Amid Crypto Regulatory Shift It is important to note that Fidelity’s involvement in the market highlights a wider trend of institutional adoption of blockchain-based financial products, such as PayPal’s launch of its own stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), in 2023. Especially following President Donald Trump’s election, a growing number of US financial institutions are venturing into cryptocurrency-based products, owing to the much-anticipated shift in policy direction. For instance, Custodia and Vantage Bank have introduced the country’s first-ever bank-issued stablecoin this week, which is built on the open Ethereum blockchain. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project backed by US President Donald Trump, introduced a stablecoin named USD1. The coin will be fully backed by short-term US government treasuries, dollar deposits, and cash equivalents. Initially, USD1 tokens will be issued on both the Ethereum and Binance networks, with future plans to expand to additional blockchains. Each USD1 token is designed to hold a consistent value of $1, backed by a reserve portfolio that is periodically audited by an independent third party.

42443329,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=700631,1743019646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42443329.jpeg,Wyoming plans to launch its very own crypto in July,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wyoming-plans-launch-its-very-own-crypto/,"Wyoming says it will launch its own cryptocurrency by July, becoming the first state in the U.S. to issue a fiat-backed, fully-reserved stablecoin. The coin, named WYST, will be backed by cash, U.S. Treasuries, and repurchase agreements, and is required by law to maintain at least 102% in reserves. The information was reported during the DC Blockchain Summit, according to Bloomberg. Governor Mark Gordon said banks have dragged their feet when it comes to launching stablecoins. “I don’t think there’s any banks that have been really eager, right? To jump in,” Mark said at the summit. He also recalled a past conversation with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, saying, “If you’re gonna do something, you should really do it in Wyoming, because we have a framework to do it.” The coin is designed to bring new revenue to the state. Wyoming plans to use interest earned from the reserves to fund education and infrastructure. Mark said the token could also help people in agriculture. “It can also be a tool that farmers and ranchers can use to develop new markets,” he said . State sees WYST as a way to pull in new money WYST will be pegged to the U.S. dollar and structured to function like other stablecoins, which aim to hold a 1:1 value with the dollar. Interest in stablecoins is already growing across the U.S. Companies like Visa, PayPal, and Stripe are investing in projects tied to these coins or building their own. Lawmakers in Texas and Utah have also looked into issuing similar state-backed tokens, but none have moved as fast as Wyoming. The state has spent nearly a decade preparing for this. Since 2016, Wyoming has passed over 45 crypto-focused laws, trying to become less reliant on money from fossil fuels. More than 1,000 LLCs using names with “crypto,” “blockchain,” or “DAO” are now registered in the state, based on filings with the Secretary of State’s office. Still, the results have been mixed. In 2023, Wyoming invested $2 million into crypto-related projects but only got back $473,000, Bloomberg reported. On top of that, lawmakers in the state rejected a proposal earlier this year to create state crypto reserves, with opponents citing crypto’s high risk and unstable value. Senator Cynthia Lummis, who represents Wyoming in the Senate, pitched the idea of a national Bitcoin stockpile last year at a conference in Nashville. Cynthia’s plan would have the U.S. government buy 1 million Bitcoin, which is way more than the 200,000 BTC the country currently holds from previous seizures. But even her home state refused to support a bill that would let the state invest directly in Bitcoin. The proposal failed in the Wyoming House in February, getting just one vote in favor. WYST could live on Solana, Ethereum, or Polygon Anthony Apollo, who runs the Wyoming Stable Tokens Commission, said the state is reviewing nine blockchains that could support WYST. Options on the table include Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon, but no decision has been made yet. Anthony said, “We also believe that the framework we’ve built over the last several years is one that’s probably richer and more robust than just the one in Washington.” While Wyoming moves forward, other states are pulling back. In the past two months alone, lawmakers in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming have all voted against creating crypto reserves. These bills would have let states hold assets like Bitcoin as part of their long-term financial planning. Jennifer Schulp, who works at the Cato Institute, said the hesitation isn’t surprising. “There’s a well-deserved perception of volatility in terms of Bitcoin and all crypto,” Jennifer said. “I think that’s going to continue to be an issue even as the crypto environment continues to be a positive one.” Crypto reserve proposals have popped up in 24 states so far, but most haven’t gone anywhere. Lawmakers say they don’t want to put taxpayer money into something that can swing wildly in value. In South Dakota, a bill to invest up to 10% of state funds into Bitcoin was postponed after a vote in the House of Representatives. Montana’s version failed with a 41-59 vote in the House. Bitcoin’s price drop hasn’t helped. After peaking at around $109,000 in January just hours before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, it’s fallen nearly 20%. That kind of dip gives lawmakers even more reasons to say no. Most state reserves are held in low-risk bonds, not coins that can lose billions in value overnight. Trump signed an executive order on crypto in January, asking for a study on whether a digital asset reserve is even doable. The order didn’t promise anything. It just told the government to look into it and come back with answers. Jennifer said that even with Trump back in office and openly pro-crypto, the White House is still being cautious. “It makes sense that if on a national level, an administration that is very pro-crypto is taking some time to consider a strategic Bitcoin reserve, states would also be doing the same thing and not jumping in with two feet,” she said. Other states experiment while Wyoming locks in Trump’s DeFi project, World Liberty Financial, is already testing the idea of a strategic crypto reserve. Chase Herro, who co-founded the project, said the platform plans to buy crypto tokens and use them to build up reserves without any help from the federal government. In Ohio, lawmakers have introduced bills in both the House and Senate that would create state-held Bitcoin reserves. The state is still debating both proposals. Andrew Burchill, who runs the Ohio Blockchain Council, said Bitcoin isn’t as scary as lawmakers think. “From our measure, Bitcoin has been the best performing asset over the last decade compared to any traditional investment,” Andrew said. “If we’re thinking long term, the volatility is less of a risk.” Oklahoma is moving too. Last month, the state’s Government Oversight Committee passed a bill that would start building a Bitcoin reserve. But that doesn’t mean it’ll happen. Just like in other states, lawmakers are still arguing about whether public money should be used to buy crypto at all. Jennifer said the arguments are far from over. “I think this does raise a lot of questions in terms of whether or not the policy is a good one and what the implementation of that policy would even look like,” she said. “And those questions become even more complex when states all have their own rules about budgeting and investing.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Imagine a world where teachers are empowered with cutting-edge tools to personalize learning, identify AI-generated student work, and streamline administrative tasks. That future is rapidly becoming a reality, and Brisk EdTech is at the forefront, securing a significant $15 million funding round to further its mission. This investment signals a major leap forward for AI in education , promising to reshape how teachers teach and students learn. Why is AI in Education Gaining Momentum? The education sector, while crucial, has often lagged behind in tech adoption compared to other industries. However, the emergence of powerful AI tools, particularly generative AI, is changing the game. Teachers are grappling with increasing workloads, diverse student needs, and now, the challenge of discerning AI-generated content from original student work. The traditional EdTech funding landscape is shifting to prioritize solutions that address these pressing issues. Brisk AI’s recent funding round underscores this trend, highlighting the investor confidence in AI’s potential to solve real-world educational challenges. Several factors are driving this momentum: Addressing Teacher Workload: Educators are overburdened. AI tools can automate tasks like lesson planning, grading, and creating differentiated learning materials, freeing up teachers to focus on student interaction and personalized support. Personalized Learning Experiences: AI can analyze student data to identify learning gaps and tailor educational content to individual needs, leading to more effective and engaging learning. Combating AI Cheating Concerns: The rise of ChatGPT and similar tools has created anxieties about academic integrity. Brisk AI’s writing inspector directly tackles this challenge by helping teachers identify potential AI use in student writing. Demand for Innovative EdTech: Schools are actively seeking innovative solutions to enhance teaching and learning outcomes. The traditional EdTech stack is proving insufficient for the AI era, creating a demand for AI-native platforms like Brisk. Brisk AI: Leading the Charge in AI-Powered Education San Francisco-based Brisk AI isn’t just another EdTech startup; it’s building what it calls the “AI-native edtech stack.” Founded by Arman Jaffer, formerly of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brisk understands the pain points of educators and is crafting AI tools to directly address them. Their Chrome extension boasts over 40 features designed for both teachers and students, leveraging generative AI, computer vision, and other AI technologies to enhance productivity and learning quality. The platform’s impressive growth – a five-fold user base increase and a 40x revenue jump in 2024 – speaks volumes about its value proposition in the market. What Makes Brisk AI Stand Out? Brisk AI’s platform offers a suite of tools that are both comprehensive and practical. Here’s a glimpse into what makes them a leader in AI teaching tools : Feature Description Benefit Writing Inspector Analyzes student writing process videos to flag potential AI-generated content indicators. Helps teachers address academic integrity concerns without definitive accusations. Targeted Feedback Uses generative AI to provide tailored feedback on student essays in Google Docs, aligned with age and grading rubrics. Saves teachers time on grading and provides students with personalized, actionable feedback. Lesson Plan & Test Generation AI-powered tools to create lesson plans, tests, and presentations. Reduces teacher workload in curriculum development and assessment creation. Differentiated Instruction Support Tools to adjust learning materials for diverse student abilities. Facilitates personalized learning and caters to varying student needs effectively. The $15 Million Funding: Fueling Future Growth The newly secured $15 million in funding, led by Bessemer Venture Partners, is a testament to Brisk AI’s early success and future potential. This capital injection will be strategically used to: Expand Toolset: Develop even more AI-powered tools to further enhance the platform’s capabilities and address a wider range of educator needs. Platform Expansion: Integrate with more platforms, including a planned Microsoft integration for autumn 2025, catering to schools heavily reliant on Microsoft ecosystems. Web Platform Development: Launch a new web platform later this year to create a cohesive Brisk environment for educators, offering enhanced resources and activities. Multimodal Integrations: Introduce features to evaluate image-based student work and generate audio versions of documents, expanding accessibility and assessment methods. Addressing Concerns and Embracing the Future of AI in Classrooms While the integration of generative AI in classroom settings presents immense opportunities, it also raises valid concerns. Issues around data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential over-reliance on AI tools need careful consideration. Brisk AI’s approach, focusing on AI as an assistant rather than a replacement for teachers, is a crucial aspect of responsible AI implementation in education. Their writing inspector, for example, doesn’t definitively declare AI plagiarism but provides insights to aid teacher judgment. This human-in-the-loop approach is vital for building trust and ensuring AI serves to empower educators and enhance, not replace, their expertise. Kent Bennett, the Bessemer partner leading the investment, aptly points out that educators are not just tolerating AI but “aggressively seeking it out.” This proactive embrace of AI by educators signals a paradigm shift in EdTech adoption. The future of education is undeniably intertwined with AI, and companies like Brisk AI are paving the way for a more efficient, personalized, and effective learning experience for all.

Gillibrand Warns Against a ‘Watered-Down’ Stablecoin Bill,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/03/26/sen-gillibrand-warns-against-a-watered-down-stablecoin-bill-says-tough-regs-needed-to-prevent-svb-like-bank-run,"U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), one of the leading Democrats supporting crypto legislation, warned the industry against pushing for a “watered-down” version of the long-awaited stablecoin legislation currently moving through the Senate, arguing that stringent regulations are necessary to foster innovation and protect investors from bank runs like the one on Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in 2022. Speaking at the D.C. Blockchain Summit in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, Gillibrand said that the bipartisan stablecoin bill — Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) — creates a number of protections for consumers in the event of an issuer bankruptcy scenario. “You have to think through all the ways this can go wrong. Something as simple as how you define a dollar — is a Treasury the same as a dollar? What happens if your 1-to-1 backing is all in Treasuries and you have an interest rate misalignment like SVB just did, and you have a run on your stablecoin and all your dollar-to-dollar backing is in a three-month Treasury that you can’t get out of – that’s a run on your stablecoin, that’s a collapse,” Gillibrand said. If dollar-backing requirements are not met or enforced, Gillibrand said: “You’ll just have another FTX. You’ll just have another algorithmic stablecoin that plunges because it never really made sense. That is a huge problem for the U.S. market.” “The worst thing we could do is water it down,” Gillibrand said. “Do not think that a watered-down bill will help your industry. It will destroy your industry. Because one more SVB, one more algorithmic stablecoin [collapse], just continues to create such uncertainty that nobody wants to do business in the United States.” After years of false starts, stablecoin legislation appears to finally be gaining momentum. Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the GENIUS Act to a Senate-wide vote. A similar bill from the U.S. House of Representatives is expected to go public on Wednesday. Read more: U.S. House Stablecoin Bill Poised to Go Public Lawmaker Atop Crypto Panel Says Gillibrand said that if Congress is able to get the GENIUS Act signed into law, it is then more likely to be able to make progress on a market structure bill. “A market structure bill is much more complex. It regulates the entire industry, not just one version of a digital asset,” Gillibrand said. “So it’s really important that we do this right so we can move to something much bigger, and something we need to build even broader consensus around.” A market structure bill would create a regulatory framework for the crypto industry as a whole, giving crypto companies and digital asset issuers clearer rules of the road and a framework to determine whether their tokens are securities or not — and therefore, who their primary regulator is. Speaking on the same panel, Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) suggested that any digital asset with a centralized issuer is likely to be a security, not a commodity. “If your digital currency has a CEO it's not a commodity, by definition,” Moreno said. During another panel discussion at the same event on Wednesday, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), said the future market structure bill would need to “find a way to create a structure that works beyond the two major categories” of security vs. commodity. Moreno said he wanted to see the GENIUS Act passed before the August recess. “I’m gonna lay out the gauntlet — let’s get this done by August recess, what do you think? Markets structure, GENIUS Act, [Strategic Bitcoin Reserve], all done by August,” Moreno said. Gillibrand tempered expectations, telling Moreno that there was no way to get a market structure bill done by August, but that Congress is “definitely going to get stablecoins done” before the summer break — perhaps, she amended, even before the Easter recess in April, “if we’re really productive.”",Policy|Stablecoins|stablecoin bill|Kirsten Gillibrand,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-26 20:32:47

(NYSE: GME) announced today that it intends to raise $1.3 billion through a private offering of convertible senior notes and will use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin. The move comes a day after the company revealed an update to its investment policy, allowing Bitcoin to be used as a treasury reserve asset. BREAKING: GameStop $GME to raise $1.3 billion to buy #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/2sO1ZplK2V — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 26, 2025 The offering consists of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2030. Additionally, the company plans to grant initial purchasers an option to buy up to $200 million more in notes within a 13-day period from the first issuance date. The notes will be general unsecured obligations and will not bear regular interest or accrete in value. They will mature on April 1, 2030, unless converted, redeemed, or repurchased earlier. Upon conversion, GameStop will have the option to settle in cash, shares of its Class A common stock, or a combination of both. The initial conversion rate and other terms will be determined at the time of pricing. The company stated that it expects to use the U.S. composite volume-weighted average price of its stock from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on the pricing date as the reference for the initial conversion price. GameStop emphasized that neither the notes nor any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion have been or will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities laws. As a result, they may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption. The company also stated that there are no assurances that the offering will be completed as described or at all. This marks a significant financial decision for GameStop as it pivots toward integrating Bitcoin into its corporate strategy. A strategy pioneered by Strategy’s Michael Saylor, who met with GameStop’s CEO Ryan Cohen in person last month, and has definitely appeared to have had an influence on the GameStop’s decision to embrace BTC as a reserve asset.

Senator Cynthia Lummis has expressed support for the strategic reserve, suggesting that holding Bitcoin for 20 years could help reduce the U.S. national debt by half and assist in balancing the federal budget.

To read full editions, subscribe . While Casey was in DC, I traveled to Las Vegas for the Exchange ETF conference. I didn’t gamble, but rather spent time reflecting (through a crypto lens) on all that’s changed since I last attended the event three years ago. Then… In 2022, tech entrepreneur Pippa Malmgren kicked off the conference by labeling Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs as a “revolution in finance.” Michael Saylor called a speech by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen bullish for digital assets. Fidelity revealed the launch dates for its crypto industry and metaverse ETFs. Meanwhile, then-Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said his firm wouldn’t rule out suing the SEC if the agency rejected its proposal to convert GBTC to an ETF. Three years ago, crypto was a shiny object that TradFi was getting more acquainted with. A couple months after that event in 2022, the SEC declined Grayscale’s bid, and the asset manager did indeed sue. The firm’s eventual legal victory would help lead to the approval of US spot BTC funds in January 2024. The crypto vibes at Exchange 2024 were thus strong, I was told, amid post-ETF launch euphoria. …and now As I strolled the main expo hall at Virgin Hotels this week, the crypto presence remained evident. An F1 racecar (yes, a real one) sat in front of Kraken subsidiary CF Benchmarks’ booth. Franklin Templeton and VanEck gave away hats emblazoned with their crypto ETF tickers. On Grayscale’s table sat hardcover books detailing bitcoin’s investment case and FAQs. Still, the crypto hype paled in comparison to last year, multiple people told me, as other topics like private credit and ETF share classes gained attention this time around. Perhaps, some optimistically opined, the tempered crypto fanfare means the maturing asset class is now considered just another segment in the broader investment ecosystem. “It goes without saying [that] crypto’s a part of everybody’s conversation today,” TMX VettaFi’s Cinthia Murphy said — noting product development is moving fast. By now, you know about all the single-asset spot crypto ETF filings (Fidelity added a solana proposal this week). And the plans for existing crypto index funds (i.e. from Franklin Templeton and Hashdex) to ultimately move beyond holding just BTC and ETH. I chatted with Calamos, about its funds that offer bitcoin exposure with downside protection over a specific outcome period; and with Innovator, which last month brought to market a fund guarding against BTC losses greater than 20%. ProShares, whose renowned bitcoin futures ETF was overshadowed when the SEC approved spot products, also had an Exchange booth. Investment Strategist Simeon Hyman said the firm has “innovative stuff coming,” declining to say more. State Street Global Advisors didn’t wish to discuss possible future crypto products after introducing actively managed digital asset portfolios with Galaxy in September. But Chief Business Officer Anna Paglia shouted out the category on stage when urging advisers to explore beyond the traditional 60/40 portfolio. “Look outside of that…whether it is alts, whether it is crypto, or whether it is something else,” she said. “Try to diversify away from what used to be comfortable.” As for some of the other financial titans there, a Charles Schwab rep reiterated the company is “monitoring this space and the regulatory environment closely.” They added that Schwab “plans to offer spot crypto trading after the regulatory environment changes” and that it isn’t counting out launching a spot bitcoin ETF. A Vanguard spokesperson, on the other hand, said its previously stated view on crypto (that it doesn’t belong in a well-balanced, long-term portfolio) hasn’t changed. I asked an executive at JPMorgan Asset Management whether the firm was planning to offer crypto ETFs. Asking not to be named, he didn’t stutter: “No.” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas kicked off a panel yesterday by asking the few hundred people in the room to raise their hand if they thought BTC would next hit $50,000 or $150,000. A clear majority (perhaps 70%) went with the latter. He went on to ask whether the crowd thought BTC hitting $1 million per coin was more likely than it dropping to “zeroish.” Nearly everyone who put a hand up took the bullish stance, minus two skeptics in the front row.

The decision, which was reached by consensus among Hyperliquid’s relatively small number of validators, flagged existing concerns about the popular network’s perceived centralization. “Despite presenting itself as an innovative decentralized exchange with a bold vision, Hyperliquid operates more like an offshore [centralized exchange],” Chen said, after saying “Hyperliquid may be on track to become FTX 2.0.” FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of fraud in the US after FTX’s abrupt collapse in 2022. Chen did not accuse Hyperliquid of specific legal infractions, instead emphasizing what she considered to be Hyperliquid’s “immature, unethical, and unprofessional” response to the event. “The decision to close the $JELLY market and force settlement of positions at a favorable price sets a dangerous precedent,” Chen said. “Trust—not capital—is the foundation of any exchange and once lost, it’s almost impossible to recover.” Source: Gracy Chen Related: Hyperliquid delists JELLY perps, citing ‘suspicious’ activity JELLY incident The JELLY token was launched in January by Venmo co-founder Iqram Magdon-Ismail as part of a Web3 social media project dubbed JellyJelly. It initially reached a market capitalization of roughly $250 million before falling to the single digit millions in the ensuing weeks, according to DexScreener. On March 26, JELLY’s market cap soared to around $25 million after Binance, the world’s most popular crypto exchange, launched its own perpetual futures tied to the token. The same day, a Hyperliquid trader “opened a massive $6M short position on JellyJelly” and then “deliberately self-liquidated by pumping JellyJelly’s price on-chain,” Abhi, founder of Web3 company AP Collective, said in an X post. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes said initial reactions to Hyperliquid’s JELLY incident overestimated the network’s potential reputational risks. “Let’s stop pretending hyperliquid is decentralised. And then stop pretending traders actually [care],” Hayes said in an X post. “Bet you $HYPE is back where [it] started in short order cause degens gonna degen.” Binance launched JELLY perps on March 26. Source: Binance Growing pains On March 12, Hyperliquid grappled with a similar crisis caused by a whale who intentionally liquidated a roughly $200 million long Ether ( ETH ) position. The trade cost depositors into Hyperliquid’s liquidity pool, HLP, roughly $4 million in losses after forcing the pool to unwind the trade at unfavorable prices. Since then, Hyperliquid has increased collateral requirements for open positions to “reduce the systemic impact of large positions with hypothetical market impact upon closing.” Hyperliquid operates the most popular leveraged perpetuals trading platform, controlling roughly 70% of market share, according to a January report by asset manager VanEck. Perpetual futures, or “perps,” are leveraged futures contracts with no expiry date. Traders deposit margin collateral, such as USDC, to secure open positions. According to L2Beat, Hyperliquid has two main validator sets, each comprising four validators. By comparison, rival chains such as Solana and Ethereum are supported by approximately 1,000 and 1 million validators, respectively. More validators generally lessen the risk of a small group of insiders manipulating a blockchain. Magazine: What are native rollups?

42444381,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143572,1743021630,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alert: Massive $7.23M MOVE Token Transfer Sparks DWF Labs Speculation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/massive-move-token-dwf-labs/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, large token movements often signal significant shifts in market dynamics or strategic plays by major players. Recently, a substantial transfer of MOVE tokens has caught the attention of on-chain analysts and crypto enthusiasts alike. A staggering 13.35 million MOVE tokens, valued at $7.23 million, have been moved from a project treasury to an address flagged as potentially linked to DWF Labs. This significant crypto transfer has ignited speculation and discussions within the crypto community. Let’s dive deeper into what this could mean and why it matters. Decoding the $7.23M MOVE Token Transfer: What Happened? On-chain data reveals that approximately 13.35 million MOVE tokens were transferred from the project’s treasury to an address identified by Arkham Intelligence as possibly associated with DWF Labs . This transaction, worth millions of dollars, immediately raised eyebrows due to DWF Labs’ prominent role as a market maker and investment firm in the crypto space. According to the vigilant on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X (formerly Twitter), the originating address has a history of interacting with wallets connected to other major players like Wintermute and Jump Crypto. This adds a layer of complexity and uncertainty to pinpointing the exact recipient. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key details: Amount Transferred: 13.35 million MOVE tokens Value: $7.23 million (at the time of transfer) Source: Project Treasury Possible Recipient: Address linked to DWF Labs (speculated) Analyst Insight: Source address interacted with Wintermute & Jump Crypto wallets Current MOVE Price: $0.5159 (as per CoinMarketCap) 24-Hour Price Change: Up 14.68% The timing of this transfer is also noteworthy. MOVE is experiencing a positive price surge, climbing nearly 15% in the last 24 hours. This price action, coupled with the large token movement, naturally leads to questions about potential market impacts and the intentions behind the transfer. Why is DWF Labs in the Spotlight? DWF Labs is a global digital asset market maker and multi-stage web3 investment firm. They are known for providing liquidity to cryptocurrency exchanges and projects, often through large token purchases or strategic investments. Their involvement can significantly influence a token’s market dynamics, price volatility, and overall ecosystem health. When an address is linked to DWF Labs, it’s crucial to understand their potential role and impact. Here’s why DWF Labs’ potential involvement is significant: Market Making Expertise: DWF Labs specializes in providing liquidity, which can stabilize token prices and improve trading conditions. Investment Capacity: As an investment firm, they often acquire tokens to support projects they believe in, potentially leading to long-term growth. Influence on Tokenomics: Large token holders like DWF Labs can have a say in project governance and tokenomics, impacting future developments. Speculation and Market Sentiment: News of DWF Labs’ involvement often generates buzz and speculation, affecting market sentiment and investor behavior. On-Chain Analysis: Unraveling the Transaction Details On-chain analysis is crucial in understanding cryptocurrency transactions. By examining blockchain data, analysts can trace token movements, identify wallet addresses, and uncover patterns that might not be visible through traditional market data. In this case, the role of on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa is vital. Their observation that the source address has interacted with wallets of Wintermute and Jump Crypto adds complexity to the narrative. Let’s break down the importance of on-chain analysis: Transparency: Blockchain transactions are public and traceable, allowing for transparent investigation. Identifying Key Players: On-chain analysis helps identify entities involved in large transactions, like potentially DWF Labs in this case. Detecting Patterns: Analyzing transaction history can reveal patterns of accumulation, distribution, or strategic movements of tokens. Risk Assessment: On-chain data can be used to assess risks associated with specific tokens or projects by understanding token distribution and activity. MOVE Tokens: Riding the Price Surge MOVE tokens , the subject of this significant transfer, are currently experiencing a notable price increase. According to CoinMarketCap, MOVE is trading at $0.5159, marking a 14.68% jump in the last 24 hours. This price surge could be related to the large token transfer, or it might be driven by broader market trends or project-specific developments. Understanding the catalysts behind this price movement is essential for investors and traders. Key points about MOVE token’s current situation: Positive Price Momentum: MOVE is showing strong positive price action in the short term. Potential Catalysts: The price increase could be due to the DWF Labs related transfer, broader market recovery, or project-specific news. Trading Volume: Increased trading volume often accompanies price surges, indicating heightened market interest. Market Sentiment: Positive price action can further boost market sentiment and attract more investors. Cryptocurrency News and Market Speculation In the cryptocurrency news cycle, events like this MOVE token transfer are significant. They fuel market speculation, drive trading activity, and shape investor sentiment. The crypto market is highly sensitive to news, and large token movements involving known entities like DWF Labs can quickly become trending topics. It’s crucial to approach such news with a balanced perspective, considering both potential opportunities and risks. How does such news impact the crypto market? Increased Volatility: Significant transfers can increase price volatility, creating both trading opportunities and risks. Market Sentiment Shift: News can quickly shift market sentiment from bullish to bearish or vice versa. Investor Behavior: News influences investor decisions, leading to buying or selling pressure. Media Coverage: Events like this are widely covered in crypto news outlets, further amplifying their impact. What’s Next? Actionable Insights and Potential Scenarios So, what does this all mean for MOVE token holders and the broader crypto market? While the exact intentions behind the crypto transfer remain unclear, several scenarios are plausible: Market Making Agreement: DWF Labs might be involved in a market making agreement with the MOVE project, requiring them to hold a significant amount of tokens to provide liquidity. Strategic Investment: DWF Labs could be making a strategic investment in the MOVE project, acquiring tokens for long-term holding and ecosystem support. OTC Trade: The transfer could be part of an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, where large volumes of tokens are exchanged privately. Treasury Management: The project treasury might be diversifying its holdings or rebalancing its portfolio. Actionable Insights for Readers: Stay Informed: Keep tracking on-chain data and follow reputable crypto news sources for updates on this situation. Manage Risk: Be cautious when trading MOVE tokens due to potential volatility from market speculation. Do Your Research: Understand the fundamentals of the MOVE project and DWF Labs before making investment decisions. Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Track wallet activity and transaction patterns to gain deeper insights into market movements. Conclusion: Navigating the Dynamic Crypto Landscape The $7.23 million MOVE token transfer to an address possibly linked to DWF Labs is a significant event in the crypto world. It underscores the importance of on-chain analysis, market monitoring, and staying informed in this rapidly evolving landscape. Whether this transfer signifies a strategic partnership, market making activities, or simply treasury management, it highlights the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets and the constant interplay between projects, market makers, and investors. As the story unfolds, keeping a close watch on further developments will be crucial for understanding the true implications of this intriguing token movement.

42444720,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143573,1743022227,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Explosive Bitcoin Prediction: Bernstein Forecasts MicroStrategy’s Holdings to Double, Targets $600!",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microstrategy-bitcoin-holdings-price-target/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The latest buzz from Wall Street is electrifying, especially if you’re keeping a close watch on Bitcoin and corporate strategies. Bernstein, a well-regarded research and brokerage firm, has just dropped a bombshell of a prediction that could send ripples through the crypto market. They foresee MicroStrategy, now known as just Strategy but forever etched in our minds as the Bitcoin-hoarding pioneer, potentially doubling its already massive Bitcoin treasury. Yes, you read that right – doubling! Let’s dive into this exciting forecast and unpack what it could mean for the future of Bitcoin and institutional adoption. Unpacking Bernstein’s Bullish Bitcoin Price Prediction for MicroStrategy Bernstein’s analysis isn’t just a shot in the dark; it’s a calculated projection based on a bullish outlook for Bitcoin itself. The firm, known for its in-depth market research, has reiterated an “outperform” rating for MicroStrategy, setting an ambitious price target of $600. This isn’t just about MicroStrategy’s stock price; it’s deeply intertwined with their Bitcoin strategy and the potential for exponential growth in the crypto space. Here’s a breakdown of Bernstein’s key points: Doubling Down on Bitcoin Holdings: Bernstein envisions MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings surging to over 1 million BTC in a bull case scenario. That’s a staggering 5% of the total Bitcoin supply! Sky-High Price Target: The firm maintains a $600 price target for MicroStrategy, signaling strong confidence in both the company and Bitcoin’s future. Bitcoin to $200,000 by 2025: Underpinning this bullish outlook is Bernstein’s projection that Bitcoin will reach a monumental $200,000 by late 2025. Valuing the Treasury: Bernstein values MicroStrategy by combining its core software business with its massive BTC treasury, currently holding over 506,000 BTC worth approximately $44 billion. Manageable Leverage: Despite MicroStrategy’s aggressive capital raises through equity and preferred shares to acquire more Bitcoin, Bernstein considers their leverage to be manageable. Why is MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy Under the Spotlight? MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with institutional Bitcoin strategy. Their bold move to adopt Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset has been both lauded and scrutinized. But there’s no denying its impact. Here’s why their strategy is so closely watched: First Mover Advantage: MicroStrategy was one of the first publicly traded companies to make a significant investment in Bitcoin, setting a precedent for others to follow. Massive Bitcoin Accumulation: Their consistent accumulation of Bitcoin, regardless of market fluctuations, demonstrates a strong conviction in its long-term value. Performance Indicator: MicroStrategy’s stock price is increasingly seen as a proxy for Bitcoin itself, making it a key indicator for crypto market sentiment. Corporate Treasury Revolution: Their strategy has sparked discussions about Bitcoin as a legitimate corporate treasury asset, potentially revolutionizing how companies manage their reserves. What Does a $600 Price Target Mean for Investors? Bernstein’s $600 price target for MicroStrategy isn’t just a number; it’s a beacon of potential opportunity. For investors, this target suggests significant upside potential. But what are the key factors driving this optimistic outlook? Factor Impact on Price Target Bitcoin Price Appreciation As Bitcoin’s price rises towards Bernstein’s $200,000 target, the value of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings increases dramatically, directly boosting its stock price. Software Business Growth While Bitcoin is a major driver, MicroStrategy’s underlying software business provides a stable revenue stream, contributing to the overall valuation. Investor Sentiment Positive sentiment towards Bitcoin and MicroStrategy’s institutional Bitcoin strategy can further propel the stock price as more investors seek exposure. Potential for Bitcoin Adoption Continued adoption of Bitcoin by institutions and corporations would validate MicroStrategy’s pioneering move and potentially increase demand for its stock. Navigating the Path to 1 Million BTC: Challenges and Opportunities While Bernstein’s forecast paints a rosy picture, the path to MicroStrategy holding 1 million BTC and reaching a $600 price target won’t be without its bumps. What are some potential challenges and opportunities that lie ahead? Challenges: Bitcoin Volatility: The inherent volatility of Bitcoin remains a significant risk. Sharp price drops could impact MicroStrategy’s balance sheet and investor confidence. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory attention on cryptocurrencies could create headwinds for Bitcoin and companies heavily invested in it. Execution Risk: MicroStrategy’s strategy relies on continued access to capital to acquire more Bitcoin. Market conditions or investor sentiment could impact their ability to raise funds. Opportunities: Bitcoin Bull Market Surge: A sustained Bitcoin bull market, as predicted by Bernstein, would be the most significant catalyst for MicroStrategy’s growth. Increased Institutional Adoption: If more institutions follow MicroStrategy’s lead and allocate capital to Bitcoin, it could drive demand and further validate their strategy. Innovation in Bitcoin Financial Products: The development of new Bitcoin-based financial products could unlock further value for MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings. Actionable Insights: Is MicroStrategy a Buy? Bernstein’s “outperform” rating and $600 price target certainly suggest a bullish outlook for MicroStrategy. But is it a buy for every investor? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Risk Tolerance: Investing in MicroStrategy is essentially taking a leveraged bet on Bitcoin. Investors should assess their risk tolerance and understand the volatility associated with both Bitcoin and MicroStrategy’s stock. Long-Term Perspective: Bernstein’s forecast is based on a long-term view of Bitcoin’s potential. Investors should adopt a similar long-term perspective if considering MicroStrategy. Diversification: As with any investment, diversification is key. MicroStrategy should be part of a well-diversified portfolio, not the sole holding. Due Diligence: Conduct thorough research on MicroStrategy, Bitcoin, and the broader crypto market before making any investment decisions. Understand the risks and potential rewards. Conclusion: A Bold Vision for Bitcoin’s Future Bernstein’s projection of MicroStrategy potentially holding over 1 million Bitcoin and their $600 price target is undoubtedly a bold vision. It underscores the growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and the transformative potential of institutional Bitcoin strategy . While challenges remain, the opportunities presented by a surging Bitcoin market and increasing institutional adoption are undeniable. MicroStrategy’s journey continues to be a fascinating case study in corporate Bitcoin adoption, and Bernstein’s analysis offers a compelling glimpse into what the future might hold.

In a letter sent to key lawmakers, including Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, the industry argues that the DOJ’s stance on Section 1960—first introduced in an August 2023 indictment — deviates from existing Treasury Department guidance. The signatories, including Coinbase , Paradigm, and Kraken , claim that the interpretation disregards the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s 2019 guidelines, which state that developers who do not take custody of user funds are not money transmitters. “The DOJ’s new policy position…creates confusion and ambiguity with the spectre of criminal liability,” the letter states. “Essentially, every blockchain developer could be prosecuted as a criminal.” You might also like: Hyperliquid removes JELLY amid market manipulation accusations, promises refunds Crypto’s ‘unlicensed’ money transmitter businesses Section 1960 of the U.S. Code criminalizes the operation of an “unlicensed money transmitting business.” However, crypto firms argue that this should apply only to custodial services that actually hold and transfer user funds, not non-custodial software providers. Courts have historically referenced FinCEN’s regulations to determine compliance, but the DOJ’s recent legal actions — such as those against Tornado Cash developers — suggest a broader interpretation that could lead to more prosecutions. The letter warns that unless Congress intervenes, U.S. crypto innovation could be stifled, pushing developers overseas. “The federal government should not be playing a game of bait and switch,” the letter reads. “Congress should urge the DOJ to correct its misapplication of the law, and clarify Section 1960 to more clearly convey Congress’s intent.” You might also like: Revolut launches mobile crypto app for U.K. and EEA users",News|DOJ|transactions|US Congress,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-26 20:54:45

The company plans to finance the purchase through debt financing. After markets closed on March 26, GameStop announced a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. The convertible senior notes — debt that can later be converted into equity — will be used for general corporate purposes, including acquiring Bitcoin, according to a company statement. “GameStop expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy,” it said. The company revealed on March 25 plans to use a portion of its corporate cash or future debt to buy digital assets , including Bitcoin and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins. GameStop’s cash reserves stood at $4.77 billion on Feb. 1 compared to $921.7 million one year earlier. According to Google Finance, GameStop shares closed at $28.36 on the NYSE, marking an 11.65% gain for the day. GameStop stock performance on March 26. Source: Google Finance The company reported a net income of $131.3 million for Q4 2024 compared to $63.1 million for the prior year Q4. Although net sales had fallen $511 million year-over-year, the company has been aggressively cutting expenses, including closing 590 stores throughout the United States in 2024. GameStop was once at the center of the 2021 meme stock craze when retail traders orchestrated a “short squeeze” that sent the price of the stock soaring. Some hedge funds closed down as a result of losses sustained during the short squeeze, giving the GameStop meme stock rise a “David vs. Goliath” narrative.

The company’s board signed off on the decision the same day, and the stock shot up 11.7% before market close, making GameStop the top performer on the S&P 500. The info was published in an official press release from GameStop Corp.. The notes will be sold only to people the company believes qualify as institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. The deal also gives the initial buyers a 13-day window to grab up to $200 million more in notes, if they want. If that full option gets picked up, the total could hit $1.5 billion. The sale is not public. It’s private and won’t be registered under any U.S. securities laws, federal or state. GameStop offers debt with no interest, flexible repayment, and a hard deadline The notes won’t pay interest. Not monthly. Not annually. Nothing. The principal won’t grow either. The total stays flat until April 1, 2030, which is when the notes come due—unless they’re converted, redeemed, or bought back before that. GameStop has full control over how it pays investors when the time comes. If holders choose to convert, they’ll get cash, Class A common stock, or some mix of both. The company decides. The Class A shares have a par value of $0.001 per share, and the conversion rate, repurchase rights, and other details will be finalized during pricing. The conversion price will be based on the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of GameStop Class A stock on the pricing day, specifically between 1:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time. The company hasn’t given a date yet for when pricing will take place. No part of this offer will be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. That means nobody in the U.S. can buy or sell these notes—unless they meet some very specific conditions or exemptions. The notes, and any Class A shares that could result from converting them, are legally blocked from being sold to or on behalf of U.S. persons unless those terms are met. The company made it clear that the announcement is not an invitation to buy or sell anything. It’s not a pitch, it’s not a solicitation, and it doesn’t give any guarantees. If the deal doesn’t go through, it doesn’t go through. GameStop didn’t promise anything about the outcome. GameStop goes in on Bitcoin as markets react to tariff news The Bitcoin buy isn’t just an idea. It’s already been signed off by GameStop’s board of directors. On Tuesday, the board approved a plan to use a portion of corporate cash to acquire Bitcoin, just like MicroStrategy has done. The company confirmed that this purchase will be done in line with GameStop’s internal Investment Policy, but it didn’t share what that policy looks like or how much Bitcoin they plan to buy. The same day the plan was approved, GameStop stock spiked. It rose 11.7%, pushing it ahead of every other stock on the S&P 500. That’s a big deal for a company that once lived in meme-stock territory. The entire move happened on the back of this single announcement. The overall market didn’t look great on Wednesday. The S&P 500 dropped 1.12% to 5,712.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 132.71 points, or 0.31%, at 42,454.79. The Nasdaq Composite took the biggest hit, falling 2.04% and closing at 17,899.01. The drop was tied to a rough day for tech stocks. Nvidia shares fell close to 6%, while Meta Platforms and Amazon each dropped more than 2%. Alphabet, parent company of Google, lost over 3%, and Tesla dropped more than 5%. Most of the damage came from fresh tension over new tariffs. The White House told reporters that President Donald Trump will reveal new auto import tariffs during a 4:00 p.m. ET press conference. The news hit right before market close, sending shares of General Motors and Stellantis down more than 3% each. The tariff wave doesn’t end there. A wider set of trade penalties is expected to be announced next week. On Tuesday, Trump said the new tariffs will likely be “more lenient than reciprocal.” That’s a softer stance compared to past rhetoric. The comments followed earlier reports that suggested the new duties could be sector-specific, with some of them even delayed. Every part of this week’s volatility—the Bitcoin buy, the stock spike, the notes offering, and the market dip—happened in a tight two-day window. It’s a lot of action, and none of it feels like a one-off. GameStop is now officially deep in crypto, stacking cash through private debt, and riding the edge of the S&P 500 like it’s 2021 all over again.

Tech giant Amazon, a name synonymous with e-commerce, is once again at the forefront of this revolution. They’ve just dropped a game-changing feature called ‘Interests,’ embedding Generative AI Shopping directly into your fingertips. Forget generic searches; prepare for a hyper-personalized, almost conversational shopping journey that promises to redefine how we discover and purchase products online. For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals always on the lookout for cutting-edge innovations, Amazon’s latest move is a powerful indicator of AI’s growing influence, even beyond the digital currency realm. What is Amazon’s ‘Interests’ Feature and Why Should You Care About Personalized Shopping Experience? Imagine telling Amazon exactly what you’re in the mood for, not through rigid keywords, but through natural, everyday language. That’s the core idea behind ‘Interests.’ This isn’t just another incremental update; it’s a leap towards a truly Personalized Shopping Experience . Instead of sifting through endless pages of irrelevant results, you can now use tailored prompts to articulate your needs. Think of it as having a super-smart shopping assistant who actually ‘gets’ you. Here’s how it works: Conversational Search: Type in prompts that reflect your hobbies, needs, or even budget. Examples include “gifts for board game enthusiasts under $50” or “sustainable fashion for eco-conscious shoppers.” AI-Powered Understanding: The magic lies in the large language models (LLMs) working behind the scenes. These sophisticated AI systems translate your natural language into precise queries that Amazon’s search engine can understand. Proactive Product Discovery: ‘Interests’ doesn’t stop at search. It continuously monitors for new arrivals, restocks, and deals that align with your stated interests, sending you timely notifications. Currently rolling out to select U.S. users on iOS and Android apps and mobile websites, ‘Interests’ is poised to become a standard feature for Amazon shoppers. This move isn’t just about convenience; it’s about anticipating and fulfilling customer desires in a way that feels intuitive and almost… human. Diving Deeper into AI-Powered Search: How ‘Interests’ Transforms Product Discovery The true innovation of ‘Interests’ lies in its AI-Powered Search capabilities. Traditional search engines rely on keyword matching, often leading to results that are technically relevant but miss the mark on user intent. ‘Interests’ bridges this gap by understanding the nuances of human language. Let’s break down the benefits: Feature Traditional Search Amazon ‘Interests’ Search Input Keywords (often requiring precise terminology) Natural language prompts, reflecting interests and preferences Search Understanding Keyword matching Semantic understanding via LLMs, interpreting context and intent Result Relevance Potentially broad and sometimes irrelevant results Highly tailored and relevant product suggestions Product Discovery Reactive (user initiates search) Proactive (AI notifies users of relevant new items, deals) By leveraging the power of generative AI, Amazon is moving beyond simply responding to searches; they are anticipating needs and curating experiences. This shift has profound implications for the future of online retail. The Broader E-commerce AI Landscape: Are Others Following Suit? Amazon isn’t alone in recognizing the transformative potential of E-commerce AI . The race to create more intelligent and personalized shopping experiences is heating up across the industry. As the article rightly points out, Google has also been making significant strides in this domain. Their recent upgrades to the Shopping tab, including ‘Vision Match’ and AI summary tools, demonstrate a clear trend towards AI-driven enhancements in online retail. Here’s a glimpse into how other companies are exploring AI in e-commerce: Personalized Recommendations: Beyond simple collaborative filtering, AI is enabling hyper-personalized product recommendations based on browsing history, purchase behavior, stated preferences, and even real-time contextual data. AI-Powered Chatbots: Customer service is being revolutionized by AI chatbots capable of handling complex queries, providing product information, and even assisting with purchases, offering instant support 24/7. Dynamic Pricing and Promotions: AI algorithms are optimizing pricing strategies and personalized promotions in real-time, based on demand, competitor pricing, and individual customer profiles. Visual Search and Product Recognition: Tools like Google’s ‘Vision Match’ are enabling shoppers to find products simply by describing or showing an image of what they are looking for, bridging the gap between visual inspiration and online shopping. The integration of AI into e-commerce is no longer a futuristic concept; it’s happening now, and it’s rapidly evolving. For businesses, embracing these technologies is becoming crucial to stay competitive and meet the rising expectations of digitally savvy consumers. Unlocking the Potential of the Amazon Interests Feature: What Does it Mean for the Future of Shopping? Amazon’s ‘Interests’ feature, while currently in its early stages, offers a tantalizing glimpse into the future of shopping. The implications are vast and potentially transformative, not just for consumers but for the entire e-commerce ecosystem. Consider these potential future developments and benefits of the Amazon Interests Feature : Enhanced Product Discovery: ‘Interests’ could drastically reduce the ‘paradox of choice’ by filtering out irrelevant products and surfacing items that genuinely align with individual tastes and needs. Increased Customer Engagement: By proactively notifying users of relevant deals and new products, ‘Interests’ can foster a more continuous and engaging relationship between customers and the platform. Boost in Sales and Conversions: Personalized recommendations and timely notifications are likely to drive higher conversion rates and increased sales for Amazon and its sellers. Evolution of Search Behavior: As AI-powered search becomes more sophisticated, we may see a shift away from keyword-based searching towards more natural and conversational queries, fundamentally changing how we interact with online search engines. However, with these advancements also come considerations. Data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for over-personalization are crucial aspects that need careful attention as AI becomes more deeply integrated into our shopping experiences. Conclusion: Embracing the AI-Driven Retail Revolution Amazon’s ‘Interests’ feature is more than just a new shopping tool; it’s a bold step towards an AI-powered future of retail. By leveraging the power of generative AI to create Generative AI Shopping experiences, Amazon is setting a new standard for personalization and convenience. As other companies follow suit and the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative and intelligent shopping experiences emerge. For consumers, this means a more seamless, efficient, and enjoyable way to discover and purchase products online.

The firm assessed the state of the BTC market using the Bitcoin Composite Market Index (BCMI), which combines key on-chain and sentiment metrics. BCMI offers a structured assessment of Bitcoin market health by integrating four main indicators with the following weights: Market Value – Realized Value (MVRV): 30% (Range: 0.5 – 4.0) Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL): 25% (Range: -0.2 – 0.75) Output Return on Investment Ratio (SOPR): 25% (Range: 0.8 – 1.3) Fear and Greed Index: 20% (Range: 10 – 100) Below 0.15: This indicates extreme market fear and often indicates an oversold market, historically presenting major buying opportunities. Above 0.75: This level signals extreme greed and overbought conditions that often precede market corrections or tops. Related News: Binance's Vote on Which Altcoin to Get Listed Concluded - Here's the Surprise Winning Altcoin According to the latest data from CryptoQuant, the BCMI is currently below 0.5, suggesting that Bitcoin has yet to reach the traditionally overheated territory above 0.75. This puts the market at a crucial point with two possible scenarios, according to analysts: Scenario A: The market is undergoing a healthy correction within a broader bull trend, potentially setting the stage for the next upward move. Scenario B: The market may be signaling an atypically early end to the bull cycle and could potentially transition to bearish conditions earlier than historical trends suggest. CryptoQuant urged traders and investors to closely monitor Bitcoin’s BCMI 7-day and 90-day moving averages for clearer directional signals. The next moves in these indicators could provide valuable insight into Bitcoin’s long-term market trajectory. *This is not investment advice.

According to onchain updates, these Ethereum held on exchanges have reached record lows. Traders and investors are watching this development closely to see how it affects price movements. ETH Supply Squeeze and its Impact The percentage of the second-largest cryptocurrency on centralized crypto exchanges has been spiraling downward, suggesting a possible supply squeeze. Per onchain data, Chain Brief on X disclosed that only 14% of ETH’s total supply is still on centralized crypto exchanges. This marks the lowest level recorded for the second-largest assets. Per historical trends, declines in exchange-held ETH suggest that investors are moving their holdings to private wallets or staking platforms, limiting the available trading supply. The shift also reflects a growing preference for decentralized finance and self-custody. More investors are choosing to hold ETH outside of exchanges, reinforcing Ethereum’s position as a long-term asset. If demand continues to increase, the limited supply on exchanges could soon set the stage for strong price movements. The Ethereum Consolidation In line with the current market position, data shows that Ethereum’s price direction has entered a consolidation phase after pushing past the psychological level of $2,000. In an X post, Adam Horton, a vocal crypto trader and analyst, shared that ETH is now moving sideways. The coin is stabilizing above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key support level for traders. While the market remains calm, some analysts believe Ethereum is preparing for its next breakout. An earlier ETH price analysis shows a potential breakout to $4,000 is looming amid a sustained consolidation in tight ranges below $2,000. Can Ethereum Price Hit $10,000? Recent developments have led market experts to believe the Ethereum price is on its way to $10,000. For example, recent data on X from Crypto Elites shows that the ETH price breakout agenda has already begun. Per the update, traders and investors may see a positive price swing at any moment. Essentially, this speculation is based on a combination of factors beyond its supply dynamics. It encompasses institutional adoption, Ethereum’s ongoing Pectra upgrades , and operational ETF filings. Inadvertently, as more ETH leaves centralized exchanges and long-term holders accumulate, the conditions for a significant price surge are forming. The Ethereum community is now closely watching for immediate catalysts that could fuel this upward momentum. If demand continues to grow and supply remains limited, Ethereum could be heading for new all-time highs toward the $10,000 mark.

I'm Ben Schiller. In this issue: Ethereum’s Final Pectra Test Goes Live Hyperliquid Eases Token Transfers for DeFi Celo Migration to Layer-2 Network Is Done Bitcoin DeFi Expansion Faces Fork Dilemma This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol , our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Network news IT’S ALIVE! ETHEREUM PECTRA TEST: The final dress rehearsal for Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade occurred Wednesday, as the blockchain's biggest changes in over a year were tested an additional time following a series of mishaps. The upgrade on the new Hoodi testnet was closely watched given that two previous tests , on the Holesky and Sepolia test networks, failed to finalize properly. Following those tests, developers created a new testnet , Hoodi, to give ecosystem players, particularly staking providers, one more testing opportunity before the Pectra upgrade hits Ethereum’s mainnet. The test involved passing Hoodi a series of code changes meant to make Ethereum more user-friendly for both end-users as well as developers. One of those changes adds smart contract functionality to wallets, allowing wallet software developers to build new convenience-oriented features, like the ability to pay transaction fees in cryptocurrencies other than ether (ETH). ​​Testnets act as copies of a main blockchain, and are used by developers to run through any major code changes in a low stakes environment, giving them a place to patch out any bugs before they reach mainnet. Hoodi was the last of three testnets to run through a simulation of Pectra. Developers previously agreed that if all went well on Wednesday, Pectra would be monitored for around 30 more days and then, finally, activated on Ethereum's mainnet. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . HYPERLIQUID EASES TOKENS FOR DEFI: The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is among the biggest drivers of value accrual and revenue creation for crypto projects, but its complexity often leaves users tangled in a web of blockchains, bridges, wallets and tokens. A technical update by Hyperliquid is making that process easier for both developers and users, with the direct linking of tokens on HyperCore and HyperEVM platforms now being possible. HyperCore is its native platform for spot assets (think tokens you can trade directly), and HyperEVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) network that executes smart contracts on Ethereum. Tokens on HyperCore, dubbed “Core spot,” can be linked to their counterparts on HyperEVM and are called “EVM spot.” Once linked, users can transfer them using simple actions — like a “spotSend” on HyperCore or a standard ERC-20 transfer on HyperEVM. By letting tokens move directly between them — without a third-party intermediary — developers can create products that cut out the technical chops required to move assets, which is easy for heavy crypto users, but may be challenging for beginners. — Shaurya Malwa Read more . CELO MIGRATION to LAYER-2: The Celo blockchain's long-awaited plan of becoming an Ethereum layer-2 chain has been completed, ending an almost two-year process, the main organizations behind the network said Wednesday. The transition ends a long journey beginning back in July 2023 for the layer-1 blockchain that included a community vote in July 2024 and a fierce competition, won by Optimism , among layer-2 networks out to convince the Celo ecosystem to build with their technology. The improved network — like other layer 2s — offers faster and cheaper transactions on top of Ethereum's mainnet. The blockchain is powered by Optimism’s OP Stack, a customizable framework that lets developers build layer-2 networks based off of Optimism’s technology. According to Rene Reisberg, the CEO of the Celo Foundation, the migration is the first of its kind in the Ethereum ecosystem, and will probably be used as a blueprint for other EVM-compatible blockchains that are looking to become a layer-2 network. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . BITCOIN DEFI FACES FORK DILEMMA: Bitcoin developers looking to expand the blockchain's decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities are likely to be considering zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, functionality that's not currently available and which require a so-called soft fork, or new version of the software, to introduce them. That's a problem, according Edan Yago, a Bitcoin veteran of over a decade and core contributor to smart contract operating system BitcoinOS (BOS). ""Forking a blockchain, especially one with $2 trillion worth of value on it, is like open-heart surgery,"" he told CoinDesk in an interview. ZK proofs are a cryptographic method of proving the validity of statements while maintaining privacy through not revealing any information about it. The functionality is not available in Bitcoin's software, but could be made so through proposed implementations like OP_CAT and OP_CTV. Yago said developers should be able to find ways of enabling them on Bitcoin without any kind of fork. ""The burden of proof is on developers to demonstrate that there is no other way of accomplishing this through clever engineering,"" he said. This is what BOS hopes to achieve through the BitSNARK, a Bitcoin rollup protocol that is part of the family of computing paradigms being developed to scale the original blockchain. These emerged following the introduction of BitVM by Robin Linus in October 2023 , which set out a framework for how Ethereum-like smart contracts could be enabled on Bitcoin. BitcoinOS has now open-sourced what Yago describes as a ""fully production-ready"" BitSNARK protocol, meaning developers now have access to ZK verification on Bitcoin and can connect it to other blockchains like Ethereum, Solana and Cardano. — Jamie Crawley Read more .

The move came after the perpetual futures DEX reportedly uncovered suspicious market activity, leading to significant financial losses. The series of events that led to Hayes’ comment started with Hyperliquid, a perpetuals decentralized exchange, delisting the JELLY (jellyjelly) token after a series of suspicious trading activities led to Hyperliquid losing over $10 million, with a threatening risk of liquidation. $HYPE can’t handle the $JELLY Let’s stop pretending hyperliquid is decentralised And then stop pretending traders actually give a fuck Bet you $HYPE is back where is started in short order cause degens gonna degen — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 26, 2025 Hyperliquid’s move to avoid liquidation According to on-chain transactions cited by Lookonchain on X (formerly Twitter), a whale address, 0xde95, with 124.6M JELLY($4.85M) manipulated the market by dumping its JELLY tokens, leading to the liquidation of $4.5 million. This led to Hyperliquid taking on a $5 million short position on JELLY. A massive whale with 124.6M $JELLY ($4.85M) is manipulating the price of $JELLY (jellyjelly) to make Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) face a loss of $12M! He first dumped $JELLY , crashing the price and leaving HLP with a passive short position of 398M $JELLY ($15.3M). Then he bought… pic.twitter.com/kYcKshV4rl — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 26, 2025 While all this was happening, a new wallet address, 0x20e8, opened a long position on JELLY. The whale bought back JELLY tokens, thereby driving the prices up and causing serious losses for Hyperliquid. This market squeeze caused JELLY to surge by 230%, raising concerns that if its market cap reached $150 million, Hyperliquid could face full liquidation. Given the imminent threat of liquidation and unusual market activity, Hyperliquid closed all perps, benching and liquidating the JELLY token at $0.0095 per token. Hyperliquid’s validators then voted to delist JELLY from the platform. The DEX reportedly made a profit of approximately 700,000 USDC from the exercise. In an announcement on X , Hyperliquid mentioned that users who invested in the token will be compensated. “All users apart from flagged addresses will be made whole from the Hyper Foundation. This will be done automatically in the coming days based on onchain data. There is no need to open a ticket. Methodology will be shared in detail in a later announcement.” The DEX’s $HYPE token took a hit, falling by 20%. Its token found small relief after it delisted JELLY from DEX. Two leading centralized crypto derivatives exchanges, OKX and Binance have announced that they would be listing JELLY on their perpetual futures (perps) market. Data also showed that most of the funds used to open the positions that attacked Hyperliquid were withdrawn from OKX and Binance. These actions have led to questions about the intention of the centralized exchanges, with some users on X claiming that they are out to see the end of Hyperliquid in a fashion similar to FTX. Criticisms of the delisting move Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, shared her opinion on the matter , criticizing the manner that Hyperliquid handled the issue. According to Chen, the handling is immature, unethical, and unprofessional. She said the platform’s actions led to user losses and have raised serious questions on its integrity. The CEO said that the action sets a dangerous precedent, adding that trust, the foundation of any exchange, whether centralized or decentralized, is impossible to recover when lost. Chen pointed out some product design flaws of the platform, saying that if they don’t get fixed soon, actions similar to the JELLY issue will continue to be weaponized against Hyperliquid, setting it on the path to becoming the next FTX. The CEO of Bitget isn’t alone in her thoughts, as this drama has led to different reactions from the the crypto ecosystem in general. Arthur Hayes echoed the sentiments of the imminent demise of Hyperliquid in a post on X, where he claimed, “$HYPE can’t handle the $JELLY.” He also called for people to stop pretending that Hyperliquid is decentralized, adding that traders don’t care if a platform is centralized or decentralized. The co-founder of BitMex, a centralized exchange, added, “Bet you $HYPE is back where it started in short order cause degens gonna degen.” Responding to Hayes, another X user, @KyleReidhead , and co-owner of Milk Road, said, Degens don’t care about decentralization, they care about trading 24/7 w/o KYC, a service which Hyperliquid renders. Mainstream traders don’t care about decentralization, they care about ease of use. He added that he doesn’t think it means that decentralization doesn’t matter, but to most people, it doesn’t matter if a platform is decentralized or not. A large portion of users and crypto traders have been vocal in condemning Hyperliquid’s move to delist JELLY, calling for it to have allowed the market to decide the fate of the platform given its decentralized nature. Others are calling the action a double standard given the swiftness of the validator’s response, something reminiscent of how a centralized exchange will respond, thereby calling the platform a centralized platform pretending to be decentralized. Hyperliquid, in its X post, said, “Technical improvements will be made, and the network will grow stronger as a result of lessons learned.” It added that it will be sharing more details shortly. The situation continues to unfold, with Hyperliquid’s response under scrutiny and broader concerns about the integrity of decentralized exchanges in the crypto ecosystem.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With a strong presale and a unique approach to tokenization, Rexas Finance could be a Solana competitor with 20x surge potential. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The Solana competitor positioned for 20x gains Certik audit and high security standards The path to a 20x surge Conclusion Investors are searching for the next altcoin with high profit potential as the cryptocurrency market gets more competitive. Among the candidates is Rexas Finance (RXS), currently valued at $0.20. With its novel approach to tokenizing real-world assets (RWA), a quickly increasing community, and a well-structured presale, Rexas Finance is on track to become one of the most significant crypto success stories in 2025. According to experts, this rival to Solana (SOL) could increase 20x, potentially reaching a price of more than $4. Rexas Finance: The Solana competitor positioned for 20x gains Rexas Finance is a platform that aims to simplify the creation and administration of digital assets. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, RXS is based on tokenizing actual assets, allowing users to quickly buy, sell, and trade goods, real estate, art, intellectual property, and more. Entering its twelfth and last presale stage, Rexas Finance has raised around $47.22 million so far. With 91.22% of the project’s $56,000,000 target already filled, this emphasizes the increasing confidence among investors. The team has allowed early investors and the general public to participate in this financial transformation by choosing a public presale over venture capitalist funding. Limiting the presale to individual investors instead of institutional participants shows a dedication to decentralization and growth driven by the community. RXS is preparing for a significant market debut on June 19, 2025 at a price of $0.25. One of the factors boosting Rexas Finance’s credibility is its listing on reputable tracking websites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. These listings have raised investor interest and exposure, increasing the presale pace. Additionally, the team behind Rexas Finance has announced ambitions to list on at least three Tier-1 exchanges. This calculated move will potentially increase demand and liquidity, resulting in a strong post-launch performance. You might also like: Cardano slowly forms a rare pattern, can ADA surge to $6? Certik audit and high security standards Any blockchain startup must prioritize security, and Rexas Finance has done what it needs to to win over investors. The platform has effectively finished an audit with Certik, a top blockchain security company. The Certik audit attests to RXS’s adherence to industry-leading security measures, removing vulnerabilities and assuring investor protection. Additionally, Rexas Finance distinguishes itself from altcoins that rely only on hype with its robust practical applications. The platform allows real-world assets to be tokenized, giving people and companies a simpler way to purchase, sell, and divide ownership of goods from any global location. Rexas Finance is well-suited for the growing tokenized asset trend, which experts believe could change the world financial system. As blockchain use increases, RXS is positioned to become a major player in this trillion-dollar industry. The path to a 20x surge With its solid foundation, successful presale, and strategic plan, Rexas Finance is in a strong position. High investor demand, impending listings on Tier-1 exchanges, and the tokenization of real-world assets all point to a significant rally. As the presale draws to a close, early investors could profit significantly when the token starts trading on well-known platforms. A projected 20x surge would bring RXS to $4, which remains a conservative estimate considering the increasing adoption of RWA-focused blockchain solutions. Conclusion Rexas Finance is proving to be a formidable competitor, offering a transformative approach to real-world asset tokenization. With its presale constantly selling out, a Certik audit strengthening investor confidence, and anticipated significant exchange listings, the token is ready for a massive ascent.

The research, which provided insights into the crypto industry performance for Q1, noted that this increase happened despite the 18% decline in its Crypto Sectors price index. According to the report , which relied on data from Artemis, blockchain-based applications were the biggest fee generator in Q1. The $2.59 billion in fees that these applications pulled in Q1 alone is more than total fees in 2023 and represents a 100% year-over-year (YoY) increase while being 11.7% higher than the previous quarter. Blockchain-based applications made almost $2.6 billion in revenue for Q1 (Source: Grayscale Research) While dApps saw an overall increase in revenue, it was a different story for the blockchain networks. A revenue breakdown shows that smart contract networks recorded only $832 million in revenue for this quarter, which was 46.5% lower than the $1.55 billion in 2024 Q1. It was not just revenue that fell for smart contract platforms during this period, as monthly active users dropped from 199 million in 2024 Q4 to 158 million now. Per the report, this decline across several metrics was caused by the plunge in memecoin trading activity on the Solana network. Blockchain Networks Key Metrics (Source: Grayscale) After reaching 140 million active monthly users in Q4 of 2024, Solana users fell to 90 million in Q1 of 2025. This highlights how important memecoins are for blockchain networks. The report said: “Although memecoins do not claim to offer real-world utility — and can be associated with especially high risks for investors — interest in memecoin trading may have introduced new users to the Solana ecosystem.” Despite Solana’s struggles with reduced memecoin activity, the network was still responsible for $390 million in fees for Q1. This is almost half of all smart contract networks’ revenue, showing its importance among all other networks. Bitcoin struggled in Q1, but the number of holders increased Meanwhile, the flagship crypto network had a unique performance in Q1. In terms of revenue, Bitcoin only generated $48 million in Q1. This represents a 61.6% decline from the $126 million in Q4 of 2024 and an 83.4% decline year over year compared to the $291 million in Q1 of that same year. Despite this decline and the general drop in BTC’s value, the number of those holding BTC increased. Grayscale Research noted that the number of addresses with a balance of $1 or more worth of BTC reached a new high of 46 million, although active users on the network were still 11 million. Bitcoin performance in Q1 (Source: Grayscale Research) The analysts believe that this is a sign of a change in the purpose of Bitcoin for investors and shows that most of the recent demand for Bitcoin is for those who want to hold it rather than use it as a currency. The research said: “The growing difference between these two indicators suggests that recent demand for Bitcoin has likely come from users interested in its function as a “store of value” rather than a “medium of exchange.” Interestingly, the Bitcoin hash rate, which is the amount of computing power on the network, increased during that period, reaching 797 exahash per second. This is an 8% rise compared to the previous quarter and a 41% increase YoY. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has announced plans to host four additional crypto roundtables. Hyperliquid delists JELLY perps, citing ‘suspicious’ activity Hyperliquid has delisted perpetual futures tied to the JELLY token after identifying “evidence of suspicious market activity” involving the trading instruments, the blockchain network said. The Hyper Foundation, Hyperliquid’s ecosystem nonprofit, will reimburse most affected users for any losses related to the incident, Hyperliquid said in a March 26 post on the X platform. “All users apart from flagged addresses will be made whole from the Hyper Foundation,” Hyperliquid said. “This will be done automatically in the coming days based on onchain data.” Hyerliquid added that the perpetuals exchange’s primary liquidity pool, HLP, has clocked a positive net income of around $700,000 in the past 24 hours. The incident began when a trader “opened a massive $6M short position on JellyJelly” and then “deliberately self-liquidated by pumping JellyJelly’s price on-chain,” Abhi, founder of Web3 company AP Collective, said in an X post. Had Hyperliquid not closed the position, the perpetuals exchange could have faced “full liquidation if JellyJelly reaches $150M mcap,” Abhi added. Source: Hyperliquid Gracy Chen, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, later criticized Hyperliquid’s handling of the incident, saying it put the network at risk of becoming “FTX 2.0.” The decision to delist the contracts, which was reached by consensus among Hyperliquid’s relatively small number of validators, flagged existing concerns about the popular network’s perceived centralization. “Despite presenting itself as an innovative decentralized exchange with a bold vision, Hyperliquid operates more like an offshore [centralized exchange],” Chen said, after saying “Hyperliquid may be on track to become FTX 2.0.” Polymarket faces scrutiny over $7 million Ukraine mineral deal bet Polymarket, the world’s largest decentralized prediction market, is under fire after a controversial outcome raised concerns over potential governance manipulation in a high-stakes political bet. A betting market on the platform asked whether US President Donald Trump would accept a rare earth mineral deal with Ukraine before April. Despite no such event occurring, the market was settled as “Yes,” triggering a backlash from users and industry observers. This may point to a “governance attack” in which a whale from the UMA Protocol “used his voting power to manipulate the oracle, allowing the market to settle false results and successfully profit,” according to crypto threat researcher Vladimir S. “The tycoon cast 5 million tokens through three accounts, accounting for 25% of the total votes. Polymarket is committed to preventing this from happening again,” he wrote in a March 26 X post. Source: Vladimir S.

The House version, introduced by Rep. Bryan Steil, who leads the House Financial Services Committee's crypto panel, and Rep. French Hill, the Republican chair of the overall committee, governs the way companies can issue dollar-denominated digital tokens. The new version will ""close the gap"" between the House efforts and the Senate version of the bill, Steil said during a conference appearance Wednesday. The Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) ""is a strong continuation of our work on digital assets in the last Congress,"" Hill said in a statement. The Senate Banking Committee had already advanced its own version of the legislation with a strong bipartisan vote, so it moves on now to consideration on the Senate floor. Rep. Tom Emmer, the House majority whip who has been among Congress' top crypto advocates for years, said the two bills have ""some minor differences that I'm sure can be ironed out.""

Unlikely, But This Altcoin Might",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-cardano-ada-overtake-solana-sol-market-cap-unlikely-but-this-altcoin-might/,"Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have long been battling for dominance, with ADA trading at $0.71 and SOL at $138. While some believe Cardano could surpass Solana in market cap, Solana’s high-speed transactions and growing adoption in DeFi and NFTs make it the stronger performer. Now, Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum after launching its presale. The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale has sold over 70% and continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $4.8 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.025 while attracting more than 6600 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 200% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06 while future forecast estimates predict a value surge past $5 in the near future. If these predictions hold true, MUTM could outpace both ADA and SOL, making it the dark horse of the next bull run. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 6900 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $4.9 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.02 in Phase 3 even though investors anticipate a 25% price increase in Phase 4 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $1 million to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be a major performer in the DeFi market, with over $4.8 million raised and more than 6,600 investors already involved. The presale is quickly selling out, providing early adopters with an opportunity for significant returns.

Recently, the platform’s treasury automatically placed a $5 million short position in JELLY, a digital token. In crypto, a short position is a bet that a token’s price will drop. However, instead of falling, JELLY’s price shot up to $0.16004 within an hour. This sudden surge caused Hyperliquid to lose over $10 million in its short position. Notably, if the price had climbed slightly higher to $0.17, the losses could have reached $240 million. The unusual price movement raised concerns about market manipulation, leading Hyperliquid to remove JELLY from its platform. JELLY’s Price Surge Sparks Manipulation Concerns JELLY’s sudden price spike did not seem natural. One wallet placed a massive short position of 430 million JELLY tokens on the HyperliquidX platform. Shortly after, the same wallet removed its margin, causing $4.5 million in short positions to be liquidated. Hyperliquid treasury had to cover these losses. At the same time, another wallet opened a long position, betting that JELLY’s price would rise. This move increased the token’s price, suggesting a possible market manipulation case. Market manipulation is a big problem in crypto, as bad actors usually exploit loopholes in trading platforms . Enforcement agencies are taking strict action against those involved in such security fraud. Last June, a federal judge in Florida sentenced Michael Kane, the former CEO of Hydrogen Technology Corporation, to 45 months in jail for his role in a crypto price manipulation scheme . Hyperliquid Takes Quick Action Hyperliquid had to act quickly to prevent further losses. The exchange’s validator committee decided to delist JELLY from the platform. The token was force-settled at $0.0095, meaning all short positions were closed at that price to contain the damage. Hyperliquid reassured users that their funds were safe. It also announced that the Hyper Foundation would compensate affected users, except those flagged for suspicious activity. Hyperliquid’s decision is part of a growing trend where decentralized platforms including Binance exchange delist tokens that seem risky or prone to fraud to maintain stability. Community Raised Concerns About Hyperliquid’s Decentralization This incident raised concerns about how decentralized Hyperliquid is. Some experts argued that the platform’s decision to step in and settle trades showed centralized control. This led to debates about whether Hyperliquid operates like a traditional exchange rather than a decentralized platform. The event also raised uncertainty about Hyperliquid’s token, HYPE, with some predicting further price drops . This comes as confidence in the platform is already shaken. Meanwhile, the full impact of this JELLY’s crisis is still unfolding, and many are watching to see how soon Hyperliquid recovers.

Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is attracting growing interest with its ongoing presale and advanced mobile app release. XRP Leads Inflows While Ethereum Continues Downtrend According to CoinShares , XRP recorded the highest altcoin ETP inflows last week, adding $6.71 million, followed closely by Solana with $6.44 million. Despite this, Ethereum recorded outflows of $86 million, extending its four-week streak of negative sentiment. Other altcoins such as Sui, Polkadot, and Tron also saw minor outflows. Total digital asset investment products saw weekly inflows of $644 million, breaking a five-week trend of net outflows. Bitcoin contributed most to this turnaround with $724 million in inflows, largely driven by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). CoinShares noted that the majority of inflows came from the United States. Switzerland, Germany, and Hong Kong followed with smaller contributions. Canada and Sweden saw the highest outflows for the week. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Gains Investor Attention During Presale Phase WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a new entrant in the crypto market, is currently in its presale phase with a token price of $0.0420 . The token has attracted attention for its focus on security, utility, and user experience diverting focus from cryptos like XRP or Ethereum. Investors have responded to the token’s promise of up to 180% annual staking rewards and low transaction fees. WallitIQ (WLTQ) token model is structured with 45% allocated for public sale, 20% for bonuses, and 15% for liquidity, aiming to maintain sustainable distribution and long-term utility. Security has been a central feature of the project, with SolidProof conducting a full audit of its smart contract . The team behind WallitIQ (WLTQ) has also launched its minimum viable product (MVP) version of a mobile app for managing crypto wallets. The app supports simulated ETH and USDT wallet activity, and includes live price data, QR code support, and a simple UI. The application is also built to scale, with plans for AI-powered trading and price alerts. WallitIQ App Offers Secure Wallet Features and Real-Time Data The AI token’s mobile app allows users to simulate wallet transactions for Ethereum and USDT. Users can generate QR codes, view transaction histories, and simulate everyday purchases. Although current transactions are simulated, they provide a realistic experience for users managing crypto assets. CoinGecko’s API powers the app’s live price tracking feature. Users can view real-time pricing and get interactive candlestick charts across multiple timeframes. This functionality is designed to make crypto monitoring more accessible and user-friendly. The app also includes a settings section that previews future capabilities. Planned features include automated trading tools , wallet update alerts, and customizable price notifications. As the app continues to grow, these additions are expected in future updates. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Positioned in a Growing Market With Scalable Potential WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) development roadmap and strategic planning suggest it aims to capture a share of the growing crypto wallet and AI markets. Its focus on usability, security, and low fees supports its efforts to stand out in a competitive space, even potentially outdoing Ethereum or XRP. Furthermore, the team is working on the Physical2Digital feature , which will bridge the gap between physical and digital assets, allowing users to manage both effortlessly on the platform. In addition, the AI token holders are rewarded with community-based benefits, including airdrops, exclusive NFTs, and early access privileges. With a supply of 1 billion tokens and a growing user base, the AI token is preparing for its next milestones, including beta platform launches. Concurrently, the token has already been listed on CoinMarketCap and is expected to list on major exchanges in Q1 2025, a precursor of massive bull rallies.

The second-largest cryptocurrency has faced intense selling pressure in recent weeks, losing over 38% of its value since late February. Panic spread through the market when ETH broke below the key $2,000 level and later plunged under $1,800 — a move that signaled weakness and raised fears of a deeper correction. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above Bullish Daily Pattern – Analyst Sees A Surge To $0.43 Despite the volatility, market sentiment is beginning to shift. Some investors now believe that the worst may be behind Ethereum, and a slow but steady recovery could be on the horizon. Supporting this narrative, on-chain data from Glassnode reveals that Ethereum has reclaimed its realized price at $2,040 — a level that reflects the average price at which all ETH in circulation last moved. This recovery of the realized price is often seen as a subtle but important bullish signal. It suggests that, on average, holders are back in profit, which may help reduce selling pressure and rebuild confidence in the market. For now, Ethereum’s ability to stay above $2,000 will be key to confirming a broader trend reversal. Ethereum Faces Pivotal Moment As Bulls Aim To Confirm Recovery Ethereum is beginning to show signs of life after weeks of uncertainty, but a decisive move is still needed to shift market sentiment. The $2,000 level, recently reclaimed, now acts as the key battleground for bulls attempting to ignite a meaningful recovery. As speculation builds around whether Ethereum will continue to trend higher or fall back into a broader correction, price action remains indecisive. Without strong conviction from buyers, the current bounce may fade quickly. To sustain any upward momentum, bulls must defend the $2,000 level with strength and consistency. A failure to hold this support could invite renewed selling pressure and invalidate early signs of recovery. For now, the price hovers in a critical range with no confirmed trend in either direction. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared an important on-chain signal on X, noting that Ethereum has successfully reclaimed its realized price at $2,040. This level reflects the average price at which ETH last moved on-chain and often serves as a pivot point for market sentiment. Martinez also pointed to $2,300 as the next significant resistance, with pricing bands suggesting heavy selling pressure at that level. Reclaiming $2,300 would mark a major technical breakthrough and potentially confirm a shift in trend. Until then, Ethereum remains in a fragile position, caught between renewed optimism and lingering caution. Bulls must step in with volume and follow-through to turn this early bounce into a full-fledged recovery rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Accumulation Is Almost Over – Breakout Above $2,200 Could Trigger Expansion Phase Technical Details: Price Struggles Below Key Averages Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,070, hovering just above the crucial $2,000 support level. Despite recent attempts to regain strength, ETH remains 5% below the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and 200 exponential moving average (EMA) — a sign that momentum is still tilted in favor of the bears. These technical indicators often act as dynamic resistance, and until bulls reclaim them, the path to recovery remains uncertain. For Ethereum to initiate a meaningful uptrend, reclaiming the $2,200 level is essential. A breakout above this zone would not only restore short-term bullish sentiment but also confirm a potential reversal from the recent downtrend. However, if ETH continues to struggle below the moving averages and fails to gain traction above $2,000, the risk of further downside increases significantly.

As market sentiment hangs in the balance, bulls must act quickly to defend key support and regain control of price action. Otherwise, Ethereum could face another leg down in the coming sessions.

Some see potential, others believe DOGE needs more use cases to gain lasting traction. Meanwhile, the PI coin price hasn’t fared much better, falling 15% and testing crucial support zones. As both coins face pressure, BlockDAG is flipping expectations. Its new XP system on the Achievement Page lets users earn while participating, not just holding. Every purchase, task, or challenge brings in XP—turning activity into rewards. With BDAG already soaring 2,380% and demand still growing, many are eyeing it as the best crypto to buy in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Outlook: Is $1 Still on the Table? Dogecoin hasn’t had the smoothest ride this year, plunging 45.30% since its December 2024 peak of $0.4843. The Dogecoin (DOGE) price outlook remains hotly debated—some analysts say a return to $1 is possible between 2025 and 2027, depending on market mood. Others are more reserved, arguing that for DOGE to climb sustainably, it needs stronger real-world use. While long-term targets range from $5 by 2034 to $10 by 2040, they’re based on speculation. The Dogecoin (DOGE) price outlook still splits opinions, and whether DOGE can find its spark again remains a major question. PI Coin Price Falls 15%—Will the Floor Hold or Crack? The PI coin price has slipped since its late February high of $2.98. It’s now sitting around $1.16, right at a key support level. A drop below $1.08 might send it down to $1.05, but if it rebounds, a short-term comeback could be in play. Excitement briefly surged after the launch of Pi Domains, which allows users to buy decentralized websites using Pi tokens. Still, it’s unclear if this alone can stop the downtrend. With a 15% slide in the past day, the PI coin price remains unstable as sentiment continues to shift. BlockDAG’s XP System Turns Every Move Into Daily Earnings BlockDAG isn’t sticking to old-school crypto norms. With its new Achievements Page , just being active earns users experience points (XP)—and those points translate into real rewards. Buying BDAG, completing challenges, or joining bonus events now boosts your XP score, unlocking higher tiers, leaderboard spots, and more coins. This system makes things fun and rewarding. It’s not just about buying and waiting. There are weekly challenges, surprise bonuses, and platform activities that push users to keep going. A simple BDAG buy gives XP, but stack on achievements—like completing three buys or joining a bonus offer—and rewards jump up fast. The platform’s energy is clear. BDAG has exploded 2,380% from its first presale batch, with 18.9 billion BDAG already sold and $206.5 million raised. The coin now sells for $0.0248 in batch 27, with prices rising in each new round. BlockDAG’s rising popularity makes it a solid pick for those looking for the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Between increasing adoption, strong demand, and a rewarding ecosystem, early XP earners are already seeing their efforts pay off big. Final Thoughts The Dogecoin price outlook is still uncertain. Some expect DOGE to hit $1 again, but doubts remain unless utility improves. PI coin price has taken a tough 15% hit and is clinging to key levels. A bounce could change the picture, but for now, it’s under pressure. While DOGE and PI holders wait and wonder, BDAG users are collecting real rewards daily. With the Achievement Page transforming platform activity into actual earnings, BDAG offers more than just hope—it offers progress. After jumping 2,380%, the race for XP is heating up, and those who got in early are already ahead. If this keeps going, BDAG could easily top the list of the best crypto to buy in 2025—and those earning XP now may end up with the biggest edge of all.

According to a new press release , the regulatory agency plans to add four roundtable discussions about crypto assets and how they are regulated to its calendar of events. The discussions, which will take place between April and June, will clarify the law regarding crypto custody, real-world asset tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi). Says Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, head of the Crypto Task Force, “The Crypto Task Force roundtables are an opportunity for us to hear a lively discussion among experts about what the regulatory issues are and what the Commission can do to solve them.” The SEC’s Crypto Task Force was launched earlier this year by Mark Uyeda, the agency’s Acting Chair. It brings together regulators, lawyers and crypto executives to discuss the appropriate courses of action in terms of regulating crypto assets. Earlier this week, Peirce, a longtime proponent of digital assets, said that the Crypto Task Force will be a revamp of the SEC’s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. “The formation of the Crypto Task Force gave permission to staff in the building to work earnestly towards a workable framework for crypto regulation, and staff have responded with palpable enthusiasm… People have been talking, thinking, and writing about the issues with which we are now wrestling. The roundtable series will allow us to explore the issues collaboratively.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit on March 26, Peirce, who heads the SEC’s crypto task force, said she expected that the commission could create more “durability” for digital asset regulations through rulemaking at the agency and legislation in Congress. Such rulemaking and laws, according to the SEC commissioner, would be in contrast to guidance issued by the agency, such as a recent statement suggesting that memecoins do not qualify as securities. “I hope people won’t be sitting around thinking about the Howey test,” said Commissioner Peirce, speculating on the direction the SEC was headed. “Your lawyers have to think about these things, I’m not saying that they’ll not be relevant, but it shouldn’t be the kind of thing that is driving what you decide to build. I want there to be enough clarity on the question of what falls in our jurisdiction and then, if it does, how you can move forward.” SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit on March 26. Source: Rumble Peirce’s remarks came as the SEC has dropped several investigations or enforcement actions against major crypto firms, including Coinbase, Ripple, Kraken and Immutable. Some see the commission’s change in policy under acting chair Mark Uyeda as an attempt by US President Donald Trump to have the agency drop cases against firms that supported his 2024 campaign. Related: SEC plans 4 more crypto roundtables on trading, custody, tokenization, DeFi Since the 119th session of Congress started in January, lawmakers have suggested that they intend to move forward with a market structure bill clarifying the roles the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission will have over digital assets. On his third day in office, Trump signed an executive order establishing a working group that would explore, among other things, a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Is a new SEC chair on the horizon? Paul Atkins, whom Trump nominated as an SEC commissioner in December, will appear before US lawmakers in the Senate Banking Committee on March 27 and likely answer questions about his views on crypto regulation. Many in the crypto industry have indicated support for the former commissioner, who holds assets in real-world asset tokenization platform Securitize and controls a consulting firm tied to FTX. If his nomination moves through the banking committee, it’s unclear whether the full Senate will vote to confirm Atkins to a term ending in 2031. He is expected to take over as SEC chair from Commissioner Uyeda.

It brings together several elements of the entertainment world, including the relative crypto industry. The power of blockchain technology has propelled into the gaming world and has led us to hundreds of gaming tokens that are now available for players to invest in. Let's take a closer look at five gaming tokens that are currently causing a stir and which value could hit a rise in 2025. 1. Beam (BEAM) You may think that gaming tokens are all about the excitement and flashiness, but BEAM’s more about privacy for its users. The token uses a privacy-centric blockchain, which is designed to carry out secure and confidential transactions. This comes following an increasing demand for data protection within burgeoning in-game economies and calls for robust encryption. The BEAM platform features impressive technology, which is easy-to-learn for anyone with a fair bit of developing knowledge, However, BEAM’s widespread adoption may be held back due to the token’s relatively low market visibility and liquidity, which are dwarfed by some of the market caps of cryptocurrencies . Beginners may find some of the tech a little confusing, too. 2. Flow (FLOW) Flow is a blockchain built to handle the heavy traffic of online games and digital collectibles, like the famous NBA Top Shot moments . It’s designed to let lots of people use it at the same time, without slowing things down. Developers find it easy to work with, and even people new to crypto can get started without too much trouble. The idea is to make online gaming and collecting smoother and faster. The Flow token is, of course, what people use to buy, sell, and participate in the platform. However, Flow isn't the only player in this space; it has to compete with well-known options like Ethereum and Solana. Whether or not it really takes off while depending a lot on the success of the big projects using it, and like any crypto, its value can go up and down. Some people also have questions about how decentralized it really is. That said, some experts are saying that the token’s value has bottomed out over the last year and could be about to go up again. 3. Decentraland (MANA) MANA-powered Decentraland is a blockchain-based virtual world on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded in 2017, Decentraland serves as a platform for multiplayer game creation using the intuitive Decentraland Builder. This offers a vast library of 3D items for building and creating in-game tokens, which you can then trade freely with other players in the form ofvirtual land parcels. The virtual world nature of Decentraland allows for many different game designs, and some of those designs may include mini-games or discovery systems. These games use mechanics like a Random Number Generator RNG ensuring that outcomes are unpredictable and purely based on chance, like what you get in free slots games. The MANA token´s value has dipped dramatically over the past year, but there are signs that it is now stabilizing and could be about to take off again. 4. Sandbox (SAND) The Sandbox: ditch the landlord, own your digital empire. Sandbox has soared in popularity in recent years, giving players the chance to build their own world inside this decentralized metaverse. SAND is the utility token made to emerge from this. It´s a golden ticket that unlocks trading, staking, and even a democratic manner in whichthe Sandbox metaverse evolves. Users get creator-friendly tools that let them craft their own virtual assets with ease. And it’s not just players: big brands, celebrities, and artists are jumping in, fuelling the hype and expanding its reach. The only downside may be the fees. Ethereum's gas fees can mount up with SAND, so anyone getting involved should account for these. Still, SAND’s popularity means that it’s currently one of the top gaming tokens around. 5. Enjin (ENJ) Enjin is approaching an exciting new frontier in crypto gaming with the Ethereum-based ERC-1155 token standard. Developers acquire this blockchain-based gaming coin and mint it into in-game items, so that players can earn $ENJ through gameplay and without the need to visit traditional cryptocurrency exchanges . The Enjin Marketplace is already well established place, where users trade ERC-1155 digital assets, all backed by ENJ tokens. In terms of development, the token is also attractive to some of the brightest minds in the industry, drawn in by the easy token creation and integration tools.
