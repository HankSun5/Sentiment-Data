This Altcoin Tops Toncoin, Chainlink, BNB, and Tron on Investor Watchlists",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/best-crypto-to-buy-before-april-this-altcoin-tops-toncoin-chainlink-bnb-and-tron-on-investor-watchlists,"While investors are keeping a close eye on tokens like Toncoin, Chainlink, BNB, and Tron, another altcoin leads the pack. While volatility struck these headline-grabbing assets in recent months, one token— Remittix —is quietly marching ahead without fanfare due to its stable, payment-oriented use case. While crypto markets are reeling from scandals and price swings, investors are increasingly looking towards projects that offer stability and real-world applications. And that's why Remittixis now the top pick as the best cryptocurrency to invest in before April. Toncoin (TON) Stumbles Amid Misinformation Saga, Investors Look to Remittix Toncoin recently surged by 8% after false reports spread claiming the TON Foundation had raised $400 million . The excitement was short-lived, as the foundation quickly clarified that the $400 million represented existing holdings by U.S.-based VCs, not fresh capital. Investors reacted negatively when the truth dawned, and most blamed insiders for manipulating sentiment. The scandal added to Toncoin's current troubles, particularly in the wake of legal troubles facing Telegram founder Pavel Durov. The issues marred the future of Toncoin. Source: Tradingview Chainlink's Volatility Limits Gains, Remittix Offers Stability Chainlink (LINK) recently saw an impressive 6.7% increase, breaking the $15 mark with high investor interest. Despite the trend, LINK is encountering resistance to break through $18.12. Even technical indicators indicate a correction overdue, as the RSI is nearing overbought levels. In addition, recent liquidations of $1.06 million indicate Chainlink's built-in volatility. While LINK remains attractive to speculative traders, its price volatility scares off long-term investors. Remittix, on the other hand, offers stability in its PayFi model, specifically addressing transaction inefficiencies globally. Investors who want consistent and substantial growth prefer the actual application of Remittix to speculative tokens like LINK. Source: Tradingview Binance (BNB) Insider Trading Controversy Hurts Confidence, Benefiting Remittix Binance (BNB) is currently navigating a major scandal involving alleged insider trading. An employee was recently suspended for front-running trades using privileged information from BNB Chain’s operations . Although Binance acted swiftly, the damage to its reputation raises serious questions about internal governance. Regulatory scrutiny will likely intensify, further complicating BNB’s short-term price outlook and dampening investor enthusiasm. By comparison, Remittix’s transparent operations and clear regulatory strategy position it as a trustworthy alternative. Source: Tradingview Tron (TRX) Struggles at Resistance Levels, Remittix Gains Momentum Tron (TRX) faces persistent challenges in surpassing the $0.25 resistance level. This repeated failure to break upward has sparked concerns over TRX’s future market standing. Mixed technical indicators further weaken investor sentiment. With on-balance volume data showing limited buying activity, traders are turning skeptical. If Tron can't regain bullish momentum, investors may begin looking elsewhere.

Odds of approval are rising fast, and some analysts think that could be the rocket fuel XRP’s been waiting for. Stellar (XLM) is also getting swept up in optimism, riding the wave thanks to its shared focus on cross-border transactions. But while the old-school payment coins battle it out for a comeback, a newer name is quietly stealing the show— Remittix (RTX) . It’s already pulled in over $14 million in presale, and with its built-in PayFi functionality for investors, businesses, and individuals, some are calling it the next-gen solution Ripple was supposed to be. If you’re betting on the future of payments, RTX is looking like a seriously promising move. Remittix (RTX) Levels Up The Global Payments Space Crypto has spent more than a decade promising to replace legacy finance—but for most users, actually spending digital assets is still a slow, expensive, and often frustrating experience. Exchange withdrawals can take days, conversion fees are excessive, and banks routinely block or delay crypto-related transactions. This is exactly the problem Remittix (RTX) is built to solve. The platform allows users to instantly convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT, sending funds directly to any bank account globally. Whether you're cashing out stablecoins, moving crypto earnings to a local bank, or making international transfers, Remittix removes the friction without compromising control. For example, a freelancer in Kenya can accept payment in USDT and receive Kenyan Shillings in their local bank account that same day. Or a business owner in Colombia can settle supplier invoices using Ethereum, without touching an exchange or dealing with FX fees. Remittix is also turning heads with its focus on privacy. As global banking becomes more invasive—tracking transactions, flagging crypto activity, and limiting financial autonomy—users are demanding tools that give them privacy without breaking the rules. Remittix provides that balance. Transactions initiated through the platform result in a traditional bank deposit on the other end, without exposing the crypto origin. That means freedom to move funds on your terms, while still interacting with the existing financial system. Ripple (XRP): ETF Hype Building, But Is It Priced In Already? XRP’s been grinding for months, but now things might finally be picking up. The odds of an XRP ETF getting the green light are climbing , and traders are already speculating on a big price breakout. If approved, it could pull in serious institutional interest—something XRP has been waiting on for years. But let’s be honest—some of that hype might already be baked into the price. XRP’s still sitting way below its ATH, and while ETF approval would be a massive headline, execution matters more than hype. Ripple’s working on real-world integrations with CBDC s and payment networks, but until those roll out at scale, XRP’s stuck playing catch-up. The ETF could be the boost it needs—but new players like Remittix are already doing what XRP aims to. Monero (XMR): Still the Privacy King, But Facing Headwinds Monero’s always been that quiet, shadowy player in the crypto space—the go-to for privacy-maxis. It still offers unmatched anonymity, but regulators aren’t too fond of that, and it’s starting to weigh on adoption. Many exchanges have either de-listed XMR or added more hurdles to buy it, which is limiting its upside. The tech behind Monero is solid—private transactions, stealth addresses, ring signatures—it’s all there. But it hasn’t evolved much in terms of broader utility. With more payment coins entering the space and projects like Remittix offering regulatory-friendly privacy options with lightning-fast settlement, Monero’s looking more like a niche tool than a mass-market solution. It’ll always have a cult following—but it may have already peaked. Remittix Presale Gains Momentum—Early Backers Move Fast With $14 million already raised, and tokens available at $0.0734, Remittix is attracting serious attention from early-stage investors who see beyond the hype. This is a project with clear utility, a growing user base, and real-world demand. Industry analysts are calling for an 800% increase in token price before the presale ends, with even more upside projected post-launch as adoption accelerates. For anyone seeking exposure to the next generation of blockchain utility—not speculation, but real financial infrastructure—Remittix is standing out as a breakout player in 2025’s crypto landscape. And right now, it’s still early enough to get in before the rest of the market catches on.

MARA Backing: Supported by MARA, a significant player in the Bitcoin mining industry, adding credibility and potential for widespread adoption. Why Hydro-Cooling? The Edge in Efficiency and Performance In the world of Bitcoin mining , heat is the enemy. Traditional air-cooled miners can generate immense heat, leading to performance throttling, increased energy consumption for cooling, and even hardware degradation over time. This is where hydro-cooled Bitcoin miners like the Terraflux AH3880 shine. Hydro-cooling, or liquid cooling, offers several key advantages: Superior Heat Dissipation: Liquid cooling is significantly more effective at removing heat compared to air cooling. This allows miners to operate at optimal temperatures, maintaining consistent performance. Enhanced Efficiency: By keeping temperatures down, hydro-cooling contributes to better energy efficiency. Cooler components operate more efficiently, reducing energy waste. Potential for Overclocking: The improved thermal management of hydro-cooling can potentially allow for overclocking, pushing the miner to perform beyond its standard specifications (though Auradine hasn’t explicitly mentioned this for the AH3880). Quieter Operation: Hydro-cooled systems can often operate more quietly than air-cooled systems, reducing noise pollution in mining facilities. Increased Lifespan: Lower operating temperatures can contribute to a longer lifespan for the mining hardware by reducing thermal stress on components. For large-scale Bitcoin mining operations , these benefits translate to significant cost savings in the long run, both in terms of energy consumption and hardware maintenance. The Terraflux AH3880’s adoption of hydro-cooling is a clear indicator of Auradine’s focus on efficiency and long-term sustainability in mining operations. Terraflux AH3880 vs. The Competition: Setting a New Benchmark Auradine claims that the Terraflux AH3880 outperforms leading models from industry giants like Antminer and Whatsminer. Let’s put this into perspective. While specific models from Antminer and Whatsminer weren’t named in the initial reports, we can compare the Terraflux AH3880 against some of their top-tier offerings based on publicly available data: Miner Model Hash Rate (TH/s) Efficiency (J/TH) Cooling System Auradine Terraflux AH3880 600 14.5 Hydro-Cooled Antminer S21 335 ~17.5 Air-Cooled Whatsminer M50S++ ~140 ~26 Air-Cooled Whatsminer M60 ~170 ~17 Air-Cooled *Note: Performance data for competitor models may vary and is based on publicly available specifications. As you can see from the table, the Terraflux AH3880 boasts a significantly higher hash rate and superior energy efficiency compared to some of the leading air-cooled models currently available. The energy-efficient Bitcoin miner market is fiercely competitive, and Auradine is clearly aiming to take the lead with this new offering. The hydro-cooling system is a key differentiator, enabling this performance edge. Addressing Critical Challenges: Energy Costs, Computing Demands, and U.S. Reliance Auradine highlights that the Terraflux AH3880 is designed to address several critical challenges facing the Bitcoin mining industry and the broader tech landscape: Rising Energy Costs: The exceptional energy efficiency of 14.5 J/TH directly tackles the issue of escalating energy costs, which are a major operational expense for miners. By consuming less energy per unit of hash rate, the Terraflux AH3880 can significantly reduce energy bills and improve profitability, especially in regions with high electricity prices. Growing Computing Demands: The Bitcoin network’s hashrate continues to climb, increasing mining difficulty and demanding more powerful hardware. The Terraflux AH3880’s high hash rate of 600 TH/s ensures that miners can remain competitive in this increasingly demanding environment. It provides the computational muscle needed to secure block rewards and maintain profitability. U.S. Reliance on Overseas Hardware: The fact that the Terraflux AH3880 is U.S.-engineered is a strategic move to reduce reliance on overseas hardware manufacturers. This is particularly relevant in the current geopolitical climate, where supply chain security and domestic technological capabilities are increasingly prioritized. Auradine is positioning itself as a champion of American innovation in the Bitcoin mining hardware sector. The MARA Connection: A Strong Endorsement The backing of MARA (Marathon Digital Holdings), a prominent publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, lends significant weight to Auradine’s claims and the potential of the Terraflux AH3880. MARA’s involvement suggests that they have vetted and validated the performance and efficiency of the miner, and see it as a valuable asset for their operations. This endorsement could pave the way for wider adoption of the Terraflux AH3880 across the industry, as other mining companies may follow MARA’s lead. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin Mining? The launch of the Auradine Terraflux AH3880 signals a significant step forward in Bitcoin mining technology . It underscores several key trends shaping the industry: Focus on Efficiency: Energy efficiency is no longer a secondary consideration; it’s a primary driver of innovation. Miners are increasingly seeking solutions that minimize energy consumption and maximize output. Advancements in Cooling: Hydro-cooling is likely to become more prevalent as miners seek to push performance boundaries and manage the thermal challenges of high-density mining operations. Geopolitical Considerations: The emphasis on U.S. engineering highlights the growing importance of domestic manufacturing and supply chain resilience in the technology sector, including cryptocurrency mining. Increased Competition: The entry of Auradine and the launch of the Terraflux AH3880 injects fresh competition into the Bitcoin miner market, which is ultimately beneficial for the industry as it drives innovation and potentially lowers costs for miners. Conclusion: A Powerful New Player Emerges The Auradine Terraflux AH3880 is more than just a new Bitcoin miner ; it’s a symbol of innovation, efficiency, and a shift towards greater domestic involvement in the cryptocurrency hardware sector. With its impressive hash rate, superior energy efficiency, and advanced hydro-cooling system, backed by the endorsement of MARA, the Terraflux AH3880 is poised to make a significant impact on the Bitcoin mining landscape.

Recent analyses from experts suggest that Ethereum price behavior is showing both bullish short-term structure and macro-level cyclical patterns, which could support an upward continuation if key levels hold. Ethereum Price Could Surge Past $2100 on Liquidity Grab Analyst Crypto Patel shared insight on the X platform, identifying a bullish price setup on the ETH/USDT chart. According to Patel, the top altcoin has shown a strong displacement move to the upside, which has led to a shift in market structure. This move followed a reaction from a previously identified bullish Point of Interest (POI). Ethereum price is reacting positively from a key mitigation block near $2064.60, indicating strong institutional demand. The mitigation block represents a zone where the top altcoin price retraced after a breakout, often used by institutional traders to mitigate prior orders before continuing the trend. This setup places the entry for a long position within the upper mitigation zone, aligning with smart money principles. Source: X The price target of $2128.12 aligns with a swing high liquidity zone, suggesting a likely smart money-driven move upward. These zones often hold clustered stop-loss orders and pending buy positions. A move into this area could allow investors to capture liquidity before a reversal. Patel sets a stop-loss at $2027.20, just below the mitigation block, providing a defined risk level if the altcoin price structure fails. Current ETH Cycle Compared to 2018–2020 Pattern Another analyst, TimeFreedomROB, posted a chart on X comparing Ethereum price weekly structure to its 2018–2020 cycle. The analysis shows ETH breaking below an ascending triangle, mirroring its past breakdown below a descending triangle before its major 2020 recovery. In that prior cycle, ETH price formed a macro bottom and rallied from under $100 to nearly $4800. According to the chart, Ethereum price is currently trading near $2060. It recently broke below the $2300 psychological level and tested the lower diagonal trendline around $1800. This area corresponds with horizontal demand levels from previous years. The chart implies this could represent a final shakeout phase before a strong upward move, similar to historical cycles. Source: X The support zone between $1800 and $2000 has acted as a long-term base in earlier market periods. A reclaim of the $2200–$2400 range is important for Ethereum price to confirm a shift back into bullish momentum on the weekly timeframe. Altcoin Price Prediction Additionally, the macro view provided by TimeFreedomROB outlines possible reversal targets if the price continues to follow historical patterns. In 2020, ETH saw a 40x increase following structure reclaim. While current conditions differ, the projected path includes potential resistance levels at $3600, $4870, and an extended range of $6000–$7500. Supporting the bullish projections, analyst MAXPAIN noted that ETH price could retrace to the $1,900 zone before a potential rally to $3,000. His analysis, based on the TPO chart, identifies the $1,874–$1,924 range as a key support and accumulation area. The top altcoin is currently trading at $2,064.98, showing an 8.10% gain over the past 7 days. Its market cap stands at $249.12 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $11.71 billion.

Year to date, Pump.fun has deposited over 1.57M SOL, valued at over $293M. Overall, Pump.fun has already produced 3,232,101 SOL in total fees, valued at close to $500M. Of those, the platform probably cashed out over $250M, with the bulk during the 2024 bull market. Following the latest sale, SOL traded at $145.56. The asset got a boost from a series of ETF applications, pointing to future demand. Pump.fun is back in the top 10 of apps, with $1.53M in fees for the last day. On more successful days, the platform reaches over $3M in fees, though still far from peak results of over $7M daily. Currently, Pump.fun once again produces more fees compared to Solana, and has far surpassed even the entire Ethereum chain. Meanwhile, Pump.fun sees a lower number of new tokens, falling to around 20K to 25K daily. On weaker days, under 2,000 new tokens are minted. Token shifts to Raydium go to zero The effect of PumpSwap is already visible, as almost no tokens are moving to Raydium. The integrated DEX now lists all tokens that have finished the bonding curve. Graduated tokens were already rare, with around 200 new tickers daily moving to Raydium. PumpSwap is just building up its list of tokens, initially starting with 26 coins. The DEX has added some of the more liquid Solana assets like Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and Jupiter (JUP). Pump.fun itself is also showing slower graduations, as the community only trades new launches, but rarely raises enough liquidity for graduation to a DEX. The DEX also added USDT and USDC liquidity, as well as older blue chip memes. However, PumpSwap achieved $1.23B in trading volumes for the first week, producing an estimated $1M in fees as part of the Pump.fun ecosystem. PumpSwap is competing with other DEX, taking between 7% and 15% of Solana DEX activity. | Source: Dune Analytics Pump.fun makes up around 7% of all Solana DEX volumes. March 24 was the first peak day, with over $890M in total daily activity. Pump.fun has also surpassed Meteora in daily token trades, peaking at over 14% of all Solana DEX on Monday. The new exchange is yet to prove its ability to replace the ‘trenches’ with new token mints and unexpected success stories. The growing DEX activity may add to more fee liquidation, as the Pump.fun ecosystem has not yet introduced its profit-sharing mechanism. Most of the SOL fees generated are either partially used for staking or sold on the open market. In the coming months, PumpSwap will start sharing its revenues with token creators. In the very first days of its operation, the new DEX almost reached Pump.fun’s in terms of fees. If trading volumes keep their levels, PumpSwap may replace the lost revenues from the slower meme token casino. The DEX has achieved up to $2.8M in daily revenues on the more successful days, both from trade fees of 0.25%, and from liquidity provider services. Most of the fees will flow back to the main token developer, once again with no plans for rewarding communities. The new model rebuilds the Moonshot launchpad and DEX combination, which, however, could not differentiate between legitimate projects and rug pulls. Most Pump.fun wallets break even or lose $500 The highly competitive PvP trading of meme tokens means the majority of players end up with losses. Since traders only make small bets on new memes, the most common loss is up to $500. Around 1M wallets break even, and 1.3M wallets lose up to $500. Only 33 whale wallets have achieved earnings of over $1M, and just four whales have lost over $1M on the platform. The Pump.fun trading format shows a shift of retail bets into whale wallets, where the top 500 traders make most of the earnings. Only two tokens, FARTCOIN and WOULD, have broken above $500M valuations. Solana memes remain active, with a total valuation for top tokens at $8.4B . The meme space has recovered, though remaining far from its peak valuations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

What Will Happen If He Fires?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-us-president-donald-trump-fire-fed-chairman-jerome-powell-what-will-happen-if-he-fires/,"US President Donald Trump has increased pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates, arguing that falling food and energy prices justify such a move. However, sources suggest that if the central bank does not meet his demands, Trump may take an even harsher step and dismiss Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump has long expressed frustration with the Fed, but tensions have escalated following its decision last week to keep interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%. The president has appeared on Truth Social and in public to press for lower interest rates, saying lower borrowing costs would stimulate economic growth and prevent any slowdowns from trade policies. Despite Trump’s calls, Powell signaled caution by emphasizing the potential inflationary impact of Trump’s upcoming tariff measures. The Fed’s new economic forecasts suggest there will be no further decline in inflation this year, largely due to the expected effects of additional tariffs. “I think further progress may be delayed once tariff-induced inflation arrives,” Powell warned last week. Trump will impose new reciprocal tariffs on April 2, which he calls “Liberation Day.” The move is aimed at countering foreign tariffs on American goods, but economists warn that such policies could further complicate the Fed’s ability to maintain economic stability. Amid the rising tensions, speculation has mounted over whether Trump could attempt to fire Powell, a move that would likely roil financial markets. Powell, whose term expires in 2026, has previously said he would not resign early even if the president asked him to. Related News: ‘Whales Entered Bitcoin Short at $88,000,’ Analysis Company Says, Explains Its Meaning Ian Katz, a director at research firm Capital Alpha Partners in Washington, said he did not expect Trump to fire Powell given the potential market turmoil. “Given how aggressively Trump has asserted his authority, you can’t rule anything out,” Katz warned. “A decision that clearly gives the president more authority over monetary policy would be extremely unsettling to the market.” Trump’s willingness to remove independent agency officials has already been demonstrated with the removal of two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Legal experts point to a 1935 Supreme Court decision, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, that protects independent agency members from being removed without cause. If Trump were to defy that precedent, it could lead to a Supreme Court showdown that would resonate across financial markets. *This is not investment advice.

42343763,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143206,1742944845,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlock Effortless Kubernetes Management: Plural’s AI Platform Revolutionizes Enterprise Operations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unlock-kubernetes-management-plural-platform/,"In the fast-evolving world of enterprise infrastructure, managing Kubernetes clusters has become a critical yet complex task. As businesses scale and adopt cloud-native architectures, the challenge of handling sprawling Kubernetes deployments intensifies. Plural emerges as a powerful solution, offering a centralized platform designed to simplify Kubernetes operations and revolutionize how enterprises manage their clusters. Imagine a world where Kubernetes management is no longer a headache but a streamlined, efficient process. Plural is making that vision a reality. The Kubernetes Sprawl Challenge: Why Centralized Management Matters For many enterprises, the Kubernetes journey began with a single cluster. However, as needs grew, so did the number of clusters, leading to a phenomenon known as Kubernetes sprawl. Sam Weaver, co-founder of Plural, experienced this firsthand at Unqork. Faced with the daunting task of managing a growing network of Kubernetes clusters, Unqork embarked on a costly, two-year project to build an in-house solution. The result? A platform that was merely ‘okay’. This experience highlighted a crucial gap in the market: the need for a comprehensive, user-friendly Kubernetes management platform . The traditional approach of managing Kubernetes clusters individually using disparate open-source tools is no longer sustainable for large organizations. This decentralized approach leads to: Increased Operational Overhead: Managing each cluster separately demands significant time and resources from DevOps teams. Inconsistency and Errors: Lack of standardization across clusters can lead to configuration drift and increased risk of errors. Slower Deployments and Updates: Rolling out updates and new applications across multiple clusters becomes a time-consuming and complex process. Visibility Gaps: Gaining a holistic view of cluster health, performance, and resource utilization across the entire infrastructure becomes challenging. Plural: Your Centralized Command Center for Kubernetes Plural addresses these challenges head-on by providing a centralized Kubernetes management platform. Born from the frustrations of Kubernetes sprawl, Plural consolidates all your enterprise Kubernetes clusters into a single, intuitive dashboard. This unified view empowers teams to streamline operations, efficiently manage clusters, and deploy updates from one central location. Imagine the time and resources saved by having all your Kubernetes infrastructure at your fingertips. The genesis of Plural is a compelling story of identifying a problem and crafting an elegant solution. After his experience at Unqork, Weaver partnered with Michael Guarino, a seasoned engineer from tech giants like Amazon and Twitter. Guarino’s swift development of a superior system in just weeks laid the foundation for Plural. This rapid innovation underscores the platform’s core value proposition: efficiency and speed in Kubernetes management. AI-Powered Kubernetes: Smart Optimization and Proactive Problem Solving Plural goes beyond basic cluster management by integrating AI-powered Kubernetes capabilities. The platform’s AI engine offers intelligent suggestions for: Cluster Optimization: AI algorithms analyze cluster performance and identify areas for optimization, improving resource utilization and reducing costs. Scaling Issue Diagnosis: Plural’s AI proactively detects and diagnoses scaling bottlenecks, enabling teams to address issues before they impact application performance. Proactive Insights: The platform provides actionable insights based on AI-driven analysis, helping teams anticipate potential problems and optimize their Kubernetes deployments proactively. This AI-driven approach transforms Kubernetes management from a reactive task to a proactive and strategic function. By leveraging AI, Plural empowers enterprises to not just manage their clusters but to optimize them for peak performance and efficiency. Benefits of Plural: Streamlining Enterprise Kubernetes Clusters The benefits of adopting Plural’s platform are substantial, particularly for organizations grappling with complex enterprise Kubernetes clusters . Plural promises to: Reduce Operational Overhead by 90%: By centralizing management and automating key tasks, Plural dramatically reduces the time and effort required to manage Kubernetes infrastructure. Accelerate Update Cycles: Deploy updates in hours instead of weeks, ensuring faster time-to-market for new features and applications. Boost Developer Productivity: Free developers from the complexities of Kubernetes management, allowing them to focus on building and innovating. Enhance Control and Security: Plural’s self-hosted, GitOps-based architecture provides enterprises with full control over their data and deployments, enhancing security and compliance. Weaver emphasizes that Plural is designed to be cloud and LLM agnostic, offering flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in. This commitment to openness and control is a key differentiator in the Kubernetes management landscape. Why Now? The Perfect Timing for Plural’s Solution The rise of AI and the increasing adoption of cloud-native architectures have converged to create the perfect storm for Kubernetes sprawl. Enterprises are no longer managing just one or two clusters; they are dealing with dozens, even hundreds. This exponential growth necessitates a more sophisticated and simplified Kubernetes operations approach. Plural’s emergence at this juncture is not accidental. The company recognized the growing pain points associated with Kubernetes management and developed a solution precisely tailored to address these challenges. The recent $6 million seed funding round, led by Primary Venture Partners with participation from Capital One Ventures and Company Ventures, underscores investor confidence in Plural’s vision and potential. Plural vs. Competitors: Architecture as a Differentiator While Plural is not alone in the Kubernetes management space, Weaver highlights key architectural differentiators that set Plural apart from competitors like Loft Labs and Rancher Labs. These include: GitOps Model: Plural operates on a GitOps model, ensuring infrastructure-as-code principles for consistent and auditable deployments. Self-Hosted Architecture: Unlike SaaS solutions, Plural is self-hosted by each customer, providing maximum control and data privacy. AI Agents per Cluster: Each Kubernetes cluster has its own dedicated AI agent, enabling localized optimization and intelligent management. These architectural choices reflect Plural’s commitment to enterprise-grade security, control, and customization. The ‘no data sent home’ approach resonates strongly with organizations in regulated industries like financial services, where data privacy and compliance are paramount. Conclusion: Empowering Enterprises in the Kubernetes Era Plural is poised to become a game-changer in the Kubernetes management landscape. By offering a centralized, AI-powered platform, Plural empowers enterprises to unlock effortless Kubernetes management , streamline operations, and accelerate innovation. As Kubernetes continues to be the orchestration engine of choice for modern applications, solutions like Plural will be instrumental in enabling organizations to harness the full potential of this powerful technology without being bogged down by complexity.

Per a Coincheck press release , the new service is named Coincheck Prime and is “specifically targeted” at “corporate and institutional” crypto investors. Coincheck: Responding to Growing Demand from Corporate Sector? The firm said its new service will cater to “corporate clients” with deposit balances worth “10 million yen ($66,763) or more.” Trading volumes on the Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) It will also cater to big-spending firms and investors who are prepared to spend similar amounts on one-off or continuous crypto purchases. Coincheck said its service will also provide trading and management support from “specialized” experts. Until very recently, the majority of Japanese corporate players dealing with crypto were web3 and blockchain players. But since late last year, there has been a rise in the number of corporations looking to raise funds through crypto investment. Some companies have also gone on the record as stating that they think crypto can help them protect their liquid assets against fiat inflation. A recent and dramatic spike in Japanese bond yields is a stark reminder that the decades-long experiment in ultralow rates is well and truly coming to an end. https://t.co/c4M4qos1up — The Japan Times (@japantimes) March 25, 2025 Coincheck also suggested it could use its Prime services to help institutional investors who might require custody services should the government approve crypto spot ETFs at a future date.

(Source: Google Finance) OTC Options The new platform will also allow users to make large over-the-counter (OTC) trades “at preferential rates.” It also promises to provide users with “robust security” for cryptoassets in the exchange’s custody. The company suggested its NASDAQ listing could help it build trust in its new services. It also pointed out that its owner, the securities giant Monex Group, is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s Prime Market. Coincheck claimed: “We adhere to global standards for internal controls, risk management, and security levels as required by [stock market-]listed financial group companies. We also provide services with a high level of transparency.” Oki Matsumoto, the Executive Director of the Coincheck operator and securities firm Monex Group. (Source: Monex on Demand/YouTube/Screenshot) Coincheck claims that its total customer assets were worth 1.29 trillion yen (over $8.6 billion) as of the end of January 2025. It also said that it was “the number one exchange in Japan in terms of Bitcoin (BTC) spot trading volume in the second half of 2024.” Japanese Companies Flocking to BTC, Altcoin Markets Corporate crypto investment is increasing rapidly in Japan, with companies now scrambling to use their balance sheets to buy Bitcoin and altcoins. Earlier this month, the Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed real estate and digital transformation firm Value Creation announced it had recently spent $667,000 on Bitcoin . Other notable Japanese firms buying BTC or unveiling plans to do so in recent months include the bullish investment player Metaplanet , as well as the SBC Medical Group and the auto trading firm Remixpoint . Japan named Kazuto Uchida as the head of the Government Pension Investment Fund https://t.co/s5Q46WTWBi — Bloomberg (@business) March 25, 2025 Remixpoint spent around $3.2 million on BTC in January this year, and has earmarked another $16 million for Bitcoin and altcoin buys. The company has also bought smaller amounts of Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , XRP , Avalanche (AVAX), and Dogecoin (DOGE) . Metaplanet, meanwhile, has publicly claimed it wants to cement its position as “Asia’s leading Bitcoin treasury company.” It has also spoken of a wider “goal” to “expand” the size of its Bitcoin holdings to BTC 10,000 by the end of this year.

According to data from Onchain Lens, a total of 54,113 SOL worth approximately $7.81 million were moved to the trading platform. The PumpFun Large Solana Transfer Continues It is worth mentioning that this transaction is part of a pattern in which the launchpad has offloaded 1,573,313 SOL this year alone. On January 2, CoinGape reported that the launchpad moved 120,000 SOL worth approximately $22.88 million to Kraken. 2 hours ago, PumpFun ( @pumpdotfun ) deposited 54,113 $SOL valued at $7.81M, into #Kraken . In 2025, they sent a total of 1,573,313 $SOL worth $293.26M. Overall, they have earned 3,232,101 $SOL currently valued at $469.1M. pic.twitter.com/YMhtxRKF4Z — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) March 25, 2025 In addition, last month, it transferred another 148,759 SOL valued at $28.22 million, adding to the ongoing trend. According to the Onchain Lens data, over 1.5 million SOL moved this year, valued at $293.26 million. These frequent transactions often place Solana under intense selling pressure. Despite the initial projections of whether PumpFun was selling its Solana stash, some still argue the platform might have another reason for moving the coins. This latest transfer comes with potential debate on whether it could derail the mild consolidation Solana price has picked from earlier in the week. PumpFun and the PumpSwap Move In a bid to repair its ecosystem reputation, PumpFun has launched PumpSwap . This new platform is a decentralized exchange DEX designed to give traders and investors using the launchpad a more direct and efficient way to trade meme coins. Per the update, the platform intends to use the newly launched product to reduce dependence on centralized exchanges like Kraken. With it, it hopes to improve liquidity within the Solana ecosystem. While PumpSwap presents itself as a positive step, it remains unclear whether it can fully restore confidence in PumpFun’s activities, especially as large SOL transfers persist. Some investors see it as an attempt to shift focus away from ongoing selloff and other ethical concerns. Solana Price Outlook Amid Growing Consolidation Despite PumpFun’s frequent transactions, Solana’s price has remained relatively stable. After the February 13 transfer of 148,759 SOL, CoinGape reported that SOL price dropped by 1.2% before recovering. Furthermore, many analysts have mixed opinions on whether the market will continue consolidating or if Solana will record a breakout soon. Some stakeholders, like VanEck, see the coin soaring to $520 in the long term should market conditions be favorable. However, repeated large-scale transfers like those from PumpFun could serve as a headwind for the coin. As of this publication, CoinMarketCap data shows that SOL price was trading at $143.99, up 1.60% in the last 24 hours.

33767162,[object Object],1742945416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Crypto Pundit Says XRP Looks Excellent Here, Gives Reasons Why",https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-looking-excellent/,"Crypto analyst Dark Defender has issued a bold outlook for XRP , stating on X that the asset is on a clear path toward multiple upside targets. His remarks come at a time when the asset bulls are trying to hold a support level at $2.42, with technical patterns suggesting the asset may be preparing for a significant breakout. XRP Faces Minor Resistance on the Way to $2.75, $5.85 in Sight XRP’s price action is starting to see some positive note , recently pushing as high as $2.56 in a 7-day timeframe. Although it met resistance and reversed on a downtrend early last week, it eventually found support at $2.36 and started a fresh uptrend. This up-and-down movement is seemingly an average price action playout, but technical analysis on the daily candlestick timeframe chart shows that the price quietly changed a downward sloping resistance trendline into support at $2.36. Now, the next outlook for the altcoin is an upward movement after this fresh uptrend above the resistance trendline. With this in mind, crypto analyst Dark Defender predicted that the cryptocurrency is on the road to $5.85. The analyst also highlighted, a closer price target at $2.75, though noting that XRP may experience some difficulty breaking through $2.55. The predicted difficulty at $2.55 is in response to its rejection last week. However, Dark Defender’s phrasing was straightforward; “XRP looks excellent,” reflecting strong conviction in the token’s current setup after his analysis. Exponential Fibonacci: $5.85 Isn’t The Limit For The Altcoin Dark Defender’s prediction of a $5.85 price target for XRP would see the crypto breaking above its current all-time high. However, this pales in comparison to the analyst’s long-term projection. The projection to $5.85 is only one part of Dark Defender’s broader analysis. In a previous post, he outlined a more ambitious long-term scenario using exponential Fibonacci levels and Elliott Wave theory. According to him, the common belief that XRP cannot exceed $10 is a misunderstanding of exponential modeling. He argued that the altcoin is currently in an impulse wave 3 on a multi-year timeframe. If wave 3 fully extends during this phase, it could reach $77.7, with wave 5 targeting a three-digit price zone. His roadmap emphasizes staying above the $2.3951 median, a level he says has been in play since November. From there, the chart suggests a run to $8, which could lead the asset toward a new range between $18 and $23. These projections are based not only on wave extensions but also on volume trends, RSI behavior, and repeating historical patterns, which the analyst believes all align to support an incoming rally.

However, crypto analyst Ali Martinez warns that strong resistance may lie ahead. Bitcoin Finally Breaks Daily RSI Downtrend In a recent X post, crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC has broken through a multi-month RSI downtrend. The analyst shared a Bitcoin daily chart, showing how the leading cryptocurrency’s RSI has broken free from a prolonged downtrend that began at the start of the year. For the uninitiated, the RSI is a momentum indicator that suggests when the underlying asset – in this case, BTC – may be overbought or oversold. A rising RSI after sustained downtrend can indicate growing bullish momentum and a possible trend reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Hit $112,000, But Only If It Holds Above This Key Level – Analyst Explains Fellow crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader echoed Rekt Capital’s analysis, stating that the RSI breakout confirms bullish momentum and could pave the way for a significant price rally. Another key indicator turned bullish this week – the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons. In an X post, crypto analyst Robert Mercer noted: One of the most accurate mid-term indicator is bullish now. Expecting BTC to go back above $100,000 in Q2 of 2025! To explain, the Hash Ribbons indicator turning bullish signals that Bitcoin miners – after a period of capitulation – are returning to the network, suggesting mining recovery and reduced selling pressure. This often marks a strong buy signal, and has historically aligned with the end of bear markets and the start of new uptrends. Analyst Warns Of Stiff Resistance Ahead Despite BTC’s more than 15% surge from its March 10 low, seasoned analyst Ali Martinez cautions that the top digital asset is likely to encounter strong resistance around the $89,000 level. Martinez explained: Bitcoin $BTC faces a key resistance cluster at $89,000, where the 50-day moving average and the descending trendline from the all-time high converge. That said, several positive macroeconomic factors could support BTC’s bullish momentum. In a recent analysis, crypto analyst The M2 Guy emphasized that the expanding M2 money supply is likely to benefit risk-on assets like BTC.

42344232,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143208,1742945455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionizing Finance: CME Group and Google Cloud Pioneer Asset Tokenization,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cme-group-asset-tokenization-google/,"Get ready for a seismic shift in the financial world! Imagine a future where assets, from stocks to real estate, are traded with unprecedented ease and efficiency, all thanks to the power of blockchain. This future is rapidly approaching, and leading the charge are industry giants like CME Group and Google Cloud. Let’s dive into their exciting collaboration and explore how they are set to revolutionize finance through asset tokenization . What is Asset Tokenization and Why is CME Group Exploring It? Asset tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets – anything from company shares and commodities to art and real estate – as digital tokens on a blockchain. Think of it as creating a digital twin of a physical or intangible asset. These tokens can then be easily traded, managed, and fractionalized, opening up a world of new possibilities. Why is CME Group, a global leader in derivatives trading, so interested in this space? The answer lies in the transformative potential of asset tokenization . Here’s why it’s a game-changer: Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenization can unlock liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets. For example, real estate, which can be slow and cumbersome to trade, can become far more liquid when fractionalized into tokens. Increased Accessibility: Asset tokenization democratizes investment opportunities. It allows smaller investors to participate in markets that were previously only accessible to large institutions. Imagine owning a fraction of a blue-chip artwork or a prime piece of real estate with just a few clicks. Operational Efficiency: Blockchain technology streamlines many processes associated with traditional asset management, such as settlement, custody, and compliance. This can lead to significant cost reductions and faster transaction times. Transparency and Security: Blockchain’s inherent transparency and security features provide a robust and auditable record of asset ownership and transactions, reducing fraud and increasing trust. For CME Group, embracing asset tokenization is a strategic move to stay ahead of the curve and cater to the evolving needs of the financial market. By exploring this technology, they are positioning themselves to offer innovative services and maintain their leadership in the global trading landscape.

Robust security measures are paramount to protect tokenized assets. Interoperability Challenges: For asset tokenization to truly flourish, different blockchain platforms and systems need to be interoperable. Lack of interoperability can create fragmented markets and hinder efficiency. Custody Solutions: Secure and reliable custody solutions for digital assets are essential, especially for institutional investors. The industry needs to develop robust and regulated custody frameworks. Education and Adoption: Widespread adoption of asset tokenization requires educating market participants about its benefits and addressing any skepticism or resistance to change. CME Group and Google Cloud are likely aware of these challenges and will be working to address them as they test and develop their asset tokenization infrastructure. Their collaboration could play a significant role in shaping the future of this nascent industry and paving the way for broader adoption. Real-World Examples of Asset Tokenization: Beyond Traditional Finance Asset tokenization isn’t limited to traditional financial assets like stocks and bonds. Its versatility allows for the tokenization of a wide range of assets, opening up exciting possibilities in various sectors. Here are some examples: Real Estate: Tokenizing real estate allows for fractional ownership, making property investment more accessible and liquid. Platforms are emerging that enable investors to buy and sell fractions of properties through tokens. Art and Collectibles: High-value art and collectibles can be tokenized, enabling fractional ownership and easier trading of these unique assets. This opens up art investment to a broader audience. Commodities: Tokenizing commodities like gold or oil can streamline trading, improve transparency, and reduce costs in the supply chain. Intellectual Property: Patents, trademarks, and copyrights can be tokenized, making it easier to manage, trade, and monetize intellectual property rights. Carbon Credits: Tokenization can bring greater transparency and efficiency to carbon credit markets, facilitating the fight against climate change. These examples illustrate the diverse applications of asset tokenization and its potential to transform various industries beyond just finance.

Rowe Price—the firm that handles over $1 trillion in assets—said that now is a good time to have exposure to bitcoin. He likened the price of bitcoin to a commodity and how investors should think about investing in it. “Bitcoin itself has traded very close to its average cost of mine. So if you think about it like a traditional commodity, that's actually historically a really good time to have exposure to it when it's close to its cost of mine,” he said. In traditional commodity investing, when the cost of mining or extracting a commodity is close to the spot price, it often signals that the commodity's price might have found the floor or has a limited downside. This is something contrarian investors look for when investing in commodities, as the bearish sentiment could be priced in when such an event occurs. Rizzo seems to be alluding to such a dynamic in play for bitcoin as well if one compares commodity cycles to bitcoin price. According to MacroMicro blog, the current average price of mining bitcoin is around $84,770, while the spot price is hovering near $87,000. How to play blockchain and AI revolution Rizzo also said that he sees blockchain and digital payments as an integral part of fintech and artificial intelligence (AI). “The world is getting more global, we're moving from cash to digital payments … so, I think digital payments is really at the nexus of moving money cheaply and taking a software-driven approach to areas that have historically been not software-driven,” according to Rizzo. He said part of this movement is blockchain, which he believes every investor should have some exposure to, whether through holding stocks of companies like Coinbase (COIN) or Robinhood (HOOD) or those of crypto miners profiting from the evolution of AI.",Finance|Bitcoin|commodity,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-25 23:30:57

Given the telecom’s underlying business fundamental s, strategic growth drivers, and defensive characteristics in a challenging overall economic backdrop, Goldman Sachs rates the stock as Buys and expects high upside ability in the next few years. Meanwhile, a nalyst James Schneider has a near-term price target of $29, nearly 8% higher than Monday’s close of $26.96. AT&T’s strong profits and generous dividend make it appealing to investors AT&T’s stock has done well lately: it’s up 21% YTD and better than 60% YTD (dividends excluded). When combined with the telecommunications company’s dividend yield of 4.1%, that’s a recipe for a strong income investment. Another big plus for AT&T is that it is less volatile than the market, at a beta of only 0.64. This indicates that the share price tends to be less sensitive to broad market moves, which is very attractive in uncertain economic times and makes stock perceived as a safe-haven investment. AT&T’s wireless business is still a hit. The company has continued to add new cell phone subscribers as demand for its network services is strong. At the same time, it is moving customers to more expensive premium plans, which boosts average revenue per user (ARPU) for its services and supports hometown revenue growth. Goldman Sachs then contends that such forces will quietly but inexorably raise earning estimates, which are the basis for the sustained revenue growth that the company has realized thus far. AT&T, as the most aggressive fiber builder in the U.S., is expected to see a significant boost in broadband profitability over the next five years. The company has also aggressively pursued fibre assets to replace their DSL/U-verse copper-based networks, increasing future capacity upgrades relative to other forms of access volume and a potentially cheaper model all-in for the company. Analysts also anticipate AT&T’s broadband revenue growth accelerating through the end of the decade as more residential customers migrate to fiber. Such focus will strengthen the firm’s broadband marketplace presence and balance sheet. The FCC is streamlining regulations to accelerate fibre transitions and drive cost savings for telecom companies Another major tailwind supporting AT&T’s fibre transition is regulatory tailwinds. The FCC is working on policies that will allow for faster decommissioning of legacy copper plants. Should these regulatory changes take off, AT&T has the potential to accelerate its fibre transition, ramp up its capacity, and realize its $6 billion savings targets. The transition from copper to fibre improves network efficiency and cuts maintenance and operating costs, both of which bode well for AT&T’s long-term fundamentals. Goldman Sachs attributes its positive outlook on AT&T, first and foremost, to the company’s strong market position, high dividend yield, and solid business fundamentals.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) space has been rocked by another exploit. This time, it’s Abracadabra, a popular DeFi platform known for its MIM stablecoin, that’s in the spotlight. In a startling turn of events, Abracadabra confirmed via X (formerly Twitter) that its gmCauldrons lending contracts were targeted in a sophisticated attack. Let’s break down what we know about this urgent situation and how Abracadabra is responding. What Happened? Unpacking the Abracadabra Exploit The alarm bells started ringing when unusual transactions were detected targeting Abracadabra’s gmCauldrons. These cauldrons are essentially lending contracts within the DeFi platform, allowing users to borrow assets. According to Abracadabra’s official statement, the exploit was identified after several malicious transactions had already taken place. In response, and to prevent further damage, borrowing has been immediately halted across all gmCauldrons. This proactive measure aims to contain the fallout and assess the full extent of the damage from this crypto hack . Here’s a quick rundown of the key details we know so far: Platform Targeted: Abracadabra DeFi platform Vulnerable Contracts: gmCauldrons lending contracts Issue: Exploit leading to unauthorized borrowing Response: Borrowing halted across all cauldrons Confirmation: Announced via Abracadabra’s official X account The Devastating Toll: $13 Million Crypto Hack The financial implications of this crypto hack are substantial. Blockchain security firm Peckshield, a trusted name in the industry, estimates the damage to be around 6,260 ETH. At current Ethereum prices, this translates to a staggering $13 million loss. This figure underscores the severity of the exploit and the significant financial hit Abracadabra has endured. The sheer scale of the stolen funds highlights the ongoing challenges in securing DeFi platforms against increasingly sophisticated attacks. It’s a stark reminder of the risks involved in the decentralized finance ecosystem, even for established platforms like Abracadabra. A Bold Move: 20% Bug Bounty Offered In a rather unconventional and perhaps desperate move, Abracadabra has offered a 20% bug bounty to the attacker. This means they are willing to pay 20% of the stolen funds – approximately $2.6 million based on the $13 million loss – for the return of the remaining 80%. Offering a bug bounty , especially of this magnitude, is a clear indication of Abracadabra’s urgency to recover the stolen assets and mitigate further damage. It’s a high-stakes gamble, hoping to incentivize the attacker to return the majority of the funds while potentially identifying vulnerabilities that led to the exploit. Whether the attacker will accept this offer remains to be seen, but it’s certainly a dramatic development in this unfolding situation. Let’s consider the implications of offering such a large bug bounty : Incentive for Return: A significant financial reward could entice the attacker to return funds. Reputation Management: Shows Abracadabra is taking proactive steps to resolve the issue. Vulnerability Insight: May lead to information about the exploit’s mechanics, helping prevent future attacks. Ethical Dilemma: Some may question rewarding malicious activity, even for fund recovery. Uncertain Outcome: No guarantee the attacker will accept or be identifiable. DeFi Platform Security: A Constant Battle This latest Abracadabra exploit serves as another stark reminder of the ongoing security challenges within the DeFi space. While DeFi platforms offer incredible innovation and financial opportunities, they are also prime targets for hackers. The decentralized and often open-source nature of these platforms can, paradoxically, create vulnerabilities if not rigorously audited and secured. The DeFi platform ecosystem is in a constant state of evolution, with new protocols and smart contracts being deployed regularly. This rapid pace of development can sometimes outstrip security measures, leaving gaps that malicious actors can exploit. For users, this underscores the importance of due diligence, understanding the risks involved, and choosing platforms with robust security track records. Here are some key takeaways regarding DeFi platform security: Aspect Consideration Smart Contract Audits Essential to identify vulnerabilities before deployment. Security Practices Rigorous testing, monitoring, and incident response plans are crucial. Community Vigilance Active community monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity can be invaluable. User Education Users need to understand risks and best practices for interacting with DeFi platforms. The Future of Abracadabra and MIM Stablecoin The immediate aftermath of this Abracadabra exploit raises questions about the future of the platform and its MIM stablecoin. While Abracadabra has acted swiftly to halt borrowing and offer a bug bounty , the incident will undoubtedly impact user confidence. The price of SPELL, Abracadabra’s native token, and the stability of MIM could face increased scrutiny in the short term. How Abracadabra handles this crisis, communicates with its community, and implements stronger security measures will be critical in determining its long-term viability. The resilience and transparency displayed in the coming days will be crucial for regaining trust and ensuring the continued operation of this prominent DeFi platform . In conclusion, the Abracadabra exploit is a significant event in the DeFi world, highlighting both the potential and the perils of decentralized finance. The $13 million crypto hack and the unprecedented bug bounty offer underscore the high stakes and fast-paced nature of this innovative yet risky space. As the situation unfolds, the crypto community will be watching closely to see how Abracadabra recovers and what lessons can be learned to bolster security across the entire DeFi ecosystem.

42344889,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143216,1742946631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Paid Startup: Manny Medina Unveils Lucrative AI Agent Billing Solution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/paid-startup-ai-agent-billing/,"The world of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, and 2024 is shaping up to be the year of the AI agent . As businesses increasingly explore the potential of these autonomous digital workers, a critical infrastructure is needed to support their growth and, crucially, their compensation. Enter Paid, a groundbreaking new venture from Manny Medina, the visionary founder of Outreach. Paid isn’t building AI agents themselves; instead, they are providing the essential financial rails – the picks and shovels, if you will – to ensure these digital entities, and the companies deploying them, thrive in this new era. Bitcoin World had the exclusive scoop on this exciting development. Decoding the Challenge of AI Agent Pricing Manny Medina, fresh off his success at sales automation giant Outreach (valued at a staggering $4.4 billion), recognized a significant gap in the burgeoning AI agents landscape. After extensive conversations with numerous agentic platform startups, a recurring pain point emerged: how do you effectively and profitably charge for the work of AI agents ? The traditional software pricing models simply don’t translate to this paradigm shift. Forget per-user or per-seat licenses – the very essence of AI agents is their ability to operate autonomously and at scale. One human employee might oversee dozens, or even hundreds, of agents. Similarly, usage-based pricing, reminiscent of the SaaS revolution, also falls short. If AI agents are truly effective, they are designed to take over entire roles, not just perform discrete tasks. Medina astutely points out, “An agent’s customer doesn’t want to pay for all the discrete tasks an agent does – if it even knows them all. They want to pay for its results, like an employee.” Imagine an AI agent deployed in insurance, tasked with policy renewals. The client isn’t concerned with the number of emails sent or actions taken; they care about the successful policy renewals generated. This outcome-based expectation clashes with the variable costs associated with running AI agents , primarily driven by the consumption of LLM tokens during training and task execution. This complexity creates a significant hurdle for startups in the AI agent space. “So how do you help them price for the job that they’re delivering?” Medina questioned, highlighting the core problem Paid aims to solve. These startups need the flexibility to experiment with different AI pricing strategies and, crucially, to accurately measure their profit margins. Paid: Bridging Billing and HR for the AI Agent Era The novelty of AI agents means that fundamental business processes, like profitable billing and renewals, are still largely uncharted territory. Paid steps in to provide this crucial framework. The platform empowers agentic startups to craft sophisticated AI pricing models – whether fixed or variable – with a laser focus on achieving profitable margins. Beyond just billing, Paid also incorporates agent output tracking. This dual functionality allows startups to not only optimize their agent billing strategies but also to rigorously validate the return on investment (ROI) generated by their AI agents . Think of it as the next-generation evolution of SaaS business tools: Zuora (the leader in SaaS renewal billing) converging with SuccessFactors (a powerhouse in SaaS HR management), specifically tailored for the age of AI agents . Paid’s initial target market is startups, rather than established enterprise giants like Salesforce or Microsoft, which are also venturing into agentic platforms. However, by focusing on the startups building the next wave of AI innovation, Paid is positioning itself at the very heart of the AI agent revolution. Already, Paid boasts an impressive roster of beta customers, including Logic.app, 11x, Vidlab7, Artisan, and HappyRobot, showcasing the immediate need and appeal of their platform. The Power of AI in Building Paid Medina emphasizes the transformative impact of AI not just on the solutions Paid enables, but also on the very process of building the company itself. “Agents are replacing roles, human roles, not the entire job, but entire roles,” Medina stated, underscoring the profound shift underway. He’s putting this philosophy into practice by leveraging AI tools to accelerate Paid’s development. The initial product demos for Paid were “vibe coded” by their engineers using cutting-edge AI -powered tools like V0, Replit, and Lovable. Medina is clearly excited about this new paradigm of company building. “This is what is so much fun about building a company right now. We have two engineers, and we have built the entirety of the building platform in a month. Why? Because we build everything on AI,” he revealed, highlighting the unprecedented speed and efficiency AI brings to software development. Manny Medina: From Outreach to Paid – A Serial Entrepreneur’s Journey Manny Medina’s track record speaks for itself. His journey with Outreach is a testament to his entrepreneurial prowess. From its humble beginnings in 2011, he steered Outreach to become a dominant force in sales automation, scaling it to 800 employees and $250 million in annual recurring revenue by the time he stepped down as CEO in September. While he later relinquished his executive chairman role in March (remaining on the board), Medina’s entrepreneurial spirit remains as vibrant as ever. Now based in London, he is channeling his experience and vision into Paid, ready to tackle the next frontier of business in the AI agent era. Paid’s successful €10 million (approximately $11 million) pre-seed funding round, led by European powerhouse EQT Ventures, alongside Sequoia and GTMFund, is a strong validation of Medina’s vision and the critical need for a platform like Paid. As AI agents become increasingly integral to the business landscape, Paid is poised to become the indispensable infrastructure that ensures their economic viability and fuels the continued growth of this transformative technology.

To fund this initiative, a total of 10 million DOGE tokens worth approximately $1.8 million were bought. House of Doge has been tasked with promoting the cryptocurrency’s appeal as a payment method to corporate partners – e.g. merchants. “The Official @Dogecoin Reserve” … sooner than Powered By : @houseofdoge & @DogecoinFdn $DOGE #dogecoin Dogecoin is Money! pic.twitter.com/xGuRKIei7o — House of Doge (@houseofdoge) March 14, 2025 “By maintaining a reserve, we can bridge the gap between transaction processing times and real-world usability, making Dogecoin extremely practical for everyday purchases,” commented Michael Galloro, Member of the Board-Elect of House of Doge in a press release published on Monday. The announcement has sparked enthusiasm among market participants, with Dogecoin (DOGE) outperforming its meme coin peers today. While Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have posted modest 24-hour gains of 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively, FLOKI and WIF have slipped by 0.2% and 1.1%. DOGE trading volume has surged by 41% in the past day as investors rushed to gain exposure following the news. This momentum highlights a growing trend of meme coins gaining utility beyond their origins as internet culture icons or speculative assets. If more merchants begin accepting Dogecoin for payments, the token’s real-world use case could drive increased demand and help cement its status as the leading meme coin. DOGE Climbs for a Third Consecutive Day – Is the Sell-Off Over? DOGE’s daily chart shows that the token found a temporary floor at the $0.1400 level during the early March sell-off. The token has been rising for three days in a row as positive momentum seems to be picking up its pace. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above the signal line and has distanced itself from it by nearly 31% already, which is bullish. Meanwhile, the MACD’s histogram shows steadily rising positive momentum readings. DOGE is also breaking a bearish descending triangle today. This is another early sign that the token could be about to reverse its downtrend. However, a reversal would only be confirmed if DOGE rises above its most recent lower high at $0.2410. If that happens, we could witness a full-blown recovery over the next few months for DOGE as market sentiment continues to improve. Identifying which meme coins will outperform the market can be a difficult task. Meme Index ($MEMEX) is becoming one of the best crypto presales of the year as it makes it easier for investors to get diversified exposure to this sector. Meme Index ($MEMEX) Raises $4M to Launch its Decentralized Meme Coin Investing Platform Meme Index ($MEMEX) is a decentralized investment platform designed to simplify and diversify exposure to the meme coin market. It offers four tailored index baskets—Titan, Moonshot, Midcap, and Meme Frenzy—allowing investors to choose based on their individual risk profiles. $MEMEX serves as the utility token and gateway to the platform. As adoption grows among meme coin investors, demand for $MEMEX is expected to rise significantly. Currently priced at a discounted $0.0166883 during its presale, $MEMEX presents a compelling opportunity for early buyers.

According to Dune Analytics data, most of that volume has come within the last 24 hours, during which time the protocol generated over $500 million in volume. Over the last 24 hours, the massive trading volume has continued a positive trend for the newly launched DEX, which started operating on March 20. Since its launch, PumpSwap has recorded 12.58 million total swaps from over 401,000 active traders. PumpSwap volume has been on rapid rise (Source: Dune Analytics) With PumpSwap, people who launch tokens on Pump.fun can move their tokens directly to the DEX as soon as they complete the bonding curve. A bonding curve is a mathematical model that determines a token’s price based on its supply, with the price increasing as more tokens are bought. The launch of PumpSwap finally allows memecoin creators to migrate to DEX without paying the 6 SOL migration fee and with plans to enable creators’ revenue sharing later on. Unsurprisingly, the increase in DEX trading volume also means revenue is rising. Per Dune Analytics, the total protocol fees generated so far are $2.4 million, while liquidity providers have received over $600,000 in fees. PumpSwap charges 0.25% in fees, of which 0.2% is for the liquidity providers and 0.005% is for the protocol. Despite the relatively positive performance, an in-depth analysis of its performance metrics shows that most of the protocol’s trades are small transactions. According to Flipside data, 65.22% of its trades, when last updated, were for transactions less than $10, while 21.40% were between $10 and $100. Over 86% of PumpSwap transactions in the last 24 hours is between $1 to $100 (Source: Flipside) This shows that most of its users are still testing out its abilities and do not trust it with their big transactions yet. It could also signify that they want to engage the protocol with the hope of a future airdrop. Nevertheless, many people have already tried out the network, with a total number of unique users now at 3.57 million, with 823 tokens graduated Is PumpSwap coming for Raydium throne? Meanwhile, the rising transaction volume and massive influx of unique addresses interacting with the DEX have led many observers to note that it could challenge Raydium. Raydium is Solana’s leading DEX, with $2.53 billion in volume over the past week, according to Defillama . The protocol also accounts for 27.94% of the DEX volume on Solan, while PumpSwap comes fifth, behind Orca, Meteora, and Linfinity. However, Raydium is now sitting content while watching PumpSwap rise. The DEX also recently unveiled LaunchLab, its own token issuance platform that seems to target Pump.fun. While Pump.fun has established itself as the memecoin deployer, Raydium is positioning LaunchLab as the platform for issuing all kinds of projects and providing permissionless and neutral infrastructure for Solana-based projects to launch their tokens. So far, PumpSwap’s arrival has had little impact on Raydium, as the protocol continues to command significant volume. Its token, RAY, is also performing well. According to CoinMarketCap, RAY has been up 22% in the last seven days and has seen a gain of around 1% in the last 24 hours. The biggest beneficiary of this competition in the Solana ecosystem appears to be the network itself. SOL is now on a rebound, rising 2% in the last 24 hours and 17% in the past seven days.

The trio used spoofed phone numbers and fake support calls to impersonate Google and Gemini representatives, manipulating the victim into transferring funds and resetting their two-factor authentication.

The indictment revealed both were arrested sometime in September 2024 and charged with conspiring to steal and launder cryptocurrency. They were set to appear in separate federal courts in California and Florida on Thursday, September 19, 2024 according to the Justice Department. According to Zach’s investigation, a cluster of the stolen funds was allegedly used to purchase luxury goods including cars, watches, jewelry and designer clothes. Unlike the other two, Malone had not revealed his identity during the heist but his flashy lifestyle gave him away. With his loot, Lam allegedly purchased a fleet of luxury vehicles, including a Pagani Huayra worth $3.8 million, a Lamborghini Revuelto worth $1 million, and custom Porsches and Ferraris. Authorities have reported that 22 luxury vehicles belonging to Lam are still missing, including a white Lamborghini with his name on it. Aside from the luxury cars, Malone also rented multiple mansions and acquired luxury watches, purchasing one of the watches for about $1.8 million. Within the short period of time that he got the loot, Malone quickly built himself a reputation in the Los Angeles nightlife scenes because of how he spent. He would give out handbags to strangers, including influencers, many of whom would recount their experience in Instagram videos. Malone was linked to the loot after accidentally sharing an address used to purchase luxury clothing. Greavys was the first to be arrested. He was located via OSINT in LA/Miami because his friends kept posting his location on social media every night. He also had an Instagram account where he shared photos of himself using his name in 2024. Greavys’ partner tried to warn Malone of the trouble headed his way after her boyfriend’s arrest, and he tried to flee but was apprehended in the process.

Lam is currently facing two counts of indictment in the District of Columbia for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. Each charge he’s accused of carries a maximum term of 20 years. He is presently being held in Virginia, with his lawyer Scott Armstrong noting that his trial will occur in October 2025. The lawyer also said Lam wants to file other legal attacks, with most of them being suppressive motions that require the US government to provide meaningful discovery in the case against him. The crypto fraudster, who is considered a flight risk, is also reportedly calling for the search warrant affidavits and reports relevant to the searches that were carried out in his case. According to prosecutors, Lam could be looking at between 168 and 210 months in jail due to the gravity of the crime, with about $100 million in stolen Bitcoin still missing.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 542,00 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s current bull market cycle has yet to reach a peak. “BTC bull market progress: 82.5%. (Progress will speed up on parabolic advances and slow down on deeper retraces).” Source: Rekt Capital/X The analyst also tells his 107,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin’s latest correction to $76,000 is not the sign of a beginning bear market based on historical precedence. “Many people have been talking about this being a bear market, but it does look like it is a downside deviation period very similar to what we’ve seen back in the past. Obviously, these downside deviation periods are changing across time, but it’s really important to look at the charts in a level-headed manner and try and look at it in an unbiased way and not scream bear market whenever we see a pullback that is actually very similar to the one we saw here [in 2024]. This was a 32% pullback [in 2024]. This is a 30% pullback [when Bitcoin corrected to the $76,000 range this month], so very similar downside deviation in that regard, but really important to keep level-headed and look at the data, look at the chart, and zoom out when in doubt.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube In technical analysis, a downside deviation is a setup where an asset breaks its immediate support to print a false breakdown before igniting a recovery and rallying to new highs.

The Bitcoin market is buzzing with exciting news. Fidelity’s FBTC Bitcoin ETF has just witnessed a massive $60 million inflow, according to data from Arkham Intelligence on X. This significant surge is not just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure. Are we on the cusp of another major wave of adoption? Let’s dive deep into what this means for Bitcoin and the broader crypto landscape. Why is the Fidelity FBTC Bitcoin ETF attracting such massive inflows? The recent $60 million injection into Fidelity’s FBTC Bitcoin ETF is a noteworthy event for several reasons. It underscores a continued and, perhaps, accelerating trend of institutional investors seeking regulated and convenient pathways to gain exposure to Bitcoin. But what makes the Fidelity FBTC ETF so appealing? Let’s break it down: Reputable Provider: Fidelity is a globally recognized and trusted financial institution with decades of experience in asset management. This established reputation provides a sense of security and reliability for investors, especially larger institutional players who prioritize counterparty risk. Ease of Access: For institutions and even retail investors, investing in a Bitcoin ETF is significantly simpler than directly purchasing and storing Bitcoin. ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them accessible through brokerage accounts that many institutions already utilize. Regulatory Compliance: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a layer of compliance and investor protection that is often lacking in the direct purchase of cryptocurrencies. This regulatory clarity is particularly attractive to institutional investors who must adhere to strict compliance standards. Diversification Benefits: For portfolio managers, adding a Bitcoin ETF can offer diversification benefits, potentially enhancing risk-adjusted returns. Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds makes it an attractive diversifier. The inflow into Fidelity FBTC isn’t happening in isolation. It’s part of a larger narrative of increasing institutional acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into mainstream finance. This latest influx suggests that the narrative is gaining momentum. Institutional Investment in Bitcoin ETFs: What does it really signify? Institutional investment is often considered the holy grail for Bitcoin and the crypto market in general. Why? Because it represents a substantial influx of capital, validation of Bitcoin as an asset class, and a move towards broader mainstream adoption. Here’s what this increasing institutional interest, exemplified by the Fidelity FBTC inflow, really signifies: Increased Market Liquidity: Larger institutional players bring significant capital to the market, which can lead to increased liquidity. This, in turn, can reduce volatility and make the market more efficient. Price Appreciation Potential: As demand for Bitcoin increases through institutional investment in ETFs and other avenues, basic economics suggests that the price of Bitcoin could appreciate. Limited supply coupled with rising demand is a classic recipe for price increases. Mainstream Validation: When established institutions like Fidelity allocate capital to Bitcoin ETFs, it sends a powerful signal to the broader market. It validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, moving it further away from the fringes and closer to the mainstream. Long-Term Investment Horizon: Institutional investors typically have a longer-term investment horizon compared to retail traders. This can contribute to greater stability in the Bitcoin market, reducing the impact of short-term speculative trading. The $60 million inflow into Fidelity FBTC is a tangible manifestation of this growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Decoding Bitcoin Inflows: Is there a direct link to price action? The crypto world is always trying to decipher patterns and predict price movements. Naturally, a significant event like a $60 million Bitcoin inflow into an ETF raises the question: Does this directly translate to positive price action for Bitcoin? While there’s no guaranteed one-to-one correlation, there are strong reasons to believe that Bitcoin inflows into ETFs can be a positive catalyst. Let’s consider the dynamics: Increased Demand: ETF inflows represent actual buying pressure in the Bitcoin market. To fulfill the ETF demand, fund providers like Fidelity need to purchase Bitcoin, directly increasing demand for the asset. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins. Increased demand from ETFs and other sources, against a limited supply, can create upward pressure on prices. Market Sentiment: Positive news like significant ETF inflows can boost market sentiment. Positive sentiment can attract more investors, both institutional and retail, further fueling demand and potentially price appreciation. However, it’s crucial to remember that the Bitcoin market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. While Bitcoin inflows into ETFs are a positive indicator, they are just one piece of the puzzle. External factors can sometimes overshadow even strong positive inflows. Therefore, while these inflows are encouraging, a holistic view of the market is always necessary. The Broader Crypto ETF Landscape: Are other Crypto ETFs seeing similar traction? While the spotlight is currently on Fidelity FBTC due to the $60 million inflow, it’s important to look at the broader Crypto ETF landscape. Are other ETFs experiencing similar positive trends? The answer, to some extent, is yes. The launch and growth of various Bitcoin ETFs, particularly in regions like North America, have collectively contributed to increased institutional and retail access to Bitcoin. Here’s a glimpse into the broader landscape: Crypto ETF Focus Cryptocurrency Key Features Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) Bitcoin One of the earliest and largest Bitcoin investment vehicles, transitioning to an ETF. iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) Bitcoin Offered by BlackRock, a global leader in asset management, providing broad market access. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) Bitcoin Futures First U.S. Bitcoin-linked ETF, offering exposure through futures contracts. Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BTF) Bitcoin Futures Another Bitcoin futures ETF, providing an alternative exposure route. Various Spot Bitcoin ETFs in Canada Bitcoin Canada has been ahead in approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, offering diverse options. The success of Fidelity FBTC and other Crypto ETFs is paving the way for further innovation and product development in the crypto investment space. We may see ETFs focused on other cryptocurrencies, thematic crypto ETFs, and more sophisticated investment products emerging in the future. This expanding landscape offers investors more choices and further legitimizes crypto as a viable investment category. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Adoption? The $60 million inflow into Fidelity FBTC is more than just a single data point; it’s a signpost pointing towards a future where Bitcoin ETFs play an increasingly central role in institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Looking ahead, here are some key aspects to watch: Continued Inflow Momentum: Will the inflow into Bitcoin ETFs , including Fidelity FBTC , continue at this pace or even accelerate? Sustained inflows would further strengthen the bullish case for Bitcoin. Regulatory Developments: Regulatory clarity and support for crypto ETFs in various jurisdictions will be crucial for broader institutional participation. Positive regulatory signals could unlock even larger pools of capital. Performance of Bitcoin ETFs: The performance of existing Bitcoin ETFs will influence investor sentiment and future allocation decisions. Strong performance could attract more investors and further validate the ETF structure. Expansion to Other Cryptocurrencies: Will the success of Bitcoin ETFs pave the way for ETFs based on other leading cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, or even baskets of cryptocurrencies? This expansion would broaden the crypto investment universe accessible through traditional financial channels. The journey of institutional adoption of Bitcoin through ETFs is still in its early stages, but the recent $60 million inflow into Fidelity FBTC is a powerful indication of the direction of travel. It suggests that institutional investors are becoming increasingly comfortable with Bitcoin as an asset class and are utilizing ETFs as a preferred vehicle for gaining exposure. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal for Bitcoin’s Future The $60 million inflow into Fidelity’s FBTC Bitcoin ETF is undoubtedly a stunning development. It’s a clear signal that institutional interest in Bitcoin is not just a fleeting trend but a growing conviction. This influx of capital into a reputable Bitcoin ETF like Fidelity FBTC validates Bitcoin’s position in the evolving financial landscape and suggests a bright future for crypto adoption. As Bitcoin inflows into ETFs continue and the Crypto ETF market matures, we can expect to see further integration of digital assets into mainstream investment portfolios, potentially driving significant growth and stability in the crypto market.

Related News: BREAKING: Ripple Chief Legal Officer Provides Final Update on XRP-SEC Case, Fine Is Changed As of today, we will wait for the SEC to vote on the final amendments. This vote is expected to take less than 30 days. After that, we will wait for the SEC to file a motion to vacate the preliminary injunction, which Ripple will not appeal. Judge Torres will sign it (less than 30 days from the filing of the petition). In the current situation, the Ripple case will be officially and legally over within 60 days from today. This case, which began even before SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, known as a crypto hater, was the main battleground between the crypto industry and regulators. Thus, the crypto industry will leave the litigation process with a very important victory. *This is not investment advice.

This bold initiative, detailed in a formal correspondence to the SEC’s crypto task force, signals a proactive approach towards fostering innovation while ensuring regulatory clarity in the burgeoning Web3 space. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development and explore what it could mean for the future of digital assets and Web3. What is Tokenization and Why is it Crucial for Web3? Before we delve into the specifics of the Asia Web3 Alliance’s proposal, it’s essential to understand the core concept of tokenization . In simple terms, tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets or rights as digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens can represent anything from traditional securities and commodities to intellectual property, real estate, and even loyalty points. The importance of tokenization for Web3 is multifaceted: Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenizing assets makes them more easily divisible and tradable, unlocking liquidity in previously illiquid markets. Fractional Ownership: It allows for fractional ownership of high-value assets, democratizing investment opportunities and making them accessible to a wider range of participants. Increased Efficiency and Transparency: Blockchain-based tokenization streamlines processes, reduces intermediaries, and enhances transparency in transactions. New Business Models: Tokenization paves the way for innovative business models and decentralized applications (dApps) in the Web3 ecosystem. As Web3 continues to evolve, tokenization is poised to become a cornerstone of the new digital economy, bridging the gap between the traditional financial world and the decentralized future. Asia Web3 Alliance’s Bold Proposal: Bridging the Regulatory Gap The Asia Web3 Alliance, a prominent organization based in Japan, is taking a proactive stance to address the regulatory complexities surrounding tokenization and Web3. Their proposal to the U.S. SEC outlines a framework for joint cooperation aimed at promoting both innovation and responsible regulation. The alliance envisions a collaborative effort involving key regulatory bodies from both regions, specifically suggesting the participation of: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan Bank of Japan (BoJ) This multi-agency approach underscores the comprehensive nature of the proposal, recognizing that effective Web3 regulation requires a coordinated effort across different sectors and jurisdictions. The core objectives of this proposed collaboration are ambitious and forward-thinking, designed to lay a solid foundation for the future of tokenization and Web3. Why Tokenization Regulation Matters for Cross-Border Web3 Growth? One of the biggest hurdles for the widespread adoption of tokenization and Web3 technologies is the lack of clear and consistent regulatory frameworks globally. The current regulatory landscape is fragmented, with different jurisdictions adopting varying approaches to digital assets and blockchain-based innovations. This creates uncertainty, hinders cross-border transactions, and stifles innovation. The Asia Web3 Alliance recognizes this challenge and emphasizes the critical need for regulatory interoperability. Their proposal specifically aims to address this issue by focusing on: Developing a Token Classification Framework: Creating a clear and harmonized framework to distinguish between tokenized securities and utility tokens is paramount. This will provide much-needed clarity for businesses and investors, reducing ambiguity and fostering compliance. Supporting Cross-Border Token Issuance: Facilitating the seamless issuance of tokens across different jurisdictions is crucial for promoting global Web3 growth. This requires establishing mutual recognition and compliance standards. Establishing Cross-Border Token Trading and Custody Standards: Developing standardized protocols for the trading and custody of tokens across borders will enhance security, efficiency, and investor protection in the global Web3 marketplace. By tackling these key areas, the proposed collaboration seeks to create a more unified and predictable regulatory environment, paving the way for accelerated growth in the global Web3 ecosystem . Key Benefits of the Proposed Collaboration for Web3 Innovation The potential benefits of a successful collaboration between the U.S. SEC and Asian regulatory bodies on Web3 regulation are substantial and far-reaching. This initiative could act as a catalyst for innovation, fostering a more robust and globally interconnected Web3 ecosystem. Some of the key advantages include: Benefit Description Regulatory Clarity and Certainty Harmonized regulations will provide businesses and investors with greater clarity and predictability, encouraging investment and participation in the Web3 space. Reduced Compliance Burden Interoperable regulations will simplify compliance for companies operating across borders, reducing costs and administrative hurdles. Accelerated Innovation A more favorable regulatory environment will foster innovation and experimentation in tokenization and Web3 technologies. Enhanced Investor Protection Jointly developed standards for trading and custody will strengthen investor protection in the evolving digital asset market. Global Web3 Growth By promoting cross-border collaboration and interoperability, this initiative can contribute to the overall growth and maturation of the global Web3 ecosystem. Moreover, the proposal includes the establishment of a “safe harbor mechanism” for early-stage token projects and learning sandbox test models from the U.S. This demonstrates a commitment to nurturing innovation from the ground up, providing a supportive environment for startups and emerging Web3 ventures. What are the Challenges in Tokenization and Cross-Border Regulation? While the Asia Web3 Alliance’s proposal is undoubtedly a positive step, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent challenges in achieving effective tokenization regulation and cross-border collaboration. Navigating these complexities will be crucial for the success of this initiative. Some of the key challenges include: Divergent Regulatory Philosophies: The U.S. and Asian countries may have different regulatory philosophies and priorities, making it challenging to reach a consensus on unified standards. Technological Complexity: Web3 technologies are rapidly evolving, making it difficult for regulators to keep pace and develop future-proof regulations. Enforcement Challenges: Enforcing cross-border regulations in a decentralized and global Web3 environment presents significant logistical and legal hurdles. Data Privacy and Security Concerns: Balancing innovation with data privacy and security requirements is a critical consideration in Web3 regulation . Political and Economic Factors: Geopolitical dynamics and economic competition between nations could also influence the progress and outcomes of regulatory collaboration. Overcoming these challenges will require sustained dialogue, compromise, and a shared commitment to fostering responsible innovation in the Web3 space. Examples of Successful Tokenization Initiatives Globally Despite the regulatory hurdles, tokenization is already gaining traction across various sectors globally, showcasing its transformative potential. Examining successful examples can provide valuable insights and inspire further innovation. Here are a few notable examples: Real Estate Tokenization: Platforms like RealT are tokenizing real estate properties, allowing investors to purchase fractions of properties with cryptocurrency, increasing accessibility and liquidity in the real estate market. Security Token Offerings (STOs): Companies are utilizing STOs to raise capital by issuing tokenized securities, offering a regulated alternative to traditional Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and expanding access to investment opportunities. Supply Chain Tokenization: Blockchain-based tokenization is being used to track and manage supply chains, enhancing transparency, efficiency, and traceability of goods. Digital Collectibles (NFTs): Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized the digital art and collectibles market, demonstrating the power of tokenization in creating unique and verifiable digital assets. Tokenized Carbon Credits: Initiatives are emerging to tokenize carbon credits, creating a more transparent and efficient market for carbon offsetting and promoting environmental sustainability. These examples highlight the diverse applications of tokenization and its potential to disrupt and improve various industries. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Future of Web3 Regulation The Asia Web3 Alliance’s proposal offers valuable insights for stakeholders navigating the evolving landscape of Web3 regulation . Here are some actionable takeaways: Proactive Engagement is Key: Industry players should proactively engage with regulators to shape the regulatory framework and ensure it is conducive to innovation. Collaboration is Essential: Cross-border collaboration among regulatory bodies is crucial for creating a harmonized and globally interoperable Web3 ecosystem. Focus on Clarity and Transparency: Regulatory efforts should prioritize clarity and transparency in defining token classifications and compliance standards. Embrace Sandbox Environments: Regulatory sandboxes and safe harbor mechanisms are vital for fostering innovation and allowing early-stage projects to experiment and grow responsibly. Balance Innovation with Investor Protection: Web3 regulation should strike a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring adequate investor protection and market integrity. By embracing these insights and working collaboratively, stakeholders can contribute to building a thriving and sustainable future for Web3 and tokenization . Conclusion: A Promising Step Towards a Harmonized Web3 Future The Asia Web3 Alliance’s proposal for collaboration with the U.S. SEC represents a significant and promising step towards establishing a more harmonized and globally cohesive Web3 regulatory environment. By advocating for joint initiatives on tokenization and Web3 regulation , the alliance is demonstrating leadership and foresight in navigating the complexities of this rapidly evolving space.

This comes as Americans continue to view the U.S. economy negatively due to rising prices and uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s policies. The economic outlook’s uncertainty is seriously affecting consumers’ predictions of their future well-being By March, the Conference Board consumer confidence index had reached 92.9, the lowest level in four years and down from February’s 98.3. The expectations index, which examines consumers’ short-term expectations for business, labour market, and income conditions, also declined in February and March. At 65.2% in March, the expectations index was far below the 80-point mark, which, according to the Conference Board, normally indicates an impending recession. February also saw a decline, with the index falling to 72.9—the first time it had dipped below 80 since June 2024. Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior U.S. economist at the Conference Board, said one of their most striking findings was how consumers’ expectations concerning their financial circumstances had deteriorated. “So that does seem to indicate that all this uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook is really beginning to weigh on consumers’ (view) of how they will do going forward,” she added. In addition, consumer expectations for the economy have weakened, according to multiple readings, including Tuesday’s. The market is increasingly concerned that consumers could pull back on spending if they grow more pessimistic about the economy. The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and economists disagree on whether “soft” survey data, such as the consumer confidence index, will make “hard” economic data, like real consumer spending, worse. “There’ve been lots of times when people are saying downbeat stuff about the economy, and they go out and buy a new car,” Powell said. However, we can’t assume that that will be the case here. We will be watching closely for weakness in the real data.” For now, however, most economists have insisted that there remains no clear sign of a sharp slowdown, even if the overall growth trajectory for the U.S. economy is likely weaker than expected going into the year. On Sunday, Morgan Stanley’s chief global economist wrote in a research note to clients that all recession-related crises are probably overstated. He pointed to the worrying collapse of retail sales in January before rebounding in February. U.S. consumers express low confidence through growing financial pessimism According to the February edition of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, which was made public on Monday, March 10, consumers were less confident about their future financial circumstances even though their medium- and long-term inflation expectations remained constant. Furthermore, the bank’s Centre for Macroeconomic Data revealed notable drops in expectations regarding credit accessibility, delinquency, and unemployment. Based on credit accessibility, a greater percentage of households believed it was harder to obtain credit, whereas a smaller percentage believed it was simpler. Additionally, three banking regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released data on Monday that indicated weakening credit quality among borrowers with balances exceeding $100 million. The regulators explained that the reasons for the negative trends in credit quality were the pressure of high interest rates on leveraged borrowers and the compressed operating margins in certain industry sectors.

42346074,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143220,1742949035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Victory for Crypto: FDIC Kills ‘Reputational Risk’ in Bank Supervision,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fdic-kills-reputational-risk/,"In a move hailed as a significant win for the cryptocurrency industry, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has officially removed ‘reputational risk’ as a criterion for bank supervision. This decision, celebrated by figures like David Sacks, a former Trump administration official, marks a pivotal shift away from subjective standards that have previously hindered crypto businesses’ access to traditional banking services. For years, the specter of ‘reputational risk’ has loomed large, often used as a vague justification to deny banking to legitimate crypto enterprises. Is this the end of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and a new era of fairness for the digital asset space? Why is Removing ‘Reputational Risk’ from Bank Supervision a Big Deal? The removal of ‘reputational risk’ from the FDIC’s supervisory framework is not just bureaucratic jargon; it’s a fundamental change with real-world implications. Previously, banks could cite ‘reputational risk’ – a nebulous and often subjective concept – to justify severing ties with or refusing service to businesses deemed undesirable. In practice, this vague standard became a tool to target lawful cryptocurrency firms, a phenomenon critics dubbed ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’. Think of it this way: Subjectivity vs. Objectivity: ‘Reputational risk’ is inherently subjective. What one regulator deems risky, another might not. This lack of clarity created uncertainty and stifled innovation in the crypto sector. Chilling Effect: The mere threat of being labeled ‘reputationally risky’ could deter banks from working with crypto companies, even those operating within legal boundaries. Lack of Transparency: Decisions based on ‘reputational risk’ were often opaque, leaving crypto businesses in the dark about the specific concerns and with limited recourse. By eliminating this criterion, the FDIC is signaling a move towards objective, data-driven assessments of risk. Banks will now be expected to rely on concrete factors like financial stability, compliance with regulations, and actual, demonstrable risks, rather than vague notions of ‘reputational risk’. David Sacks and the Echoes of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 David Sacks, a prominent voice in the tech and crypto space, didn’t mince words in his praise for the FDIC’s decision. As the former Director of Cryptocurrency and AI in the Trump administration, Sacks has been a vocal critic of what he perceives as regulatory overreach targeting the crypto industry. His reference to ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’ is particularly telling. Operation Chokepoint, initiated by the Obama administration, aimed to combat fraud by pressuring banks to cut ties with businesses deemed ‘high-risk’. While the original intent might have been laudable, critics argue that it was misused to target legitimate industries. ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0′, as coined by some, suggests a similar pattern – a perceived effort to stifle the cryptocurrency industry by leveraging banking regulations. Sacks’ endorsement underscores the significance of the FDIC’s move in the context of these past regulatory challenges. His statement on X (formerly Twitter) highlights the relief felt by many in the crypto community who believe that ‘reputational risk’ was weaponized to unfairly target their businesses. Senator Tim Scott and the FIRM Act: Legislative Muscle Behind Fair Bank Supervision While the FDIC’s action is a regulatory shift, it’s also intertwined with broader legislative efforts to bring clarity and fairness to bank supervision. David Sacks specifically credited Senator Tim Scott’s leadership through the FIRM Act. But what is the FIRM Act, and how does it connect to this FDIC decision? The FIRM Act (Financial Innovation and Regulatory Modernization Act) , championed by Senator Tim Scott, aims to modernize the regulatory framework for financial technology and digital assets. A key objective of the FIRM Act is to promote innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. It seeks to achieve this by: Establishing Clear Regulatory Boundaries: The FIRM Act aims to provide clearer guidelines for how existing financial regulations apply to new technologies like cryptocurrencies. Encouraging Innovation: By reducing regulatory uncertainty, the Act intends to foster innovation and growth in the fintech and digital asset sectors. Promoting Competition: A more level playing field, as envisioned by the FIRM Act, could encourage competition and benefit consumers. The FDIC’s decision to drop ‘reputational risk’ aligns perfectly with the spirit of the FIRM Act. It signals a move towards a more objective, less discriminatory approach to bank supervision, which is crucial for the healthy development of the cryptocurrency industry within the regulated financial system. Benefits of Objective Bank Supervision for Crypto Firms The shift towards objective, data-driven bank supervision, spurred by the FDIC’s action and supported by legislative efforts like the FIRM Act, unlocks a range of benefits for cryptocurrency firms. Let’s explore some key advantages: Benefit Description Improved Access to Banking Services Crypto firms, especially smaller businesses and startups, will find it easier to open and maintain bank accounts, access loans, and utilize other essential financial services. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty Clearer, objective criteria for bank supervision reduces the ambiguity and fear associated with ‘reputational risk’, fostering a more predictable regulatory environment. Fairer Competitive Landscape By eliminating subjective barriers, the FDIC’s move promotes a fairer playing field where crypto firms are judged on their actual risk profile, not on perceived reputational issues. Encouraged Innovation and Growth With better access to banking and reduced regulatory hurdles, the cryptocurrency industry can focus on innovation and growth, driving economic activity and job creation. Enhanced Investor Confidence A more stable and predictable regulatory environment can boost investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market, attracting further investment and development. Are There Challenges Ahead? Navigating the New Landscape of Bank Supervision While the FDIC’s decision is undoubtedly a positive step, it’s crucial to acknowledge that challenges may still lie ahead. The removal of ‘reputational risk’ doesn’t automatically guarantee smooth sailing for crypto firms. What potential hurdles remain? Implementation and Enforcement: The true impact of this policy change will depend on how effectively it is implemented and enforced by bank supervisors. Consistent and fair application across all banks is essential. Residual Subjectivity: Even with ‘reputational risk’ removed, some degree of subjectivity might still creep into bank supervision. Regulators must remain vigilant against implicit biases and ensure truly objective assessments. Ongoing Regulatory Scrutiny: The cryptocurrency industry remains under significant regulatory scrutiny globally. Firms must continue to prioritize compliance and risk management to maintain positive relationships with banks and regulators. Education and Awareness: Banks and regulators need to be further educated about the nuances of the cryptocurrency industry to make informed decisions based on facts, not misconceptions. Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses: Seizing the Opportunity For cryptocurrency businesses, the FDIC’s decision and the broader shift towards objective bank supervision present a valuable opportunity. Here are some actionable steps crypto firms can take: Strengthen Compliance Frameworks: Robust KYC/AML procedures, transparent operations, and adherence to all applicable regulations are more critical than ever. Demonstrate a commitment to compliance to build trust with banks. Proactively Engage with Banks: Don’t wait for banks to reach out. Initiate conversations, showcase your compliance measures, and clearly articulate your business model and risk mitigation strategies. Document Everything: Maintain meticulous records of your operations, compliance efforts, and financial transactions. Transparency and documentation are key to building credibility. Seek Legal and Regulatory Counsel: Stay informed about evolving regulations and seek expert legal and regulatory advice to ensure you are navigating the landscape effectively. Advocate for Fair Policies: Engage with industry associations and participate in advocacy efforts to promote fair and balanced regulatory frameworks that support innovation. A Welcome Shift Towards Fairness in Crypto Banking The FDIC’s decision to drop ‘reputational risk’ from bank supervision is more than just a policy tweak; it’s a symbolic victory for the cryptocurrency industry. It signals a move away from subjective biases and towards a more objective, data-driven approach to regulating this burgeoning sector. While challenges remain, this development, coupled with legislative efforts like the FIRM Act, offers a glimmer of hope for a fairer and more inclusive financial future for crypto. This welcome shift can pave the way for greater innovation, broader adoption, and a more level playing field for crypto businesses seeking to operate within the traditional financial system. The era of ‘reputational risk’ as a blunt instrument against crypto appears to be waning, replaced by a more nuanced and hopefully, more equitable approach.

In November 2024, the SEC issued a Wells notice to the Web3 gaming company alleging that it was in potential violation of securities laws. In a report , Immutable called the notice the latest in the agency’s policy of regulation by enforcement, which was targeting leading Web3 companies, such as Ripple, OpenSea, and Coinbase. While the SEC did not state it in its notice, Immutable believes the inquiry targeted the listing and sales of its tokens IMX in 2021 and expressed confidence that its assets and services were not in violation of any laws. “We are confident in the legality of our assets and services, in the value digital ownership can bring to 3.1 billion gamers across the world, and in the power of blockchain to create a better internet. If required, we will fight for these rights, and those of our industry, vigorously,” the report said. SEC ends all investigations into Web3 gaming company Immutable Last year, the SEC issued Immutable a Wells Notice. That inquiry is now officially closed, with zero findings of wrongdoing, and the SEC is taking no action. This is a huge win – not just for web3 gaming, but everyone who believes in digital ownership rights. Let's build. — Immutable (@Immutable) March 25, 2025 On March 25, 2025, the Web3 gaming company announced that the SEC has decided to formally end all investigations into Immutable, the IMX Ecosystem Foundation, and its CEO. Also, the regulator would not be taking any further enforcement actions. “The SEC’s decision to end its investigation is a win for all builders, creators and gamers fighting for true digital ownership in gaming,” the Web3 gaming firm shared in a news release, adding that it is vindicated in its longstanding focus on legal and regulatory compliance. The SEC dropping its inquiry into Immutable aligns with the broader shift of the regulatory landscape under President Trump. In January 2025, the SEC established a crypto task force led by Hester Peirce , charged with creating comprehensive and clear regulatory frameworks governing digital assets. The SEC also dropped its case against Ripple, with more settlements and agreements agreed earlier today. Immutable says it welcomes the U.S. government’s commitment to creating clear frameworks for digital assets, adding that, “Constructive regulation provides certainty for builders, and helps foster the innovative potential of blockchain technology.” SEC resolution has implications for the Web3 gaming industry Immutable recorded about $80 million in NFT sales volume in Q4 2024, according to a Messari report . The conclusion of the SEC’s inquiry would have significant effects on the Web3 gaming industry. Regulatory clarity will help unlock investments and help Immutable to tokenize the in-game purchase market , which is worth over $100 billion. After the SEC closed the Inquiry, Immutable co-founder Robbie Ferguson, in a post on X, said it was a huge win not just for Web3 gaming but also digital asset ownership rights, saying the threats to digital asset ownership have been removed. The company, throughout the SEC investigation, was working on its vision to bring digital ownership to the 3.1 billion gamers worldwide. Ferguson believes overcoming the investigation brings Immutable closer to onboarding gamers on-chain. The closure of the SEC’s investigation follows a trend of reevaluating enforcement actions against Web3 and digital asset firms under the Trump administration.

The world of digital assets is buzzing with excitement as traditional finance giant Fidelity Investments makes a bold leap into the Solana ecosystem. In a potentially game-changing development, Fidelity has officially filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Solana ETF . This news, first spotted by the keen eyes at @solidintel_x on X, signals a major step forward for Solana and the broader crypto market. But what does this mean for you, the crypto investor? Let’s dive into the details of this thrilling announcement and unpack its potential impact. Why a Spot Solana ETF is a Big Deal For those unfamiliar, an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. A spot Solana ETF , if approved, would directly hold Solana tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to Solana’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This is a significant departure from futures-based ETFs and opens up a new avenue for traditional investors to access the crypto market. Here’s why this is generating so much buzz: Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. This makes Solana investment available to a wider range of investors who may be hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. Familiarity and Regulation: ETFs operate within a well-established regulatory framework. This provides a sense of security and familiarity for institutional and retail investors accustomed to traditional financial products. Diversification: A Solana ETF can be a valuable tool for portfolio diversification. It allows investors to add crypto exposure without the need to manage individual digital assets directly. Institutional Adoption Signal: Fidelity, a major player in asset management, filing for a Solana ETF sends a powerful signal of institutional confidence in Solana and the long-term potential of crypto. Fidelity’s Foray into Crypto ETFs: A Sign of the Times? Fidelity Investments is no stranger to the crypto space. They have been gradually increasing their involvement, offering crypto trading services and even including Bitcoin in some retirement plans. However, a Fidelity ETF specifically focused on Solana represents a significant escalation in their crypto strategy. This move suggests that Fidelity sees substantial growth potential in Solana and believes there is strong investor demand for a regulated investment product linked to SOL. Consider Fidelity’s track record in the ETF market. They are a well-respected and experienced ETF issuer. Their entry into the crypto ETF arena, particularly with a focus on Solana, could pave the way for wider acceptance and adoption of crypto ETFs by other major financial institutions. The Current Crypto ETF Landscape: Where Does Solana Fit In? The crypto ETF market is still relatively nascent, but it’s rapidly evolving. Currently, spot Bitcoin ETFs have gained significant traction after their approval in the US. Ethereum ETFs are also anticipated, and now, a spot Solana ETF application from Fidelity adds another layer of excitement and potential diversification to the market. Here’s a quick comparison: Cryptocurrency Existing ETFs (Spot/Futures) Fidelity’s Move Bitcoin (BTC) Spot ETFs Approved Already offers Bitcoin products Ethereum (ETH) Futures ETFs, Spot ETFs Anticipated Likely to follow with ETH ETF Solana (SOL) No Spot ETF yet Fidelity files for spot Solana ETF The introduction of a Solana ETF could broaden the appeal of crypto investments beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially attracting investors who are interested in Solana’s unique technology and ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations for a Solana ETF While the spot Solana ETF application is a positive development, it’s important to acknowledge the potential hurdles: SEC Approval: The SEC’s stance on crypto ETFs has been cautious. Approval is not guaranteed, and the review process can be lengthy and rigorous. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their price volatility. This inherent risk needs to be carefully considered by investors. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and changes in regulations could impact crypto ETFs. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of the underlying Solana assets is crucial for a spot ETF. Despite these challenges, Fidelity’s decision to file for a Solana ETF suggests they are confident in navigating these complexities and see a viable path to bringing this product to market. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Investors? So, what should you do with this news? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the progress of Fidelity’s Solana ETF application and any updates from the SEC. Research Solana: If you’re unfamiliar with Solana, now is a good time to research its technology, ecosystem, and potential use cases. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals before investing in any crypto-related product, including ETFs. Diversify Wisely: If a Solana ETF becomes available, consider it as a potential diversification tool within a broader investment portfolio. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Future of Crypto Investment Fidelity’s filing for a spot Solana ETF is undoubtedly a groundbreaking moment for the crypto industry. It signifies a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions and opens up exciting new avenues for investors to participate in the digital asset revolution. While the path to approval may have its bumps, this move underscores the increasing maturity of the crypto market and the enduring appeal of innovative blockchain technologies like Solana. The potential launch of a Fidelity ETF for Solana could mark a new era of accessibility and mainstream adoption for Solana investment and the broader crypto space.

Originally slated for September 2024, the Cerebras IPO delay is now extending further into the future as the national security review process drags on. This delay raises questions about the IPO market and the increasing scrutiny faced by tech companies, especially those in sensitive sectors like artificial intelligence. Why is the Cerebras IPO Delay Happening? Several factors are contributing to the Cerebras IPO delay, primarily centered around a rigorous national security review. Here’s a breakdown: National Security Review: The IPO triggered a national security review due to a significant $335 million investment from G42, an AI holding company based in Abu Dhabi. G42’s past connections with Chinese tech giant Huawei have amplified concerns, leading to intense scrutiny from U.S. authorities. Government Vacancies: Adding to the complexity, key positions within the U.S. government that oversee such reviews remain unfilled. Notably, the assistant Treasury secretary for investment security, who leads the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), is yet to be appointed. This vacancy has slowed down the review process significantly. Geopolitical Tensions: The current geopolitical climate, marked by heightened tensions and a focus on national security, especially concerning technology and AI, is playing a crucial role. Investments from foreign entities, particularly those with potential links to adversarial nations, are under increased examination. Impact on the AI Chips IPO Landscape The Cerebras IPO delay sends ripples through the AI chips IPO landscape. Cerebras is a significant player in the AI hardware space, known for its innovative Wafer Scale Engine. A successful IPO was expected to boost investor confidence in the sector and pave the way for other AI-focused companies to go public. However, this delay introduces uncertainty. What are the potential consequences? Investor Hesitation: The drawn-out review process might make investors wary of investing in AI chip companies, especially those with international funding. It highlights the potential regulatory hurdles and delays associated with IPOs in sensitive tech sectors. Valuation Concerns: Prolonged delays can impact a company’s valuation. Market conditions can change, and investor sentiment can shift, potentially affecting the IPO’s success even after the security review is cleared. Precedent Setting: The Cerebras case could set a precedent for future AI chips IPOs. Companies in similar situations might face even more stringent and time-consuming national security reviews. Cerebras’ Innovative AI Investment and Future Prospects Despite the IPO setbacks, Cerebras remains a formidable force in the AI industry. Their groundbreaking Wafer Scale Engine, a massive chip designed specifically for AI workloads, positions them at the forefront of AI hardware innovation. The AI investment they have attracted, even with the current scrutiny, underscores the potential of their technology. Key highlights of Cerebras’ technology and market position: Wafer Scale Engine (WSE): Cerebras’ WSE is significantly larger and more powerful than traditional GPUs, offering unparalleled performance for complex AI models and computations. Target Market: They cater to high-performance computing needs in areas like scientific research, drug discovery, and large-scale AI model training. Competitive Edge: While facing competition from established players like NVIDIA and AMD, Cerebras carves a niche with its unique architecture optimized for specific AI workloads. Navigating the National Security Review Maze The national security review process is becoming an increasingly critical aspect of IPOs, especially for companies operating in sensitive technology sectors. For Cerebras and other startups seeking to go public, understanding and navigating this maze is crucial. Actionable insights for companies facing similar reviews: Early Engagement: Proactively engage with regulatory bodies and seek guidance early in the IPO process. Transparency: Maintain full transparency regarding funding sources and international partnerships. Risk Assessment: Conduct thorough risk assessments to identify potential national security concerns and address them proactively. Legal Counsel: Seek expert legal counsel specializing in national security reviews and IPO regulations. The Road Ahead for Cerebras and the IPO Market The Cerebras IPO delay is a stark reminder of the complexities and challenges in the current IPO market, particularly for technology companies operating at the intersection of AI and national security. While the delay is undoubtedly a setback, it doesn’t diminish Cerebras’ technological achievements or long-term potential. The company’s ability to navigate the regulatory hurdles and eventually proceed with its IPO will be closely watched by the industry. The outcome of Cerebras’ IPO journey will not only impact the company itself but also shape investor sentiment and the regulatory landscape for future AI and tech IPOs. It underscores the increasing importance of national security considerations in the global technology race.

It has been negotiating with Morocco, Bangladesh, and Turkey. Progress has also been made in other huge markets like India. However, Musk’s political connections have started to complicate Starlink’s global rollout. Musk’s relations with Trump have helped Starlink secure critical government contracts in the United States. Trump-era officials showed fewer concerns about monopolies, clearing a path for SpaceX to land lucrative federal deals. Thanks to that environment, Starlink was recently installed at the White House, and Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, has urged officials to consider the service under the $42 billion US rural Broadband Equity. Regulators in other countries must now decide whether Musk’s political reputation and unpredictable comments on his social media platform create too much risk. This debate has already surfaced in Canada, Europe, and other regions that initially embraced Starlink but are now hesitant to deepen their dependence on Musk’s company. In a recent example, a Canadian province canceled a $100 million agreement with Starlink as a protest against American tariffs, signaling that Musk’s image in the U.S. could affect cross-border deals. He also stirred opposition from European politicians after criticizing their approach to Ukraine’s conflict with Russia. Industry experts say these issues might spark a shift in the satellite communications arena, suggesting that Starlink, while still the largest player, may not remain the only major force if governments decide to diversify. Edison Yu, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, noted, “There appears to be a potentially tectonic shift occurring in the satellite communications landscape ignited by geopolitics. Starlink is still clearly number one, but not the only one.” Musk has a huge financial stake in Starlink Meanwhile, Musk’s financial stake is enormous. Starlink is a key part of SpaceX, which was valued at $350 billion in a private tender offer. Roughly half of Musk’s $314 billion net worth is now tied to SpaceX, while his 20 percent stake in Tesla has dwindled in value to around $100 billion. According to Morgan Stanley, Starlink could generate $16.3 billion in revenue this year, a 74 percent increase from $9.3 billion in 2024. The subscriber base, reported at 4.65 million in January, may nearly double to 7.8 million in the near term. By comparison, SpaceX’s rocket launch business is projected to make $5.8 billion in revenue in 2025, rising from $4.9 billion in the prior year. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said, “While it all began with market-leading launch capability, we believe Starlink will be the primary driver of SpaceX’s growth and profitability.” Starlink claims that it has a network of around 7,000 low-orbit satellites that connect distant corners of the world. Niger, for example, became the latest nation to gain access just last week. However, company insiders report that the bigger developments lie in negotiations with Turkey and Morocco, with the latter exploring an expansion of service into Western Sahara, a disputed territory. In Bangladesh, officials say Musk personally spoke with the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, in hopes of finalizing an operating license. These efforts build on Starlink’s progress in India , where deals were recently made with tycoons Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Mittal. Such partnerships are especially appealing in regions that are geographically difficult to serve. Airlines and maritime companies have also adopted Starlink, including Qatar Airways and Air France. However, Musk’s foray into political matters has presented drawbacks. Musk’s controversial statements and relations with Trump are proving to be a hurdle Musk’s labeling of certain South African Black economic empowerment rules as “openly racist” has caused friction over Starlink’s entry into his home country. Brazil saw a similar controversy over false information shared on Musk’s social media site, X, causing leaders there to consider a ban on Starlink at one point. The global tension grew more visible when Musk requested an urgent meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella to salvage a $1.5 billion deal with Italy’s government. The deal hit a snag after Trump suspended certain military aid and intelligence-sharing arrangements with Ukraine. Italy’s presidential palace refused a direct meeting, instead directing Starlink to work with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose administration holds the real authority in such matters. Around 40,000 terminals are operating in Ukraine’s military, hospital, business, and relief settings. SpaceX originally covered those costs, but they are now handled by Poland and the US Department of Defense. The Pentagon holds a $537 million contract with SpaceX through 2027 under the Proliferated Low Earth Orbit program, ensuring Ukraine’s forces keep receiving satellite coverage. Poland also chips in about $50 million annually to supply Starlink terminals, according to its digitization ministry. Musk’s remarks on X have at times sparked anxiety among Ukraine’s partners. He boasted that Starlink is the “backbone of the Ukrainian army,” adding that the front line would “collapse” without it. In response, Poland’s foreign minister Radosław Sikorski warned that relying so heavily on a single supplier might require Poland to find another provider if Starlink proved unreliable. I literally challenged Putin to one on one physical combat over Ukraine and my Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off. What I am sickened by is years of slaughter in a stalemate that Ukraine will… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 9, 2025 Musk fired back at Sikorski on X, telling him to “be quiet” and insisting that Poland pays only a fraction of Starlink’s overall cost. He then clarified that SpaceX would never disconnect Ukraine’s access or use the service as leverage. Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 9, 2025 Defense experts note that Europe may try to develop alternatives in light of Musk’s unpredictable statements. Still, no nation has banned Starlink outright. Analysts who follow the satellite industry see no slowdown for Starlink in the immediate future. Chris Quilty of Quilty Space says, “If a country banned access to Starlink, people would be at politicians with pitchforks.” Even in markets that have blocked government contracts or threatened to pull support, private citizens and businesses often find ways to use Starlink equipment bought elsewhere. Given the scarcity of reliable alternatives in rural or conflict-affected zones, local populations may pressure politicians to allow Starlink services, even if officials dislike Musk’s political connections.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has now raised $4.7m in presale, with a total of 6,500 holders delighted with its structured lending and aggressive growth strategy since presale launched. Available for $0.02 in phase three, more than 65% the token supply has already been taken up as investors await a 25% price increase to $0.025 in phase four. According to analysts, those tokens won’t cost anything as the mutm’s tokenomics back a 200% return for the exchange listing at $0.06, with an end of phase prediction of a post launch token price of $1.50, giving a total 7,400% increase to the raise. Momentum On Mutuum Finance presale Meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and DogeCoin (DOGE) have been hot in recent months, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers utility that has shown signs of trouncing all of the other meme coins. Instead of focusing on social media hype like SHIB and DOGE do, MUTM offers a decentralized lending platform that allows users to lend, borrow and earn interest on mtTokens, and converts deposits to an interest-bearing asset. Such real-world utility stands in stark contrast to the speculative nature of meme coins, drawing in investors looking for sustainable returns. Urgency has been created for the presale’s phased structure, which rises in price incrementally, with third phase now filling very quickly in advance of an upcoming price rise. Phase four will yield a 25% profit for early participants who purchase tokens at $0.02 — in addition to the 200% baseline return at launch. Prospects for ROI and the Tokenomics Strategy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides One of the Most Calculable ROIs in the Crypto Market Tokens purchased during the current $0.02 presale will effectively be worth 200% more once they hit exchanges at $0.06. Analysts also predict the price could soar to $1.50 in the months after listing, boosted by the platform’s buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of platform revenue goes toward repurchasing MUTM tokens to be distributed to stakers, creating a continuous buy pressure and reducing sell-offs. For perspective, Investing $1,000 at phase three prices would reap you $3,000 at launch and over $75,000 if the token touches $1.50 and retains it. Safety and Forward Progress Mutuum Finance is concluding a smart contract audit with industry leader CertiK, the biggest blockchain security company, to confirm protocol integrity. Final results will be announced through official channels once completed, providing further reassurance to the investor base. Alongside the $100,000 presale giveaway — a campaign in which the ten selected participants will receive $10,000 each — the project is establishing itself as a serious competitor in the often cut-throat world of DeFi. With the crypto market’s evolution, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is acting as a bridge between speculative trading and real financial utility. Its presale success combined with predictable yields and a deflationary token model contrasts sharply with the fluctuations affecting Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). There is limited time left to get tokens as phase three is nearly a wrap and closing time fast. Investors are flocking to MUTM’s structured, utility-first approach, looking to replicate past meme coin gains, but without the risk. Time To Act Before Phase Three Ends Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the rare case of accessibility and high-growth potential. Not only do early participants register immediate benefits as presale phases progress, but they also enable themselves for blockbuster returns following the launch of the tokens. With more demand than supply, especially as the project approaches listings. Which is why, if you want to get in on the next giant DeFi breakout, your best bet may be to lock phase three down now and not wait.

42346588,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=718129,1742950813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42346588.jpeg,"Ethereum Forms Complex iH&S Structure, Why $18,000 Is The Possible Target",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-complex-ihs-structure/,"Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of a bullish breakout, forming a complex Inverse Head and Shoulder (iH&S) pattern on the weekly timeframe. This key technical formation suggests that the Ethereum price is on track for a massive rally toward a bullish target of $18,000. Ethereum Forms Inverse Head & Shoulder Pattern The Ethereum price has been in a long consolidation period, experiencing a crash amid the ongoing market turmoil. Despite recording massive declines that have pushed its value significantly below all-time highs, crypto analyst Gert van Lagen on X (formerly Twitter) predicts that ETH could still reach a price target of $18,000. Related Reading: “Ethereum Is Not Dead”: Broadening Wedge Suggests Another Leg-Up Is Coming Notably, Ethereum recently bounced off the $1,800 – $2,000 support range, which previously served as resistance during the ‘Head’ phase of the iH&S pattern. With this crucial retest confirmed, ETH may be entering the final stage of its reversal, set up to new all-time highs. Lagen’s $18,000 bullish target is more than 8X Ethereum’s current price, underscoring the sheer magnitude of this projection. Lagen has identified the formation of the iH&S structure on the Ethereum chart, supporting his ambitious prediction with this renowned bullish chart pattern. The Inverse Head and Shoulder is a classic bullish reversal structure, often signaling the end of a downtrend and the beginning of a strong and new uptrend. Considering the Ethereum’s price has been in a downturn, the formation of the iH&S chart pattern suggests that this prolonged decline may be finally coming to an end. In the analyst’s chart, this left shoulder of the iH&S structure began forming from 2021 to 2022, experiencing a price peak before a pullback. From 2022 to 2023, a deeper decline occurred, marking the cycle low and the formation of the ‘Head.’ Finally, the right shoulder of the technical pattern was formed between 2024 to 2024, recording a higher low that aligned with the left shoulder. Lagen’s price chart highlights that the most critical level to watch is the neckline of the iH&S structure, which is approximately $3,978 and acts as the primary resistance area. How An $18,000 ETH Target Is Possible Still looking at Lagen’s Ethereum price chart, the analyst suggests that if ETH can surpass the $3,978 resistance level with strong volume, it could validate the Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern and open the door for a rally toward $18,000. Conversely, if Ethereum fails to break above this resistance level, a prolonged consolidation or significant pullback may occur before its next breakout attempt. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Extremely Strong Support And Monthly 55 EMA Says ETH Is Headed For $4,867 Lagen predicts that a rejection at the resistance area could see the Ethereum price drop to $1,888 — an important support level which could prevent further declines. A drop to this support would represent a potential 52% dip from the main resistance level and an 8.52% decline from ETH’s current market value of $2,055.

Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just announced its support for Celo’s groundbreaking move to an Ethereum layer-2 network. This significant blockchain upgrade marks a new chapter for Celo, the carbon-negative platform focused on mobile accessibility. If you’re a Celo (CGLD) holder or a Coinbase user, this news is particularly relevant for you. Let’s dive into what this Celo Layer-2 Migration means, how it impacts you, and why it’s a crucial step forward for the Celo ecosystem. What is this Coinbase Celo Support all about? Coinbase’s announcement, delivered via X (formerly Twitter), confirms their commitment to supporting the Celo Layer-2 Migration . Essentially, Celo is evolving from being a standalone layer-1 blockchain to operating as a layer-2 solution built on top of Ethereum. This is a strategic move aimed at enhancing scalability, efficiency, and interoperability for the Celo network. To facilitate this transition smoothly, Coinbase will be performing a system upgrade. Here are the key details: Upgrade Timing: Scheduled for later today, starting at 8 p.m. Pacific Time (PT). Service Impact: Temporary suspension of CGLD token deposits and withdrawals during the upgrade period. Token Impact: Focus is on CGLD token as it is the native token of the Celo network. User Action: If you are a Coinbase user holding CGLD, be aware of this temporary suspension. No immediate action is required, but avoid initiating CGLD deposits or withdrawals during the specified time. Why is Celo Migrating to an Ethereum Layer-2? The move to an Ethereum Layer-2 network is a strategic decision by Celo, driven by several compelling benefits. Let’s explore the key reasons behind this blockchain upgrade : Enhanced Scalability: Layer-2 solutions are designed to offload transaction processing from the main Ethereum chain, thereby significantly increasing transaction throughput and reducing congestion. This means faster transactions and lower fees for Celo users in the long run. Leveraging Ethereum’s Security: By building on Ethereum, Celo benefits from the robust security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. Ethereum is the most established smart contract platform, and inheriting its security is a major advantage. Improved Interoperability: Being on Ethereum layer-2 enhances Celo’s interoperability within the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

Developer Ecosystem Growth: The Ethereum ecosystem boasts a massive and vibrant community of developers and tools. Migrating to layer-2 can attract more developers to build on Celo, further enriching its ecosystem and driving innovation. Future-Proofing Celo: Layer-2 solutions are seen as a crucial part of Ethereum’s scaling roadmap. By embracing this technology, Celo is positioning itself for long-term growth and relevance in the evolving crypto landscape. Think of it like this: Ethereum is the major highway, and Celo is moving from a smaller, parallel road to a faster lane on this highway. This allows Celo to handle more traffic (transactions) efficiently and connect more easily with other vehicles (dApps) on the same highway. What are the Benefits of Celo Layer-2 Migration? This Celo Layer-2 Migration brings a plethora of advantages to the Celo ecosystem and its users. Let’s break down the key benefits: Benefit Description Lower Transaction Fees Layer-2 solutions are renowned for significantly reducing transaction costs compared to layer-1. Users can expect cheaper transactions on the Celo network after the migration. Faster Transaction Speeds Increased transaction throughput on layer-2 translates to quicker transaction confirmations. This improves the user experience, especially for applications requiring fast and frequent transactions. Enhanced User Experience Faster and cheaper transactions contribute to a smoother and more user-friendly experience for interacting with Celo-based applications and services. Stronger Security Inheriting Ethereum’s security provides a more robust and reliable foundation for the Celo network, enhancing user confidence and trust. Greater Interoperability Seamless integration with the vast Ethereum ecosystem opens doors for new partnerships, collaborations, and opportunities for Celo within the broader crypto space. Environmental Sustainability (Continued) Celo’s commitment to being carbon-negative remains intact with the layer-2 migration. Ethereum’s ongoing transition to Proof-of-Stake further contributes to the overall sustainability of the ecosystem. Impact on CGLD Token and Coinbase Users For holders of CGLD Token and Coinbase users, the immediate impact is the temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals. This is a standard procedure during such upgrades to ensure the integrity of the process. Here’s what you need to know: Temporary Suspension: As mentioned, CGLD deposits and withdrawals will be paused on Coinbase starting at 8 p.m. PT today. No Action Required (Usually): Unless specifically instructed by Coinbase, users typically don’t need to take any action. Your CGLD holdings on Coinbase should be safe during the upgrade. Post-Upgrade Benefits: In the long run, the Ethereum Layer-2 migration is expected to benefit CGLD holders through a more robust, scalable, and efficient Celo network. This can potentially lead to increased adoption and value for the CGLD token. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Coinbase and Celo for any updates or specific instructions related to the upgrade. Looking Ahead: The Future of Celo and Layer-2 Solutions Celo’s decision to embrace Ethereum Layer-2 technology is a significant indicator of the evolving landscape of blockchain scalability. Layer-2 solutions are increasingly becoming vital for the growth and mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. By making this move, Celo is positioning itself at the forefront of this trend. This blockchain upgrade not only benefits Celo and its users but also contributes to the overall maturation of the crypto ecosystem. It demonstrates a commitment to innovation, scalability, and interoperability – key ingredients for the future of decentralized technologies. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Step for Celo Coinbase’s support for the Celo Layer-2 Migration is more than just a routine upgrade; it’s a revolutionary step that underscores Celo’s commitment to growth, scalability, and user experience. By joining the Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem, Celo is set to unlock new levels of performance, efficiency, and interoperability. For CGLD Token holders and the wider crypto community, this upgrade signals a positive trajectory for Celo and the continued evolution of blockchain technology towards a more scalable and accessible future.

According to multiple analysts, DOGE price is displaying a combination of technical indicators and structures that suggest the potential for a 10X rally. These include a breakout from a triangle pattern, a developing “cup and handle” formation, and historical pattern similarities to the 2017 bull market. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Chart Patterns Point to 10X Meme Coin Rally In a recent post on X, analyst Trader Tardigrade shared a chart showing the MACD indicator breaking out from a triangle formation. This setup has historically been linked with strong upward momentum in Dogecoin price. The MACD breakout is accompanied by a rounded bottom pattern, often seen as a preparatory phase before bullish moves. Notably, during previous instances in September and March, similar MACD triangle breakouts occurred. In both cases, the breakout led to a rapid acceleration in Dogecoin price. These historical movements suggest that the current meme coin rally may lead to a new all-time high. Source: X The MACD lines have crossed again in recent sessions, with the indicator moving above the triangle’s downtrend line. Analysts are observing similar conditions that were present during previous rallies. The upward curl in the price structure reinforces the breakout narrative. Meanwhile, following the recent move by House of Doge , market analysts are forecasting a 16% rise in Dogecoin price as bullish momentum builds. Cup and Handle Pattern Suggests Upside Toward $2.00 Additionally, according to Crypto Elites , DOGE price is forming a cup and handle pattern, a technical formation often associated with bullish continuation. The rounded bottom of the cup has already developed, and the handle phase is underway. This formation typically leads to a breakout once the price surpasses the neckline resistance. The key resistance level is positioned near $0.185. A confirmed break above this threshold could open the door to a sharp upward movement. Based on this chart pattern, the projected target is in the $1.85 to $2.00 range. The projection is calculated using the depth of the cup formation. Source: X However, the analyst noted that the current retracement to the handle’s lower range may act as a support zone. This area has historically been where momentum builds ahead of breakouts. Historical Behavior Resembling 2017 Cycle Concurrently, analyst KrissPax has identified similarities between the current Dogecoin price movement and the 2017 bull run. KrissPax posted a chart on X that compares both periods, showing the current phase aligning closely with the structure before DOGE price previous surge. According to the chart, the current meme coin cycle could extend beyond the previous all-time high. KrissPax projected that the top meme coin could rise to $4 if the second major breakout occurs, similar to the 2017 pattern. While this is a longer-term scenario, it is based on recurring patterns observed in past market cycles. A recent CoinGape report supports the bullish outlook on DOGE price, noting that a breakout above the $0.18 resistance could ignite a meme coin rally toward the $20 mark.

Meet Gemini 2.5 Pro, the latest family of AI reasoning models designed to think before it speaks (or codes!). This isn’t just another AI; Google claims it’s their most intelligent creation yet, poised to redefine benchmarks and set new standards in the industry. For crypto enthusiasts and tech innovators alike, understanding the advancements in AI, especially reasoning models, is crucial as it underpins many emerging technologies within the blockchain and decentralized spaces. Let’s dive deep into what makes Gemini 2.5 Pro a game-changer. What Makes Gemini 2.5 Pro the Next-Gen AI Reasoning Model? Imagine an AI that doesn’t just react but reasons. That’s the promise of AI reasoning models , and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking center stage. Unlike previous models, Gemini 2.5 Pro pauses to ‘think’ before generating a response. This crucial step involves: Fact-checking: Ensuring the information provided is accurate and reliable. Problem-solving: Analyzing complex queries to deliver well-reasoned answers. Contextual Understanding: Grasping the nuances of language and intent for more relevant outputs. This enhanced reasoning capability is not just a minor upgrade; it’s a fundamental shift that elevates AI performance to new heights. Google is making Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental available on its Google AI Studio developer platform and through the Gemini Advanced plan. This means developers and early adopters can immediately start experimenting with this cutting-edge technology. The Race for AI Reasoning Supremacy: Google vs. the Competition Since OpenAI launched its first AI reasoning model , o1, in September 2024, the tech world has been in a frenzy to catch up and surpass its capabilities. Now, key players like Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI are all in the ring, each with their own versions of reasoning AI. Why is this race so important? Improved Accuracy: Reasoning enhances the reliability of AI outputs, crucial for applications in finance, healthcare, and beyond. Complex Task Handling: Reasoning models excel in math, coding, and strategic problem-solving – tasks previously challenging for AI. Foundation for AI Agents: Many believe reasoning is the bedrock for creating autonomous AI agents capable of performing tasks with minimal human oversight. However, this leap in intelligence comes at a cost. AI reasoning models are computationally intensive and more expensive to run. Google’s Gemini 2.5 is their most ambitious attempt to outshine OpenAI’s o series, showcasing the fierce competition driving AI innovation. Gemini 2.5 Pro: Benchmarking AI Performance Google is making bold claims about Gemini 2.5 Pro’s AI performance , stating it outperforms both its previous models and leading competitors in several key benchmarks. Let’s break down some of these claims: Benchmark Gemini 2.5 Pro Score Comparison Significance Aider Polyglot (Code Editing) 68.6% Outperforms top models from OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek Highlights superior code editing capabilities, crucial for software development. SWE-bench Verified (Software Dev) 63.8% Outperforms OpenAI’s o3-mini & DeepSeek’s R1, underperforms Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet (70.3%) Shows strong software development abilities, competitive but not leading in all aspects. Humanity’s Last Exam (Multimodal) 18.8% Better than most rival flagship models Demonstrates strong performance in a broad range of knowledge domains (math, humanities, sciences). These benchmarks suggest that Gemini 2.5 Pro is a formidable contender, especially in code-related tasks and broad knowledge understanding. However, the competitive landscape remains dynamic, with different models excelling in different areas. Unleashing the Power of Context: The 1 Million Token Context Window One of the most impressive features of Gemini 2.5 Pro is its massive context window . At launch, it boasts a 1 million token context window, capable of processing approximately 750,000 words in a single input. To put this into perspective, that’s longer than the entire ‘Lord of The Rings’ series! And Google isn’t stopping there; they plan to double this to 2 million tokens soon. What does this mean for users? Enhanced Understanding: The model can retain and process vast amounts of information, leading to more coherent and contextually relevant responses. Complex Document Analysis: Imagine summarizing lengthy research papers, analyzing extensive codebases, or even drafting entire books. Gemini 2.5 Pro’s context window makes this feasible. Improved AI Agents: For AI agents, a large context window means better memory and the ability to handle long, complex tasks more effectively. This expanded context window is a significant leap forward, potentially unlocking new applications and capabilities for AI models. Pricing and Availability: What to Expect Currently, Google has not released specific API pricing details for Gemini 2.5 Pro. They have indicated that more information will be shared in the coming weeks. For now, access is available through Google AI Studio and the Gemini Advanced subscription. Keep an eye out for updates as pricing details will be crucial for developers and businesses looking to integrate this powerful AI reasoning model into their projects. Conclusion: A Giant Leap for AI… and Beyond? Google’s unveiling of Gemini 2.5 Pro marks a significant milestone in the evolution of AI. With its enhanced reasoning capabilities, impressive performance benchmarks, and massive context window, it’s clear that Google is serious about leading the charge in AI innovation. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, advancements like these in AI reasoning models are incredibly relevant. AI is increasingly being used for smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi) risk assessment, and even predicting market trends. As AI becomes more intelligent and context-aware, its integration into blockchain technologies promises to unlock even more sophisticated and efficient solutions.

If you’re one of the thousands who watched Pudgy Penguins soar and thought, “I should’ve bought in early,” you’re definitely not alone. From meme NFTs to a booming brand with toys in stores and a token that’s making waves, Pudgy Penguins built one of the most surprising success stories of the meme coin world. And for those who caught that launch? They’re now sitting pretty. But if you didn’t ape in when $PENGU was just getting started, don’t stress—it’s not game over. In fact, a new door just swung wide open. BTFD Coin, one of the best new meme coins to join this week , is making noise with a real Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a staking program with jaw-dropping 90% APY, and an active referral system pulling in Bulls by the thousands. And the best part? It’s still in presale at just $0.0002 per coin, with the LAUNCH100 bonus code giving buyers a full 2x token reward until March 30, 2025. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a full-on ecosystem with actual utility and a real shot at delivering massive gains. And if you’re into second chances, this is the one you’ve been waiting for. BTFD Coin’s Live P2E Game Puts It Among the Best New Meme Coins to Join This Week Let’s cut to the chase—what really sets BTFD Coin apart is the game. Not a “coming soon” promise. Not a vague roadmap. But a fully live Play-to-Earn game that launched on January 1st, 2025, and is already rewarding players who suit up and charge into the Bull Run arena. This isn’t passive holding. This is earn-as-you-play, and it’s addictively fun. Early users are already seeing returns. One gamer turned their first week into thousands of tokens, then staked them for compounding growth. With the staking program offering 90% APY, it’s one of the best new meme coins to join this week for anyone looking to build both short-term gains and long-term momentum. You’re not just buying a token—you’re stepping into a full-blown meme coin presale ecosystem where your investment works while you play. Then there’s the Bulls Squad, a community of over 11,500 holders who aren’t just bullish—they’re building. The referral program lets users invite friends and earn extra tokens, turning every tweet or text into a potential payday. With over 71 billion tokens sold and $6.41 million raised, this isn’t your average meme coin presale. This project isn’t whispering—it’s roaring, and the community’s energy is off the charts. And here’s where things get juicy. If you put in $5,000 at today’s meme coin presale price of $0.0002, you’re scoring 25 million $BTFD tokens. That’s not just a nice number—if the coin hits its projected listing price of $0.0006, you’re sitting on $15,000. And if the buzz around its $0.006 moon price proves true? That flips to $150,000. That’s the kind of math that made Pudgy Penguin holders rich—and this time, you could be ahead of the curve. What seals the deal? The LAUNCH100 bonus code, which literally doubles your tokens during Stage 15. Buy 1 million tokens? You get 2 million. But only if you act fast—March 30th is the cutoff. Miss this meme coin presale opportunity, and the bonus disappears for good. So how do you get started? Just go to the BTFD Coin presale site and connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet both work). Fund it with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Enter LAUNCH100 in the promo box in all caps, choose your amount, and confirm the transaction. You’ll get your tokens at the end of the presale—and your crypto game will never be the same. This is why BTFD Coin is topping every list of the best new meme coins to join this week—because it delivers utility, rewards, community, and upside all in one. Pudgy Penguins: A Missed Launch That Created Massive Gains Pudgy Penguins began as a wholesome NFT project built around adorable, ice-loving cartoon birds. But what started as an art project quickly turned into a movement. Community members built memes, merch, even brand partnerships. And once the $PENGU token dropped, it didn’t take long for it to soar. The Penguins became more than just collectibles—they became a cultural icon. They made headlines in both crypto and mainstream circles. $PENGU got traction, exchanges picked it up, and early backers cashed in. That rise made Pudgy Penguins one of the biggest “why didn’t I buy it early?” stories of the year. But let’s be honest—most people didn’t buy early. They watched the buzz, hesitated, and then watched the price take off. And now? They’re on the hunt for the best new meme coins to join this week—something with real upside and a better entry point. Enter BTFD Coin. Conclusion: This Time, Be the One Who Bought Early Let’s not sugarcoat it—you probably missed the early boat on Pudgy Penguins. That train left the station, and it took a lot of big wins with it. But the beauty of the crypto world? There’s always another launch, another shot, another chance to get in before the masses. BTFD Coin is that chance. It’s got the community, the staking, the bonus, and best of all—a fully functional game already live and paying out. With a presale price of just $0.0002, a potential moon price of $0.006, and the LAUNCH100 code giving you double tokens until March 30th, this is hands-down one of the best new meme coins to join this week. No more second-guessing. No more could-have-beens. This is the one. Make the move and join BTFD Coin’s presale before this chance becomes another “I should’ve.” FAQs Why is BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join this week? Because it offers more than hype—BTFD Coin has a live Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY staking, and a referral program, all while being in presale at $0.0002 with a moon target of $0.006. How do I claim the LAUNCH100 bonus code with BTFD Coin? Go to the presale site, connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in all caps in the promo field, then confirm your purchase. The bonus doubles your token amount instantly. Is BTFD Coin still available for presale? Yes! It’s currently in Stage 15, priced at $0.0002, with over $6.41 million raised, 71 billion tokens sold, and 11,500 holders joining what’s easily one of the best new meme coins to join this week.

This settlement marks a likely end to the long legal battle that has been ongoing since the SEC sued Ripple in 2020 over the sale of XRP tokens, which it claimed were unregistered securities. As part of the deal, the SEC has also requested that Judge Analisa Torres lift the “obey the law” injunction that had been placed on Ripple, which was part of the earlier ruling. With this agreement, Ripple will recover $75 million from escrow, while the SEC will retain $50 million. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, referred to this as “the final crossing of t’s and dotting of i’s,” signaling that this is likely the last update on the case.

The long-standing case has been a major point of contention in the cryptocurrency world, with Ripple consistently arguing that the SEC’s actions were more about intimidation than protecting investors. Garlinghouse opened up about the financial harm caused by the lawsuit, saying that the legal proceedings had potentially wiped out up to $15 billion in value for XRP holders.

Trading at $8.04 at press time, BeraChain crypto has witnessed an impressive 38.2% surge over the past week, catapulting it into the top 100 by market cap, with a valuation of $864 million. The Berachain Network PoL system The BeraChain mainnet first roared to life in February with a $1.17 billion BeraChain airdrop, rewarding early participants who engaged in pre-launch activities. That initial phase, however, was constrained to BEX, the native decentralized exchange, leaving room for broader growth. Now, with the PoL system live, the Berachain Network is opening new doors that enhance the BeraChain TVL and incentivize participation. Unlike traditional PoS, where users stake directly with validators, PoL encourages staking in DeFi liquidity pools to earn BGT, the governance token of the BeraChain ecosystem. Validators stake BERA, the utility token of BeraChain, to secure the network and propose blocks, earning BGT that flows into reward vaults, which can be swapped for BERA at a 1:1 ratio, though irreversibly. The BeraChain launch of PoL has unleashed 37 whitelisted reward vaults, initially focused on DEX liquidity pools like those on BEX, Kodiak, and Beradrome. Berachain Foundation 🐻⛓ @berachain · Follow Replying to @berachain 37 new reward vaults are now live, distributing BGT emissions across the ecosystem.See the full list here: blog.berachain.com/blog/berachain… 9:09 pm · 24 Mar 2025 99 Reply Copy link Read 2 replies These vaults, vetted for economic value, security, and synergy with the BeraChain ecosystem, pair major tokens such as BERA, HONEY, USDC, and wETH to maximize liquidity depth. The Berachain token’s role in these pools has fueled trading activity, with a 24-hour volume of $165.9 million. Beyond DEXes, the network plans to expand into real-world assets, gaming, and more, with a second batch of vaults up for review by March 27th. This scalability positions the BeraChain mainnet as a hub for diverse dApps, from BeraChain swaps to potential BeraChain NFTs. Notably, governance is a cornerstone of the PoL system, with BGT holders now wielding influence over the Berachain Network’s direction. The BeraChain airdrop laid the foundation, but PoL decentralizes control, letting the community dictate incentive flows. Validators supply liquidity to vaults, receiving receipt tokens that can also be staked, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. This innovative approach has elevated the BeraChain crypto’s appeal, drawing builders and users eager to tap into a permissionless ecosystem. As pseudonymous founder Homme Bera noted, this is a major step in the network’s evolution, promising sustainable growth. Looking forward, the Berachain Network’s roadmap inspires confidence. The upcoming review of additional vaults next week could broaden its scope, potentially boosting the BeraChain price further. With the PoL launch having already pushed BeraChain crypto into the top 100, it has ignited speculation about the effects of the next milestones.

This move aligns the company with a growing number of publicly traded firms choosing to hold bitcoin as part of their financial strategy. Along with its fourth-quarter earnings report, GameStop revealed that its board has unanimously decided to add bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. This allows the company to hold digital assets on its balance sheet, signaling a shift in its treasury management and aligning with its evolving financial strategy. GME Surges Over 5% This announcement gained attention earlier in February when CEO Ryan Cohen posted a photo of himself with Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy (MSTR), at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, sparking curiosity about the company’s future plans in the crypto space. By the end of 2024, GameStop reported $5.355 billion in current assets but didn’t specify how much of this would be used for Bitcoin purchases. The news led to a 5.9% increase in GME shares during after-hours trading. Matt Cole Urges Gamestop To Adopt BTC Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Asset Management, an investment firm co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy previously called on GameStop to adopt bitcoin as a reserve asset. In a letter to Ryan Cohen, GameStop’s Chairman and CEO, on February 24, Cole argued that with nearly $5 billion in cash reserves, GameStop has a unique chance to transform itself into a market leader. Strive Asset Management’s clients own GameStop shares through the firm’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Cole also mentioned that Strive holds GameStop stock across three different ETFs but did not share how much stock the firm owns. “We believe GameStop has an incredible opportunity to transform its financial future by becoming the premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector,” Cole wrote. Cohen further fueled the speculation when he tweeted , “Letter received,” in response to Cole’s suggestion. Growing Trend Of Companies Pursuing BTC Strategy The letter follows previous reports from that GameStop is considering investing in alternative assets, including bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The suggestion in the letter aligns with moves already made by companies like MicroStrategy, Semler Scientific, and MARA Holdings. Cole praised GameStop for closing unprofitable stores and publicly rejecting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.

Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, cautioned members of Parliament that millions of under-35s are choosing assets like Bitcoin instead of more traditional options such as equities or bonds. He said that investing in digital coins involves “a very high risk that you could lose all your money.” In explaining why this matters, Rathi shared that the number of Britons owning shares directly is much lower than in places like the United States or Sweden. He told MPs on Tuesday that 38 percent of US citizens hold equities, while in Sweden, the figure is more than 20 percent. By contrast, far fewer people in the UK own shares, especially younger citizens, who seem drawn to alternative assets like bitcoin. Rathi added, “We have also evolved a particular approach to risk and compensation in the UK, which perhaps isn’t matched in other parts of the world.” UK’s FCA wants young Britains to consider ‘mainstream investments’ The FCA’s new five-year plan, presented on Tuesday, focuses on four key objectives, one of which is helping consumers make better financial decisions. The authority will track how many people with more than £10,000 of investible assets choose to place their money in what it calls “mainstream investments” by 2030. Rathi told the committee that one of his concerns is “the sheer number of under 35-year-olds for whom the financial product that they invest in first is crypto — several million in the UK.” Currently, the UK’s crypto market is largely unregulated. Companies handling crypto transactions only need to register with the FCA to show they follow anti-money laundering rules. The government, however, intends to introduce legislation that would create a specific regulatory framework for crypto businesses. Last year, the FCA estimated that about 12 percent of UK adults owned crypto assets. That equates to roughly 7 million people, with men under 35 most likely to borrow money to fund their coin purchases, according to a YouGov survey of nearly 2,200 adults. Rathi linked the country’s low level of share ownership to “a mix of tax, education, regulation and broader culture in our country.” He emphasized that the question of risk and compensation is not the FCA’s responsibility alone. “We have also evolved a particular approach to risk and compensation in the UK, which perhaps isn’t matched in other parts of the world,” he said. Under the new plan, the FCA pledges to “deepen trust, rebalance risk, support growth and improve lives.” While the regulator has been criticized in the past for holding back innovation and investment, several industry figures gave the new strategy a careful endorsement. The authority will use AI to act ‘more efficiently and effectively’ A central part of the new approach is making more use of technology, including artificial intelligence, to help the FCA act “more efficiently and effectively.” The agency also aims to crack down further on financial crime, stressing that it will focus “on those who seek to use the fact they are regulated to do harm.” Also on Tuesday, the authority announced plans to simplify its extensive set of regulations by removing over 100 pages devoted to consumer finance, investments, and mortgage lending. This change was set in motion after Chancellor Rachel Reeves revealed a “radical action plan to cut red tape,” intending to reduce regulatory costs for businesses by 25 percent. The FCA’s rule book is currently longer than 10,000 pages, and the goal is to make it less burdensome for legitimate operators while keeping protections in place for the public. James Daley, who heads the research group Fairer Finance, expressed worry about the direction of these proposals. “The general direction of travel is worrying,” he said. He believes the regulator is under political pressure to reduce the regulation burden but argues that some of these changes “would be a step backwards.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

But the tides are shifting. While these tokens have built strong communities, their price action has been frustrating, with long periods of stagnation. Now, a growing number of Shiba Inu and DOGE holders are making a calculated move into an AI-driven altcoin; RCO Finance . Let’s dive into why investors are making the switch. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Holders Are Looking for the Next Big Opportunity Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have given their holders some wild rides over the years, but the market has not been kind to meme coin investors lately. Shiba Inu , which once seemed unstoppable, has been stuck in a macro downtrend since its peak. While recent movements suggest a potential breakout, the token still faces a critical resistance range between $0.00001450 and $0.00001550. A breakthrough could send it climbing, but another rejection could push it back toward support at $0.00001269. Dogecoin isn’t faring much better. The token is trying to push past $0.19, but the selling pressure is heavy. If it fails to clear this level, there’s a strong chance of another drop, possibly as low as $0.10. On the flip side, breaking past $0.29 could restore confidence, but given the current trend, that seems like an uphill battle. For Shiba Inu and Dogecoin holders, this kind of uncertainty is frustrating. That’s why they are making a strategic move into RCO Finance because it’s still in its early stages, has practical applications, and could be on the verge of an explosive run. This AI-Driven Altcoin Is Outshining Meme Coins RCO Finance is designed to help investors make smarter moves with its AI-powered Robo Advisor. This is an advanced, real-time AI system that processes data from leading financial sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, spotting market trends before they go mainstream. For instance, a new altcoin is quietly gaining traction, similar to how Shiba Inu exploded in its early days. Most traders don’t notice it yet, but RCOF’s AI does. It recognizes unusual trading patterns, increasing volume, and early whale accumulation. With a single alert, you’re in early, buying before the masses. A month later, that same token has surged 100x, and your $500 investment is now worth $50,000; all because you had the right data at the right time. The AI also protects your investments. Let’s say a market downturn is looming. It triggers an automated sell-off, securing your profits before the crash. Beyond trading, RCO Finance allows users to diversify into 120,000+ assets, including stocks, ETFs, bonds, and tokenized real estate, all on the same platform. It’s also entirely KYC-free, meaning no invasive verification processes. And the RCOF debit cards let you use your holdings in real life without the hassle of converting them to fiat first. RCOF Presale Is Gaining Traction with Early Buyers RCOF has already proven itself. Unlike most presale projects, it has a fully operational Beta Platform with over 10,000 active users testing its core features. And this is just the beginning; while the beta is live, the upcoming Alpha phase promises even more powerful upgrades, currently in internal testing. The presale is already in its 5th stage, with the token selling at $0.10. Once it moves to the next stage, the price will rise to $0.13; a guaranteed 30% gain in just a few weeks. With over $14 million raised so far, the momentum is undeniable, and the price will only go up from here. A $1,000 investment at the current stage would turn into $1,300 when the next stage kicks in. If it follows the same trajectory as other successful AI-driven projects, early buyers could see their holdings multiply 50x or even 100x. That same $1,000 could easily become $100,000. Security is also a top priority. RCOF has undergone a full audit by SolidProof , one of the most reputable blockchain security firms. The audit confirmed no vulnerabilities, meaning investors can participate with confidence. Meme Coins Had Their Moment but the Future Belongs to AI Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have cemented their place in crypto history, but their best days might be behind them. At their peak, they delivered jaw-dropping returns, but today, their growth is nowhere near what it once was because they’re established. And without continuous waves of hype, their momentum is fading. RCOF , on the other hand, is just getting started. It’s new, meaning early adoption is happening fast, and as more investors discover its AI-driven advantages, its growth will accelerate even further. Investors who got in during the earlier presale stages have already seen their holdings grow, and those who wait too long will find themselves paying significantly higher prices. Joining in the next stage alone means missing out on an easy 30% gain, and waiting until it hits exchanges could mean missing out on 100x potential.

Among the players making waves this year are Qubetics , Tezos, and VeChain, three blockchain projects that have distinct features setting them apart from the rest. If you’ve been following the crypto space closely, you’ll know how fast things change, but these three coins seem to be going the distance in different ways. Whether it’s groundbreaking real-world applications, cutting-edge tokenomics, or smart contract capabilities, they all have unique offerings that demand attention. Tezos has long been a fan favorite for its innovative proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while VeChain continues to make strides in supply chain solutions. And then, there’s Qubetics—a rising star with a fresh approach to the tokenization of real-world assets, making it easy for businesses, professionals, and individuals to embrace the future of finance. While each of these cryptos brings something different to the table, one thing is certain: they are all poised to make a big impact on the digital finance landscape. Let’s break down the key features of each of these top 3 cryptos—Qubetics, Tezos, and VeChain—and explore what makes them tick in 2025. From Qubetics’ Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace to VeChain’s efforts to streamline supply chains, each has a critical role to play in the future of blockchain. Qubetics ($TICS) – Revolutionizing Real World Asset Tokenization Qubetics has been turning heads with its innovative approach to blockchain technology, particularly through its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. Unlike other platforms, Qubetics is designed to simplify the process for businesses, professionals, and individuals looking to tokenize real-world assets. Think of it as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, offering a smooth and secure way to digitize physical assets for trade or investment purposes. At the heart of Qubetics lies its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, which aims to break down the barriers that have traditionally kept smaller businesses and individuals out of the crypto space. By making it easier to tokenize assets such as real estate, commodities, or even intellectual property, Qubetics is providing a user-friendly interface that opens up new avenues for decentralized finance (DeFi). The ease of access, transparency, and security are what set Qubetics apart from other blockchain projects in the space. Qubetics Presale Surpasses Milestones – A Look at the Exciting 2025 Opportunity Over 503 million $TICS tokens sold across 23,700+ holders Raised more than $15.4 million in presale funds Currently in its 27th stage, with tokens priced at $0.1300 Analysts predict up to 11,436% ROI once the mainnet launches Qubetics emerges as one of the most exciting crypto projects of 2025 Latest News: $TICS token gaining momentum as it enters final presale stages Aggressive roadmap leading up to the mainnet launch Qubetics is building lasting value, not just riding hype Crypto Presale success reflects strong trust in the platform Growing demand for real-world asset tokenization is evident Tezos Launches Etherlink and Announces Major Upgrades Tezos continues to solidify its position as a leading self-upgradable and energy-efficient Proof of Stake blockchain. Recent developments include the launch of Etherlink, a Layer-2 solution built on Tezos technology, which successfully completed its public beta and is now officially production-ready. During ETHDenver 2025, Etherlink’s team announced a substantial incentive program, allocating $3 million in rewards to attract and retain users, further enhancing the Tezos ecosystem’s scalability and efficiency. ​ In addition to technological advancements, Tezos has seen significant community engagement, with the Tezos Commons providing monthly overviews of ecosystem milestones. The February 2025 report highlighted key achievements, including important protocol upgrades like Oxford and Paris C, the announcement of Tezos X, and the launch of Etherlink. These developments underscore Tezos’s commitment to continuous improvement and innovation within the blockchain space. ​ VeChain Enhances Supply Chain Transparency ​VeChain (VET) continues to make strides in blockchain-based supply chain solutions. The platform’s ongoing developments and strategic initiatives have positioned it as a significant player in enhancing transparency and efficiency across various industries. Recent analyses suggest that VeChain’s market presence remains robust, with its token trading within a specific range, reflecting a period of consolidation. ​ Community engagement plays a pivotal role in VeChain’s evolution. The recent Galactica Vote, held from February 25 to March 4, 2025, was a critical event for VeChain and associated tokens. This vote aimed to set the stage for significant upgrades, encouraging community participation that could influence VeChain’s strategic direction and long-term success. Positive outcomes from such initiatives are expected to bolster participants confidence and potentially drive adoption. Understanding the Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace Tokenizing real-world assets opens up incredible opportunities for individuals, businesses, and professionals to interact with a variety of asset types in a decentralized way. It allows for fractional ownership, meaning that high-value assets such as real estate, art, or commodities can be broken down into smaller, more affordable tokens. This makes it easier for anyone to participate in asset markets that were once out of reach. For Qubetics, this focus on real-world asset tokenization is a game-changer. It provides a transparent, secure, and easy-to-use platform for asset tokenization. What sets Qubetics apart is the combination of its seamless marketplace with an emphasis on bringing liquidity to assets that traditionally have been illiquid. By digitizing assets and allowing them to be traded, Qubetics opens up a whole new world of opportunities for both seasoned professionals and newcomers alike. Whether it’s real estate, intellectual property, or even commodities, the potential of asset tokenization is just beginning to unfold. Conclusion: Top 3 Cryptos to Buy Now The Top 3 Cryptos —Qubetics, Tezos, and VeChain—are making big waves in the blockchain world this year. While each has its own distinct focus and strengths, all are contributing to the future of decentralized finance in meaningful ways.

The NCIA would have oversight over state funds and investment strategies, including the option to invest up to 5% of the funds under its control in digital assets. The 2025 State Investment Modernization Act was introduced into the House on March 24 and the Senate on March 25. The bills were introduced by Republican sponsors, making North Carolina the 19th state to have Bitcoin-related proposals in front of its legislature. The bills create a new investment agency Under the bills (H506 and S709), the NCIA would have oversight of funds including retirement systems, general funds, and special funds. It would be made up of a five-member board headed by the state treasurer, who will select the remaining members on the basis of their expertise. The NCIA board will choose a chief investment officer who will be responsible for day-to-day operations and staffing. The bills also provide greater flexibility for choosing assets, including digital assets with a 5% cap, and exempt the NCIA from some state regulations. At the same time, it introduces new governance requirements regarding transparency and the handling of illiquid investments. The NCIA would be formed by July 1 and begin full operation on Jan. 1, 2026. The bills are competing with other bills proposing 10% funds allocation Different bills on digital asset investment ( H92 and S327 ) were introduced into the chambers of the North Carolina legislature in February. Those bills would allow up to 10% of funds to be invested in digital assets. The Senate bill would create a Bitcoin Economic Advisory Board and require the approval of two-thirds of the General Assembly for the liquidation of Bitcoin holdings. The bills would also restrict investable digital assets to exchange-traded funds or assets with a market cap of over $750 billion. Only Bitcoin meets the market cap requirement. These bills were also introduced unilaterally by Republicans. House Speaker Destin Hall endorsed H92. “Today, I filed HB 92, The North Carolina Digital Assets Investments Act, to authorize the NC State Treasurer to invest in qualifying digital assets like #Bitcoin — aligning with President Trump’s vision for a national Bitcoin stockpile and ensuring North Carolina leads at the state level,” Hall wrote on X on Feb. 10. Trump issued an executive order creating a federal Bitcoin reserve on March 7. The bills faced some opposition, with the State Employees Association of North Carolina speaking out against it, for example. “Retirees do not like the conversation about investing in this highly volatile currency. Past, present, and future state employees are taxpayers, and their promised benefits should not be played with,” a spokesman for that organization said . Those bills are now in committee. North Carolina passed an anti-central bank digital currency (CBDC) law in September, overturning a veto by the then-governor to do so. The law prohibits the state from participating in the testing of a CBDC. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State in May. The Senate companion version in is the Banking Committee. Federal Reserve has repeatedly stated that it will not issue a CBDC without a Congressional mandate.

Infinite Reality said in a March 25 statement that Napster would offer “branded 3D virtual spaces” to allow virtual concerts and “social listening parties” along with the ability to offer virtual merchandise. “Imagine stepping into a virtual venue to watch an exclusive show with friends, chat with your favorite artist in their own virtual hangout as they drop their new single, and be able to directly buy their exclusive digital and physical merch,” said Napster CEO Jon Vlassopulos, who will continue in his role amid the acquisition. “The internet has evolved from desktop to mobile, from mobile to social, and now we are entering the immersive era,” he added.

Napster’s latest repurposing Napster was a pioneer in piracy, launching in 1999 as a peer-to-peer (P2P) filing-sharing service mostly for music. It shuttered in 2001, buried by a court order after a wave of copyright infringement lawsuits. The now-bankrupt company sold its brand, which was relaunched as a music-streaming service before bouncing between owners for the next 20 years. The blockchain firm Algorand and crypto investment firm Hivemind most recently bought it in 2022. Related: Here’s what musicians actually think of tokenizing content in Web3 Napster had made several moves in the Web3 space, announcing plans in June 2022 to launch its own Napster token on the Algorand blockchain that could be used to buy music subscriptions and other content.

Source: Napster John Acunto, co-founder and CEO of Infinite Reality, said the team hopes to lead an “internet industry shift from a flat 2D clickable web to a 3D conversational one.” Infinite Reality says the acquisition of Napster is slated to close in a few weeks. According to the firm, it hopes to evolve the Napster brand to become the leading immersive music platform for artists, fans and curators through audience monetization and engagement capabilities.

Timeline Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The legal fight between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is officially over. Last week, the SEC decided to drop its appeal, clearing the way for a final resolution that both sides have now agreed on. As part of the settlement, Ripple will pay a $50 million fine, which will be held in an interest-bearing account. Additionally, Ripple has agreed to drop its cross-appeal, meaning they won’t challenge the SEC’s earlier rulings anymore. A key part of the resolution is that the court will lift the injunction (a legal restriction) that had been placed on Ripple at the SEC’s request. This means Ripple can now operate freely without that limitation. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer confirmed the news and said: “The SEC dropped its appeal, and Ripple dropped its cross-appeal.” What Happens Next? While some paperwork and court steps still need to be finalized, legal experts expect the remaining process to go smoothly. Attorney Fred Rispoli provided a timeline for the final steps: “With the announcement by @s_alderoty, you better believe the paperwork has been drawn up already. Now we wait on a vote by SEC Commission.” Timeline: When Will It Be Done? Rispoli explained the timeline: The SEC Commission will vote in less than 30 days. The injunction filing will happen soon after and will be approved.
