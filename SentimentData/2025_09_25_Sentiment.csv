Total market capitalization now stands at $294 billion, The majority of these tokens continue to circulate on Ethereum, cementing its place as the backbone of the stablecoin ecosystem. But this growth isn’t just about the old giants like USDT and USDC. New entrants are making waves with innovative models and fresh incentives for users. Let’s take a closer look at the latest developments. Total Stablecoin Market Cap just hit a new ATH of $294 BILLION Guess where most of those stablecoins live? You guessed it: Ethereum pic.twitter.com/0QQBqS4Y26 — Crypto-Gucci.eth ᵍᵐ (@CryptoGucci) September 24, 2025 USDH Launches on Hyperliquid Native Markets has officially rolled out USDH, a fully backed stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. The token is now live on Hyperliquid with a USDH/USDC trading pair already seeing more than $2.2 million in early trading volume. The reserves behind USDH are managed through a hybrid structure. Backing comes from cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, while transparency is maintained through oracle feeds. An initial mix of off-chain and on-chain allocation ensures liquidity and stability. HYPERLIQUID RA MẮT STABLECOIN USDH USDH đã ghi nhận hơn 2 triệu USD khối lượng giao dịch ngay trong giai đoạn đầu Được bảo chứng bằng tiền mặt và trái phiếu kho bạc Mỹ ngắn hạn, USDH nhằm giảm sự phụ thuộc vào các stablecoin bên ngoài như USDC,… pic.twitter.com/4IRnySisKX — ThuanCapital (@ThuanCapital) September 24, 2025 The issuer has also mapped out a yield-sharing model: 50% of reserve yields will be used to buy back HYPE tokens. The remaining 50% will support Hyperliquid’s ecosystem growth. For Hyperliquid, this launch is a step toward reducing reliance on USDC, which still represents over 90% of total deposits. USDH could help diversify liquidity on the platform and create new demand for the HYPE token. Key stat: USDH has already generated over $2 million in trading activity since launch. 1/ USDF is @Aster_DEX 's native stablecoin. Holders earn airdrop points for holding the token. Lets dive into the metrics of this token. pic.twitter.com/TrxC3mfQg8 — Pine Analytics (@PineAnalytics) September 24, 2025 USDF Supply Explodes on Aster DEX Another stablecoin gaining attention is USDF, the native token of Aster DEX. Unlike USDH, USDF is directly tied to user incentives,holders earn airdrop points simply for holding the token. The supply growth has been nothing short of aggressive. Just nine days ago, total supply hovered around 34 million USDF. Today, it has surged to nearly 250 million, marking an increase of more than 220 million in under two weeks. But the distribution tells a different story. According to data: 83% of USDF remains in the project treasury. 8.7% is staked as auUSDF. 6.8% is held by other protocol addresses. Staking plays a key role in USDF’s tokenomics. Users can convert their USDF into auUSDF, which not only earns extra points but also provides yield. At present, auUSDF is trading at 1.042, translating to an implied 7.5% APY over the last five months. Most recent activity shows wallets buying USDF primarily to farm Aster DEX points, before depositing them directly on the platform. This mix of incentives has fueled rapid supply expansion while anchoring liquidity within the ecosystem. Key stat: USDF supply jumped 7x in just over a week, from 34M to 250M. Kazakhstan Enters the Stablecoin Race with KZTE It’s not just DeFi protocols experimenting with stablecoins. Nation-states are beginning to make their mark too. The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) has launched a pilot program for KZTE, a tenge-backed stablecoin. Developed inside NBK’s regulatory sandbox, KZTE is being issued on Solana by licensed exchange Intebix, with support from Mastercard and Eurasian Bank. This marks the first national tenge stablecoin to hit a blockchain. Kazakhstan launches Stablecoin $KZTE pegged to the Tenge! The National Bank of Kazakhstan @Nationalbank_KZ has kicked off a pilot program to issue the tenge-backed KZTE stablecoin on Solana, developed within its regulatory sandbox for digital assets. Issued by licensed… pic.twitter.com/1iHhTgC9BP — Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) September 24, 2025 The pilot introduces a few key benefits: Seamless fiat-to-crypto exchange with KZTE integration. Direct crypto card settlement via Mastercard rails. Expanded digital asset access for Kazakhstan’s retail and institutional market. A significant step toward NBK’s goal of modernizing payment infrastructure. By choosing Solana, the initiative gains access to high-speed, low-cost transactions, which makes sense for a retail-friendly stablecoin. With Mastercard in the mix, KZTE is positioned for real-world payments and cross-border settlement. This move also signals Kazakhstan’s intent to carve out a role in the global stablecoin race,not just as a miner-friendly hub, but now as a player in blockchain-based finance. Key stat: KZTE is the first stablecoin pegged to the Kazakh tenge issued under a national pilot program. Why These Launches Matter Stablecoins remain the backbone of crypto markets, accounting for nearly every on-chain dollar transaction, lending protocol, and DeFi yield farm. The rise to $294 billion market cap shows they are not slowing down. But the entry of new players like USDH, USDF, and KZTE highlights the evolution of this space: USDH is focused on decentralizing liquidity within trading venues while tying yields back to governance tokens like HYPE. USDF reflects how DeFi projects gamify liquidity through airdrops and staking incentives, driving rapid supply growth. KZTE represents a government’s attempt to merge fiat and crypto payments under a regulated framework. The mix of private issuers, DeFi-native tokens, and state-backed experiments suggests stablecoins are becoming more diverse in purpose and design. Ethereum still hosts the lion’s share of stablecoin activity, but ecosystems like Solana, Hyperliquid, and Aster DEX are carving out niches. Whether it’s new collateral models, reward mechanisms, or direct fiat integration, the stablecoin market is moving beyond its USDT/USDC duopoly. As the market cap pushes into new record territory, expect even more issuers,both private and state-linked,to step in. Each new launch tests how stablecoins can evolve from just a crypto dollar to something that underpins financial systems at scale. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The goal is to boost liquidity across both ecosystems by letting investors redeem their fund shares for RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin that already boasts a $700 million market cap . While redemptions will begin on Ethereum , Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that they’ll soon transition to the XRP Ledger , bringing even more real-world utility to the network. This unlocks a key catalyst for a bullish XRP price prediction , potentially accelerating transaction volumes and supporting the case for long-term targets as high as $1,000 . XRP Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch As Consolidation Continues XRP has been consolidating for a while after it hit its latest swing high at $3.65. The token is still on an uptrend and the key area of support to watch is the $2.60 level. Hence, while XRP may see short-term pullbacks in the coming days, its long-term trajectory remains bullish thanks to major project developments and improving market conditions. A strong rebound from the $2.60 level could set the stage for a breakout to a new all-time high, with $10 firmly in sight this cycle – representing a 230% upside. And while the $1,000 mark may sound ambitious, the rapid pace of institutional adoption and integration of Ripple’s technology points to a long-term trajectory where such a valuation becomes increasingly plausible over time. In the meantime, high-potential crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are attracting serious attention. With altseason heating up fast, this could be the best chance to get in before the next 10x explosion . Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Turns High-Leverage Trading Into a Meme-Powered Movement Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is more than just another Shiba in the meme pack; it’s a token wired on 1,000x leverage and built for retail traders who want to play the same game as whales. Backed by one of crypto’s most recognizable memes, $MAXI has already pulled in over $2.4 million just a few weeks after its presale kicked off. Through the MAXI Fund, the project will invest up to 25% of the presale proceeds in the most promising tokens of the cycle with 1000X leverage to amplify results. Add in gamified challenges like Max Gains and Max Ripped, and the token becomes a trading club for degens who thrive on risk. To buy $MAXI, visit the official Maxi Doge website and connect a compatible wallet (such as the Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card at checkout.

His call is bold: slash gas from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei, cutting average transaction costs nearly in half. That would make BNB one of the cheapest major blockchains in 2025,on par with Solana and Base,while maintaining performance for traders and builders. Gas fees matter.

For high-frequency traders and market makers, even small fee differences shape where liquidity flows. Lower fees also attract new apps and retail users who may otherwise avoid costly networks like Ethereum. BNB Chain validators are proposing to cut gas from 0.1 to 0.05 Gwei and shorten block intervals from 750ms to 450ms, dropping fees to about $0.005 per tx and keeping BSC competitive with Solana and Base. Past cuts from 3→1 Gwei and 1→0.1 Gwei lowered fees 75% and boosted daily… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 24, 2025 BNB Chain validators are now proposing two big changes: Cut minimum gas from 0.1 Gwei → 0.05 Gwei Shorten block intervals from 750ms → 450ms If approved, this would push median fees down to ~$0.005 per tx. That cements BSC’s role as a low-cost chain for trading, swaps, and onchain experimentation. A Track Record of Bold Cuts This isn’t new territory. BNB Chain has repeatedly slashed gas, and each time activity soared: April 2024: Gas fell 3 Gwei → 1 Gwei (–67%) May 2025: Gas fell 1 Gwei → 0.1 Gwei (–90%) The results: median fees dropped from $0.04 → $0.01 (–75%). Daily transactions jumped 140%, breaking 12M+ per day. October 2025 now brings the next chapter: 0.05 Gwei as the new floor. Trading Drives the Network The shift in activity is clear. At the start of 2025, swap-related activity made up just 20% of BSC transactions. By June, it surged to 67%, making trading the chain’s dominant use case. For these users, every fraction of a cent in fees matters. Low gas doesn’t just help,it decides where trades land. BNB’s staking yield remains above 0.5% APY, meaning validator rewards are stable. Network capacity also sits under 30% utilization, leaving plenty of headroom for volume growth. Risks and Safeguards Critics often point to three risks: failed transactions, validator incentives, and infrastructure strain. But the chain’s data suggests otherwise: Infrastructure has been tested to handle 3x today’s state load. Higher transaction counts offset lower per-tx fees, keeping validator APY healthy. Gas remains dynamic if congestion spikes. The system is designed to flex with demand while prioritizing accessibility. A New Principle for Growth The community is discussing a guiding principle for BNB Chain: “As long as staking APY stays above 0.5%, the network should aim for the lowest gas possible.” This ensures validators remain rewarded while users enjoy ultra-low costs. The long-term target is even more ambitious: ~$0.001 per tx, which would put BSC among the cheapest large chains globally. ATHs Back the Case Momentum is already on BNB Chain’s side. Last week, the chain hit fresh records: 17.4M active addresses $3.32B perpetuals volume 100M+ weekly transactions $1M+ daily fees Much of this surge is powered by @Aster_DEX, which has reignited the perpetuals trading narrative on BSC. These milestones strengthen the argument that lowering fees further won’t hurt sustainability,it may instead accelerate adoption. BNB Chain hits new weekly ATHs with 17.4M active addresses and $3.32B in perps volume. The growth is driven by @Aster_DEX , which attracted traders to @BNBCHAIN and reignited the perps narrative. Other metrics are climbing too: weekly trxns сrossed 100M, and daily fees hit $1M. pic.twitter.com/f7tFPcTNEK — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) September 24, 2025 BNB’s Market Position BNB is consolidating after recently breaking $1,000 for the first time. The rally reflects growing confidence in Binance’s ecosystem, even as competitors like Solana, Ethereum, and Base push for liquidity dominance. Cutting fees at this moment isn’t just tactical,it’s strategic. It signals BNB Chain intends to lead the next wave of onchain trading by staying the cheapest, fastest option. The proposal is now in community hands. Validators and users will weigh the pros and cons before voting. If approved, fees would halve within weeks, further positioning BNB Chain as the backbone for high-frequency onchain activity. The message from leadership is clear: performance and accessibility will drive the next stage of growth. BNB Chain has always moved forward with validator consensus and user support. This proposal continues that path. Community feedback will shape whether the chain pursues 0.05 Gwei now and $0.001 per tx long term. With adoption climbing and trading now dominant, the fee debate is more than numbers,it’s about securing BSC’s place in the future of DeFi. BNB trades at $1,014, with 24h volume at $3.8B and circulating supply of 139M BNB, per CoinMarketCap. The road ahead will be decided by the same principle that has guided past success: build fast, keep fees low, and grow together. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Yet the one-word message went viral, drawing over 8.6 million views within hours. The response was immediate. $FTT, the native token of the defunct FTX exchange, erupted in trading volume and price. According to Coingecko, $FTT jumped 30.2% in early trading, later peaking near a 60% gain on the day. $FTT is up 30.2% following a 'gm' tweet from Sam Bankman-Fried's X account. pic.twitter.com/9Zqk33Y01b — CoinGecko (@coingecko) September 24, 2025 Who’s Posting From Prison? The sudden appearance of SBF online fueled speculation. How does someone behind bars manage to post on X? Shortly after the “gm,” a follow-up clarification appeared. The account explained that Sam himself is not directly posting, but that “a friend” has access and is sharing updates on his behalf. The clarification did little to calm the chatter. Screenshots, reposts, and memes flooded crypto Twitter. Reactions split between disbelief, anger, and amusement at the idea of a casual “good morning” shaking up a dead token. The Market Impact The effect was undeniable. Traders rushed back into $FTT, a token once written off after FTX’s collapse in 2022. At press time, $FTT trades around $0.97, up 18% in 24 hours, with a market cap of $319 million, according to CoinMarketCap. Daily volume surged past $79 million. Timing Ahead of Repayment Round The surge also coincides with a crucial date for FTX creditors. On September 30, the exchange is scheduled for its third repayment round, distributing $1.6 billion back to creditors. Speculators may be linking the renewed activity around SBF’s account to renewed hopes for the FTX estate. While there’s no official connection between the tweet and the repayment, markets often react emotionally to symbolic signals. Digital Resurrection of #SBF Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced genius serving 25 years for massive fraud, has just broken his silence on X after months of digital silence.

A… pic.twitter.com/QkPzrpSn1f — Ismeidy (@ismeidyfinanzas) September 24, 2025 A Community Divided The broader crypto community remains torn. Some view the $FTT move as a cynical pump, with little substance behind it. Others frame it as proof of the token’s resilience, even years after its parent exchange collapsed. Crypto commentator @g13m noted that “the fact a single ‘gm’ can do this says more about trader psychology than fundamentals.” GieM The unexpected awakening of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in X, where he is serving a 25-year sentence in an American prison, led to a nearly 60% increase in the price of the FTT exchange token. After the ""Good Morning"" message, another post was published, clarifying that… pic.twitter.com/4iOyJ4FOqu — Captain GM (@g13m) September 24, 2025 Memes also poured in, with “gm from prison” trending across X. Some joked about Sam tweeting workout updates or prison cafeteria reviews next. Others criticized the ethical implications of humanizing someone convicted of one of the largest frauds in financial history. The SBF Factor Sam Bankman-Fried has been largely absent from public conversation since his conviction earlier this year. Legal experts had predicted a quiet disappearance from headlines as the FTX bankruptcy played out. Instead, his digital ghost just sent shockwaves through crypto markets. Even from behind bars, the mere suggestion of SBF’s presence still moves money. That fact alone raises questions about how much influence individuals continue to hold over crypto sentiment, even after disgrace. Whether today’s surge sustains is uncertain. $FTT remains a speculative asset tied to a collapsed exchange, with little utility outside creditor speculation. Still, today’s price action shows that narratives,especially unexpected ones,can reignite interest. As the September 30 repayment round approaches, all eyes will remain on both $FTT price action and the X account of Sam Bankman-Fried. A casual post already triggered one rally. Traders are now watching closely for the next digital whisper from prison. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While the market shows attempts at recovery, the unclear wave patterns leave traders divided on whether the next move will be a breakout or a deeper correction. Messy Subwaves Keep Bitcoin’s Next Move Clouded TARA, a crypto analyst, recently shared fresh insights on X regarding Bitcoin’s ongoing price action. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is currently in the middle of forming another wave down, but the subwave structure is still messy and unclear. This uncertainty makes it harder to predict the exact short-term direction, though the broader trend signals that further movement is likely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Signals Bullish Edge As Traders Eye Fed Pivot She noted that BTC has already tested the resistance zone around $113,500, but the market still seems drawn toward lower targets. The rejection from that resistance highlights the weakness in immediate bullish momentum, leaving room for bears to reassert control. TARA also emphasized that the $111,000 level remains a critical area to watch. This zone aligns closely with important Fibonacci retracement levels, particularly the .618 support fibs. As long as Bitcoin holds above this threshold, there’s still a chance for the bulls to regain momentum and avoid deeper downside pressure. However, if $111,000 is broken decisively, the analyst warned that Bitcoin would most likely extend its decline toward the next major Fibonacci level near $99,000. Such a move would shake out weak hands before the market establishes a more stable foundation for recovery. BTC Finds Support As Liquidity Grab Sparks Bounce Crypto VIP Signal, in a fresh update, noted that Bitcoin recently grabbed liquidity at a key support zone before bouncing higher. This liquidity sweep allowed the market to reset after testing lower levels, showing that buyers were quick to step in and defend the area. Such reactions often serve as early signs of strength, suggesting that Bitcoin still holds bullish potential as long as the support remains intact.

This level has acted as a tough ceiling in previous attempts, making it a critical zone to watch. According to the analyst, a decisive close above $113,300 could pave the way for BTC to target the $115,000 level in the short term. Such a breakout would not only reinforce bullish momentum but also strengthen the case for a continuation of the broader upward trend. In the meantime, speculations are whether Bitcoin can hold onto its rebound or if resistance will once again prove too strong to overcome.

52215414,588435,1758754842,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52215414.jpeg,XRP And DeFi: The Roadmap That Tells It All,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-and-defi-the-roadmap/,"Ripple has unveiled the next phase of its roadmap for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in relation to institutional DeFi. The roadmap focuses on tokenization, privacy, and native lending, and plans to introduce more stablecoins on the network, which is a positive for XRP’s utility. Ripple Reveals Latest Roadmap For Institutional DeFi On The Ledger In a blog post , Ripple noted that tokenization remains the central enabler of the XRP Ledger’s institutional strategy. Therefore, plans are in place to introduce the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard by October on the network. The crypto firm explained that these MPTs are a flexible token standard that can carry essential metadata without relying on complex smart contracts. In relation to institutional DeFi on the XRP Ledger, Ripple noted that the MPT enables assets of bond issuers, money market funds , and structured products to be represented faithfully and traded natively on the network. The crypto firm further revealed that the next phase will enable the integration of MPTs into the DEX for easy trading, AMM liquidity pools, and cross-token payments. Furthermore, Ripple also plans to introduce a native lending protocol on the Ledger, which it described as the “most significant near-term milestone.” The lending protocol is set to go live in XRPL Version 3.0.0 later this year. The crypto firm said that the protocol introduces pooled lending and underwritten credit directly at the ledger level. Ripple remarked that the appeal of a native lending protocol on the Ledger is clear for institutions. The firm claimed that no financial institution will turn down low-cost capital if it can be sourced within KYC/AML standards . The protocol will pool liquidity from a global base of smaller investors into institutional-sized loans while maintaining compliance. For loan managers, this will be an opportunity to meet the rising demand for liquidity from TradFi by tapping into the growing crypto liquidity, specifically on the XRP Ledger. The Push For Programmable Privacy Ripple revealed that one of the XRP Ledger’s next major upgrades is programmable privacy . The firm noted that for financial institutions, full transparency doesn’t always work, but that privacy features must still meet compliance and auditability standards. The first privacy-focused application, confidential MPTs, is said to already be in development and is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of next year. These confidential MPTs will support privacy-preserving collateral management, which Ripple noted is a critical requirement for institutional adoption of tokenized finance . As a whole, the crypto firm indicated that the goal is to introduce more stablecoins, RWAs, lending, compliance tooling, and privacy directly at the protocol level at a global scale. Meanwhile, Ripple stated that over the last year, the Ledger has broken into the top 10 chains for RWAs and has reached its first $1 billion month in stablecoin volume. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.84, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Ripple|AMM Liquidity Pools|DeFi|DEX|KYC/AML Standards|MPTs|Multi-Purpose Token|ripple|ripple news|stablecoin|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|WALLET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-24 23:00:42

AML Software has filed a lawsuit against Athena Bitcoin, claiming that Athena conspired with Taproot Acquisition Enterprises and its CEO, Jordan Mirch, in a scheme to wrongfully obtain AML’s proprietary source code. Athena Bitcoin faces lawsuit over alleged source code theft Athena Bitcoin Global Inc., a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator , has run into legal trouble with the Illinois firm AML Software. AML Software filed a lawsuit accusing Athena Bitcoin of engaging in a scheme to steal its proprietary source code. The complaint was lodged on Tuesday in federal court and contains allegations of copyright infringement, trade secret theft, and other unlawful conduct. AML Software claims that its code is copyrighted and was never licensed for sale to Athena despite the company’s attempt to directly purchase AML’s code. The 16-page filing made allegations of collusion between Athena and Jordan Mirch, the CEO of Taproot Acquisition Enterprises. Mirch was implicated as the “motivating force” behind the alleged misappropriation and accused him of using fraudulent tactics to gain access to more than 3,000 ATMs still running AML’s software that Athena sought to acquire starting in 2023. The legal case involves SandP Solutions, which is a company that once operated 2,800 Bitcoin ATMs. After regulators barred SandP from operating in Ohio, the company faced mounting financial strain. The complaint alleges that Mirch seized the opportunity, securing SandP’s ATMs through “fraudulent misrepresentations and other unlawful conduct.” Once in possession of the machines, Mirch allegedly reached out to Athena to negotiate a transfer of both hardware and software. The lawsuit further claims that Mirch hired an AML developer as a consultant in an effort to wrongfully obtain AML’s existing copyrighted platform. Athena faces different customer protection lawsuit AML’s lawsuit also references a recent $9M settlement agreement involving Athena, Taproot, and associated entities. Under the terms, Athena announced earlier this month that it was gaining “immediate ownership of ATMs and source code,” while terminating a revenue-sharing deal with Taproot. AML, however, argues that the source code transferred under the agreement did not legally belong to Taproot or Athena, but to AML alone. Earlier this month, Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb filed a separate lawsuit accusing Athena of exploiting elderly customers through predatory practices . Schwalb alleged Athena profited from scams, charging up to 26% in hidden fees. Progressive Democrats have called for tougher consumer protections in the crypto sector.Senator Cynthia Lummis said Tuesday that she plans to address issues like those raised in the Athena case through forthcoming market structure legislation, co-sponsored with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.

On Wednesday in New York, nearly 500,000 fed funds futures contracts for September were traded, breaking a record set in April 2023 when Trump’s tariff news hit markets. The surge is happening while the effective fed funds rate quietly crept up to 4.09% on Monday. That single basis point move outside of a policy change was enough to rattle the futures market and raise red flags over overnight borrowing stress. Traders are responding to a tightening repo market, where firms borrow cash overnight in exchange for Treasuries, as month-end and quarter-end always bring more pressure, with shrinking bank reserves and more Treasury bills flooding the market. Traders expect spike in repo rates before month-end Scrutiny on the rate has jumped since July. That’s when Treasury started pumping out more bills, while the Fed kept slashing its balance sheet. Bank reserves are now falling. Some traders are warning this combo could lead to serious funding pressure at quarter-end. Dealers slow their repo activity to clean up their books, and that usually pushes up borrowing costs. Everyone’s trying to front-run that pressure. The bulk of the action in September futures happened during Asia hours, with two blocks of 50,000 contracts traded. That frenzy picked up again once U.S. markets opened, especially as traders eyed the effective rate possibly hitting 4.10% before the month wraps. For almost 20 years, U.S. funding markets were soaked in cheap cash. Not anymore. Now, rates on very short-term borrowing, used by banks and asset managers, are climbing. That’s because the Treasury is rebuilding its cash pile while the Fed keeps tightening. Meanwhile, use of the Fed’s overnight reverse repo tool, a barometer for excess cash, just fell to its lowest in four years. “We are seeing a level shift in funding,” said Mark Cabana of Bank of America. “Money funds no longer have excess cash to deploy to the RRP.” As more T-bills get sold, investors move money out of repo and into those bills, which is dragging demand down while pushing rates up.Interest-rate benchmarks tied to overnight repos are now sitting near the Fed’s interest on reserve balances rate, showing the strain. The spread between repo and the fed funds rate has widened to about 11.5 basis points, the biggest gap since April. That spread was under 10 basis points for most of July and August, before the new wave of T-bills hit. Fed weighs tools as collateral and reserves drop together Things may get worse fast. Corporate tax payments and new auctions are about to pull even more money from the system next week. That could upset the balance between cash and collateral — and banks already hold fewer reserves at the Fed. Those balances have fallen to around $3.15 trillion, and Fed Governor Christopher Waller has warned that $2.7 trillion is probably the floor for what counts as “ample.” Meanwhile, rates tied to overnight financing keep climbing, which creates a headache for the Fed’s quantitative tightening strategy, the balance sheet reduction started in June 2022 and is supposed to finish by year-end. But it’s getting harder to manage with rates rising and reserves shrinking. Roberto Perli, who runs the Fed’s securities portfolio, said the central bank’s short-term interest rate tools will become even more critical in times like this. The more efficiently they work, the less damage markets take. To avoid another 2019-style repo panic, the Fed now uses the Standing Repo Facility (SRF), letting eligible firms borrow cash by pledging Treasuries or agency debt. That facility charges a rate aligned with the top of the Fed’s target range, now at 4.5%. It saw its biggest usage at the end of June since being made permanent in 2021. But it hasn’t been tested under real stress yet. JPMorgan’s team said the SRF could contain spikes in repo rates, reducing the need to cut QT short. But others aren’t so sure. September is already looking shaky, and more volatility could force that debate to the front. Some Fed officials, including Waller and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, admit funding stress is building. But they’re not pushing for an early end to QT.

Senators Push For Probe According to the Wednesday letter , Slotkin and Warren want a probe launched into David Sacks and Steve Witkoff for allegedly “advocating for the United States to sell sensitive national security technology to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).” The Senate duo allege Sacks and Witkoff “played key roles” over the White House’s choice to ease AI system security restrictions in shipments sent to the UAE. However, the senators claim the two had not “disclosed their financial ties to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan,” UAE’s national security advisor. Trump Administration Ties Questioned By U.S. Lawmakers Slotkin and Warren say that Witkoff’s son, World Liberty Financial CEO Zach Witkoff, failed to recuse himself from U.S. decisions involving the UAE despite MGX – a state-owned investment firm controlled by Sheikh Tahnoon – investing $2 billion worth of WLF’s issued stablecoin , USD1, into Binance. The senators allege that Sacks and Witkoff “were in positions to control government decisions to personally enrich themselves – even as they created significant national security concerns.” “In the history of our country’s foreign policy, one is hard-pressed to find two senior officials with such significant conflicts of interest involved in decisions regarding national security,” Slotkin and Warren said. “Such unbridled conflicts of interest have no place in the U.S. government, and we urge you to undertake a swift and thorough evaluation of these allegations,” they added. “This information is also critical as Congress considers legislation for digital asset market structure and attempts to ensure that crypto corruption does not undermine our national security.” The post Senators Call For Probe Into Top Trump Administration Officials, appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Elizabeth Warren|Trump|World Liberty Financial,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BNB|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-24 23:28:45

Per the South Korean media outlet Electronic Times , the ruling party said the task force would “create policies that spur future growth.” South Korean Crypto Policy: Task Force Set to Meet Biz Leaders At a press event at the National Assembly on September 24, task force members said they plan to pass pro-business legislation before the end of the year. Han Jeong-ae, the Chair of the DP’s policy committee, said: “We need to establish a system that keeps pace with evolving trends in the new financial market.

(Source: @jongmun.lee.1/Facebook) The new unit will initially focus its efforts on stablecoin legislation, with lawmakers still to finalize their token issuance and distribution plans. But the DP’s plans will likely bring much cheer to South Korean crypto firms. The media outlet wrote that the lawmakers are “expected to focus on streamlining the system to foster industries.” It added that it would move away from existing crypto laws, which focus primarily “on operator regulation and user protection measures.” The lawmaker Lee Jeong-moon will head the task force. Members include the likes of Min Byoung-dug, the chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee and a vocal proponent of stablecoin-powered growth .

(Source: @anyangminbest/Facebook) Task Force to Speak to Regulators, Central Bank The task force has already asked ministries and the top financial regulators (the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service) to come forward with policy proposals. The lawmakers have also asked the Bank of Korea to do likewise. They also plan to hold talks with companies in the sector, such as crypto exchanges and fintech companies. The task force said it would form an advisory group comprised of private sector experts. Lee said that the force’s goal was to roll out crypto-related legislation during the National Assembly’s final session of the calendar year. He explained: “We will treat the digital asset market as a new paradigm for the financial markets. Our goal is to develop policies that will foster future growth.” Han, meanwhile, lauded the government for its recent move to lift a ban on venture capital funding for crypto firms. She said the move would help revitalize the industry, and added: “We will communicate closely with the government and listen to and reflect diverse opinions from experts, financial institutions, crypto exchanges, and fintech companies.” The lawmaker Ahn Do-geol, another DP MP with a pro-business stance on crypto policy, stated: “The government must lead the way in financial innovation. We have already fallen a long way behind. We could miss out on the innovation and growth potential of the digital asset sector, including stablecoins .” Ahn concluded that lawmakers have “formed a consensus” on many crypto-related matters, with a general “bipartisan agreement” on stablecoins now in place.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/13-of-xrp-supply-could-be-taken-off-the-market-heres-why/,"Concerns are growing within the XRP community about a possible reduction in available supply, as new projects target large allocations of the token for staking and yield-bearing products. Digital Asset Investor (DAI), a well-known voice in the community, recently highlighted figures from both Axelar Network and Flare that, if realized, could remove billions of XRP from circulation. Ambitious Targets from Axelar and Flare Axelar Network recently introduced mXRP, a yield-generating asset that runs on both the XRP Ledger and its EVM Sidechain. In an interview with Crypto in America , Axelar Foundation co-founder Georgios Vlachos explained that the team measures success primarily by assets under management. So @axelar 's goal is to lock up 5% of the XRP circulating supply and @FlareNetworks 's goal is to lock up 5 Billion XRP. That's just two companies. Can you say supply shock?? pic.twitter.com/KBDahqMxfx — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) September 23, 2025 According to Vlachos, their goal is to reach $10 billion in XRP locked within the system. This figure translates to about 5% of the circulating supply. Similarly, Flare’s co-founder, Hugo Philion, set out his vision during an appearance on the Paul Barron Show. When asked about the expected growth of FXRP, Philion stated that he hopes to see 5 billion XRP secured on the Flare network by mid-2026. Combined, the objectives from both projects amount to roughly 8 billion tokens, which equate to approximately 13% of the current circulating supply. Current Progress Toward the Targets While the long-term goals are substantial, the actual progress so far is modest. Data shows that the mXRP product, which was formally launched at XRP Seoul 2025, currently holds about 3.851 million XRP. Of this amount, 2.786 million resides on the EVM Sidechain and the remainder on the XRP Ledger. When compared with the $10 billion target, this represents only about 0.006% of the total circulating supply. Nonetheless, since mXRP has only recently gone live, advocates argue that the project still has significant time to expand. Shrinking Exchange Reserves DAI’s warning about a possible supply crunch comes at a time when XRP balances on major exchanges appear to be decreasing sharply. Coinbase provides one example. In June, the exchange held around 970 million XRP spread across 52 cold wallets. By September 20, this figure had dropped dramatically to just 32 million XRP in two wallets. The sudden reduction has raised questions within the community, though Coinbase has not offered any public explanation for the shift. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Concentration of XRP Holdings Beyond exchange balances, a large proportion of XRP is already locked or controlled by key entities. Ripple retains control over 37.3 billion XRP in escrow and an additional 3.5 billion in liquid form. Co-founder Chris Larsen holds 2.3 billion, while Arthur Britto is estimated to control about 1.3 billion. Altogether, these allocations account for nearly 44.4% of the total token supply. Institutional interest is also beginning to emerge. For instance, Purpose ETF has disclosed holdings of 29.6 million XRP, while Canadian firm 3iQ manages approximately 45 million. Analyst 24HrsCrypto recently estimated that retail investors may collectively own no more than 15% of the circulating supply. According to 24HrsCrypto , the market could see even greater supply reductions once large financial institutions enter the space. Banks such as JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs are frequently mentioned as potential future participants. In addition, speculation continues about the possible approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds later this year, which could result in further tokens being moved into long-term storage. Although Axelar’s and Flare’s current holdings remain small relative to their ambitious goals, their stated objectives combined with declining exchange balances and institutional accumulation have intensified community discussions about a potential supply squeeze. If the projects achieve their targets, as much as 13% of circulating XRP could be removed from open markets, significantly reshaping the asset’s liquidity profile.

Now it says batteries have to follow. On Wednesday, during an auto industry event in Milan, Alfredo, the company’s European adviser, made it clear: if BYD is serious about making EVs locally, it can’t keep flying batteries in from China. The company’s factory in Hungary is almost ready and should start running by the end of this year. A second plant in Turkey is set for 2026. These two alone will give BYD the capacity to build about 500,000 cars a year in Europe. That’s a huge change from where the company started, which is with selling only electric cars in Europe. Now it’s adding plug-in hybrids to the mix, because European buyers seem to like the flexibility. BYD lays out the options for its next big move Alfredo said the company hasn’t decided what comes next. It’s weighing two options: a third car plant or its first battery facility in the region. Either way, BYD is not slowing down. “It does not make sense to invest in car assembly but bring batteries from China,” he told the audience in Milan. “Several factors come into play when choosing a new location,” Alfredo said , pointing to things like energy prices. “Energy cost is objectively one of the most important competitiveness factors,” he added, since both types of factories use a ton of electricity. Right now, the focus is on getting Hungary’s plant running at full speed. But BYD is already talking to governments across Europe about where it might set up its next base. The company says it wants all the EVs it sells in Europe to be built in Europe by 2027. That goal is meant to help the company avoid EU import tariffs. And for now, plug-in hybrids will likely dominate sales, according to Stella, the company’s EVP. Fully electric models are still part of the plan, but BYD sees hybrids as the near-term money maker. On top of all that, Alfredo had something to say about Warren Buffett. Last month, Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, finished selling its full stake in BYD after 17 years. Some thought that move meant he was losing trust in the company. Alfredo wasn’t having it. “Buffett made a profit of 20 times the capital he invested. He did very well to do what he did,” he said. “We’ve been extremely glad to have had Buffett, but the fact that he monetised his position is exactly what Berkshire Hathaway does for a living: buying, earning and selling.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|BYD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-24 23:41:57

However, the crypto community pushed back against his remarks, with many arguing that his analysis relied too heavily on short-term data. BTC Down 20% against Gold The economist dismissed Bitcoin in a September 24 post on X, stating it is “not living up to its hype.” He pointed out that the cryptocurrency has dropped 20% against gold since its August peak, a fall that he said means it’s in bear market territory. Schiff added that since the crypto asset is promoted as “digital gold,” the 20% drop terms is comparatively more than the 10% decline in dollar terms. Bitcoin recently experienced a sharp correction that dragged it more than 8% down from its all-time high of $123,800 on August 13 to a recent 13-day low of $112,200 on September 22. On the other hand, gold has continued setting fresh highs this year, climbing more than 11% over the past month. This isn’t the first time Schiff has made such claims. A few days ago, he predicted that the metal’s steady strength could set the stage for a breakout while it’s counterpart continues to slip. His view is supported by analyst Stockmoney Lizards, who pointed to a bearish rising wedge in the leading cryptocurrency’s pattern. The latter’s chart shows $112,000 as the immediate support level, with $110,000 identified as the critical threshold, which means that a break below that point could signal a deeper decline. Crypto Community Fires Back Crypto supporters have rejected Schiff’s bearish outlook, with people accusing him of not factoring in the digital asset’s long-term dominance. Some claimed he is “moving the goalposts” by measuring Bitcoin in gold, pointing out that the cryptocurrency is still up triple digits against the metal over the past five years. Others dismissed his argument that a 20% decline constituted a bear market, saying that “in crypto, calling a 20% dip a ‘bear market’ is like calling a drizzle a flood.” Another X user highlighted the leading digital asset’s long-term dominance, noting that over the past decade, gold priced in Bitcoin has collapsed by 99.3%, dropping from about 4.84 BTC per ounce in 2015 to just 0.033 BTC today. The 62-year-old has remained relentless in his bearish stance. According to the artificial intelligence platform Grok, he has made 237 separate predictions since 2011 forecasting Bitcoin’s crash, collapse, or eventual worthlessness.

Recently, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin underscored a critical point: safety is the absolute top priority for this pivotal network enhancement. This isn’t just about speed; it’s about building a robust and secure foundation for the decentralized world. Understanding the significance of the Fusaka upgrade helps us appreciate the meticulous planning behind Ethereum’s evolution. Why is the Fusaka Upgrade So Important for Ethereum? The Ethereum network is constantly evolving to meet the demands of a growing ecosystem. The Fusaka upgrade represents a significant step forward, primarily focusing on enhancing scalability and security. Buterin’s emphasis on safety highlights the careful approach core developers are taking to ensure the network remains resilient. At the core of this upgrade is a feature called PeerDAS. This technical innovation is designed to revolutionize how nodes interact with blockchain data. It’s not just a minor tweak; it’s essential infrastructure for the long-term health of Ethereum. Enhanced Scalability: PeerDAS will enable the network to handle more transactions efficiently. Improved Security: Nodes can verify and reconstruct blocks without needing to store all data, reducing the burden on individual participants. Future-Proofing: This feature is crucial for both Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling solutions, paving the way for broader adoption. Understanding PeerDAS: A Glimpse into Scalability What exactly is PeerDAS, and why is it so vital? PeerDAS, short for “Peer Data Availability Sampling,” allows Ethereum nodes to check if all data for a block is available, even if they don’t download the entire block themselves. Think of it like a smart sampling method. Traditionally, nodes would need to store every piece of data to ensure the network’s integrity. However, as Ethereum scales, this becomes increasingly impractical. PeerDAS addresses this by: Enabling light clients to participate more effectively. Reducing the hardware requirements for running a node. Ultimately supporting a more decentralized and robust network. This mechanism is a game-changer for how Ethereum manages its ever-increasing data load, directly contributing to the success of the Fusaka upgrade . Navigating the Blob Expansion: A Conservative Approach Another key aspect of the Fusaka upgrade involves increasing the number of “blobs.” Blobs are essentially temporary data packets designed to hold transaction data for Layer 2 rollups. They are crucial for improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these scaling solutions. Buterin stated that the number of blobs will be increased “conservatively at first.” This cautious approach underscores the commitment to safety. Rushing to expand blob capacity could introduce unforeseen risks, potentially compromising network stability. The gradual increase allows developers to: Monitor network performance in real-time. Address any potential bottlenecks or vulnerabilities. Ensure a smooth and secure transition for the entire ecosystem. This careful expansion is a testament to the development team’s dedication to making the Fusaka upgrade a success without compromising Ethereum’s foundational security. What Challenges Does the Fusaka Upgrade Address? The Fusaka upgrade is designed to tackle some of Ethereum’s most pressing challenges head-on. As the network grows, issues like transaction costs, processing speed, and data storage become more pronounced. This upgrade directly targets these areas. By implementing PeerDAS and carefully expanding blob capacity, Ethereum aims to: Reduce Transaction Fees: More efficient data handling can lead to lower gas costs for users. Increase Throughput: The network will be able to process a higher volume of transactions per second. Enhance Decentralization: Lower hardware requirements for nodes make it easier for more individuals to participate, strengthening the network’s decentralized nature. These improvements are not just technical advancements; they translate directly into a better user experience and a more accessible blockchain for everyone. The Road Ahead: Fusaka Upgrade Timeline and Impact Ethereum core developers have set a tentative date of December 3 for the Fusaka upgrade . While dates in blockchain development can sometimes shift, this target provides a clear indication of the project’s momentum. The successful deployment of the Fusaka upgrade will have far-reaching implications: It will solidify Ethereum’s position as a leading blockchain for decentralized applications. It will accelerate the adoption of Layer 2 solutions, making Ethereum more practical for everyday use. It reinforces the network’s commitment to continuous improvement and robust security. This upgrade isn’t just another technical milestone; it’s a foundational step towards a more scalable, secure, and user-friendly Ethereum ecosystem. In conclusion, Vitalik Buterin’s unwavering focus on safety for the Fusaka upgrade underscores Ethereum’s commitment to building a resilient and future-proof blockchain. With innovations like PeerDAS and a conservative approach to blob expansion, the upgrade promises to significantly enhance scalability, security, and decentralization. As the tentative December 3rd date approaches, the crypto community eagerly anticipates the positive impact this pivotal upgrade will have on Ethereum’s journey towards mass adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Fusaka upgrade? The Fusaka upgrade is an upcoming enhancement to the Ethereum network, primarily focused on improving scalability and security through features like PeerDAS and an increase in data blobs. Who is Vitalik Buterin, and what is his role in the Fusaka upgrade? Vitalik Buterin is the co-founder of Ethereum. He has emphasized that safety is the top priority for the Fusaka upgrade, guiding its development philosophy. What is PeerDAS, and how does it relate to the Fusaka upgrade?

This dramatic shakeout has left investors searching for opportunities amid the chaos, with many turning to best crypto presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as potential havens from mainstream market volatility. Market analysts suggest this liquidation event could mark a crucial reset point for the broader crypto ecosystem. Liquidation Tsunami Rocks Bitcoin Markets The September 2025 crypto market downturn began when more than $1.7 billion worth of leveraged positions were closed during a single 24-hour period. Bitcoin price reached $111,800 during the liquidation period, but it now trades at $112,863. Major exchanges experienced their largest-ever market collapse due to massive leverage liquidations, which reached unprecedented levels. The crypto market experienced its fourth-largest long liquidation in 2025 on Monday when Bitcoin prices reached their lowest point and $1.6 billion worth of leveraged positions got wiped out. The system accumulated dangerous speculative amounts which this data demonstrates. The exchange data shows that $1.6 billion worth of liquidated positions were long bets which indicates most traders held optimistic views about price increases. The market became exposed to massive liquidation waves because traders maintained excessive bullish positions until essential support levels failed. Major market cycles follow this specific pattern. Market euphoria leads to excessive leverage which creates conditions for price drops to trigger massive liquidation waves that exceed their initial causes. Technical Analysis Points to Critical Juncture Bitcoin price has reached its support zone between $110K and $112K while liquidation spikes indicate intense market volatility. Technical experts monitor these specific price points because they could serve as triggers for upcoming market trends. The 30-day volatility of BTC decreased to 1.33% which approaches its yearly minimum value just like the August beginning. The current market situation holds essential value for traders because this compression pattern typically leads to explosive price movements in any direction. The liquidation data shows that excessive leveraged positions have been removed from the market which might establish better technical market conditions. Market structure experts believe this type of market reset creates essential moments for crypto market cycles to shift direction. The liquidation event showed institutional-grade selling activity while professional investors started buying at lower price points. Major market bottoms show themselves through the distinct behavior of retail investors who panic while professional traders seek opportunities. Best Crypto Presale Projects Gain Attention As mainstream cryptocurrency markets face turbulence, investor interest in best crypto presale opportunities has surged. The cryptocurrency market in 2025 finds itself at a pivotal juncture, with investors increasingly focused on finding the best crypto presales. MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as a standout opportunity during this market reset. While Bitcoin and major altcoins face liquidation pressure, presale projects offer insulation from margin trading volatility that has plagued established markets. The appeal of presale investments during market shakeouts is straightforward. These projects aren’t subject to the leverage-driven volatility affecting exchange-traded assets. Additionally, early-stage pricing often provides better risk-reward profiles than buying established coins at elevated levels. Professional investors increasingly view presale opportunities as portfolio diversification tools. During periods of mainstream market stress, these alternative investments can provide uncorrelated returns that smooth overall portfolio performance. Hidden Gems Emerge from Market Chaos Investors seeking to uncover hidden gems should examine market disruptions, as they often generate the most promising investment opportunities. The market currently supports projects that integrate new technology with dedicated communities and established listing strategies. The current market situation favors projects with solid fundamentals over those based solely on speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE presents itself as a hidden investment opportunity that matches the criteria of emerging projects. The current market instability allows smart investors to identify new breakthrough projects which traders overlook while monitoring Bitcoin technical indicators and liquidation events. The project launch date matches the current market conditions. The market shift toward stable assets attracts institutional investors who support community-based projects that demonstrate practical uses. The market transition toward fundamental value discovery benefits MAGACOIN FINANCE because it moves away from speculative price movements. Quality projects find their best entry points during major market downturns which early-stage investors understand. The current market volatility presents an excellent chance for investors who want to move past surface-level price movements. Market Reset Creates Strategic Opportunities The $1.8 billion liquidation event demonstrates both the dangers and the resilience of the crypto market in the face of challenges. The event serves as a warning to investors about the risks of excessive leverage in their trading activities. The market will enter a new expansion period after this final period of market adjustment, according to some market participants. The professional investment community views this liquidation event as a necessary step to clean up the market. The removal of excessive speculation has created a more favorable environment for sustained market growth. The current market conditions support projects which deliver practical value and maintain active community involvement. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the best crypto presale investment because it allows users to access explosive market potential without facing the leverage-related dangers that have destroyed overleveraged positions. The fundamental elements of crypto adoption continue to advance despite short-term market price swings. The development of institutional infrastructure, alongside improved global regulatory frameworks and practical blockchain solutions in real-world applications, continues to advance. The fundamental growth factors operate independently of market price movements to drive long-term expansion. Investment Strategy During Market Uncertainty Experienced crypto investors capitalize on market shakeouts as an entry point, rather than rushing to sell their holdings. The current market situation favors investors who plan their moves instead of making impulsive trades. The strategic exposure of MAGACOIN FINANCE as a best crypto presale project enables investors to participate in the market. Strategic portfolio management through diversified investments in various project types and market capitalizations enables better navigation of market volatility. The technical challenges faced by Bitcoin and major altcoins create presale investment opportunities that provide distinct risk and reward dynamics for portfolio growth. Professional traders understand that liquidation events require them to stay patient, as markets tend to swing excessively in both positive and negative directions. The market tends to make excessive movements in both positive and negative directions which professional traders use to their advantage when others lose control. Conclusion The $1.8 billion liquidation event marks a significant reset point for cryptocurrency markets. While short-term volatility creates challenges, it also generates opportunities for strategic investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE and similar best crypto presale projects offer compelling alternatives to mainstream market exposure during uncertain times. Market cycles consistently reward those who position early in quality projects rather than chasing momentum in overvalued assets. The current shakeout creates exactly these types of opportunities for discerning investors willing to look beyond immediate headline volatility.

The Numbers Behind the Price Target,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-to-1-the-numbers-behind-the-price-target/,"The idea of Shiba Inu (SHIB) reaching a value of $1 continues to circulate within the crypto community, but closer examination of the numbers reveals that the target is largely unrealistic under current conditions. While some community leaders and market commentators maintain optimism, the scale of SHIB’s supply and current burn rates present significant obstacles. Community Sentiment and Predictions Price projections for SHIB vary widely, ranging from modest targets of $0.0001 to more ambitious levels such as $0.001 . The most extreme prediction, $1 per token, remains the most controversial. Supporters argue that strong utility growth combined with aggressive token reduction strategies could make the goal achievable. Lucie, Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, previously referenced external analysis suggesting that expanded adoption and accelerated burns could, in theory, support such a valuation. Why the $1 Target Is Unlikely The primary challenge is SHIB’s vast supply. Current data places the circulating supply at approximately 589.24 trillion tokens. With SHIB trading at $0.00001227, the token’s market capitalization sits around $7.14 billion. To reach $1, the price would need to climb more than 8 million percent, creating a market capitalization of roughly $589 trillion. For perspective, that figure is several times larger than the global economy and far beyond the entire cryptocurrency sector’s combined valuation, which is estimated at about $4 trillion. This mathematical reality underscores why analysts remain skeptical that SHIB can achieve a $1 price point without extreme changes in supply dynamics. Token Burn Efforts Shiba Inu has attempted to address the supply issue through token burns. Soon after its launch, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin removed approximately 410 trillion SHIB from circulation, reducing the total supply from one quadrillion to roughly 590 trillion. Since then, the community has continued to push for ongoing burns as a price support mechanism. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In practice, however, the burn rate has slowed. Monthly reductions have ranged between 13 million and 2.31 billion tokens, with daily activity often registering in the hundreds of thousands. At the current pace, it would take decades to bring the supply down to the estimated 7 billion tokens needed to support a $1 price with today’s market capitalization. Additional supply control efforts have come through Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain. The network converts part of its gas fees into SHIB and directs them to a burn wallet. Since its introduction in August 2023 , Shibarium has removed billions of tokens from circulation. However, Shibarium’s impact depends on the level of activity on the network. Transaction volumes have recently fallen to around 20,460 per day, a sharp drop compared to peaks of over 4 million daily transactions earlier in the year. This decline limits the scale of SHIB reductions that can be achieved through the mechanism. The $1 dream remains a central talking point for many SHIB enthusiasts, but the mathematics demonstrate that such a price level is not feasible without extraordinary supply cuts and broader adoption of Shibarium or other burn mechanisms. While community-driven burns and utility expansion efforts provide long-term potential, the gap between current realities and the $1 target is significant.

Drawing on historical price patterns and critical support levels, the analyst suggests that XRP could be on track for either a slightly conservative surge toward $9.6 or an explosive rally to $33. XRP Price Retest Signals Path Toward $9.6 In his post released on X social media, Egrag Crypto highlights XRP’s market behavior during the 2021 cycle, particularly the cryptocurrency’s interaction with the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and how it has played a role in fueling massive gains. At the time, XRP faced one of its most turbulent periods in its history. Related Reading: 8-Year Accumulation Phase Could Catapult XRP Price To $6 The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple had triggered a sharp drop, pushing the XRP price below the 21 EMA. This move disrupted the bullish structure that had supported XRP in earlier rallies, spreading uncertainty and fear across the market. However, XRP eventually managed to reclaim the 21 EMA and hold it as a critical support level. The chart analysis shows that after the cryptocurrency executed a successful retest, it staged a powerful rebound, driving its price up by approximately 414%. Applying this same percentage gain to XRP’s current market structure, the analyst presents his first bull rally scenario, projecting targets that point to a peak around $ 9.60. His chart analysis reveals that the current market setup resembles the key conditions observed in 2021, particularly with XRP’s recent retest of the 21 EMA on June 9 this year. The Altcoin Faces Potential Moonshot To $33 Egrag Crypto’s second scenario for the XRP price outlook is modeled after its explosive rally during the 2017 cycle, when the 21 EMA acted as a powerful launchpad for growth. At the time, XRP bounced off this key support level twice, paving the way for a remarkable 1,610% rally. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Major XRP Warning: Last Chance To Get In As Accumulation Balloons This breakout marked one of the most defining moments in XRP’s history, propelling the asset from sub-dollar levels to a fresh ATH around $3.84 at the peak of that bull cycle. If XRP repeats the 2021 cycle dynamics in 2025, Egrag Crypto forecasts that the measured move points to another 1,610% increase, potentially pushing the price to a more ambitious target of $33. Such a rally would represent one of the strongest performances in XRP’s history, firmly establishing it as a standout asset in the market. With the US SEC lawsuit finally concluded and XRP completing its third retest of the 21 EMA this year, the conditions are aligning for a potential surge toward $9.6 or $33. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.87, having declined in the past week by approximately 5%. While the cryptocurrency managed to reclaim the $3 resistance level briefly, it failed to sustain momentum and is now consolidating below this key threshold.

Recent proposals suggest that digital asset platforms operating in the country will soon face mandatory Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing requirements. This move signals a growing global trend towards establishing clear rules for the rapidly evolving digital finance sector. Why is Australia Embracing Mandatory Digital Asset Licensing? The Australian government’s draft regulation, as reported by Yahoo Finance, aims to bring much-needed clarity and protection to the digital asset space. The primary goal is to safeguard consumers and foster market integrity. Without proper oversight, the risks of fraud, scams, and market manipulation can be higher, eroding public trust in digital assets. This initiative seeks to level the playing field, ensuring that all platforms adhere to a baseline of operational excellence and accountability. It’s about creating a secure environment where innovation can still thrive, but not at the expense of user safety. Key Requirements for Digital Asset Platforms The proposed framework outlines several crucial obligations for platforms dealing with digital assets. These are designed to ensure transparency, security, and consumer recourse: Financial Services License: Platforms will need to obtain a specific financial services license, aligning them with traditional financial institutions. This ensures they meet stringent regulatory standards. Dispute Resolution System: A robust system for resolving customer complaints and disputes will be mandatory. This gives users a clear path to address issues, enhancing consumer protection. Minimum Standards for Custody: Platforms holding customer digital assets must meet specific standards for secure custody. This protects users’ funds from hacks, theft, and mismanagement. Payment Standards: Requirements for payment processes will be introduced, aiming to ensure efficient and secure transactions. This builds confidence in the operational reliability of these platforms. What are the Benefits of Robust Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing? While some in the crypto community might view regulation with skepticism, there are significant advantages to a well-structured regulatory framework. Firstly, it can dramatically boost investor confidence. Knowing that platforms are licensed and subject to oversight can encourage more mainstream adoption and institutional investment. Moreover, it helps in combating illicit activities. By requiring platforms to identify their clients and monitor transactions, the new rules can make it harder for bad actors to use digital assets for money laundering or terrorist financing. This ultimately strengthens the reputation of the entire digital asset industry. Navigating the Challenges of Digital Asset Licensing Of course, implementing such comprehensive regulations is not without its challenges. Smaller platforms and startups might face increased compliance costs, potentially hindering their ability to compete. There’s also the delicate balance of fostering innovation versus imposing overly restrictive rules. Regulators must work closely with the industry to ensure the framework is practical and forward-looking. Another challenge is the dynamic nature of digital assets themselves. The technology evolves rapidly, and regulations must be flexible enough to adapt without becoming outdated too quickly. The success of Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing will depend on its ability to strike this balance. What Does This Mean for You, the Crypto User? For individuals trading or holding digital assets in Australia, these proposed changes are generally positive. They promise a safer and more transparent environment. You can expect platforms to be more accountable, with clearer avenues for support and dispute resolution. This shift could lead to a more stable and trustworthy market, encouraging broader participation. It’s an exciting time as Australia moves to solidify its position in the global digital economy, demonstrating a commitment to responsible growth in the crypto space. The framework for Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing is a pivotal step. Conclusion: Australia’s proposal for mandatory digital asset licensing marks a pivotal moment for its crypto industry. By introducing clear regulatory standards, the nation aims to enhance consumer protection, foster market integrity, and build greater trust in digital assets. While challenges in implementation will exist, this proactive approach positions Australia as a leader in creating a secure and responsible environment for the future of finance. It’s a move that promises a more mature and reliable ecosystem for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of Australia’s proposed digital asset licensing?

To help investors navigate these emotional tides, we have the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This vital sentiment indicator currently stands at 44, signaling that “Fear” continues to hold sway among market participants. This reading, unchanged from the previous day, highlights ongoing caution. But what exactly does this specific number mean, and how can understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index empower your investment journey? What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Really Tell Us? Developed by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a clear snapshot of the market’s emotional temperature. It uses a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Intense anxiety, often leading to panic selling. 25-49: Fear – A cautious market, characterized by investor hesitation. 50-74: Greed – Growing optimism, typically fueled by rising prices. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoric sentiment, potentially indicating an overheated market. A score of 44 places us firmly in the “Fear” zone. This suggests that investors are generally wary, possibly holding back on new purchases or even considering selling due to concerns about potential losses. Recognizing this collective sentiment is crucial for making more objective investment decisions, rather than being swept away by market emotions. Unpacking the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: The Factors at Play The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s a sophisticated calculation combining six distinct market factors, each contributing to the final score: Volatility (25%): Measures Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. High volatility often signals an uncertain market, driving the index towards “Fear.” Market Momentum/Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volume and momentum. Strong buying volume indicates greed; low volume during a downturn suggests fear. Social Media (15%): Scans crypto-related posts for sentiment. Negative chatter can push the index towards fear. Surveys (15%): Historically, these polls captured direct investor sentiment. (Currently paused but a key factor in its design). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s market cap share. Rising dominance often implies investors are seeking safety in BTC, reflecting broader market fear. Google Search Trends (10%): Examines search queries like “Bitcoin crash.” Spikes in such terms indicate growing retail investor fear. These components collectively paint a comprehensive picture of market psychology, informing the daily reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . Navigating the ‘Fear’ Territory: Investor Strategies and Challenges When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals “Fear,” it presents both challenges and potential opportunities. Many seasoned investors recall the wisdom: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” This suggests that periods of market fear could be prime moments for strategic accumulation. Potential Opportunities: For long-term investors, “Fear” territory can offer chances to acquire assets at reduced prices. Historically, significant value has been found when market sentiment is low, provided the underlying projects have strong fundamentals. Key Challenges: Investing during fearful times demands strong conviction. The emotional pressure to sell or avoid buying can be intense, especially if prices continue to decline. It’s vital to differentiate between short-term market noise and genuine shifts in fundamentals. Actionable Insight: Employing Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is a smart strategy during periods of fear. By investing a consistent amount at regular intervals, you average out your purchase price over time. This mitigates the impact of short-term volatility, allowing you to build positions steadily even when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests caution. Remember, emotional decisions rarely lead to optimal outcomes. The index serves as a guide, not a definitive trading command. Beyond the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Balanced Perspective While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers valuable insight into market sentiment, it is just one tool in your analytical arsenal. Relying solely on any single indicator can lead to incomplete conclusions. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by numerous factors, necessitating a holistic approach. Consider these additional elements when evaluating the market: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global inflation, interest rate policies, and geopolitical events profoundly affect investor risk appetite across all asset classes, including crypto. Regulatory Developments: New legislation or government stances on digital assets can significantly alter market sentiment and price trajectories. Technological Advancements: Innovations in blockchain technology, new project launches, or major network upgrades can generate positive sentiment and drive adoption. Fundamental Analysis: Thorough research into a crypto project’s utility, development team, tokenomics, and community remains critical for long-term investment success. By combining the sentiment from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with a broader understanding of market fundamentals and external influences, you can forge a more robust and resilient investment strategy. In conclusion, the current 44 reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals a period of caution and uncertainty in the crypto market. While “Fear” can be a challenging environment, it has historically presented opportunities for disciplined investors who look beyond short-term volatility. Use this index as a valuable guide, but always complement it with thorough research and a comprehensive understanding of the market’s diverse dynamics. Staying informed and making rational, rather than impulsive, decisions are your best assets in navigating the exciting, yet unpredictable, world of cryptocurrency.

For those of us tracking economic trends and their ripple effects on the cryptocurrency landscape, this movement is particularly noteworthy. It signals potential shifts that could influence everything from trade to digital asset valuations. What’s Behind the South Korean Won’s Recent Dip? On September 25, the South Korean won experienced a notable weakening, trading past 1,400 against the U.S. dollar. This marks the first time since August 1 that the currency has crossed this threshold, with the exchange rate settling around 1,401.98, according to data from TradingView. This movement isn’t just a number; it reflects underlying economic pressures that are impacting a major Asian economy. Such a shift often indicates a complex interplay of global and domestic factors. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone looking to make informed decisions in the current economic climate. Why is the South Korean Won Under Such Pressure? The recent depreciation of the South Korean won is not an isolated event. Several key factors are contributing to this trend: Aggressive U.S. Interest Rate Hikes: The U.S. Federal Reserve’s continued efforts to combat inflation by raising interest rates have significantly strengthened the U.S. dollar. This makes other currencies, including the won, relatively weaker. Global Economic Slowdown Fears: Concerns about a potential global recession are dampening demand for exports. As an export-driven economy, South Korea is particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in international trade. High Energy Import Costs: South Korea is a net importer of energy. Elevated global oil and gas prices mean the country needs more U.S. dollars to pay for these essential imports, increasing demand for USD and weakening the won. Domestic Economic Concerns: Local factors, such as persistent inflation and rising household debt, also contribute to economic uncertainty, which can put downward pressure on the national currency. These combined forces create a challenging environment for the South Korean won , making it susceptible to further volatility. How Does a Weaker South Korean Won Affect Crypto Investors? South Korea boasts one of the most active cryptocurrency markets globally. Therefore, a weakening South Korean won has direct implications for crypto investors in the region: Increased Cost of Stablecoins: For investors holding won, buying U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT or USDC becomes more expensive. This can affect trading strategies and hedging costs. Potential for Capital Flight: If local economic confidence erodes significantly, some investors might seek to move their assets out of the won into perceived safer havens, potentially including cryptocurrencies. However, this also carries risks. Reduced Purchasing Power: A weaker won means that Korean investors have less purchasing power when acquiring international crypto assets priced in USD or other stronger currencies. While a weaker currency can sometimes spur interest in alternative assets like crypto as a hedge, it also introduces additional layers of risk and complexity for investors. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the market. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for South Korean Won Holders In times of currency volatility, thoughtful planning and risk management become paramount. Here are some actionable insights for both traditional and crypto investors impacted by the movement of the South Korean won : Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider diversifying across different asset classes and geographies to mitigate risks associated with single-currency exposure. Monitor Global Indicators: Keep a close eye on global economic data, particularly U.S. inflation and interest rate decisions, as these significantly influence currency markets. Understand Stablecoin Mechanics: If you are a crypto investor, comprehend how stablecoins maintain their peg and the potential risks involved, especially during periods of high fiat currency volatility. Practice Prudent Risk Management: Avoid making impulsive decisions. Implement stop-loss orders, manage your position sizes, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Regularly consume reliable economic news and analysis. Knowledge is your best defense against market surprises. The financial landscape is always evolving, and being prepared helps investors adapt to changing conditions. Conclusion: Vigilance in a Volatile World The recent weakening of the South Korean won past 1,400 against the U.S. dollar serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of global financial markets. From aggressive central bank policies to geopolitical tensions and energy prices, numerous factors influence currency valuations and, by extension, the broader investment landscape, including cryptocurrencies. For investors, particularly those in South Korea and those trading with the won, vigilance and a clear understanding of these economic forces are essential. While challenges exist, informed decision-making and a well-thought-out strategy can help navigate these turbulent waters. Staying updated on economic trends and their potential impact on both traditional and digital assets remains a top priority. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when a currency ‘weakens’ against another? When a currency weakens, it means you need more units of that currency to buy one unit of another currency. For example, if the South Korean won weakens against the U.S. dollar, it takes more won to buy one dollar. Q2: How do U.S. interest rate hikes affect the South Korean won? Higher U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors seeking higher returns. This increases demand for the U.S. dollar, causing it to strengthen and other currencies, like the won, to weaken. Q3: Is a weaker South Korean won always bad for the economy? Not necessarily. While it makes imports more expensive, a weaker won can make a country’s exports more competitive on the global market, potentially boosting export-oriented industries. Q4: Should crypto investors in South Korea be concerned about the won’s depreciation? They should be aware. A weaker won increases the cost of acquiring U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and international crypto assets. It also adds a layer of currency risk to their portfolio, making careful risk management even more important. Q5: What is TradingView and why is it mentioned? TradingView is a popular charting platform and social network for traders and investors. It’s mentioned as the source of the exchange rate data, lending credibility and transparency to the reported figures. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

While SOL has potential for growth, its upside is quite modest when compared to some of the newer projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is now presale for $0.035, is making headlines for its lending-and-borrowing protocol with DeFi emphasis, set to provide real-world adoption and scale-fit utility. Mutuum Finance is available for $0.035 at presale level 6. The protocol has exceeded more than $16.2 million in funds raised from more than 16,550 holders. With significantly lower price, the majority of investors believe that MUTM can return up to 25x, and this would be one of the top choices for investors seeking more solid returns in the year 2025. Solana Price Prediction Solana (SOL) is fluctuating around $231.50, holding ground below the critical $245–$250 resistance point. Analysts note that SOL will need a clear break above this level to build momentum towards its $270–$300 level that has been projected for Q4. Failure to break through resistance could have the asset stuck in the between $220 and $250 range, and overall market sentiment will be the determiner of whether higher levels are an achievable target. On the other hand, new project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being heralded as having improved growth opportunities. Strong Presale Performance Mutuum Finance has hit Stage Six of presale, with tokens selling at $0.035 after experiencing a 16.17% price increase from the previous round. Investor demand remains strong, with more than 16,550 participants and more than $16.2 million raised in capital. To strengthen platform security, Mutuum Finance is introducing a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The vulnerabilities are categorized into four types, critical, major, minor, and low, in order to ensure proper detection and fixing. The protocol uses strict control on collateralized assets to safeguard the system and participants. Controls take the shape of definite collateral ratios, caps on lending, and limits on deposits. Positions that are undercollateralized are rapidly closed, and call penalties and remediation fees are charged to ensure systemic stability. Building an Efficient Platform Efficiency is ensured through the optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, especially in cases of overcollateralized credit. Reserve requirements offer a buffer to dampen market shocks, while additional reserves may be employed for risk-absorbing purposes with risky assets. Mutuum Finance’s overall goal is to fundamentally transform the DeFi model on the premises of long-term sustainability, reliability, and inclusiveness. The project is not only building a secure lending and borrowing platform but also opening up a new era where decentralized finance becomes more accessible to retail and institutional investors. To encourage early adoption as well as community building, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway contest in which 10 winners will get $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. This initiative highlights the project’s commitment to rewarding its supporters while driving awareness and participation across the ecosystem. A key pillar of its capital model, Mutuum Finance employs a dynamic, liquidity-driven interest rate mechanism. This system ensures lending and borrowing are always in balance with shifting market conditions. When there is plentiful capital on the platform, borrowing rates are kept deliberately low, encouraging more use of funds available and driving market activity. By contrast, if liquidity is constricted, the cost of borrowing increases, and that incentivizes existing borrowers to repay existing loans and draws in fresh deposits as well. This self-reinforcing process creates a better, more sustainable climate that protects user interests, moderates liquidity streams, and weakens the overall protocol’s exposure during both periods of calm and turmoil in the markets. MUTM’s Early-Stage Upside vs. SOL’s Consolidation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction as investors look beyond Solana’s (SOL) price surge to $300. At $0.035 in Stage 6, MUTM has raised $16.2M from 16,550+ holders, with analysts predicting up to 25x returns based on its lower market cap and strong DeFi utility. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, strong collateral governance, and a $100K giveaway, the project combines security, efficiency, and adoption-fueled growth. Whereas SOL builds strength around $231.50 for a breakout, MUTM offers early investors better upside. Lock-in Stage 6 tokens now before the price rises in the next phase.

This movement signals a potentially exciting shift in the market dynamics, drawing attention to altcoins and their performance against Bitcoin. For many crypto enthusiasts, this rise in the Altcoin Season Index is a compelling indicator worth watching closely. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Mean? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for anyone tracking the broader crypto market. Developed by CoinMarketCap, this index serves as a barometer for altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. It helps us gauge whether the market sentiment favors altcoins or if Bitcoin continues to dominate. Here’s how the Altcoin Season Index is calculated: It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Stablecoins and wrapped coins are intentionally excluded from this calculation to provide a clearer picture of genuine market movements. The performance of these top 100 coins is measured against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. An altcoin season is officially declared when 75% of these top coins outperform Bitcoin within that 90-day window. Conversely, if Bitcoin is the dominant performer, it’s considered a Bitcoin season. A reading closer to 100 on the Altcoin Season Index indicates a stronger, more pronounced altcoin season. Is a Full-Blown Altcoin Season on the Horizon? With the Altcoin Season Index now standing at 72, many are wondering if we are on the cusp of a full-fledged altcoin season. While 72 is an impressive figure and a strong indicator of growing altcoin strength, it’s just shy of the 75-point threshold required for an official declaration. However, this upward trend is undeniably positive for altcoin investors. This recent four-point increase suggests a noticeable shift in capital flows and investor interest. People are actively exploring opportunities beyond Bitcoin, indicating a broadening of the market. This momentum could easily push the index past the 75-mark, potentially ushering in a period where many altcoins see significant gains. Therefore, staying informed about the Altcoin Season Index becomes even more vital. Navigating the Potential Altcoin Season: Benefits and Challenges A rising Altcoin Season Index brings both exciting opportunities and inherent risks for investors. Understanding these aspects is key to making informed decisions in a dynamic market. Potential Benefits: Higher Returns: Altcoins often exhibit higher volatility and, consequently, can offer greater percentage gains compared to Bitcoin during an altcoin season. Diversification: Investing in a variety of altcoins can help diversify a crypto portfolio, reducing reliance on a single asset. Innovation Exposure: Many altcoins represent groundbreaking technologies and use cases, offering investors a chance to support and profit from future innovations. Potential Challenges: Increased Volatility: While offering higher returns, altcoins are also prone to more significant price swings, leading to higher risk. Research Intensive: Identifying promising altcoins requires extensive research into their utility, team, tokenomics, and community support. Liquidity Issues: Some smaller altcoins might have lower liquidity, making it harder to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. The current movement of the Altcoin Season Index highlights the need for a balanced approach. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts As the Altcoin Season Index climbs, here are some actionable insights for navigating the evolving crypto landscape: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on hype. Thoroughly research any altcoin before committing capital. Understand its whitepaper, development team, and community. Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your funds into one altcoin, consider spreading your investments across several promising projects. This strategy helps mitigate risk. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear entry and exit strategies, and consider using stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, technical analysis, and, of course, the Altcoin Season Index itself. Market conditions can change rapidly. Even with a positive trend in the index, a disciplined approach remains paramount for long-term success in the crypto space. The recent rise in the Altcoin Season Index to 72 is undoubtedly a thrilling development for the cryptocurrency market. It suggests a potential shift towards altcoin outperformance, offering exciting prospects for investors willing to explore beyond Bitcoin. While the 75% threshold for an official altcoin season is within reach, it’s crucial to approach this period with both enthusiasm and caution. Diligent research, strategic diversification, and robust risk management are your best allies in harnessing the potential of a burgeoning altcoin market. The journey ahead promises to be dynamic, and the Altcoin Season Index will continue to be a key guide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric created by CoinMarketCap that measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. How is an Altcoin Season officially declared? An Altcoin Season is declared if 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) outperform Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. What does a high Altcoin Season Index reading, like 72, imply? A high reading, such as 72, indicates that a significant majority of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. While not yet an official Altcoin Season (which requires 75), it suggests strong momentum and growing interest in altcoins. What’s the difference between an Altcoin Season and a Bitcoin Season? An Altcoin Season occurs when altcoins largely outperform Bitcoin. Conversely, a Bitcoin Season happens when Bitcoin’s performance surpasses that of most altcoins within the top 100. Should I invest in altcoins if the Altcoin Season Index is high? A high Altcoin Season Index can signal favorable conditions for altcoins, but it’s essential to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and manage risks effectively. Market conditions can change rapidly, so informed decisions are crucial. Did you find this article insightful?

52219401,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84318,1758762018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Repeats Technical Cycle, Analyst Sets Bullish Price Target",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-repeats-technical-cycle-analyst-sets-bullish-price-target/,"XRP has recently declined below the $3 threshold, now trading near $2.8 in line with the broader weakness across the cryptocurrency market. Despite this pullback, several analysts remain optimistic about its long-term trajectory. Among them, EGRAG Crypto has highlighted recurring historical price structures that could guide XRP’s next major movement. Based on past cycles, he projects two potential targets: $9.6 or $33, depending on how current conditions unfold. Historical Performance and Key Levels EGRAG’s assessment is based on the two-week chart, which tracks XRP’s performance from 2014 to date. His analysis focuses on the 21-period exponential moving average (EMA), which has repeatedly acted as a pivotal support level. #XRP – 2 Scenarios Based on Historical Price Action ($9.6 – $33): If you're not yet familiar with the most likely outcomes, it might be time to catch up! Here’s a closer look at two pivotal cycles in #XRP 's history. 21 EMA Historical Support Levels 2017 Cycle: #XRP … pic.twitter.com/oE1MAMhsXA — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 23, 2025 In the 2017 cycle, XRP tested the 21 EMA twice before launching into a rapid upward trend. That sequence culminated in a gain of approximately 1,610%, bringing the token to around $3.31 by January 2018. By contrast, the 2021 cycle unfolded differently due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple . In December 2020, XRP briefly lost support at the 21 EMA, but once the price reclaimed and retested the level, it advanced by about 414%, reaching close to $1.96 in April 2021. Current Setup and Possible Long-Term Scenarios EGRAG points out that June 2025 marked another retest of the 21 EMA, when XRP fell to roughly $1.9. He argues that this event could be the start of a major upward move similar to those seen in previous cycles. From this point, two outcomes appear likely. If conditions mirror the 2017 pattern, XRP could record another 1,610% increase, driving prices toward $33 . Alternatively, if market behavior resembles the 2021 cycle, the token could rise by about 414%, leading to a price near $9.6. In either case, the assumption is that the rally would begin from the $1.9 level observed during the June retest. At present, XRP is trading around $2.95, still facing resistance at $3.31, which coincides with its 2017 peak. Volume data during these retests suggests that investor participation is strong, reinforcing the importance of these price zones for determining the next trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short-Term Market Outlook While EGRAG emphasizes long-term potential, other analysts are monitoring near-term behavior. Market commentator DustyBC has described XRP’s four-hour chart as stagnant, suggesting that sideways trading may continue until the asset breaks above a defined buying zone. He recommends patience, noting that this strategy helps avoid premature entries. Conversely, Casi Trades holds a more bullish short-term view. She recently identified a double-bottom formation near $2.70 following a sharp drop that she attributes to excessive leverage rather than sustained selling. Since that decline, XRP has reclaimed the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement at $2.79, which is now serving as support. Casi anticipates a potential retest of $2.79, combined with a bullish divergence on the relative strength index. If confirmed, this could trigger a Wave 3 rally with projected targets at $4.00 and $4.40, aligning with the 2.618 and 3.618 Fibonacci extension levels. However, she cautions that a breakdown below $2.70 would undermine this setup and could redirect the price toward $2.58, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. XRP’s price action remains closely tied to historical patterns and key support levels. While long-term projections suggest potential targets of $9.6 or $33, short-term movement will depend on whether the token maintains critical support zones and overcomes near-term resistance.

However, it remains above the 200-day moving average at $0.735, signaling that while sellers dominate in the short and medium term, the longer trend is still supported. ADA's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Daily charts show oversold signals with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 36.6, a negative Commodity Channel Index (CCI), and near-zero Stochastic RSI levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Soak Up Trillions From China And Russia, Billionaire Predicts Despite this, downside pressure persists, with ADA likely consolidating between $0.768 and $0.790 in the coming sessions. Momentum indicators remain neutral, suggesting that any rebound could be limited unless buying volume strengthens. Cardano ETF Optimism and Roadmap Fuel Longer-Term Outlook While ADA struggles in the near term, longer-term fundamentals look stronger. Odds for a Cardano-based ETF approval have surged to 9%, a development that could lift market sentiment and drive institutional adoption. The Cardano Foundation’s new roadmap also supports a bullish case, with significant funding allocated to decentralized finance (DeFi), governance, and ecosystem growth. Whale transactions have increased, and major firms like Reliance Global have added ADA to their treasuries, signaling growing institutional confidence. These developments could help ADA break above critical resistance at $0.868, the Ichimoku Kijun level, which analysts view as the threshold for confirming a rebound. Until then, traders may see sideways consolidation or slight downside risk. Short-Term Consolidation, Long-Term Potential According to market expert Anton Kharitonov of Traders Union, ADA remains technically vulnerable. “As long as Cardano trades below major resistance, the upside case lacks credibility,” he noted, adding that reclaiming $0.868 is essential for any sustainable rebound. For now, ADA’s immediate price corridor remains narrow, with a low probability of a breakout in the next five days. However, the long-term picture is brighter, with forecasts suggesting a potential climb toward $1.20–$1.38 within the next 6–12 months, supported by ETF optimism and institutional demand.

Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a prominent crypto analyst, drew attention to this, stating that $2.8 is now the most important support level for the digital asset. He attached a chart from Glassnode highlighting how XRP holders are distributed across various realized price ranges, with a particular concentration at the $2.80 level. $2.80 is the most important support level for $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/6sCz11GR91 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 23, 2025 Understanding the Chart Data The chart shared by Martinez displays XRP’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), partitioned at its all-time high . It illustrates how large portions of XRP holdings are associated with different historical price levels. The data reveals that more than 2.1 billion XRP, representing approximately 3.32% of the supply, is tied to $2.8. This makes that level a key zone of support where significant buying interest has been established. Considering the overall structure, the chart shows multiple points where XRP has notable concentrations of realized prices. These include areas around $0.33, $0.6, $1.64, $1.93, and other levels closer to $3. However, the $2.8 level stands out as one of the largest concentrations near the higher range, which indicates that many investors entered at this point. What the Analysis Suggests for XRP XRP is trading at $2.85 after bouncing off the $2.80 support. Holding above this level would signal strong support from existing holders and create a foundation for further advances . On the other hand, failure to defend this level could expose XRP to renewed selling pressure and potentially trigger a test of lower realized price zones. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The focus on realized price distribution offers a unique perspective because it measures actual positions taken by market participants rather than just speculative chart patterns. This allows for a clearer understanding of where major groups of investors may act, whether through buying to defend their entry levels or selling to limit losses. Possible Next Steps for XRP Should XRP sustain momentum above $2.8, attention may shift to the next significant resistance areas identified on the chart. These levels cluster around $2.95 and above $3, where another wave of historical entries exists. A move toward these prices would likely test the conviction of holders who entered near XRP’s prior peaks. Analysts have also drawn attention to XRP’s peak of $3.65, predicting double-digit targets if the asset can surpass this level . How the market reacts at these levels will provide further clarity on whether XRP can establish a stronger base for growth.

CFTC Launches Initiative For Tokenized Collateral & Stablecoins In Derivatives As revealed in a press release , Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham has enacted an initiative for the use of tokenized collateral in derivatives markets. Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency, are set to play a role in the effort. “The public has spoken: tokenized markets are here, and they are the future,” said Pham. “For years I have said that collateral management is the ‘killer app’ for stablecoins in markets.” The initiative is part of CFTC’s “ Crypto Sprint ” announced at the start of August. Pham introduced it to implement recommendations from the President’s Working Group report on digital assets. The push mirrors the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) “ Project Crypto .” The President’s Working Group report asked the CFTC to “provide guidance on the adoption of tokenized non-cash collateral as regulatory margin.” The latest move comes in response to this recommendation and also builds on the regulator’s Crypto CEO Forum held back in February 2025. The Acting Chairman noted: At our historic Crypto CEO Forum, we discussed how innovation and blockchain technology will drive progress in derivatives markets, especially for modernization of collateral management and greater capital efficiency. The regulator has invited interested stakeholders to provide written feedback and suggestions on its website regarding the use of stablecoins as collateral in derivatives markets by October 20th. “The CFTC continues to move full speed ahead at the cutting edge of responsible innovation, and I appreciate the support of our industry partners,” added Pham. Stablecoins have been enjoying capital inflows recently, with their combined market cap sitting at the $294 billion mark today, a new all-time high (ATH). Below is a chart from DeFiLlama that shows how the market cap of these cryptocurrencies has changed during the last few years. From the graph, it’s visible that stablecoins have been in a phase of growth since 2024, with inflows only accelerating recently. During the past week alone, the market cap of these fiat-tied tokens has increased by over $4 billion. In terms of the individual coins, Tether’s USDT continues to be the most dominant, with its market cap of $173 billion accounting for almost 59% of the sector. Circle’s USDC ranks second with a market cap of $73 billion, significantly below USDT, but nonetheless dominant in its own right considering its lead over the third largest stablecoin. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $112,800, down more than 3% over the last week.",Stablecoin|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|CFTC|CFTC Stablecoins|Stablecoins|Stables,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-25 01:00:51

One of the main arguments favoring this amendment is that it is required to spur investor interest and establish new business models. Representative Lee Jeong-moon will guide the task force’s work. He will work with Min Byoung-dug, the party’s Digital Asset Committee Chair, who has always insisted that stablecoins drive the next phase of financial innovation. The Democratic Party has offered a significant contrast to the previous laws, which focused on the exchanges’ activity and ensured that no user funds would be lost to hacking. This time, the party says it would instead like to see the industry grow while keeping a clear foundation for investor activity. Task force engages regulators and industry The lawmakers have reportedly cooperated with the most significant institutions, asking the ministries, the Financial Services Commission, and the Financial Supervisory Service to submit their proposals on what the new law should specifically contain. A representative of the Bank of Korea has also been invited to share his outlook on the matter. The task force seeks to involve the private sector, not just regulators. Organizers are also expected to seek guidance from crypto exchanges, fintech startups, and venture capital firms. There will also be a panel of advisors comprised of industry experts. Lee Jeong-moon said they were seeking to consider the digital asset market as a new way for people to carry out transactions. He added that the focus was on policies that would generate future growth. The DP has also expressed support for a ruling by the government to end the proscription of venture capital investments to crypto companies. Legislators say new funding could come soon to startups hamstrung by tight banking restrictions. Lee Jeong-moon said they were seeking to consider the digital asset market as a new way for people to carry out transactions. He added that the focus was on policies that would generate future growth. Lawmakers balance innovation with caution South Korea’s push for pro-crypto laws comes as debate over stablecoins heats up, with lawmakers eyeing won-based tokens to rival dollar-backed assets. In July, a similar bill allowing non-financial firms to issue won-denominated stablecoins was introduced in parliament. It was a huge step in opening Korea’s financial world. But the Bank of Korea has been cautious. This month, Deputy Governor Kim Woong-seok said regulated banks should be allowed to issue stablecoins gradually. He maintained that a more measured rollout would safeguard financial stability. The central bank has subsequently established a crypto oversight unit to help coordinate regulation. Analysts say the DP’s push for swift innovation could collide with the central bank’s conservative approach. The months ahead may determine whether South Korea can reconcile growth and safety. South Korea is one of the world’s most active crypto markets. Already among Asia’s top performers, South Korea boasts millions of retail investors who trade daily. The government has frequently been repressive, but new measures indicate a move from simply policing and supporting the industry. If the DP manages to push through new legislation by year-end, South Korea could be among the earliest major economies to enact a full-fledged stablecoin regime. Not only would this protect domestic firms, but it could also work to reinforce the country in the global digital economy. Get seen where it counts.

This substantial holding points towards a deliberate strategy to build a significant position in ASTER. Long-Term Vision: Institutional players often withdraw assets for long-term holding, staking, or to utilize them within their own ecosystem for various financial products. Reduced Selling Pressure: Assets held off-exchange are less likely to be immediately sold, potentially easing short-term selling pressure on the token.

Recently, a significant development in the stablecoin space caught attention, involving Chinese fintech firm AnchorX and its much-anticipated yuan stablecoin , AxCNH. This clarification is not just a minor detail; it’s a crucial piece of information shaping how we understand the future of digital currencies and their global adoption. Clarifying the Yuan Stablecoin ‘s True Home: Kazakhstan, Not Hong Kong There was a ripple of confusion across the crypto landscape regarding the operational base of AnchorX’s AxCNH. Initially, various media outlets reported that this new yuan stablecoin was being issued out of Hong Kong. However, AnchorX has stepped forward to set the record straight and provide essential clarity. The company officially clarified that AxCNH, which is pegged to the Chinese yuan, operates under a license granted by Kazakhstan’s Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA). This statement directly addresses and corrects earlier misinformation, which had also led the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to deny any involvement. Initial Reports: Claimed Hong Kong issuance, leading to market uncertainty. AnchorX’s Clarification: Officially licensed by AFSA in Kazakhstan, ensuring transparent operations. HKMA’s Stance: Denied any connection to AxCNH’s issuance, reinforcing the need for accurate reporting. AnchorX secured the necessary approval to issue this innovative yuan stablecoin from Kazakhstan back in February. This move highlights a strategic choice in jurisdiction, underscoring the importance of a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in an increasingly complex global financial environment. Why Does the Yuan Stablecoin ‘s Jurisdiction Matter So Much? You might wonder, why is the exact licensing location for a yuan stablecoin such a big deal? The answer lies in trust, regulation, and the stability of the digital asset itself. The jurisdiction dictates the legal and operational environment in which the stablecoin functions, directly impacting its reliability and acceptance. Robust regulatory oversight provides several key benefits: Investor Protection: Clear rules and frameworks safeguard users from potential risks and fraudulent activities. Operational Transparency: Licensed entities often face stricter reporting requirements, ensuring accountability. Market Integrity: A well-regulated environment fosters confidence among users and institutions, promoting long-term stability. For a stablecoin like AxCNH, which aims to maintain a stable value against a major fiat currency like the yuan, robust regulatory backing is absolutely essential. It assures users that the asset is properly collateralized and that its operations are subject to scrutiny by a recognized financial authority, thereby building crucial trust. Kazakhstan’s AFSA: A Hub for Yuan Stablecoin Innovation? Kazakhstan, through its Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA), has been actively positioning itself as a forward-thinking jurisdiction for fintech and digital assets. AFSA operates within the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), which boasts an independent legal system based on English common law, providing a familiar and reliable framework for international businesses. This environment offers a distinct advantage for companies looking to innovate in the crypto space with regulatory certainty. AnchorX’s decision to seek approval for its yuan stablecoin here is a testament to AFSA’s progressive approach to digital asset licensing, signaling its commitment to fostering innovation within a regulated ecosystem. The February approval for AxCNH signifies AFSA’s commitment to fostering a regulated yet innovative ecosystem for digital currencies. This move could potentially attract other fintech firms seeking clear guidelines for launching similar financial products, establishing Kazakhstan as a key player in the global digital finance landscape. The Broader Implications of a Licensed Yuan Stablecoin The emergence of a properly licensed yuan stablecoin like AxCNH carries significant implications beyond just AnchorX. Stablecoins are crucial bridges between traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies, offering much-needed price stability in a volatile market. A yuan-pegged stablecoin can facilitate easier cross-border transactions involving the Chinese currency, potentially reducing friction and costs for businesses and individuals alike. It also opens new avenues for liquidity and financial innovation within the digital asset ecosystem, enhancing global connectivity. Potential impacts of AxCNH and similar stablecoins include: Enhanced efficiency for international trade and remittances, making global payments faster and cheaper. Increased adoption of digital currencies for everyday transactions, bridging the gap between crypto and mainstream commerce. Greater integration of the Chinese yuan into the global digital economy, reflecting its growing international importance. As the digital finance landscape matures, the demand for stable, regulated digital assets will only grow. AnchorX’s strategic licensing in Kazakhstan sets a precedent for how other global currencies might find their digital counterparts within clear, regulated frameworks, paving the way for a more integrated financial future. AnchorX’s clear statement regarding the licensing of its AxCNH yuan stablecoin in Kazakhstan is a pivotal moment for regulatory clarity in the crypto world. It underscores the critical importance of accurate information and proper jurisdictional backing for stablecoins. This development not only provides a stable digital asset pegged to the yuan but also highlights Kazakhstan’s growing role as a significant player in the regulated digital finance sector. As the industry continues to evolve, such transparent and compliant initiatives will be key to fostering trust and widespread adoption, ensuring a more secure and predictable digital financial ecosystem for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is AxCNH? AxCNH is a yuan stablecoin launched by the Chinese fintech firm AnchorX, meaning its value is pegged to the Chinese yuan (CNH). Q2: Where is AnchorX’s yuan stablecoin officially licensed? AnchorX’s yuan stablecoin , AxCNH, is officially licensed and issued under the regulatory oversight of Kazakhstan’s Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA). Q3: Why was there confusion about AxCNH’s licensing? Initial media reports incorrectly stated that the yuan stablecoin was issued in Hong Kong, a claim later denied by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and clarified by AnchorX. Q4: What is the significance of AFSA’s licensing for AxCNH? AFSA’s licensing provides regulatory clarity, investor protection, and operational transparency for AxCNH, establishing a trusted framework for the yuan stablecoin ‘s operations within a recognized financial center. Q5: How does a yuan-pegged stablecoin benefit the crypto market? A yuan stablecoin can facilitate more efficient cross-border transactions involving the Chinese currency, enhance liquidity in the digital asset ecosystem, and further integrate the yuan into the global digital economy.

Following a challenging security incident, UXLINK has delivered some urgent news: a dedicated UXLINK token swap portal is set to open its doors for on-chain users within the next five business days. This is a crucial step towards restoring stability and confidence for all involved. What Exactly Happened with UXLINK, and Why the Swap? Recently, UXLINK faced a significant hacking incident that impacted its token ecosystem. Such events can be unsettling for any project and its community, raising immediate concerns about asset security. In response, UXLINK moved swiftly. The team announced on X that they have successfully deployed a new UXLINK smart contract. Furthermore, they submitted a detailed incident report and a comprehensive migration plan to key regulatory bodies, including South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) and other major exchanges. The core reason for this rapid action and the upcoming UXLINK token swap is to isolate the compromised tokens and transition users to a secure, new contract. This ensures that the integrity of the UXLINK ecosystem is maintained. How Will the UXLINK Token Swap Portal Work for You? Understanding the process of the UXLINK token swap is key for all legitimate token holders. UXLINK has outlined a clear and straightforward plan to facilitate this transition: One-to-One Exchange: All existing, legitimate circulating UXLINK tokens will be swapped for new tokens on a direct one-to-one basis. This means your holdings will maintain their value relative to the new tokens. Exclusion of Illicit Tokens: A critical aspect of this recovery is that tokens illicitly issued by the hacker will be specifically excluded from the swap process. This prevents the attacker from profiting from their actions and protects the legitimate supply. Official Portal: The swap will occur through a dedicated portal. It is absolutely vital that users only engage with this official platform to perform their token swap. Always verify the source to avoid phishing attempts. This systematic approach aims to ensure a fair and secure migration for the entire community, paving the way for a more robust UXLINK going forward. Beyond the Swap: Addressing Stolen Assets and Future Compensation While the UXLINK token swap addresses the immediate need for a secure token, the incident also involved stolen assets. UXLINK has been proactive in tackling this challenge: Frozen Assets: The project confirmed that most of the stolen tokens have been successfully frozen. This is a significant achievement in limiting the hacker’s ability to liquidate or further distribute the illicitly obtained assets. Ongoing Monitoring: Despite freezing efforts, UXLINK acknowledged that some stolen tokens are still being traded. This highlights the persistent challenges in tracking and recovering digital assets post-hack. Compensation Plan: For victims who have suffered losses due to the hack, UXLINK has committed to arranging a separate compensation plan. Details on this plan will be provided in due course, demonstrating the project’s dedication to its community members affected by the incident. These measures collectively form UXLINK’s strategy for comprehensive recovery and support for its user base. Securing Your Assets: Your Role in the UXLINK Token Swap As UXLINK prepares for this crucial recovery phase, user vigilance is paramount. To ensure a smooth and secure UXLINK token swap , consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow UXLINK’s official channels (like their X account) for the exact date and link to the token swap portal. Do not rely on unofficial sources. Verify Links: Before clicking any links related to the swap, double-check that they are from UXLINK’s verified official sources. Scammers often create fake portals. Be Patient: The swap process will be clearly communicated. There is no need to rush or panic. Take your time to understand the instructions before proceeding. Never Share Private Keys: Legitimate platforms will never ask for your private keys or seed phrases. Be extremely cautious of any request for this information. By taking these precautions, you can help protect your assets during this critical period. The opening of the UXLINK token swap portal marks a pivotal moment for the project and its community. It signifies a robust response to a challenging incident, demonstrating UXLINK’s commitment to security and user trust. While the path to full recovery can be complex, this proactive step provides a clear direction forward. Users are encouraged to stay informed through official channels and participate in the swap to secure their assets and support UXLINK’s journey towards a stronger, more resilient future.

52221288,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=818467,1758764452,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52221288.jpeg,UK's HSBC uses IBM quantum chip to boost bond price forecasts by 34%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/hsbc-ibm-quantum-chip-bond-price-forecasts/,"HSBC has claimed a global first in financial tech after using IBM’s quantum chip to increase bond price prediction accuracy by 34%, according to information provided by the bank on Thursday. The trial, done with IBM’s Heron quantum processor, ran real, anonymized European bond trading data through the system, not fake models or simulations, and resulted in a major accuracy jump. That’s the first time any bank has used quantum to process real trading data at full scale. The test didn’t involve live trades, but it wasn’t theoretical. HSBC confirmed it was a production-scale demonstration. That means this wasn’t just another one of those tech tests that sit in a sandbox forever. This was finance in the wild, just without actual money moving. The bank believes this step sets the tone for how quantum will start creeping into daily financial systems worldwide. Banks build teams to extract real-world results The quantum test focused on over-the-counter bond markets, where trades happen privately between two firms, no exchange involved. These are harder to predict due to low transparency and fragmented data. That’s exactly why HSBC picked this use case. IBM’s Heron processor, the latest in its quantum lineup, handled the task by running calculations in parallel, unlike classical chips that go line by line. Philip Intallura, HSBC’s head of quantum tech, said , “Is this a ‘Sputnik moment’ for quantum? My instinct is yes.” He pointed to how this milestone could trigger a wave of fast-moving adoption. “It will create a flurry of activity,” Philip added, hinting that rivals will rush to close the gap. Josh Freeland, HSBC’s global head of algo credit trading, gave a glimpse into what was happening behind the scenes. He said the trial involved 16 experts (physicists, machine learning engineers, AI specialists) who were “working around the clock” to replicate what the chip had done. “If you could get something like this result every day, that would be quite something,” Josh said. He explained that in trading, even a single-digit gain, when repeated thousands of times, can move the needle in a big way. This tech push isn’t limited to HSBC. Other big names like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup are also pouring resources into quantum. In March, JPMorgan said it created and validated truly random numbers with a quantum computer built by Quantinuum. The bank claims this tech will help improve encryption, security, and maybe even trading systems. That work was later published in Nature, a top science journal. Meanwhile, Google’s Willow quantum chip, separate from the HSBC effort, solved a specific mathematical task in five minutes that classical supercomputers couldn’t solve in the entire age of the universe. That kind of speed is what has the financial sector throwing billions into quantum development, even if widespread rollout still seems distant. McKinsey expects banks to chase quantum profits Quantum revenue is expected to skyrocket to $72 billion in the next ten years, up from just $4 billion last year, according to consulting firm McKinsey. The report, published in June, lists finance alongside industries like life sciences and chemicals as key drivers. Henning Soller, who leads McKinsey’s quantum research in Frankfurt, said the tech’s value is clearest when it’s applied to pricing predictions. In finance, every percentage counts. “If one bank is able to start using quantum computing to develop a program, then the others will be developing it the next day and people will not sleep until they have it,” said Miklos Dietz, McKinsey’s senior partner in Vancouver. He didn’t hold back on what’s coming next. “When it comes, it will be explosive.” HSBC isn’t pretending the tech is perfect yet. But it believes it’s on the edge of something real. Philip said the work is proof that banks don’t have to wait five or ten years to see results. “We have great confidence we are on the cusp of a new frontier of computing in financial services, rather than something that is far away in the future.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

According to Bloomberg calculations, central and local authorities have only 16% — some 2.2 trillion yuan ($309 billion) — of their annual quota remaining, paving the way for the slackest fourth-quarter net supply since 2022. Bond supply shrinks as Beijing front-loads issuance The decline in issuance may help bring some balance and confidence to the bond markets, whose investors have become skittish with a proposal on the table to tax investment income and raise redemption fees for short-term funds. Yields betray the warning: The 10-year benchmark rate has risen 23 basis points this quarter, to roughly 1.88% as of Tuesday. “The significant supply shrinkage ahead will benefit market sentiment and help curb the ascent in bond yields,” said Zhou Guannan, analyst at Huachuang Securities, who expects the 10-year yield to fall to 1.7% by year-end. Beijing front-loaded much of its 2025 bond issuance to cushion a faltering economy, persistent property troubles, and escalating trade frictions following US tariff hikes. Bloomberg data show that bond sales in the first half of the year outpaced levels seen in the same period over the past three years. Easing pressure offers relief to skittish investors Officials say they favor a strategy of acting early, Finance Minister Lan Fo’an said this month, and wanted to seize the critical window,” and issue their policies decisively in one single action. Bloomberg compiled data that show that local governments have already issued almost all of their 2 trillion yuan quotas for special refinancing bonds to replace off-balance-sheet debt. Several pending deals are about to be completed, as the central government is scheduled to release its final tranche of 1.3 trillion yuan in ultra-long special sovereign bonds on Oct. 10, according to its published schedule. As the “predictable supply from the special bonds concludes, the market is better able to absorb the remaining, more regular issuance,” said Wei Li, head of multi-asset investments at BNP Paribas Securities (China). With supply expected to ease, Beijing may be able to expand debt programs and increase the bond quota — as it had done in recent years — if growth lags its target of about 5%. However, economists are expecting only modest steps, as China has already pushed up its annual budget deficit to a decade high in response to lingering economic problems. China’s fiscal strategy stands apart from global peers Some investors are adjusting allocations. U-Shine Private Equity FD Mgt Co., which holds one of the biggest caches of 30-year sovereign notes, is gradually adding to its position as yields will slide on better supply dynamics and a potential rate cut, said Xu Yongbin, co-chief investment officer. Market expectations for reduced bond supply stand in contrast to those of developed economies. In the US, Japan, and Europe, longer-dated bond yields have soared as investor concerns mount over fiscal sustainability and widening budget deficits. According to BNP’s Li, China’s fiscal and supply outlook looks stronger than that of many developed markets, with the government taking a cautious approach that prioritizes optimizing existing funds instead of further expanding debt.

Recently, the GAIN token community experienced a **devastating token exploit** that saw an attacker make off with a significant sum, leaving investors reeling. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the ever-present security challenges within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. What Exactly Happened in This GAIN Token Exploit? Approximately two hours before the news broke, an attacker successfully executed an unauthorized mint of five billion GAIN tokens. This wasn’t just a small transaction; it was a massive injection of new tokens into the market without proper authorization. Following this illicit mint, the attacker promptly sold these newly created tokens, triggering a dramatic chain of events. Massive Price Plunge: The sudden influx and sale of five billion GAIN tokens caused the token’s price to plummet by an alarming 95%. This rapid depreciation wiped out significant value for legitimate holders. Significant Profit: On-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa confirmed that the attacker secured a staggering $3.01 million in profit from this dump. Funds Transfer: To obscure their tracks and move the illicit gains, the attacker is reportedly transferring these funds to other major networks, including Solana and Ethereum, utilizing deBridge for cross-chain transactions. It’s worth noting that Binance Alpha had only recently added GAIN to its listings on September 24, making the timing of this **token exploit** particularly unfortunate for new investors. Understanding the Mechanics: How Does an Unauthorized Token Exploit Occur? An unauthorized mint is a critical vulnerability, often stemming from flaws in a smart contract’s code. In essence, the attacker found a way to bypass the intended minting controls, allowing them to create new tokens out of thin air. This is akin to a counterfeiter printing money without the central bank’s approval, severely devaluing the legitimate currency. The core issue typically lies in: Access Control Weaknesses: The smart contract might have insufficient checks to prevent unauthorized accounts from calling the minting function. Re-entrancy or Logic Bugs: Complex interactions within the contract could be exploited to trick it into minting more tokens than allowed. Owner Key Compromise: Though less common for minting exploits, a compromised private key of the contract owner could also grant minting privileges. Such a **token exploit** highlights the absolute necessity of rigorous smart contract audits and continuous security monitoring for any DeFi project. Safeguarding Your Assets: Lessons from the GAIN Token Exploit While project developers bear the primary responsibility for securing their protocols, individual investors also have a role to play in protecting their assets. The GAIN incident offers valuable lessons: Perform Thorough Due Diligence: Before investing in any new token, especially in the volatile DeFi space, research the project’s team, its smart contract audit reports, and its community. Look for transparency and a track record of security. Understand the Risks: DeFi is an innovative but high-risk environment. Be aware that even audited projects can have undiscovered vulnerabilities. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Monitor On-Chain Activity: Tools and analysts like ai_9684xtpa provide crucial insights. Following reputable on-chain monitors can offer early warnings of suspicious activities. The Broader Impact of a Token Exploit on DeFi Trust Every **token exploit** like the one affecting GAIN chips away at investor confidence in the broader DeFi ecosystem. These incidents can deter new users and capital, slowing down innovation and adoption. Projects must prioritize security, implementing multi-layered defenses and robust incident response plans. Moreover, the ease with which funds can be transferred across networks via bridges like deBridge, while a benefit for liquidity, also presents a challenge for tracking and recovering stolen assets. Collaboration between exchanges, blockchain analytics firms, and law enforcement becomes paramount in such scenarios. The GAIN token incident is a somber reminder that the promise of decentralization comes with significant security responsibilities. As the crypto space matures, the industry must collectively work towards creating more resilient and secure protocols to prevent future **token exploit** events and protect investor interests.

What exactly happened to the GAIN token? An attacker performed an unauthorized mint of 5 billion GAIN tokens, then immediately sold them. This caused the token’s price to crash by 95%. 2. How much profit did the attacker make from this token exploit? The attacker secured approximately $3.01 million in profit from selling the illicitly minted GAIN tokens. 3. What does “unauthorized mint” mean in the context of a token exploit? An unauthorized mint occurs when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in a smart contract to create new tokens without proper permission or beyond the intended supply limits, effectively printing money out of thin air. 4. How can I protect my crypto assets from similar token exploits? Always conduct thorough due diligence on projects, check for reputable smart contract audits, understand the inherent risks of DeFi, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay informed by following on-chain analytics and security alerts. 5. Are the stolen GAIN funds recoverable? While blockchain transactions are public, recovering stolen funds is often challenging due to the attacker’s use of cross-chain bridges (like deBridge to Solana and Ethereum) and various obfuscation techniques. Recovery efforts typically require collaboration between affected projects, exchanges, and law enforcement. Did you find this article informative?

The committee confirmed the date in a notice first reported by Eleanor Terrett, and witnesses lined up include Jason Somensatto, Policy Director at Coin Center; Andrea S. Kramer, founding member of ASKramer Law; Lawrence Zlatkin, Vice President of Taxation at Coinbase; and Annette Nellen, Chair of the Digital Asset Taxation Working Group under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. This hearing is meant to address a problem that’s pissed off crypto users for years, which is why every small crypto transaction, even a few dollars, triggers a tax headache. The Senate is being pushed to finally look at de minimis exemptions, which would let people use crypto for daily stuff (like grabbing a coffee) without reporting every damn thing to the IRS. Trump administration backs small crypto tax relief Cryptopolitan reported back in July that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt had said that the Trump administration still wants to push through the de minimis exemption in upcoming laws. “The president did signal his support for de minimis exemption for crypto and the administration continues to be in support of that,” Karoline said. She explained that right now, using crypto for basic purchases is too complicated because of tax rules, but a change could make everyday payments smoother. “We are definitely receptive to it to make crypto payments easier and more efficient for those who seek to use crypto as simple as buying a cup of coffee — of course, right now, that cannot happen, but with the de minimis exemption perhaps it could in the future.” Karoline also revealed that President Trump plans to host a signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-focused bill expected to pass soon. That bill is part of his administration’s broader goal to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the world.” The Senate has already tried and failed to deal with this issue before. In 2020, two Democratic lawmakers proposed the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act, which aimed to ignore tax on crypto gains below $200. It didn’t even make it to a vote. A similar version in 2022 also died on the floor. Then came a broader bill in 2025 called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which covered everything from taxes to border control. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming, tried to get a crypto exemption added in for gains under $300, but that proposal got scrapped before the final bill passed. President Trump signed it into law on July 4 without the crypto language attached. Right now, the IRS says every single crypto transaction must be reported, even if there’s no gain or the amount is tiny. If you spend $5 of bitcoin, that’s a taxable event. The idea behind the de minimis exemption is to cut through that nonsense and give users room to breathe. But it hasn’t been easy. Lawmakers face real obstacles. First, the federal government depends on tax income. If it suddenly lets millions of small crypto transactions go untaxed, that means less money coming in. And there’s no sign yet of how they’ll offset that shortfall. Even with strong voices like Cynthia and Jason in the room, the Senate still hasn’t landed on a solution. October 1 might give them a chance to do something useful. Or it might be another meeting where everyone talks and nothing happens. Get seen where it counts.

The agreement , known as the Canada-Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), was signed in Ottawa on Wednesday by Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. It is Canada’s first bilateral trade agreement with an ASEAN country, so it is a historic milestone for both countries. The agreement comes as both countries try diversifying trade in light of global uncertainty. Skyrocketing US tariffs and friction with China have made new economic alliances more urgent than ever. Under the agreement, more than 95% of Canada’s exports to Indonesia will be duty-free when the deal is fully implemented. It will provide Canadian businesses, from farmers to clean energy developers, with new access to one of the fastest-growing markets in Asia. The agricultural sector will be the first beneficiary, according to Canada’s Trade Minister Maninder Sidhu. Canadian wheat, soybeans, and potash are already going to Indonesia, but the agreement will clear more room for processed foods, high-tech agri-products, and value-added goods. Sidhu told reporters that the opportunities created by the deal cut across sectors, ranging from agriculture to energy. He explained that Indonesia’s population of 280 million makes it a massive market that Canadian companies are eager to serve. And the deal opens the door to investment in nuclear power. Canada’s technology in small modular reactors could even be used to help Indonesia expand its power and, at the same time, keep a lid on emissions. Indonesia secures access and investment growth Beyond goods, the CEPA establishes rules for digital trade and intellectual property. Officials say it will provide an easier and more predictable environment for Canadian technology multinationals to do business in Southeast Asia. Canada’s Global Affairs department reported last year that Indonesia was the country’s largest export market in Southeast Asia and its second-biggest destination for known direct investment in the region. Export Development Canada is now preparing to provide up to CAD 825 million in financing to the Indonesia Investment Authority. This is expected to assist in financing large-scale projects in infrastructure, energy, and digital industries, EDC vice-president Franco Sciannamblo said. The business community is also pleased to note that a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the Business Council of Canada and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to help companies from both countries to benefit from trade initiatives. Canada pursues broader strategy in Asia This CEPA agreement is part of a larger Canadian strategy for Asia. Ottawa, which takes three-quarters of Canada’s exports, has taken steps to conclude trade agreements with Asian countries outside of China to diminish US dependence. In addition to Indonesia, Canada is considering a partnership with ASEAN to launch a regional agreement over time. Canadian officials emphasized that ASEAN’s closer ties can help strengthen Canada’s position in one of the globe’s fastest-expanding areas. Meanwhile, Indonesia is carving out its place in the world. Just this week, Jakarta announced that a nearly decade-long trade negotiation with the European Union had been completed . The EU and Canada deals represent a dramatic shift in Indonesia’s trade strategy as it seeks to assert itself as a linchpin of global supply chains. The CEPA and similar ones will not become effective immediately. The deal requires domestic ratification in both countries for it to take effect. The official hopes to complete this process by 2026. Once it does, trade between the two nations, valued at some $4 billion last year, is anticipated to increase sharply. Analysts said the deal could catalyze a new wave of Canadian businesses in Asia and increase market access for Indonesian goods in North America.

This milestone marks the beginning of a broader expansion for the XRP Ledger, positioning it as a serious player in the race to blend global liquidity with everyday usability. Why A Native Stablecoin Matters For XRP The recent launch of the first native stablecoin for XRP on the Flare Network marks a significant development for the XRP ecosystem. Onur, a trader and ambassador to NEARProtocol and Somnia_Network, has mentioned on X that the new stablecoin is designed to provide extra utility for XRP and create new liquidity rails for holders. It is worth noting that this initiative is part of Flare Network’s broader strategy to expand the utility of FAssets adoption. Related Reading: XRP Price Stability Signals Opportunity – Is a Fresh Breakout on the Horizon? Onur also drew attention to the stablecoin design, which is based on a battle-tested collateralized Debt position (CDP) and stability pool model. He also sees this as a first step toward a more self-sustaining DeFi layer on Flare, where liquidity is generated natively rather than depending solely on external assets. Onur concludes by expressing his curiosity about the level of demand from XRP holders for liquidity without selling for this new product. Based on a new report highlighted by a technical analyst, ALLINCRYPTO, Ripple is positioning the XRP Ledger as a top-tier platform for institutional DeFi. In addition, the report reveals significant milestones, including securing over $1 billion in monthly stablecoin volume and ranking among the top real-world asset tokenization activities. Meanwhile, the report also confirms that zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are currently being developed for the XRPL to strike a balance between user privacy, regulatory compliance, and scalability. Major Analysts Are Now Targeting XRP An Italian crypto expert, Fabio Zuccara, has drawn attention to a shift in the market’s perception of XRP, referencing bold price predictions from major market voices on Wall Street. These forecasts, which place XRP’s potential value between $10,000 and $35,000, are not mere random speculation. Related Reading: $480 Million In 2 Weeks? XRP Whale Movements Could Reveal The Next Price Direction Zuccara’s core argument is that the adoption of XRPL for RWAs is poised for an explosion. He points to the $653.39 trillion global real estate market, which is preparing to migrate onto the XRPL through Real token. The token was launched with a phase one supply of just 100 million tokens, with a remarkable 80% already burned. Specifically, this extreme scarcity creates the foundation for a massive supply squeeze. Zuccara illustrates this with a compelling calculation that if a mere 1% of the $650 trillion market flows through the XRPL, the value of the Real token could surge from its current price of $0.023 to $64,500. However, this kind of supply shock could unfold overnight, positioning the REAL Token as the premier RWA and DeFi asset on the XRP Ledger.

A recently published Bitcoin “cheat code,” by a crypto strategist, points to cyclical markers that have perfectly aligned with every major rally in the past. With BTC currently trading above $112,500, traders are watching closely as the same setup that triggered explosive runs in previous bull markets comes back into play. A Closer Look At The Bitcoin “Cheat Code” Crypto strategist, CrypFlow, shared a new technical analysis of Bitcoin in an X social media post on Monday. The analysis focuses on the Bitcoin (2M) SNAB Relative Strength Index (RSI) chart, which he describes as the core “cheat code” for identifying cycle tops and bottoms. He explained that the 73 level on this indicator has been the heartbeat of every major Bitcoin bull market move since 2013. When the RSI is below 73, it has historically acted as resistance, preventing BTC from moving higher. But once Bitcoin reclaimed that level, the RSI transformed into powerful support, triggering massive rallies that culminated in new all-time highs . Every cycle from 2013, 2017, and 2021 followed the same rhythm: a reclaim of the 73 level, a sustained rally to fresh highs, and eventually a breakdown from the extreme purple line near the 98 level that signaled the ultimate cycle top . CrypFlow stated that the current market cycle appears to be repeating this pattern, with the same SNAB RSI indicator flashing for Bitcoin. After previously forming a double bottom , the cryptocurrency surged to reclaim the critical level, mirroring setups from past bull market cycles. Looking ahead, the crypto strategist confirms that BTC is yet to reach its final cycle top, despite its record-breaking run and new ATH this year . As with past bull cycles, the final exhaustion point is expected only when RSI loses strength from its overheated levels near 98. Until then, the analyst’s confidence in his Bitcoin cheat code remains high, with signals still pointing to significant upside potential. Bollinger Band Squeeze And RSI Cross Spark Momentum Setup In a follow-up analysis, CrypFlow highlighted another recurring chart signal—the Bitcoin (1W) Bollinger Bands squeeze combined with a bullish stochastic RSI cross. This pairing has reportedly been a reliable trigger point for Bitcoin’s upward momentum throughout the current cycle. Historically, the pattern begins when the Bollinger Bands tighten around the price, indicating reduced volatility and an increased likelihood of a breakout. Each time this squeeze has coincided with a bullish stochastic RSI cross , CryptoFlow notes that Bitcoin has launched into a fresh upward swing. This was the case during previous surges from mid-2023 through 2025, with each squeeze setting the stage for significant price rallies. Right now, the setup is flashing once again. CrypFlow highlights that Bollinger Bands have compressed, and the stochastic RSI has just confirmed another bullish cross. He argues that this setup has held throughout the current cycle, and its reappearance signals that momentum is about to accelerate once again. If history repeats, BTC may be on the verge of another explosive squeeze that drives it to fresh ATHs.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bollinger bands|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CrypFlow|relative strength index|SNAB RSI|Stochastic RSI,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-25 02:00:33

From late 2023 through mid 2025, the region’s on-chain value received rose sharply, climbing from about $81b a month in mid 2022 to a peak near $244b in Dec. 2024, and holding above $185b per month this year, according to a Chainalysis report published Wednesday. Japan is now the standout. On-chain value received rose 120% in the 12 months to June 2025, outpacing South Korea , India and Vietnam . Growth follows rule changes that treat more tokens as investment instruments, planned updates to crypto taxation, and the licensing of the first yen-backed stablecoin issuer. With stablecoin listings beginning to loosen, traders channeled heavy volumes into XRP, then BTC and ETH, while markets watch how USDC and JPYC gain traction. In our next preview chapter of the 2025 Geography of Crypto Report, we explore APAC's acceleration as the world's fastest-growing crypto region.

It leads APAC in total on-chain value at about $338b dollars, supported by UPI rails, a large diaspora that uses crypto for remittances, and young investors who trade for supplementary income. Industry groups are helping normalize usage, while authorities build clearer oversight without stifling fintech growth. South Korea’s market looks distinctly professional. Nearly half of on-chain activity sits in the $10,000 to $1m band. The 2024 Virtual Asset User Protection Act is reshaping exchange practices, and growing USDT and KRW stablecoin pairs have lifted volumes. Image Source: Chainalysis Policymakers are debating KRW-backed stablecoins, with rules expected to address issuance, distribution and secondary trading. Tighter Supervision In Australia Sets The Stage For Institutional Entry Vietnam shows everyday utility. Crypto supports remittances, gaming and savings, reflecting wide grassroots adoption. Activity has matured, which explains slower percentage growth compared with Japan, yet usage remains deeply embedded in daily flows. Australia is laying foundations. Steps to modernize AML and CFT rules and to clean up inactive exchange licences point to tighter supervision and a more durable market structure. That groundwork matters as institutions seek clearer counterparties. Hong Kong and Singapore continue to shape policy in different ways. Hong Kong’s Policy Statement 2.0 accelerated local activity by signalling a path for regulated trading. Singapore’s measured stance has shifted flows toward stablecoins, which now surpass bitcoin pairs as institutions use them for payments, liquidity and hedging. Across APAC, monthly on-chain value received climbed from about $81b in July 2022 to that Dec. 2024 peak. Volumes eased afterward but stayed high through mid-2025. The region frequently ranks second to Europe and at times outpaces North America, underscoring its growing influence on global flows. Beyond Trading, New Use Cases Keep Volumes Elevated Into 2025 Market triggers were clear. Late 2023 and early 2024 produced the first months above $100b as prices recovered. Q4 2024 delivered the top prints, helped by a global risk rally. The trend persisted into 2025 even as prices cooled, pointing to broader use cases beyond trading alone. APAC’s diversity is the driver. Japan’s reform cycle, India’s digital public infrastructure, Korea’s trader centric market, Vietnam’s everyday use, Australia’s compliance push, and the twin hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore together create multiple paths to adoption. That mix also buffers the region. When trading slows in one market, remittances, payments or treasury activity sustain volumes elsewhere. As rules continue to harden, APAC’s role as a bellwether for how crypto will be used at scale looks set to grow.

As of this week, it hit its most overbought level in 45 years, with a monthly RSI of 89.72. That’s the highest RSI for gold since 1980. Anyone who follows charts knows that anything above 70 usually signals overbought territory. So, near 90? That’s insane. And this is happening on a monthly chart, which means the trend’s been cooking for a while. The rally’s been brutal and steady. This year alone, gold has surged 43%, driven by falling real yields, global instability, and central banks shoveling gold into reserves like it’s running out. Traders are glued to the charts right now. This level of RSI doesn’t pop up often, and when it does, a correction usually follows. Some are already bracing for a short-term pullback. But for now, this metal isn’t cooling off. Traders rush into ETFs as gold keeps climbing On Friday, gold-backed ETFs added 27 tonnes in a single day. That’s the biggest spike since January 2022 and more than double the daily average this year. It triggered a 0.9% surge in ETF holdings, the biggest one-day jump in over two years. Bloomberg says those holdings have grown almost every month in 2025, except May, adding close to 400 tonnes total. Traders are going all in. This push has lined gold up for its sixth straight weekly gain, the longest winning streak since February. It’s turning into a historic run. At the same time, silver’s moving too. The largest silver ETF, $SLV, saw daily options volume jump to 1.2 million shares on Friday. That’s the highest since April 2024. On Tuesday, silver touched $44 an ounce, while spot gold held steady at $3,760.70 as of 8:16 a.m. in Singapore. Platinum barely moved. Palladium ticked lower. But the real action’s all on the yellow metal. Fed rate cuts and Trump’s NATO comments heat up the gold trade The Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points a week ago, dragging real yields down even further, as Cryptopolitan previously reported. Naturally, that has pushed even more investors into non-yielding assets like gold. Inflation’s still sticking around, fiscal deficits are rising, and tensions across Europe and the Middle East haven’t let up. Central banks haven’t missed the party either. They’ve been stacking gold this year like their lives depend on it. That demand hasn’t let up, and it’s kept support under prices. Now, there’s even talk that gold could hit $5,000 by the end of the year. Traders are watching the U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index this week. That’s the Fed’s favorite inflation metric. If it slows down again, that could mean more cuts are coming, and more support for gold. On the political front, President Donald Trump, speaking during a UN General Assembly meeting in New York, said NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace. When asked whether Ukraine can still win the war, Trump said, “Yes, I do.” Those comments dropped straight into the middle of already tense global markets. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index stayed flat, giving no help to the greenback. That’s just one more reason traders are clinging to gold. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

In a move that has caught the attention of analysts, ten major whale addresses collectively pulled an astounding 210,452 ETH, valued at approximately $860 million, from prominent exchanges like Kraken, Galaxy Digital OTC, BitGo, and FalconX. This substantial outflow, reported by Lookonchain, suggests a potentially crucial shift in market dynamics. Such large-scale movements by powerful market players often provide valuable insights into upcoming trends and investor sentiment. Understanding these actions is key for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. What Do These Significant ETH Whale Withdrawals Mean? When large holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ move substantial amounts of cryptocurrency off exchanges, it typically indicates a change in their strategy. These particular ETH whale withdrawals represent a significant portion of Ethereum’s circulating supply being taken out of immediate trading environments. Historically, such movements can signal several things, from increased confidence in the asset’s long-term value to preparation for specific off-exchange activities. Moreover, these withdrawals are not merely transactions; they are strategic decisions with potential ripple effects across the entire market. They offer a glimpse into the mindset of those who hold substantial influence. Reduced Selling Pressure: By removing ETH from exchanges, these whales are effectively reducing the supply available for immediate sale, which can alleviate short-term selling pressure. Accumulation Phase: It could indicate that these large investors are accumulating ETH, believing its price will appreciate significantly in the future. Self-Custody Preference: A growing trend among savvy investors is to move assets to personal wallets for enhanced security, away from potential exchange risks. Why Are Investors Opting for ETH Whale Withdrawals Now? Several factors might be influencing these large-scale ETH whale withdrawals . One primary reason could be the desire for greater security. Holding assets on an exchange always carries inherent risks, including potential hacks or regulatory uncertainties. Moving ETH to cold storage or self-custody wallets provides investors with full control over their funds, mitigating these concerns. Furthermore, these withdrawals could be linked to participation in Ethereum’s staking ecosystem. By withdrawing their ETH, whales might be preparing to stake their assets to earn rewards, thereby contributing to the network’s security and decentralization. Another possibility involves over-the-counter (OTC) deals, where large transactions are executed directly between parties, bypassing public exchanges to minimize market impact and price slippage. What Are the Potential Market Implications of These ETH Whale Withdrawals? The implications of such substantial ETH whale withdrawals are far-reaching for the broader crypto market. Firstly, a decrease in exchange supply often leads to a perception of scarcity, which can contribute to bullish sentiment. If demand remains constant or increases while supply on exchanges diminishes, upward price pressure may build over time. Secondly, these actions can serve as a strong signal to smaller investors. When major players demonstrate conviction by holding assets off-exchange, it can inspire others to follow suit, further strengthening market confidence. However, it is also crucial to consider that these movements do not guarantee immediate price appreciation. Market sentiment and broader economic factors always play a significant role. Short-term Volatility: While often bullish long-term, large movements can sometimes precede short-term volatility as the market digests the news and speculators react. Indicator of Health: Consistent outflows, especially during market dips, can be seen as a sign of underlying strength and growing institutional interest in Ethereum. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Landscape of ETH Whale Withdrawals The recent ETH whale withdrawals of $860 million from major exchanges are undoubtedly a significant event in the Ethereum ecosystem. They highlight a strategic decision by powerful market participants, potentially signaling a move towards greater self-custody, increased staking, or the execution of large private deals. For investors, monitoring such on-chain metrics provides valuable insights into the intentions of institutional and high-net-worth individuals, helping to inform personal investment strategies. While the immediate impact is always subject to broader market forces, these withdrawals generally paint a picture of long-term conviction rather than short-term speculative selling. Staying informed about these crucial movements is essential for anyone navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

Frequently Asked Questions About ETH Whale Withdrawals What is an ETH whale? An ETH whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Ethereum, typically enough to influence market prices with their transactions. Why do whales withdraw ETH from exchanges? Whales withdraw ETH for various reasons, including enhanced security through self-custody, participation in staking, executing over-the-counter (OTC) deals, or simply accumulating for long-term holding. Does withdrawing ETH always mean the price will go up? Not necessarily immediately. While withdrawals can reduce selling pressure and signal bullish sentiment, market prices are influenced by many factors. However, consistent outflows often suggest long-term confidence. How can I track ETH whale withdrawals? On-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain (as mentioned in the article), Glassnode, and CryptoQuant specialize in tracking and reporting such large movements of cryptocurrency. What is the difference between withdrawing and selling ETH? Withdrawing ETH means moving it from an exchange to a personal wallet, retaining ownership. Selling ETH means exchanging it for fiat currency or another cryptocurrency on an exchange. Did you find this analysis of ETH whale withdrawals insightful?

Recent reports reveal a dramatic decline in South Korean crypto holdings , indicating a notable reallocation of investor capital. This trend comes as traditional equities experience a strong resurgence, prompting a closer look at what’s driving this market movement. What’s Behind the Steep Decline in South Korean Crypto Holdings? Data from the Bank of Korea’s September Financial Stability Report, cited by Newsis, shows a substantial reduction in virtual asset holdings among South Korean investors. By the end of June, these holdings had fallen to 89.2 trillion won (approximately $64.6 billion). This represents a significant 27% decrease from their peak of 121.8 trillion won ($88.3 billion) at the end of January. The decline in South Korean crypto holdings directly correlates with a robust rally in the domestic stock market, including the KOSPI. Virtual asset deposits also dropped sharply, from 10.7 trillion won ($7.8 billion) to 6.2 trillion won ($4.5 billion) in the same period. Why Are Investors Shifting from Crypto to Stocks in South Korea? The primary reason for this pronounced shift appears to be the strong performance of the domestic stock market. As equities rally, they present an attractive alternative for investors seeking returns, often perceived as more stable than the volatile cryptocurrency market. Booming Equity Market: The KOSPI’s strong rally naturally draws capital, as investors chase potentially higher returns in traditional assets. Risk Reassessment: Following periods of significant crypto volatility, some investors may seek assets with lower perceived risk. Macroeconomic Influence: Broader economic conditions and investor sentiment favor established markets over emerging digital ones. This rebalancing of portfolios indicates a change in investor sentiment towards digital assets, as South Korean crypto holdings adjust to the evolving financial landscape. The Impact on South Korean Crypto Holdings and the Market Landscape The substantial reduction in South Korean crypto holdings carries broader implications for the nation’s digital asset ecosystem. A sustained outflow of capital could affect local crypto exchanges, potentially leading to reduced trading volumes and slower innovation. It also raises questions about future regulatory frameworks. For individual investors, this trend highlights the importance of a balanced investment strategy. While cryptocurrencies offer unique opportunities, their inherent volatility means that diversification remains a crucial principle. Understanding broader market cycles is essential for informed decision-making. Navigating Volatility: What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? The experience of South Korean crypto holdings offers valuable lessons for investors globally. It underscores the dynamic nature of financial markets and the constant interplay between different asset classes. Consider these actionable insights: Diversify Wisely: Avoid concentrating all investments in one asset class. A diversified portfolio, including both traditional and digital assets, helps manage risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with both crypto market trends and broader economic news. Assess Risk: Understand your personal comfort level with risk and align your investments accordingly. This dramatic shift in South Korea provides crucial insights into investor behavior and market dynamics. In conclusion, the significant decrease in South Korean crypto holdings , fueled by a thriving stock market, marks a pivotal moment for the country’s financial sector. It highlights the cyclical nature of investment preferences and the enduring appeal of traditional assets during periods of equity market strength. Understanding these shifts is crucial for all investors navigating today’s complex markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused the 27% fall in South Korean crypto holdings? A strong rally in the domestic stock market (KOSPI) attracted funds away from virtual assets. 2. How much did virtual asset deposits decrease? Deposits dropped from 10.7 trillion won ($7.8 billion) to 6.2 trillion won ($4.5 billion). 3. Is this trend unique to South Korea? While specific to South Korea, reallocation of funds between asset classes based on market performance is a common global trend. The scale here is noteworthy. 4. What should investors learn from this shift in South Korean crypto holdings? Prioritize diversification, stay informed about market trends, and regularly assess risk tolerance for informed decisions.

Recent headlines suggest that retail adoption is shifting from niche to mainstream. Russia’s largest online retailer, Wildberries, has introduced crypto payments in Belarus via Whitebird, the nation’s first licensed exchange. Rather than direct transfers, customers buy electronic certificates with BTC, ETH, or USDT, which are then redeemable on Wildberries’ platform. JUST IN: Russia's e-commerce giant Wildberries now accepts #Bitcoin and crypto payments from Belarus. Bullish pic.twitter.com/UlDCjRc3Fq — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 24, 2025 The program remains in pilot mode, but authorities expect Belarus to process as much as $3 billion in crypto payments by the end of 2025. That surge in adoption could underpin long-term demand for Bitcoin. Corporate Bets on Bitcoin Beyond retail, corporate interest is surfacing again. Chinese EV charging firm Jiuzi Holdings shocked market participants with a plan to allocate up to $1 billion into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. The proposal, aimed at hedging against economic volatility, briefly sent Jiuzi’s stock soaring 47% before reality set in.

Still, the announcement highlights a broader trend: more companies are considering crypto as part of their treasury strategies. Meanwhile, Kraken has pledged $2 million to U.S. political groups pushing for clearer regulation. The donation, split between America First Digital and the Freedom Fund PAC, reflects growing industry efforts to secure legal clarity. Technical Outlook for Bitcoin (BTC/USD) From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has slipped into a descending channel after peaking at $117,800 earlier this month. The rejection at $115,185 coincided with a short-term “death cross,” where the 50-period SMA crossed below the 200-period SMA. Momentum has shifted toward sellers, with RSI hovering near 45, suggesting weakness but not capitulation. The immediate resistance stands at $114,025, while $112,000 forms critical short-term support. A break below could expose the $111,095 and $109,771 levels. Traders, however, should remain alert for bullish signals. A rebound from $111,000, confirmed by a bullish engulfing candle or positive RSI divergence, could trigger a breakout from the descending channel. That scenario would open upside targets back toward $115,200 and $116,600, with momentum potentially building into the final quarter of 2025. Key Takeaway: With retail adoption expanding in Belarus, corporates allocating billions to crypto, and regulatory clarity advancing in the U.S., Bitcoin is quietly laying the groundwork for another leg higher. A well-timed rally toward $116,000 remains in play if technical conditions align with these macro tailwinds.

This isn’t just another coin; it represents a new avenue for investment and participation within the evolving blockchain ecosystem.

The decision to feature XPL reflects careful evaluation and confidence in the token’s underlying value proposition. Understanding XPL: What Powers This New Digital Asset?

The proposal requires exchanges and other operators to secure an Australian Financial Services Licence. Firms that fail to act honestly and fairly, or that engage in misleading conduct and unfair contract terms, would face the greater of three penalties, A$16.5m (US$10.9m), three times the benefit gained, or 10% of annual turnover. These rules build on existing anti-money laundering obligations overseen by AUSTRAC and complement the Australian Taxation Office’s scrutiny of crypto transactions for capital gains tax. Consultation Period Set To Shape Rules For Industry Heavyweights The ATO can already impose fines worth up to three times the amount evaded or pursue prison terms in cases of serious breaches. The draft law will remain open for consultation until Oct. 24. It marks one of the most significant moves yet to regulate an industry that includes major global players such as Coinbase and Kraken. Australia’s regulators have repeatedly warned about the risks of surging retail crypto investment. The nation’s securities and prudential watchdogs, as well as the central bank, have pressed for tougher standards. In August, financial crimes agency AUSTRAC ordered Binance’s local arm to appoint an external auditor over money laundering and terrorism financing concerns. @binance faces mandatory audit in Australia over serious AML and terror financing concerns amid nationwide enforcement campaign. #Binance #Australia https://t.co/lVsofJm6gC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 22, 2025 New Rules Extend Corporations Act To Digital Asset Platforms Treasury said the new regime will bring digital asset and tokenized custody platforms under the Corporations Act, extending consumer protections and formal licensing requirements. Smaller players will not face the full burden. Platforms that hold less than A$5,000 per customer and process under A$10m in annual transactions will be exempt. The effort reflects a balancing act, with policymakers seeking to protect investors without stifling innovation. Industry feedback over the next month will shape the final framework before it moves toward parliament. Separately, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission last week granted class relief to intermediaries distributing stablecoins issued by licensed AFS providers. The measure, which runs until June 2028, exempts them from separate market, clearing and settlement licences when handling stablecoins from approved issuers. The relief is the first of its kind in Australia, signalling regulators’ willingness to provide flexibility where oversight is already embedded in existing financial licences.

Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a monumental ASTER whale accumulation event. Two distinct whale addresses made headlines by amassing a staggering 118 million ASTER tokens, a haul valued at an incredible $270.8 million. Understanding the Massive ASTER Whale Accumulation This substantial acquisition, initially brought to light by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, represents a considerable portion of ASTER’s total supply. Specifically, these two addresses now control 7.13% of the entire circulating supply of ASTER. Such a concentrated ownership by a few entities can have profound implications for a token’s market dynamics. Magnitude of the Acquisition: 118 million ASTER tokens. Value at Time of Report: Approximately $270.8 million. Circulating Supply Impact: Represents 7.13% of ASTER’s total circulating tokens. Following this news, ASTER’s market performance saw an immediate positive reaction. According to CoinMarketCap, ASTER was trading at $2.25, marking an impressive 8.86% increase. This surge suggests that the market interpreted the significant ASTER whale accumulation as a strong bullish signal, indicating confidence from major investors. Why Does Large ASTER Whale Accumulation Matter to Investors? When whales make such substantial moves, it often captures the attention of the wider crypto market. Their actions can influence sentiment and price trends. Here’s why this particular ASTER whale accumulation is significant: Market Confidence: Large purchases by whales often signal their belief in the token’s future potential, which can inspire smaller investors. Potential for Price Swings: Whales have the capital to significantly move prices. Their buying can drive prices up, while selling could lead to downturns. Liquidity Impact: Removing a large percentage of tokens from the open market can reduce liquidity, potentially making the remaining supply more volatile. However, it is crucial for individual investors to understand that while whale activity can be a powerful indicator, it does not guarantee future price movements. Market dynamics are complex, influenced by numerous factors beyond just large holder actions. Who Are These Crypto Whales Behind the ASTER Accumulation? The identities behind these two whale addresses remain anonymous, a common characteristic in the pseudonymous world of blockchain. While we cannot pinpoint specific individuals or institutions, their actions provide valuable insights. These could be: Early Investors: Long-term holders who are increasing their positions. Institutional Players: Investment funds or large corporations diversifying their portfolios. Strategic Traders: Entities executing a specific trading strategy based on market analysis. Regardless of their identity, the sheer volume of this ASTER whale accumulation underscores a strategic play. It suggests a calculated move rather than impulsive trading, likely based on thorough research and a strong conviction about ASTER’s underlying value or future development. Navigating the Market: What Can You Learn from ASTER Whale Accumulation? For everyday crypto enthusiasts and investors, observing whale movements can offer valuable lessons, but it requires a balanced perspective. Do not blindly follow every large transaction. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Conduct Your Own Research: Always perform due diligence on any cryptocurrency project. Understand its technology, use case, team, and roadmap. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your capital into one asset, even if whales show interest. Diversification helps mitigate risks. Understand Market Cycles: Whale accumulation often happens during periods they perceive as undervalued. Learning to identify these cycles can be beneficial. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Volatility is a constant in the crypto market. The recent ASTER whale accumulation serves as a potent reminder of the significant capital at play in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the powerful influence it can wield. While intriguing, it is one piece of a much larger puzzle that shapes the market. Compelling Summary: The Ripple Effect of Whale Activity The accumulation of $270.8 million in ASTER tokens by two whale addresses, representing over 7% of the circulating supply, is undoubtedly a headline-grabbing event. This substantial move highlights the conviction of major players in ASTER’s potential, contributing to its recent price surge. For investors, understanding such large-scale transactions is key to grasping market sentiment and potential trends, yet it also emphasizes the importance of independent research and prudent risk management in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘whale accumulation’ mean in crypto?

The remarks arrive as global policymakers debate the use of Russia’s immobilized reserves to backstop new loans to Ukraine and as gold trades near record highs, sharpening the contours of a market regime in which Bitcoin increasingly trades as a function of liquidity and institutional credibility rather than a halving-linked “four-year cycle.” Trump’s Fed Takeover Could Supercharge Bitcoin “It’s been great being off Twitter… I continue to be long BTC and also significantly sized up my gold position in August. This is driven by my belief that Trump’s efforts to take control of the Fed represent a momentous catalyst, the kind that happens once a decade,” he wrote, adding: “Once he takes control, it is logical that he will not only cut rates, but engage in some form of yield curve control… The USD will get destroyed as a result.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Soak Up Trillions From China And Russia, Billionaire Predicts The post frames Bitcoin and gold as “more pure beneficiaries of an environment where liquidity is increasing and institutional credibility is undermined,” and contends that lingering fears about a halving-style market top are misplaced now that “BTC… has been captured by tradfi and is a more pure expression of liquidity conditions.” The policy backdrop he sketches has moved from hypothetical to contested reality in recent weeks. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell publicly rejected claims that the central bank is acting politically, even as investors parse appointments and public pressure from the White House. “Cheap shots,” he said of accusations about the Fed’s motives, defending the data-dependence of recent decisions. In parallel, global policymakers and market strategists have openly debated whether ongoing political intervention could force the Fed toward explicit yield-curve control to contain long-term borrowing costs—an approach not used in the US since the 1940s. In a follow-up thread, “plur daddy” outlined a pathway to lower mortgage rates via government-sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) buying more mortgage bonds, with capital requirement tweaks and derivatives used to manage duration. That proposal distinguishes itself from QE by shifting spreads through asset mix rather than expanding central-bank balance sheets directly. The argument aligns with the broader political incentives ahead of US midterms: “Markets are forward looking… They have a strong incentive to juice the economy and markets,” he wrote, while cautioning that direct stimulus would carry inflation risks. The liquidity lens extends to the Treasury General Account (TGA), which has been rebuilt rapidly into late Q3. Research desks had warned that an aggressive TGA refill into September could briefly drain market liquidity before easing, a pattern that crypto traders have long monitored given Bitcoin’s outsized sensitivity to changes in dollar system reserves and bills-versus-reserves mix. “BTC is hypersensitive to any shift in liquidity conditions, much more so than equities,” the post asserts, echoing analysis that mapped TGA dynamics to risk-asset performance. Another pillar of the thesis is Europe’s evolving stance on Russia’s frozen sovereign assets—roughly $300 billion immobilized after the 2022 invasion. Brussels is weighing a structure in which new loans to Kyiv are backed by those assets and only repaid if Russia pays reparations—an outcome the author argues “will never happen,” calling the mechanism a de facto seizure that “massively bolsters the raison d’être for crypto.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Dip-Buy Calls Spike: Why This Could Actually Be Bearish Market context has been sympathetic to the store-of-value leg of the argument. Gold has pierced new highs this month, with multiple banks projecting scenarios toward $3,700–$4,000 over the next several quarters if central-bank buying remains strong—and potentially higher if private investors accelerate hedging flows away from US dollar assets amid policy and geopolitical uncertainty. “It makes sense that BTC start moving [when] gold’s momentum slows down,” “plur daddy” added, positing a rotation once bullion’s advance stalls. The post has drawn quick agreement from notable traders. “Agree, I am trying to time this, I think 90k,” wrote Ansem (blknoiz06), sketching a timeline that implies a Q1 2026 window for a new Bitcoin leg higher. Macro strategist Alex Krüger called it a “great post.” Forward Guidance podcast host Felix Jauvin added: “So very well said. Good to see you man.” The policy backdrop the expert sketches now features a Fed Board with a freshly confirmed Governor, Stephen I. Miran, who immediately dissented at the September FOMC for a larger cut and has been publicly arguing for materially faster easing in the dot plot. In parallel, the administration’s attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook via lawsuit has put an unprecedented spotlight on the legal protections around Federal Reserve independence. Those developments—together with Europe’s evolving plan to leverage frozen Russian assets—are the concrete signposts of the “once-a-decade” moment described above. At press time, BTC traded at $113,121.

Trading at $43.37, HYPE has fallen more than 12% in the past 24 hours and is down 20.8% this week, raising alarm across the crypto market. The scheduled unlock on November 29 will see team tokens representing 23.8% of the total supply released over 24 months, with analysts warning of $500 million in monthly selling pressure. Research group Maelstrom described the upcoming vesting as a “Sword of Damocles” moment, noting that only 17% of the supply may be absorbed by buybacks. This overhang has already caused major whales to trim their positions, with one investor withdrawing $122 million worth of HYPE while holding onto $90 million in unrealized profits. Arthur Hayes’ Ferrari Sale Sparks Hyperliquid (HYPE) Selloff Adding fuel to the bearish sentiment, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes recently exited his entire HYPE position, cashing out over 96,000 tokens for approximately $4.8 million. Hayes revealed on social media that the sale was to cover a deposit for his new Ferrari 849 Testarossa, generating nearly $823,000 in profit. The move stunned the market, especially given Hayes’ bold prediction just weeks earlier at the WebX 2025 conference, where he forecasted a 126x surge in HYPE over three years. His abrupt selloff, paired with mounting unlock concerns, has shaken investor confidence in Hyperliquid’s long-term trajectory. Tokenomics Reform Proposal: Can It Restore Trust? In response to growing concerns, DBA Asset Management’s Jon Charbonneau and researcher Hasu have introduced a comprehensive proposal to overhaul HYPE’s tokenomics. The plan recommends: Burning 45% of HYPE’s supply , including unminted tokens allocated for emissions and assistance funds. Eliminating Hyperliquid’s fixed 1 billion supply cap , aligning with flexible issuance models seen in Ethereum and Solana. Supporters argue the proposal could remove distortions in fully diluted valuation (FDV) metrics and create a fairer assessment of Hyperliquid’s fundamentals . However, critics warn that cutting emissions may weaken growth incentives and reduce flexibility in responding to future challenges. Despite its current price struggles, Hyperliquid remains one of the fastest-growing decentralized derivatives exchanges, recently hitting $3.4 billion in daily trading volumes. Whether the proposed reforms can stabilize HYPE ahead of November’s unlock will be a decisive test for the project’s resilience.

Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate total inflows. However, the latest figures show a striking performance by XRP, which secured significant capital at a time when several other assets struggled to attract or even retain investment. According to CoinShares data shared on X by crypto commentator and analyst X Finance Bull, XRP recorded $69.4 million in weekly inflows, placing it firmly among the best-performing assets of the week. By comparison, multi-asset investment products recorded $38 million in outflows, while other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) attracted only marginal sums. BOOM! $XRP pulled $69M in weekly inflows while others leaked capital. Money doesn’t lie, institutions are loading into clarity, not confusion. The market is already telling you where the next wave of adoption is headed. When will you realize where liquidity flows? pic.twitter.com/HUzmr5qVdO — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) September 23, 2025 Analyst Reaction to XRP’s Performance X Finance Bull addressed the shift in flows with a direct focus on XRP’s ability to capture institutional capital. He remarked that “XRP pulled $69M in weekly inflows while others leaked capital” and added that “money doesn’t lie.” His assessment describes a conviction among large investors that regulatory clarity surrounding XRP has given the asset a unique advantage compared to competitors facing uncertainty. The analyst’s comments highlight the notion that capital allocation often reflects institutional perception of stability and opportunity. He suggested that the market already signals where adoption is heading. This sentiment aligns with the data, which show XRP’s cumulative year-to-date inflows at $1.5 billion, an amount that reflects steady accumulation throughout 2025. Why This Matters for XRP The consistent inflows provide a more comprehensive view than a weekly snapshot. They represent a trend of institutional validation. While Bitcoin remains the dominant digital asset with over $24.7 billion in inflows year-to-date, and Ethereum follows with $12.6 billion, XRP’s ability to sustain inflows despite a smaller total market size stands out. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This positions XRP in a competitive landscape where survival depends not only on speculation but also on institutional adoption. A key driver of this development is the increasing perception that XRP benefits from a clearer regulatory standing in the U.S. compared to other assets. For institutions that prioritize compliance, this clarity reduces perceived risk and encourages long-term positioning. With $3 billion in assets under management tied to XRP investment products, the scale of participation now exceeds that of many established altcoins. XRP Outlook for the Coming Months If current momentum persists, XRP could solidify its position as one of the most institutionally supported digital assets in the market. The inflow data suggests that capital managers view it as more than a speculative token, instead recognizing its role in payment systems and cross-border settlement.

ETH is now struggling and might decline further if it breaks the $4,050 support zone. Ethereum failed to extend gains and declined below the $4,150 zone. The price is trading below $4,150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,360 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $4,050 and $4,000. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price remained in a bearish zone after it settled below $4,450, like Bitcoin . ETH price declined below the $4,320 and $4,300 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below $4,120. A low was formed at $4,000 and the price recently started a minor recovery wave. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $4,635 swing high to the $4,000 low. However, the bears remained active near the $4,250 resistance zone and pushed the price lower again. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,360 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,150 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,220 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,250 level. A clear move above the $4,250 resistance might send the price toward the $4,350 resistance and the trend line. An upside break above the $4,360 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,450 resistance zone or even $4,550 in the near term. Downside Extension In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,220 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,050 level. The first major support sits near the $4,000 zone. A clear move below the $4,000 support might push the price toward the $3,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,820 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,750.

U.S. investment bank Benchmark has just reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating for the Japanese company, signaling strong confidence in its bold Metaplanet Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This move has set an ambitious price target of 2,400 yen for Metaplanet’s stock by the end of 2026, a significant leap from its current trading price of 540 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Why is Benchmark So Confident in Metaplanet Bitcoin? Benchmark’s decision to reaffirm its positive outlook isn’t just a casual endorsement; it comes with a strong rebuttal to market skepticism. The investment bank directly addressed claims suggesting that Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy is collapsing or that its stock momentum is fading. Benchmark firmly stated that such assertions are premature and lack sufficient evidence, highlighting their belief in the company’s long-term vision. It is true that Metaplanet’s stock has recently faced headwinds, largely due to the activities of short sellers. These investors bet on a stock’s price falling, and their actions can sometimes create temporary downward pressure. However, Benchmark encourages a broader perspective: Past Performance: Metaplanet was Japan’s best-performing listed company last year, a remarkable achievement that underscores its potential. Current Standing: Despite recent fluctuations, its shares remain up an impressive 56% year-to-date, demonstrating considerable resilience and growth. This sustained performance suggests that the underlying value and strategic direction of Metaplanet Bitcoin remain strong, defying short-term market noise. Understanding Metaplanet’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation Metaplanet’s approach to Bitcoin isn’t merely speculative; it is a deliberate corporate strategy to integrate the digital asset into its treasury. This move aligns the company with a growing trend of publicly traded entities, particularly in the U.S., adopting Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset to hedge against inflation and preserve capital. For a Japanese company to embrace such a strategy is particularly noteworthy, given the traditional conservatism often associated with Japanese corporate finance. This bold step positions Metaplanet as a pioneer in its region, potentially paving the way for other Asian companies to consider similar moves. The goal is to leverage Bitcoin’s properties as a decentralized, scarce asset to enhance shareholder value over the long term. By consistently accumulating Bitcoin, Metaplanet aims to: Strengthen its balance sheet: Utilizing Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation. Attract a new investor base: Appealing to those interested in digital asset exposure within traditional markets. Innovate corporate finance: Demonstrating leadership in adopting new financial technologies. The strategic clarity behind Metaplanet Bitcoin is a key factor in Benchmark’s unwavering confidence. Navigating the Market: Metaplanet Bitcoin Amidst Volatility While the overall narrative for Metaplanet remains positive, investors must always consider market dynamics. The recent faltering of the stock, though attributed to short sellers, serves as a reminder that even strong strategies can face temporary pressures. Bitcoin itself is known for its volatility, and companies that tie their fortunes to it will naturally experience some of this ebb and flow. However, Benchmark’s 2026 price target indicates a belief in the long-term trajectory of both Metaplanet’s operational strategy and the broader Bitcoin market. For investors, this suggests that looking beyond immediate price movements and focusing on the fundamental shift in corporate treasury management could be crucial. The ability of Metaplanet Bitcoin to navigate these waters will be a key indicator of its success. This situation highlights the difference between short-term trading sentiment and long-term investment conviction. Benchmark’s reiteration is a strong signal for those who believe in the enduring value proposition of Bitcoin and its role in modern corporate strategy. A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Benchmark’s reiterated ‘Buy’ rating for Metaplanet is more than just a stock recommendation; it is a powerful validation of a forward-thinking corporate strategy. It underscores the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable treasury asset, even in traditional financial markets like Japan. Metaplanet’s journey serves as an important case study for how companies can strategically integrate digital assets to create long-term value. Despite the challenges posed by short-term market dynamics, the underlying strength of Metaplanet’s performance and the strategic rationale behind its Metaplanet Bitcoin accumulation strategy appear robust. The 2,400 yen price target by 2026 reflects significant growth potential, suggesting that the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Benchmark’s current rating for Metaplanet? Benchmark has reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating for Metaplanet. Q2: What is Metaplanet’s price target according to Benchmark? Benchmark has set a price target of 2,400 yen for Metaplanet’s stock by the end of 2026. Q3: Why did Metaplanet’s stock recently falter? The stock recently faltered due to activities by short sellers, who bet on a stock’s price decline. Q4: How has Metaplanet’s stock performed year-to-date? Despite recent fluctuations, Metaplanet’s shares are still up 56% year-to-date. Q5: What is the core of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy?

The latest trend shows a clear rotation away from hype-driven assets toward platforms with practical value. At the forefront of this shift is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale-stage DeFi platform that blends secure lending, borrowing, and staking with Layer-2 technology for faster, lower-cost transactions. From market rotation to DeFi dominance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out by offering dual lending options, where users will access peer-to-contract pools for mainstream assets alongside peer-to-peer channels for higher-risk tokens. mtTokens earned through deposits can be staked for MUTM rewards, while a future $1 stablecoin will power borrowing and repayment activity. This multi-layered design is not built for speculation alone—it is engineered to drive continuous activity, revenue generation, and long-term token demand. With a roadmap that prioritizes utility, exchange listings, and community engagement, MUTM is being highlighted by analysts as the best crypto investing opportunity in today’s market rotation. Investors are beginning to realize that lasting returns come from tokens backed by active use cases rather than quick hype cycles. Dogecoin (DOGE) once captured headlines on community momentum, but it lacks the structural mechanics to keep attracting serious capital. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned differently, as it is designed to launch with a working beta platform where users will experience loans, staking, and stablecoin functions firsthand. This hands-on exposure is expected to generate trust and draw in both retail participants and institutional players. Layer-2 optimization will be another driver. Transactions will be faster and cheaper, solving one of the most common frustrations with decentralized finance. By lowering barriers for participation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will encourage frequent lending and borrowing, amplifying liquidity in the system. On top of this, the buy-and-distribute revenue model will recycle platform earnings into MUTM buybacks, distributing them to mtToken stakers. This self-reinforcing cycle ensures that activity on the platform translates directly into demand pressure on the token. Market rotation is also steering whales toward assets with transparent growth metrics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates a dashboard where investors will track their holdings and returns, alongside a Top 50 leaderboard that highlights leading participants. This gamified environment not only keeps users engaged but also incentivizes large-scale players to lock in capital for long-term benefits. Together, these features provide a strong foundation for MUTM to outpace speculative crypto coins and rise toward the $3.5 target analysts are projecting. Presale momentum and future exchange listings Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with the token priced at $0.035. The presale has already raised around $16.23 million, attracting more than 16,600 holders, and 50% of the Phase 6 allocation of 170 million tokens has been sold. Security has been validated through a CertiK audit, with scores of 90 on Token Scan and 79 on Skynet, and the revised audit timeline is set for May 20, 2025. The project also enjoys a strong social following with over 12,000 Twitter supporters. When the presale advances to Phase 7, the token price will increase by 15% to $0.040. Exchange listings are expected to unlock the next wave of demand. With plans to bring MUTM onto top-tier platforms such as Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, MEXC, and Kraken, the project will gain exposure to a global audience of investors seeking tokens with real utility. Unlike many presale projects that rely only on promises, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer a live ecosystem, where stablecoin borrowing, Layer-2 efficiency, and staking rewards converge to keep liquidity circulating. This model is the best place for market rotation capital to move about. Investors who are tired of the instability that comes with meme-driven assets are switching to platforms where growth is built into the service. An increase from $0.035 to $3.5 isn’t just a guess; it’s a path backed by growing acceptance, more exchanges, and built-in demand via buybacks and staking rewards. Investors need to act fast to get MUTM for $0.035 because half of Phase 6 has already been sold. The price will go up to $0.040 in Phase 7, which will make the admission cost 15% higher. This makes early access even more attractive. If you’re keeping an eye on the crypto market and trying to figure out where to put your money, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most interesting new coins. The move toward platforms that are useful is already happening, and MUTM is already taking advantage of it.

Recently, the spotlight has been firmly on ETH liquidations , which have soared to a staggering $76.51 million within just 24 hours. This massive wave of forced selling has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, particularly impacting traders who held long positions. Understanding these events is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of crypto. Understanding the Surge in ETH Liquidations In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency perpetual futures, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin, or collateral, falls below a certain threshold, typically due to adverse price movements. Essentially, it’s a safety mechanism designed to prevent traders from losing more money than they have in their account. Perpetual futures contracts are popular derivative instruments in crypto, allowing traders to speculate on asset prices without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, but they rely heavily on a mechanism called ‘funding rates’ to keep their price close to the spot price. Traders often use leverage, borrowing funds to amplify their potential returns. While this can lead to significant profits, it also magnifies losses. When the market moves against a leveraged position, and the value of the collateral falls below a certain maintenance level, the exchange automatically closes the position. This prevents further losses and maintains market integrity. These events are crucial because they can amplify market volatility; when a large number of positions are liquidated simultaneously, it can trigger further price drops, creating a cascade effect known as a ‘liquidation spiral’. The Staggering Numbers: ETH, BTC, and SOL Take a Hit The recent data paints a clear picture of significant market activity and the immense pressure felt by traders. Over the past 24 hours, ETH liquidations led the pack, totaling an astonishing $76.51 million. What’s particularly noteworthy is that long positions accounted for a dominant 74.24% of this figure, indicating that the vast majority of liquidated traders were betting on rising prices. Bitcoin (BTC) also saw substantial liquidations, reaching $53.88 million, with long positions making up 64.2% of the total. Not to be outdone, Solana (SOL) experienced $30.72 million in liquidations, and an even higher percentage of long positions, 83.62%, were wiped out. These figures collectively highlight a period of considerable downside pressure, especially for those betting on an upward trajectory. The sheer volume of these liquidations, particularly for Ethereum, suggests a rapid and perhaps unexpected shift in market momentum. For many traders, this meant a sudden and forced exit from their positions, often at a loss. This cascade of closures can create a challenging environment for even experienced traders to navigate, as market movements can accelerate rapidly. Why Were Long Positions Dominant in Recent Crypto Liquidations ? It is interesting to observe the prevalence of long positions in these recent liquidations. This suggests that a significant portion of traders were optimistic about upward price movements for these assets. However, when market sentiment shifted or unexpected price drops occurred, these leveraged long positions quickly became vulnerable. Several factors can contribute to such a scenario. Perhaps there was an overleveraged market, where many traders were using high leverage, making their positions more susceptible to even small price corrections. Additionally, macro-economic news, regulatory concerns, or specific project developments could have triggered selling pressure, leading to a swift downturn that caught many off guard. The dominance of long positions in these recent crypto liquidations points to a prevailing bullish sentiment that was abruptly challenged. Prior to these events, many traders might have been confident in the continued growth of these assets, perhaps influenced by positive news, technical indicators, or broader market optimism. The rapid closure of these long positions likely exacerbated the price declines, as exchanges sold off assets to cover margin calls, adding to the overall market supply. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights to Mitigate Liquidations Understanding the dynamics of forced liquidations is vital for any crypto trader. Here are some actionable insights to consider, helping you protect your capital during volatile periods: Manage Leverage Wisely: Using leverage can be a double-edged sword. While 10x or 20x leverage might seem appealing for quick gains, it means a mere 10% or 5% price drop can wipe out your entire capital. Consider starting with lower leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) until you gain more experience and confidence in your strategy. Set Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order is your best friend in volatile markets. For instance, if you enter a long position at $3,000 for ETH, you might set a stop-loss at $2,900. If ETH drops to that level, your position is automatically closed, limiting your loss to a predefined amount, rather than risking a full liquidation. Monitor Funding Rates: Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders. Positive funding rates mean longs pay shorts, indicating more demand for long positions. Consistently high positive funding rates can signal an overbought market and a potential correction, making it a red flag for new long entries. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading your investments across different assets can help mitigate risk. If one asset performs poorly, others might still do well. Stay Informed: Market sentiment can turn on a dime. Follow reputable crypto news sources, analyze on-chain data for insights into whale movements, and understand the broader economic landscape. Knowledge is power in predicting potential shifts that could lead to widespread liquidations. The recent surge in ETH liquidations , alongside significant figures for BTC and SOL, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks in leveraged trading within the cryptocurrency market. The dominance of long positions among the liquidated indicates a market that was perhaps overly optimistic, facing swift corrections. While liquidations can be painful for individual traders, they are a fundamental part of how perpetual futures markets maintain stability. For participants, learning from these events and implementing robust risk management strategies is paramount to long-term success in this exciting yet unpredictable space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin (collateral) falls below a required level, usually due to adverse price movements. 2. Why do long positions get liquidated more often during a market downturn? Long positions profit when prices rise. During a market downturn, prices fall, causing long positions to lose value. If these positions are leveraged, even small drops can deplete their margin, leading to forced closure. 3. How can traders avoid being liquidated? Traders can avoid liquidations by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and staying informed about market conditions to anticipate potential shifts. 4. Do liquidations impact the overall crypto market price? Yes, large-scale liquidations can significantly impact market prices. The forced selling of assets by exchanges to cover liquidated positions adds to selling pressure, potentially accelerating price declines and increasing volatility. 5. What is the difference between a spot trade and a perpetual futures trade in relation to liquidations? Spot trading involves buying and selling the actual cryptocurrency, so liquidations do not occur. Perpetual futures trading, however, involves leveraged contracts that track the asset’s price. These leveraged positions are subject to liquidation if the market moves against the trader’s bet and their margin runs out.

But since crypto values are still changing a lot nowadays, investors are not only keeping an eye on ETH; they are also looking for the next big cryptocurrency that might make them a lot of money. As it moves through its presale Phase 6 at under $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting a lot of attention. Analysts say it might be the greatest crypto coin to keep an eye on before the year’s most anticipated ETH rise. Ethereum (ETH) forecast Ethereum (ETH) is forecasted to hit $6,000 by the end of 2025, trading at ~$4,203 as of September 23, 2025, with a 24-hour trading volume of $37.07 billion. This projection, supported by analysts like Gov Capital and DigitalCoinPrice, stems from robust ETF inflows exceeding $11 billion since July, led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust holding 3.49 million ETH. Institutional adoption, including corporate treasuries like SharpLink Gaming adding $400 million, and Layer-2 scaling driving 1.74 million daily transactions, bolsters the outlook. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) unlocks a new era in DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a dual-model DeFi platform that will serve both traditional and risk-tolerant users. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending will allow investors to supply assets like BTC, ETH, or stablecoins into liquidity pools to earn predictable interest, while Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending will provide flexibility for riskier tokens such as SHIB, PEPE, or DOGE through individually negotiated terms. This design is intended to combine scalability, security, and versatility in ways few lending protocols have managed. Beyond the lending foundation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1, minted only against collateral and burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will oversee interest rates to keep the peg stable, while arbitrage will strengthen the $1 balance over time. This stability framework is further supported by Chainlink-powered oracles, backed up with fallback feeds and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages (TWAPs), ensuring liquidation events remain safe and transparent even during volatile swings in crypto prices. Another innovation in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem is its approach to borrowing interest and liquidity management. The platform will adopt a utilization-based system, meaning that when liquidity is abundant, borrowing costs stay low, while during periods of high demand, interest rates rise to attract more deposits. For lenders, this design increases yield potential without compromising borrower access. To complement lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces mtToken staking and MUTM buybacks. Users staking mtTokens will earn MUTM rewards, while protocol-generated revenue will be used for open-market buybacks of MUTM tokens. Those repurchased tokens will then be redistributed to stakers, creating an ongoing incentive loop that links platform usage directly to staker rewards. Presale momentum and investor examples The presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already proven to be one of the most closely tracked token sales in 2025. Out of its 4 billion total supply, Phase 6 offers 170 million tokens at $0.035, and over 50% of this allocation is already sold. The presale has raised more than $16.23 million so far, supported by a growing community of more than 16,600 holders. Importantly, Phase 7 is scheduled to increase the token price to $0.040, marking a 15% jump from current levels. Early participants are already seeing transformative growth. For instance, an investor who swapped $10,000 worth of BTC or SOL during Phase 1 at $0.01 now holds MUTM valued at $35,000 at Phase 6, locking in a +250% paper gain even before the token lists. Once the listing price of $0.06 is reached, the same allocation will be valued at $60,000, representing a +500% unrealized gain. Analysts further project that once the beta platform launches and expected listings on exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, Kraken, or MEXC go live, MUTM will be positioned to climb multiples higher as adoption accelerates. This trajectory becomes even more compelling as ETH approaches $6,000. Investors who are weighing whether crypto is a good investment during a time of rising valuations are increasingly studying crypto charts and realizing that diversifying into utility-driven tokens under $1 like MUTM offers greater upside than holding only large caps. Instead of risking exposure to the next crypto crash, many are hedging by entering early-stage projects with practical use cases that drive organic demand. Roadmap and security anchors build confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has made a clear plan for the next four phases. The framework is already in place, with presale start, marketing campaigns, and token auditing. The next steps are to develop smart contracts, finish the front-end and back-end, do beta testing, and do security audits. All of these steps will lead to the introduction of a live platform with support for many chains and partnerships with institutions. Security is also a major part of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal. The project has undergone review by CertiK, recording a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has committed to a $50,000 bug bounty program to reward ethical hackers who identify vulnerabilities, alongside an ongoing $100,000 giveaway to expand its community and reward early supporters. It’s evident that now is the time to buy, since presale Phase 6 is nearly 50% sold and Phase 7 is about to start at $0.040. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new type of lending that uses stablecoins, powerful oracle integration, and a staking buyback scheme to reward people who take part. As crypto prices keep going up and ETH gets closer to $6,000, analysts are focusing on MUTM at $0.035 as a rare chance among crypto coins that offers more than just speculation; it also has real use, growth, and security.

Right now, the limit sits at 49%, but that could change before the end of 2025, according to Abdulaziz Abdulmohsen Bin Hassan, a CMA board member who said the proposal is already under review and may be implemented “before the end of the year.” That news alone was enough to add $123 billion in market value to the Tadawul All Share Index, which hadn’t seen a boost like this since 2020. The entire market responded. Every industry group traded up, and Saudi banks took the lead with 9% gains. This comes after months of underperformance. As of now, the index is still down 9.6% in 2025, lagging behind Dubai, which is up 13.8%, and Kuwait, up 20%, a trend largely tied to weaker oil prices. Foreign cap rumors drive massive stock inflows The potential rule change would open Saudi’s doors wider to foreign capital, especially from index-tracking funds like MSCI and FTSE. If foreign ownership hits 100%, UBS projects that the market could attract between $9.5 billion and $10 billion in passive inflows. Victor Martin, UBS’s head of portfolio trading in EMEA, said those inflows would hit fast once the rules change. Big names like Saudi Aramco, despite being a symbol of the country’s market power, haven’t been able to hold ground. Its stock is down around 10% year-to-date, part of the broader weakness in large caps. Mohammed Ali Yasin, the CEO at Ghaf Benefits (under Lunate), pointed out that “even with the 49% cap, foreigners never really cross 15% ownership in most large caps.” But he said expectations are shifting fast. The momentum is now driven by hopes that foreigners will pour more money into these listed firms once the caps are gone, and not just small stakes. These flows could raise Saudi’s weight in global indices, pushing prices higher, and making the exchange more appealing to big international funds. This isn’t the first step either. Saudi has already tried to attract foreign investors by launching exchange-traded funds in partnership with Japan and Hong Kong. Another major shift came in January, when regulators gave foreigners the green light to buy listed firms that hold real estate in Mecca and Medina, though the law still blocks direct ownership of land in those two holy cities. Saudi momentum lifts emerging stocks as Powell pressures currencies As Saudi’s stocks ripped higher, global markets noticed. The MSCI benchmark for emerging market equities rose 0.4%, extending its winning streak to three days, now sitting at its highest level since July 2021. It wasn’t just Saudi fueling that push. Alibaba surged to a four-year high after boosting its AI investments, and Tencent followed suit. But the real weight came from the Saudi banks, which dominated Wednesday’s performance. On the currency side, it was the opposite story. Most emerging market currencies lost ground, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck a cautious tone in his comments. The Bloomberg dollar index rose 0.4%, as Powell said the Fed faces a “challenging situation” balancing inflation and labor market risks. That tone crushed bets for a rate cut next month, and investors backed off risk trades. In eastern Europe, the Polish zloty and neighboring currencies took a hit, dragged down by increased Russia-NATO tensions over reported airspace violations. At the same time, the Thai baht fell after new data showed the country’s export growth hit its slowest pace in almost a year, pressured by U.S. tariffs. Investors in Czech Republic kept their eyes on the central bank, which was widely expected to hold interest rates steady. A hawkish signal from the board could offer support to the koruna, one of the region’s strongest currencies against both the euro and the dollar so far this year.

Recently, a significant announcement from South Korean exchange Bithumb has caught the attention of IQ token holders. Bithumb is temporarily suspending IQ deposits and withdrawals, a move that directly impacts users of the platform. What’s Behind the Bithumb IQ Suspension? Bithumb has officially stated that the temporary suspension of IQ deposits and withdrawals will commence at 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 25. This isn’t an arbitrary decision; it’s a necessary step due to an impending IQ network transition. Network transitions are vital for blockchain projects, often involving upgrades or migrations to enhance security, scalability, or functionality. For users, this means that during the specified period, any attempts to deposit IQ tokens into their Bithumb accounts or withdraw them will be unsuccessful. It’s essential to plan any transactions accordingly to avoid inconvenience or potential loss of funds. Why Are Network Transitions Necessary for IQ? Blockchain networks, like any software, require updates and maintenance. An IQ network transition typically involves moving the token from one blockchain protocol to another, or implementing significant upgrades to its existing infrastructure. These transitions aim to improve the underlying technology, making the network more robust, efficient, and future-proof. Enhanced Security: Upgrades can patch vulnerabilities and strengthen the network’s defenses. Improved Scalability: A new network might handle more transactions faster, reducing fees and congestion. New Features: Transitions can enable new functionalities or integrations for the IQ token. While a temporary Bithumb IQ suspension might seem disruptive, it’s ultimately for the long-term health and development of the IQ ecosystem. How Does This Bithumb IQ Suspension Affect You? If you hold IQ tokens on Bithumb, or were planning to trade them around the suspension time, this announcement is particularly relevant. The primary impact is the inability to move your IQ tokens in or out of the exchange during the suspension period. This could affect your trading strategies or your ability to manage your portfolio. It’s important to understand that this is a temporary measure. Bithumb is facilitating a necessary technical process. Once the IQ network transition is complete and verified, deposits and withdrawals are expected to resume. Users should monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for updates on the resumption of services. Taking Action: What Should IQ Holders Do? Given the upcoming Bithumb IQ suspension, proactive steps can help you navigate this period smoothly: Review Your Holdings: Check your IQ balance on Bithumb. Plan Transactions: If you need to deposit or withdraw IQ, do so well before the September 25 deadline. Stay Informed: Regularly check Bithumb’s official website and announcement channels for the latest information regarding the IQ network transition and the lifting of the suspension. Consider Alternatives (Temporarily): If immediate trading or transfer is critical, you might explore other exchanges that support IQ, though this comes with its own set of considerations and risks. The goal is to avoid any last-minute rushes or surprises that could lead to missed opportunities or operational issues during the suspension. The Bigger Picture: Network Upgrades in Crypto Temporary suspensions for network upgrades are not uncommon in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Major blockchains like Ethereum have undergone significant transitions, such as “The Merge,” which required extensive preparation and temporary adjustments from exchanges and users. These events highlight the dynamic nature of crypto assets and the continuous efforts by projects to innovate and improve. A Bithumb IQ suspension for a network transition underscores the commitment to technological advancement within the IQ project. While inconvenient in the short term, such transitions are foundational for long-term growth and stability in the decentralized world. Conclusion: Navigating the Bithumb IQ Suspension with Confidence The temporary Bithumb IQ suspension for deposits and withdrawals is a direct consequence of an essential IQ network transition. This move, while requiring users to adjust their immediate plans, is a testament to the ongoing development and improvement of the IQ blockchain. By staying informed, planning ahead, and following official announcements from Bithumb, users can navigate this period effectively. Ultimately, these technical adjustments contribute to a more robust and efficient cryptocurrency ecosystem for everyone. Keep an eye on Bithumb’s official channels for the announcement of service resumption.

With the market moving into a phase where innovation and utility matter more than hype alone, three names have emerged at the top: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP. Among them, MUTM has quickly become the standout, combining real-world lending utility with strong tokenomics that are expected to drive exponential growth. For anyone focused on crypto investment with high upside in 2026, MUTM is commanding attention. Solana (SOL): A strong platform but missing direct lending utility Solana (SOL) continues to be one of the most powerful smart contract platforms, delivering fast transaction speeds and strong ecosystem development. It remains an attractive long-term hold for those investing in crypto, but its scope is focused largely on serving developers rather than individual users seeking capital efficiency. Unlike Mutuum Finance (MUTM), Solana (SOL) does not natively tie token demand to lending fees, staking rewards, or buyback mechanisms. This gap means that while Solana (SOL) will continue to grow as an infrastructure blockchain, it is less aligned with the lending-driven DeFi sector that is forecasted to expand aggressively by 2026. Dogecoin (DOGE): Hype still moves it forward Dogecoin (DOGE) has built a reputation as the original memecoin, capturing viral attention and community-driven price surges. Analysts expect DOGE to secure up to 3x growth in the near future, supported largely by its enthusiastic fanbase. However, DOGE’s long-term position is limited by its lack of utility. It does not generate lending fees, staking returns, or reinvested revenue streams. For serious investors looking beyond hype cycles, DOGE remains speculative compared to the structured growth model of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Still, DOGE’s strong cultural relevance ensures it will remain part of the conversation when discussing 2026’s crypto predictions. XRP: A payments specialist, not a lending leader XRP has carved out its niche in the world of cross-border payments, making transactions faster and cheaper for institutions and banks. Currently trading around $2.9, XRP offers stability and global partnerships that strengthen its appeal. Yet, XRP’s role is specialized and limited. It does not provide DeFi lending mechanics or staking-based incentives, meaning it lacks the organic token demand that will drive projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). For those interested in crypto investment focused on utility and direct user rewards, XRP’s ceiling is much lower compared to a full-stack DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A full-stack DeFi protocol designed for growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem rather than just another token. At its foundation is a dual lending model. Through peer-to-contract (P2C) lending, investors will be able to supply blue-chip tokens such as BTC, ETH, and stablecoins into liquidity pools that automatically serve borrowers. At the same time, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending will cater to higher-risk assets like memecoins, where lenders negotiate directly with borrowers. This dual approach balances safety and yield, appealing to both cautious lenders and those seeking aggressive returns. Beyond lending, the platform integrates mtToken staking, giving users the ability to earn rewards by locking in their tokenized claims. The revenue collected will later drive a buy-and-distribute model, ensuring consistent buy pressure on MUTM in secondary markets. Combined with a Layer-2 optimized design, which reduces costs and boosts transaction speeds, the project will be prepared for rapid scaling once it lists. Users have access to a detailed dashboard where they can track their portfolios, estimate future returns, and check the Top 50 leaderboard. Those who rank among the biggest investors receive additional MUTM token rewards as part of their bonus incentives. The upcoming beta launch will allow early adopters to test live features, including lending, borrowing, staking, and stablecoin mechanics. With these innovations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to offer a hands-on experience that will directly reinforce demand. Presale and ROI potential of MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. The round has already generated $16.23 million, with 50% of the allocation sold and more than 16,600 holders participating. Phase 7 is scheduled to raise the price to $0.040, ensuring a 15% automatic gain for new buyers entering before the transition. Security confidence is reinforced by a CertiK audit, where MUTM has achieved a Token Scan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. The final report is set for release in 2025, adding transparency for investors. An early investor who joined in Phase 1 at $0.01 by swapping into MUTM has already gained 3.5x on paper at $0.035. Once the presale token lists at $0.06, that same position is projected to increase another 70% by value from current pricing, supported by lending revenues, staking demand, and exchange listings. Why MUTM leads into 2026 The roadmap indicates strong demand drivers: a beta platform for hands-on use, and a buy-and-distribute method that keeps demand high. Layer-2 optimization makes transactions faster and cheaper, while external incentives like a $100,000 community giveaway and a $50,000 bug bounty program will get more people involved. Then, expected listings on major exchanges will give you liquidity and visibility. By 2026, SOL will still be focused on developers, DOGE and XRP will still serve their own niches, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is predicted to be the most innovative choice for anyone who wants to invest in crypto with an emphasis on exponential growth. MUTM is not simply catching up with the other two; it is already laying the groundwork to pass them.

The company, which manufactures chips for Nvidia and other tech giants, says this change is necessary as current systems burn too much electricity. At full load, Nvidia’s AI servers can use up to 1,200 watts, the same as keeping 1,000 U.S. homes running non-stop. That kind of energy drain isn’t sustainable, and TSMC is reportedly trying to fix it with smarter design. The approach revolves around building chips with smaller pieces called chiplets, each made with different tech, all packaged into one. But it’s not just about throwing pieces together. These new packages are being designed by AI software from firms like Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys, not by engineers alone. Cadence and Synopsys beat engineers on speed and accuracy Jim Chang, deputy director at TSMC’s 3DIC Methodology Group, showed off the results. Using Cadence and Synopsys software, chip designs that once took two days of human effort were finished by AI in five minutes. “That helps to max out TSMC technology’s capability, and we find this is very useful,” Jim said during his talk. The company sees this speed boost as key to getting more efficient chips to market faster. But not every problem can be solved with smarter code.Kaushik Veeraraghavan, an engineer at Meta’s infrastructure division, said during his keynote that the current chip manufacturing model is hitting physical walls.Moving data in and out of chips with traditional wires is slowing things down. Switching to optical connections could fix that, but right now, they’re still too unreliable for large data centers. “Really, this is not an engineering problem,” Kaushik said . “It’s a fundamental physical problem.” At the same event, Qualcomm launched a new set of chips, including one aimed squarely at business computers. The flagship, Snapdragon X2 Elite, is expected to ship next year with a new security feature called Guardian. Qualcomm pushes Guardian to compete in the business PC market Kedar Kondap, senior vice president of gaming and compute at Qualcomm, explained how Guardian works.The feature lets IT teams remotely connect to a laptop, even if it’s off, to push updates or give support.This kind of remote access has existed before, but Qualcomm plans to pair it with their 5G modem chips. That means companies could locate and manage laptops as long as they have a mobile signal. “Nobody else can offer something like that,” said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of Creative Strategies. “I can actually see that being attractive for a portion of the workforce and something that will get stronger interest in Qualcomm for enterprise fleets.” Qualcomm has been trying to grab a piece of the PC market for two years now, competing with Apple and Intel by offering energy-saving chips for Windows laptops. Intel still holds most of the corporate PC share and already had similar remote features, but Qualcomm’s wireless integration might give it an edge with businesses managing devices on the go.

The ETF, listed as NASDAQ:NCIQ, made the change last Thursday after updating its trust structure to meet the new criteria. The revised setup, filed under Form 8-K on Wednesday, includes a “Third Amended and Restated Trust Agreement” signed by Hashdex Asset Management Ltd. and CSC Delaware Trust Company, replacing the previous second agreement. The ETF, built in Delaware, is tagged as an “emerging growth company.” The filing didn’t show any changes to its fiscal year or include any new financial documents. The updated trust agreement was attached as an exhibit to the filing , confirming compliance with Nasdaq’s current listing demands. ETF issuers prepare for October launch Following the SEC’s vote to adopt the updated listing standards last week, several asset managers have kicked into gear. These new rules let qualified crypto ETFs skip the case-by-case review process, something that used to drag on for months. Under the old rules, approval could take as long as 270 days. Now, with the new setup, products can be cleared in as little as 75 days. “We’ve got about a dozen filings with the SEC now, and more coming,” said Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital Group. He confirmed that asset managers are already lining up, ready to take advantage of the rule change. “We’re all getting ready for a wave of launches,” he said. That wave is expected to hit hard in Q4 2025, according to Jonathan Groth at DGIM Law, who called this period a likely “boom time” for crypto ETFs. The rush began in July, when the SEC first proposed the changes. Since then, firms have scrambled to rewrite filings, address SEC feedback, and meet the updated standards. Sources familiar with the process say the final updates could be submitted by the end of the week. “These are the rules we had been anticipating,” said Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise. Fusaro says most filings are nearing the end of the review phase and could hit the market shortly. Analysts expect ETFs tracking SOL and XRP to debut in early October. New SEC rules speed up crypto ETF approvals To qualify for the new approval process, ETFs must meet at least one of three main requirements. One, the coin involved must trade on a regulated exchange, or have CFTC-regulated futures contracts that’ve been active for at least six months. Two, another ETF must already hold that coin with 40% of its assets directly invested in it, not via swaps or options. If any of those conditions are met, the ETF skips the red tape. But not every firm is ready to roll. “Not all of our existing filings qualify,” said Kyle DaCruz, head of digital assets at VanEck. “The next step is to talk to our lawyers to see which products can move forward and how rapidly will they get onto the market.” That said, Grayscale Investments didn’t wait around. Less than 48 hours after the SEC’s announcement, it converted its private fund into a public product: the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF (GDLC.P). This new ETF holds BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and cardano. According to Peter Mintzberg, CEO of Grayscale, their quick launch reflects their push for “public market access, regulatory clarity and product innovation.” The bigger question now is whether investors will actually care about ETFs tied to lesser-known coins. “There will be a flood of tokens that many folks have never heard of,” DaCruz warned. Unlike BTC, which took years to build trust, some of these coins may get only weeks or months of investor education before hitting the market.

The new cases cover personal protective equipment (PPE), medical instruments, advanced robotics, and industrial machinery, with department officials saying they will face higher tariffs if the investigations prove that they are a national security threat. The administration is asking companies for detailed breakdowns on expected demand, their ability to meet it with U.S. production, and how much of that demand depends on foreign suppliers, especially China. Commerce demands full breakdowns from companies on foreign reliance In documents reviewed by the press, Commerce officials requested that manufacturers explain “the extent to which domestic production of robotics and industrial machinery, and their parts and components can meet domestic demand,” and outline the role of foreign supply chains in meeting U.S. needs. This applies to everything from welding robots and machine tools to industrial ovens, laser cutters, and autoclaves. These probes also extend deep into the medical sector. Items under investigation include surgical masks, N95 respirators, gloves, gowns, and critical hospital supplies like IV bags, bandages, sutures, crutches, wheelchairs, and beds. The Commerce dept said that it is also requesting data on high-tech medical devices: pacemakers, coronary stents, insulin pumps, heart valves, orthopedic appliances, MRI machines, CT scanners, blood glucose monitors, hearing aids, and prosthetics are all listed. Companies must also report on how foreign subsidies and what officials call “predatory trade practices” are affecting U.S. supply chains. Gina Raimondo, the Secretary of Commerce, said the government is particularly focused on how countries like China are allegedly manipulating global trade in these critical sectors. In Gina’s words:- “We are looking at how foreign government actions impact the availability and reliability of these goods in the U.S.” While these investigations focus on medical and industrial goods, other probes are running separately. Prescription drugs and drones are being reviewed under different Section 232 tracks. But all are part of a broader strategy under President Trump to tighten U.S. control over strategic imports. The Commerce Department is not new to this approach. Similar probes are already underway on wind turbines, airplanes, semiconductors, heavy-duty trucks, polysilicon, copper, timber, lumber, and critical minerals. Officials say these industries are essential to both national defense and long-term economic security. Get seen where it counts.

The whole deal with Nvidia is built on spreading costs over time, and not dropping billions upfront. The artificial intelligence company wants to access Nvidia’s top-tier GPUs, but instead of buying them outright, it’s locking into long-term lease agreements. That way, the money goes out slowly, and the risk shifts to Nvidia.The arrangement is simple. As each new AI data center goes live, OpenAI gets access to more GPUs.The first center, being built in Abilene, Texas, is expected to go online in the second half of 2026. That’s when the cash starts flowing. The exact price of each center is still unknown, but OpenAI isn’t taking ownership of the hardware. It’s renting the compute. Every GPU deployed will be leased, with payments spread across their useful life, around five years. OpenAI delays costs by leasing Nvidia chips instead of buying Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, described the deal as “monumental in size.” He said building a single gigawatt AI data center could cost about $50 billion. Out of that, around $35 billion goes straight to Nvidia for its chips. The remaining is for everything else. But OpenAI isn’t paying that up front. By leasing the GPUs instead, the company avoids taking a financial hit all at once. OpenAI will get an initial $10 billion from the deal soon. That money helps kick off the first wave of deployment. And while some of the funds will be used for hiring, operations, and other expenses, the majority of it will go straight to compute. More specifically, to Nvidia’s processors. These GPUs are the engines behind AI training, powering models like ChatGPT and everything that runs on them. Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s chief financial officer, said in Abilene that the plan wouldn’t be possible without partners. She pointed to Oracle, which is leasing the Abilene data center, and Nvidia , which is providing equity up front in return for long-term payments. “Folks like Oracle are putting their balance sheets to work to create these incredible data centers you see behind us,” Sarah said. “In Nvidia’s case, they’re putting together some equity to get it jumpstarted, but importantly, they will get paid for all those chips as those chips get deployed.” Debt talks begin while Nvidia chips eat most of OpenAI’s cash OpenAI is not profitable. It doesn’t have positive cash flow, and it doesn’t hold investment-grade credit. That’s why financing data centers through equity is costly. Executives inside the company said they’re preparing to take on debt to handle the rest of the expansion. And thanks to the lease structure with Nvidia, banks are more comfortable lending. The terms look better when a company isn’t trying to buy everything outright. Sarah said the compute shortage is the bigger issue. “What I think we should all be focused on today is the fact that there’s not enough compute,” she said. “As the business grows, we will be more than capable of paying for what is in our future — more compute, more revenue.” But not everyone is thrilled about the way this is structured. Nvidia’s $4.3 trillion market cap has been built on selling chips to OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. At the same time, OpenAI’s $500 billion private valuation is only possible because of cash injections from Microsoft and others. That money doesn’t sit around. It goes right back to Nvidia. Jamie Zakalik, an analyst at Neuberger Berman, told CNBC the deal shows OpenAI raising capital and pouring it straight into the same company providing the tech. “It’s goosing up everyone’s earnings and everyone’s numbers,” Jamie said. “But it’s not actually creating anything.” When asked about those concerns, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman didn’t push back. “We need to keep selling services to consumers and businesses — and building these great new products that people pay us a lot of money for,” Sam said. “As long as that keeps happening, that pays for a lot of these data centers, a lot of chips.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Unpacking the Dunamu Naver Acquisition Rumors Recent media reports created a stir, indicating that Dunamu could be acquired by Naver Group. Specifically, these rumors suggested a comprehensive stock swap between Dunamu and Naver Financial, the entity behind Naver Pay. The proposed deal would reportedly make Dunamu a wholly-owned subsidiary of Naver Financial. This move would effectively integrate Dunamu into the broader Naver Group. It’s important to remember that Naver is the largest shareholder in Naver Financial, giving it significant influence. Despite these detailed reports, Dunamu has officially stated that nothing has been confirmed regarding a definitive Dunamu Naver acquisition . This provides a crucial counterpoint to the swirling speculation. Beyond Acquisition: What About Cooperation? While an outright acquisition remains unconfirmed, Dunamu did acknowledge ongoing discussions with Naver Pay. These talks are focused on various potential collaborations, extending beyond their existing partnerships. Currently, Dunamu and Naver Pay are already working together on several initiatives, including: Stablecoin development: Exploring the potential of digital currencies pegged to traditional assets. Unlisted stock trading: Facilitating transactions for shares not yet available on public exchanges. The company emphasized that while discussions are indeed happening, no specific details or agreements have been finalized. Therefore, the scope and nature of future cooperation are still taking shape. Why Does a Dunamu Naver Acquisition Matter? The mere rumor of a Dunamu Naver acquisition highlights the significant influence both companies wield in their respective sectors. Dunamu is a powerhouse in the South Korean crypto market, primarily through its Upbit exchange. On the other hand, Naver is a dominant tech giant, with Naver Pay being a leading digital payment service. A closer integration or acquisition could: Create Synergies: Combine Dunamu’s blockchain expertise with Naver’s vast user base and payment infrastructure. Expand Market Reach: Potentially introduce cryptocurrency services to a broader mainstream audience through Naver’s ecosystem. Impact Competition: Reshape the competitive landscape in both fintech and crypto industries in South Korea. However, such a deal would also face considerable challenges, including regulatory hurdles and complex integration processes. The market watches closely for any definitive announcements. The Future of Dunamu and Naver’s Relationship As of now, the narrative is clear: a Dunamu Naver acquisition is not confirmed. Dunamu has directly addressed the rumors, asserting that while cooperation talks are ongoing, no definitive deal is in place. The focus appears to be on expanding their existing collaborative efforts rather than a full merger. This situation underscores the dynamic nature of corporate partnerships in the fast-evolving digital economy. Investors and users alike will need to stay tuned for official updates from both Dunamu and Naver regarding their future plans. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is Dunamu being acquired by Naver?

While Binance traders are exhibiting a bullish stance, traders from other exchanges are still showing a degree of hesitation. Binance Traders Expecting Bitcoin Price Surge According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, fresh derivatives data from Binance is signaling shifting market dynamics – specifically, the recent BTC funding rate on Binance points toward traders taking a bullish stance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Above Mid-Term Holder Breakeven – Is A Fresh Rally Brewing? On the contrary, the BTC funding rate from other exchanges, such as OKX, Bybit, and Deribit, suggests that traders on these platforms are still uncertain about taking any directional bet. As of September 23, the BTC perpetual funding rate on Binance climbed to +0.0084%, suggesting that the long positions are dominant and traders are willing to pay a premium to maintain their bullish bets. It is worth highlighting that the increase in funding rate is not an isolated event, as it suggests a positive seven-day change, indicating strengthening conviction among Binance traders. For comparison, the BTC funding rate on OKX is currently hovering at -0.0001%, while on Bybit it sits at 0.0015%. Finally, Deribit shows a funding rate of 0.0019%. The analyst added: This isn’t just a difference in numbers; it’s a difference in narrative. While funding rates on OKX and Bybit have actually decreased over the last seven days, Binance’s rate has climbed. For the uninitiated, funding rates can be viewed as a real-time gauge of trader sentiment in the perpetual swaps market. A strong positive rate like that of Binance, which diverges from the rest of the market, points toward aggressive bullish speculation. Is BTC About To Make A Move? In a separate CryptoQuant post, contributor XWIN Research Japan noted that Bitcoin’s implied volatility has dropped to its lowest level since 2023. Back then, the lull in the market was followed by an explosive rally of 325%, which propelled BTC from $29,000 to $124,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Bearish Pressure As Exchange Inflows Stay Elevated – Will BTC Lose $112,000 Support? The analyst added that the total Bitcoin exchange reserves continue to deplete at a rapid pace, hitting new multi-year lows. Historically, such a fall in BTC exchange reserves has preceded supply squeezes, leading to a dramatic rise in demand. That said, the overall sentiment toward BTC appears to be cold at present. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index suggests that investors are fearful of entering the market, which may offer a good opportunity to accumulate BTC at current market prices. However, fresh data from BTC wallets confirms that new wallets – those that are less than a month old – are starting to buy the top digital asset. At press time, BTC trades at $113,796, up 1% in the past 24 hours.

52225563,588339,1758772837,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52225563.jpeg,"Ripple Powers New Offramp For BlackRock, VanEck Tokenized Fund",https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-new-offramp-blackrock-vaneck-tokenized-fund/,"Ripple has added another institutional rail to its stablecoin strategy: through an integration with Securitize, holders of BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized US Treasuries can now redeem fund shares for Ripple USD (RLUSD) around the clock—initially on Ethereum, with support for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in the pipeline. BlackRock And VanEck Turn To Ripple’s RLUSD In a press release dated September 23, Ripple and Securitize said a new smart-contract flow “would allow holders of BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL to exchange their shares … for Ripple USD (RLUSD),” describing the mechanism as “an additional stablecoin off ramp for BUIDL and VBILL tokenized short term treasury funds.” The companies emphasized continuous availability—“24/7”—and framed the upgrade as programmable liquidity for compliant, on-chain investment products. Securitize also confirmed it is integrating with the XRP Ledger “to expand access and bring new utility to the XRPL ecosystem.” Jack McDonald, Ripple’s SVP of Stablecoins, positioned the move as a bridge between tokenized funds and transactional money: “RLUSD is for institutional use, offering regulatory clarity, stability, and real utility. As adoption grows, partnerships with trusted platforms like Securitize are key to unlocking new liquidity and enterprise-grade use cases.” On X, McDonald distilled the news for market participants: “RLUSD is now a key stablecoin offramp for BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized fund holders. The integration is starting with ETH, though Securitize is planning to integrate with the XRP Ledger.” Ripple President Monica Long linked the Securitize integration to a broader RLUSD tokenization push announced the prior week with DBS and Franklin Templeton, where RLUSD serves as a “liquid, stable and compliant exchange mechanism for tokenized assets in lending and trading use cases.” “This week, Securitize added RLUSD as a new offramp for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized funds,” she noted. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse underscored the 24/7 redemption promise and the XRPL roadmap: “Very excited to share that BlackRock’s BUIDL and @VanEck_US’s VBILL tokenized fund holders can redeem shares for RLUSD/ETH 24/7 365 through Securitize, and soon to come RLUSD/XRPL. Enterprise-grade instant onchain liquidity at your fingertips. That’s real utility.” The companies framed the design as explicitly regulatory-first. Ripple said RLUSD is issued under a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) trust charter, with “1:1 USD backing by high-quality liquid assets, strict reserve management and asset segregation, third-party attestations and clear redemption rights.” Ripple added that since launch in late 2024, RLUSD has integrated into DeFi and cross-border payment flows and surpassed $700 million in market capitalization. For tokenized funds, the off-ramp matters because it stitches together yield-bearing on-chain treasuries with settlement-grade stablecoin liquidity. BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL are tokenized short-term US Treasury strategies issued through Securitize on public blockchains; the new workflow lets qualified holders convert fund shares into RLUSD without banking hours friction, potentially improving collateral mobility for trading, lending, repo and treasury operations. Ripple Puts New Focus On Tokenization The development also follows Ripple’s tie-up with DBS and Franklin Templeton , which is listing Franklin’s sgBENJI token on the DBS Digital Exchange alongside RLUSD to enable swapping between the tokenized fund and the stablecoin, and to explore using tokenized fund units as repo collateral—an example of how banks envisage tokenization rails meeting institutional liquidity needs. While the initial redemption path is live on Ethereum via Securitize, both firms signaled that XRPL integration is next, aligning with Ripple’s push to make RLUSD natively useful across multiple venues. If executed, XRPL support would extend the same institutional redemption mechanics to a different settlement environment—one that Ripple and parts of the treasury-tokenization market already touch via custody, payments, and prior Franklin Templeton XRPL issuance plans. Notably, BlackRock will be represented at Ripple Swell 2025 in New York on November 4–5 at Convene Hudson Yards. Maxwell Stein, BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, is slated to speak in a session titled “The Impact of Tokenized Financial Assets on Capital Markets,” alongside Rory Callagy of Moody’s.

52225667,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84336,1758772929,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: XRP Price Breakout Is Coming. Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-price-breakout-is-coming-heres-the-signal/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a well-known analyst, has shared his latest view on XRP using a chart projecting a major breakout. He shared a chart showing a technical formation that suggests price movement may soon accelerate. The chart highlights a descending triangle pattern that has formed over the past several weeks, with XRP trading between steadily lower highs and consistent support levels. It emphasizes price compression, a condition often associated with an eventual breakout. In this case, the descending trendline from above converges with horizontal support near $2.7. Steph’s chart projects a scenario where XRP could touch this level once more before rallying sharply to higher targets. #XRP BREAKOUT INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/T7FRBjUCcQ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 23, 2025 Current Pattern and Market Context The descending triangle displayed in the post reflects a period of consolidation . The digital asset began forming this structure in July, following a sharp rise to its all-time high . The asset moved into this contracting structure, with sellers consistently pressuring the price at lower points while buyers defended a defined support line. This has led to sideways action for several months. Such a pattern typically indicates that a decisive move is nearing. Traders often monitor these levels to identify when momentum is about to shift. The chart suggests that XRP may soon break out of this tightening range, either confirming continued strength or revealing further weakness. Steph’s projection leans toward an upward resolution. XRP’s Next Target The chart provides a clear upward trajectory for XRP once it breaks out of this consolidation phase. Steph’s chart suggests the asset could surpass $4.5, potentially reaching $5, a level other experts have recently predicted . XRP is currently trading at $2.84, and a climb to $5 represents a 76.06% surge for the digital asset. Traders considering these targets will likely watch closely for confirmation of strength above the descending trendline, as that would serve as a signal that the projected path may be underway. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the Structure Matters Periods of consolidation following strong rallies can act as staging grounds for the next leg of a move. The extended sideways action has kept XRP trading in a narrow range, allowing the market to digest earlier gains. For analysts such as Steph, the pattern forming now represents a point of interest because it suggests an imminent resolution. Many analysts share Steph’s bullish outlook for XRP. The structure provides traders with reference points for risk management and opportunity. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The price is now struggling to clear $3.00 and might decline again below the $2.80 zone. XRP price is moving lower below the $2.920 support zone. The price is now trading near $2.90 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it dips below $2.850. XRP Price Faces Hurdles XRP price found support near $2.680 and recently started a recovery wave, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to surpass the $2.80 and $2.85 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the main decline from the $3.138 swing high to the $2.678 low. However, the bears are active near the $3.00 resistance. The price faced rejection near $3.00 and reacted to the downside. The price is now trading near $2.90 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.95 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.9620 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the main decline from the $3.138 swing high to the $2.678 low. A clear move above the $2.9620 resistance might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.050 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.120. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.9620 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.880 level. The next major support is near the $2.850 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.850 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.780. The next major support sits near the $2.70 zone, below which the price could gain bearish momentum. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.880 and $2.850.

This impressive turnaround marks the end of a two-day streak of outflows, signaling renewed investor confidence and a significant positive shift in the market. It’s a moment that has many in the crypto community buzzing about what this fresh capital infusion means for the future of digital assets. Why are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attracting Fresh Capital? The recent surge in capital flowing into US spot Bitcoin ETFs is a clear indicator of strong demand and a bullish sentiment returning to the market. On September 24, these exchange-traded funds collectively welcomed $241 million, showcasing a robust appetite from investors.

Leading the charge among these funds was BlackRock’s IBIT, which alone captured an impressive $130 million in net inflows. This dominant performance highlights the strong brand recognition and trust that institutional giants bring to the crypto space. Following closely, Fidelity’s FBTC secured $29.7 million, demonstrating its significant role in attracting retail and institutional capital.

A sustained period of positive inflows could indicate a strengthening belief in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, potentially leading to increased price stability and growth. However, it is essential for investors to remember that the crypto market can still be volatile. While ETFs offer a regulated entry point, the underlying asset, Bitcoin, remains subject to market fluctuations. Actionable insights for those considering investment: Do Your Research: Understand the specific ETF you are investing in and its underlying mechanics.

What began as a speculative asset for individual investors is now increasingly finding a home on corporate balance sheets, marking a pivotal moment for the digital currency. Why Are Public Companies Holding Bitcoin? The latest data highlights this significant move: over 50 publicly listed companies have now accumulated more than 1,000 BTC each. Furthermore, the top 100 firms involved in Bitcoin investment each hold over 100 BTC. This isn’t just a handful of early adopters anymore; it’s a broad and accelerating trend among major corporations. But what’s driving this institutional embrace? Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a strong hedge against inflation, especially in an era of quantitative easing and rising fiat currency concerns. It’s seen as a store of value, similar to digital gold. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to traditional portfolios offers diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall risk and enhancing returns. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Investing in Bitcoin aligns companies with technological innovation and positions them at the forefront of the digital economy. It signals a forward-thinking approach. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, attracting companies seeking substantial returns on their treasury assets. The Growing Wave of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption This increasing commitment from public companies hold Bitcoin is a testament to the digital asset’s maturing ecosystem. Pioneering firms have led the charge, demonstrating that it is feasible and potentially profitable to integrate Bitcoin into corporate treasury strategies. This growing adoption by institutional players provides a layer of legitimacy and stability to the cryptocurrency market. The fact that so many significant entities are now involved means that Bitcoin is no longer solely a retail phenomenon. Instead, it is becoming an integral part of the global financial landscape. This institutional validation can help to reduce perceived risks and encourage even more conservative companies to consider similar moves in the future. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Public Companies Holding Bitcoin While the benefits are clear, public companies hold Bitcoin also face unique challenges. Volatility remains a primary concern, as large price swings can impact quarterly earnings and balance sheet valuations. Regulatory uncertainty is another factor, with different jurisdictions adopting varying stances on cryptocurrency assets. However, the opportunities often outweigh these challenges. For instance, the potential for significant capital appreciation can boost shareholder value. Furthermore, being an early mover in this space can enhance a company’s brand image as innovative and adaptable. Companies are increasingly developing sophisticated strategies to manage these holdings, including custodial solutions and risk management frameworks. Risk Management: Companies are implementing robust strategies to mitigate volatility, such as dollar-cost averaging and secure cold storage solutions. Regulatory Compliance: Staying abreast of evolving regulations is crucial, requiring dedicated legal and compliance teams. Public Perception: Communicating the rationale behind Bitcoin investments transparently helps manage stakeholder expectations and public perception. What Does This Mean for the Broader Market? The increasing number of public companies hold Bitcoin sends a powerful signal to the global financial markets. It suggests a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition and its role in the future economy. This institutional interest contributes to deeper liquidity, greater market efficiency, and potentially less susceptibility to extreme price manipulations. For individual investors, this trend can be seen as a strong vote of confidence, potentially fostering greater trust and encouraging broader adoption. It highlights Bitcoin’s transition from a niche digital asset to a recognized, albeit still volatile, financial instrument with significant institutional backing. Conclusion: A New Era of Corporate Finance The remarkable surge in the number of public companies holding significant amounts of Bitcoin underscores a profound shift in corporate financial strategy. From inflation hedging to diversification and embracing innovation, the motivations are clear. While challenges exist, the opportunities presented by Bitcoin are compelling enough for a growing number of firms to integrate it into their treasury operations.

While many of the industry’s titans are busy striking multi-billion-dollar deals to solidify their positions, Google Cloud is charting a remarkably different, yet equally ambitious, course. It’s not just about securing today’s giants; it’s about brilliantly capturing tomorrow’s innovators – the burgeoning AI Startups that will define the next era of technology. This strategic pivot has profound implications for the entire Cloud Market and the future of Generative AI , signaling a bold wager on the power of emerging talent. The Shifting Tides: Why Google Cloud is Targeting AI Startups The AI revolution is here, and it’s reshaping industries at an unprecedented pace. The colossal partnerships dominating headlines, such as the recent $100 billion alliance between Nvidia and OpenAI for massive chip purchases, demonstrate a trend towards consolidation among established players. These deals, while impressive in scale, often involve non-exclusive agreements, creating a complex web of dependencies. However, Google Cloud, under the strategic guidance of COO Francis deSouza, sees a different path to leadership. DeSouza, with a rich background spanning genomics (Illumina) and AI safety (Synth Labs), understands the transformative power of machine learning from multiple vantage points. Now, at Google Cloud, he’s orchestrating a massive wager on what he calls AI’s “second wave” – focusing intently on the next generation of AI Startups . DeSouza’s conviction is backed by compelling data: Nine out of the top 10 AI labs currently leverage Google’s infrastructure. Nearly all Generative AI unicorns run on Google Cloud. A staggering 60% of all generative AI startups worldwide have chosen Google as their cloud provider. Google Cloud has secured an impressive $58 billion in new revenue commitments over the next two years, more than double its current annual run rate. “AI is resetting the cloud market, and Google Cloud is leading the way, especially with startups,” deSouza notes. This understated delivery masks an ambitious strategy: to home in on upstarts while the biggest players are busy striking lucrative but non-exclusive partnerships. This approach acknowledges that in today’s dynamic tech environment, a startup can evolve into a multi-billion-dollar enterprise in a remarkably short period. Capturing these future unicorns early could prove far more valuable than vying for today’s established giants. The Competitive Landscape: Mega-Deals Reshaping the Cloud Market To truly appreciate Google Cloud’s distinctive strategy, it’s essential to understand the scale of consolidation sweeping across the AI Infrastructure and Cloud Market . Major players are making enormous bets, cementing partnerships that redefine industry dynamics. Here’s a snapshot of the current high-stakes environment: Partnership Key Players Value / Commitment Impact on Cloud Market AI Chip Alliance Nvidia, OpenAI $100 Billion Deepens mutual dependence, secures massive chip purchases for advanced AI. Cloud & AI Power Microsoft, OpenAI ~$14 Billion Fundamentally reshaped the cloud market, integrating AI deeply into Microsoft’s offerings. Customized AI Amazon, Anthropic $8 Billion Secured deep hardware customizations, tailoring AI training to Amazon’s infrastructure. Enterprise AI Oracle, OpenAI $30 Billion (initial), $300 Billion (5-year from 2027) Emerged as a surprise winner, securing massive long-term commitments for AI workloads. Hybrid Cloud AI Meta, Google Cloud $10 Billion Meta leverages Google Cloud despite building its own infrastructure, highlighting hybrid strategies. “Stargate” Project Trump Admin, SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle $500 Billion Adds another layer to these interlocking partnerships, potentially shaping future infrastructure. These gigantic deals might initially appear threatening for Google Cloud, suggesting it’s being cut out of some frenzied dealmaking. However, Google’s strategy indicates a clear understanding that while these partnerships are lucrative, they are often non-exclusive and focused on existing giants. This leaves a significant opening for Google to cultivate the next wave of innovators. How Google Cloud Empowers the Next Wave of AI Startups Instead of battling for established titans, Google Cloud is signing smaller, yet highly promising, companies like Loveable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners.” This approach requires no major upfront investments from the startups, making it an attractive proposition for lean, agile teams. It’s a pragmatic reflection of the market: capturing future unicorns before they mature could prove to be a superior long-term strategy. The support for AI Startups extends far beyond simple customer acquisition. Google offers a comprehensive ecosystem designed to foster growth and innovation: Generous Cloud Credits: Startups receive $350,000 in cloud credits, significantly reducing their initial operational costs and allowing them to focus resources on development. Access to Technical Teams: Direct access to Google’s world-class technical experts helps startups navigate complex challenges and optimize their AI models. Go-to-Market Support: Integration into Google’s marketplace provides crucial visibility and pathways to potential customers, accelerating growth. “No Compromise” AI Stack: Google Cloud provides a complete AI stack – from custom chips (TPUs) to models (Gemini) and applications – with an “open ethos.” This ensures customers have choice and flexibility at every layer, a critical factor for innovative Generative AI development. “Companies love the fact that they can get access to our AI stack, they can get access to our teams to understand where our technologies are going,” deSouza emphasizes. “They also love that they’re getting access to enterprise grade Google class infrastructure.” This combination of robust technology and dedicated support creates a powerful incentive for emerging AI companies. The “Open Ethos” and Google’s Unique AI Infrastructure Google Cloud’s commitment to an “open ethos” is a cornerstone of its strategy. This is particularly evident in its approach to AI Infrastructure . While Google develops its own cutting-edge AI models like Gemini, it also hosts competitors like Anthropic’s Claude model through its Vertex AI platform. This seemingly paradoxical stance – competing while enabling – is a deliberate choice. Google’s infrastructure advantage became even clearer with recent reports revealing its behind-the-scenes efforts to expand its custom AI chip business. Google has begun placing its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in other cloud providers’ data centers, including a significant agreement with Fluidstack for a New York facility, backed by up to $3.2 billion in financial support. This move positions Google’s custom hardware as a foundational component across the broader Cloud Market , even for its rivals. The company’s history of open-source contributions, from Kubernetes to the foundational “Attention is All You Need” paper that enabled the transformer architecture underlying most modern AI, further underscores this philosophy. More recently, Google published an open-source protocol called Agent-to-Agent (A2A) for inter-agent communication, demonstrating its continued commitment to openness even in highly competitive areas like Generative AI development. “We have made the explicit choice over the years to be open at every layer of the stack, and we know that this means companies can absolutely take our technology and use it to build a competitor at the next layer,” deSouza acknowledges. “That’s been happening for decades. That’s something we are okay with.” This willingness to foster an ecosystem, even at the risk of enabling future competitors, is a defining characteristic of Google Cloud’s long-term vision. Navigating Regulatory Scrutiny and Future Prospects for the Cloud Market Google Cloud’s aggressive courtship of AI Startups comes at a critical juncture, particularly with ongoing regulatory scrutiny. A recent federal court ruling in the government’s search monopoly case highlighted concerns about Google leveraging its search dominance to stifle competition in AI. Critics worry that Google’s vast data trove provides an unfair advantage and that the company might replicate monopolistic tactics. However, by positioning itself as an open platform that empowers rather than controls the next generation of AI companies, Google Cloud may be subtly demonstrating to regulators that it fosters competition. Its strategy of supporting a diverse range of Generative AI startups, providing them with essential AI Infrastructure and resources, can be seen as a powerful counter-narrative to claims of anti-competitive behavior. This strategic move not only secures future revenue streams but also strengthens Google’s defense in the face of regulatory pressure. DeSouza, for his part, remains focused on the positive, transformative outcomes that Google Cloud can enable. He envisions a future where Google Cloud powers groundbreaking research into major diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and accelerates climate technologies. “We want to work very hard to make sure that we are pioneering the technologies that will enable that work,” he affirms. This long-term vision, coupled with a robust strategy for capturing emerging talent, positions Google Cloud as a formidable force in shaping the future of the Cloud Market . Actionable Insights for Innovators and Businesses For innovators and businesses, especially those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space looking to leverage AI, Google Cloud’s strategy presents a compelling proposition: For AI Startups: Google Cloud offers a unique blend of financial support, technical expertise, and a flexible, open AI Infrastructure that can accelerate development and market entry. The focus on early-stage companies means tailored support for rapid growth. For Established Enterprises: The competition fostered by Google’s approach ensures a dynamic and innovative Cloud Market , offering more choice and advanced services for integrating Generative AI into existing operations. For Investors: Google Cloud’s aggressive pursuit of promising AI Startups indicates where the next wave of innovation is likely to emerge, offering insights into potential investment opportunities within the broader AI ecosystem. Google Cloud is not merely participating in the AI race; it’s strategically redefining its role within the Cloud Market . By focusing on nurturing the next generation of AI Startups and providing an unparalleled AI Infrastructure , it’s making a profound statement about the future of technology. This isn’t just about market share; it’s about shaping the very fabric of innovation for decades to come, especially in the burgeoning field of Generative AI .

At the time of writing, XLM trades around $0.36, down 0.56% on the daily charts and 4.2% weekly. Related Reading: XRP Gets A Retirement Twist: Expert Calls It A 401(k) Despite the short-term weakness, analysts suggest that the altcoin’s recent bounce could set the stage for a move toward $0.50 and beyond. The $0.37 level has historically acted as both resistance and support, making it a decisive zone for future price action. A reclaim above this mark could push XLM toward the long-standing descending resistance near $0.48, with a breakout potentially triggering a stronger rally. Technical Indicators Signal Mixed Outlook Market data highlights both caution and opportunity for Stellar traders. Momentum indicators remain balanced, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) close to neutral at 50 and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) slightly above zero. While these readings suggest indecision, the broader technical setup indicates a potential bullish reversal. Analysts also observe a developing wedge pattern on the daily chart, which often signals a possible upside breakout. If bulls can sustain momentum and push the price above $0.41, the next targets are between $0.58 and $0.80. Conversely, failing to hold above $0.35 could expose the token to declines toward $0.30 or even $0.21. XLM's price moving sideways on the daily chart.

The fund, created by 21Shares, has appeared on a key U.S. financial platform that prepares for market trading. The Dogecoin ETF is still awaiting approval, and the final decision rests with U.S. regulators as they continue their review. 21Shares Dogecoin ETF TDOG Appears On DTCC Platform Swiss asset management company 21Shares has placed its new Dogecoin ETF , trading under the ticker TDOG, on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) platform. By appearing on the DTCC’s “Active and Pre-Launch” list, the Dogecoin ETF is now visible to broker-dealers, who can begin operational checks, such as setting up the ticker and completing clearing procedures. The listing mirrors what happened in the past with spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, where DTCC listings came before official trading. However, it is essential to note that this listing itself does not mean the SEC has approved the Dogecoin ETF . It is part of the standard process that sets the stage but does not guarantee the outcome. Seeing TDOG appear on the DTCC website also highlights the rising level of institutional attention around Dogecoin. Grayscale filed a spot Dogecoin ETF shortly after the SEC delayed 21Shares’ filing. Meanwhile, Rex-Osprey launched a hybrid Dogecoin ETF last week, which saw higher-than-expected trading on its first day. A listing like this helps confirm that investor demand is strong enough to support such a product; however, the actual launch still depends on the subsequent regulatory step. If approval comes and trading begins, TDOG ETF could increase confidence in Dogecoin as a legitimate asset and expand its role in the cryptocurrency market. SEC Approval Remains The Final Step Before Trading Although the Dogecoin ETF now appears on the DTCC platform, it cannot trade without approval from the SEC. The regulator is carefully reviewing the filing from 21Shares to ensure it meets all requirements. Even with the DTCC listing, the ETF’s legal status remains unchanged. The DTCC step is progressing, but trading will only commence once the SEC gives its official approval. The process at the SEC usually involves public comment periods, agency feedback, and detailed compliance checks. It can take time, and approval timelines are often unpredictable . The SEC has already pushed back its decision once, noting it needed more time to review the fund’s compliance with Nasdaq’s rules. If the SEC grants approval, the Dogecoin ETF would be listed on U.S. exchanges, providing investors with direct exposure to Dogecoin in a regulated product . The 21Shares Dogecoin ETF (TDOG) is now available on the DTCC platform. For now, the TDOG ETF is still under review. Its future depends entirely on the SEC’s decision, which is the final step before it can trade.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-25 05:00:58

BTC is now lagging behind money supply growth by around 70 days, whereas gold has maintained an almost perfect correlation. It is a tale of “cross-asset correlations amid secular dollar weakness and geopolitical risk,” said Consorti, who added, “gold is high beta risk-off, BTC is high beta risk-on.” Bitcoin has been trading more like a high-risk tech stock rather than a safe haven inflation hedge. More Liquidity Not Benefitting Bitcoin Global money supply increases when central banks print more fiat for monetary easing policies. This increases liquidity in the financial system, which enables more money for allocation to riskier assets such as crypto. Bitcoin has not tracked global M2 with a ~70-day lag since early May.

It has reached an all-time high in the United States this week of around $22.2 trillion, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve. M2 expansion started in early 2024 and has increased by more than 7% since then. It has been described as “relentless debasement baked into the system,” as every new dollar printed dilutes the old ones. Additionally, the US dollar has weakened significantly this year. The dollar index (DXY) – a measure of the greenback against a basket of currencies – has slumped 12% since the beginning of this year to its lowest level since early 2022 this month. This should all be gravy for Bitcoin, but the asset has remained sideways for the past three months and is 9% down from its all-time high. Goldbug Peter Schiff claimed it was already in a bear market, stating that it has dropped 20% against gold since its August peak. What the crypto critic failed to mention is that BTC has gained 78% over the past 12 months, whereas gold is up 42%. Whether you like it or not, bitcoin’s value is very much linked to its scarcity.

Its efficiency, speed, and cost advantages position it as a practical tool for financial institutions seeking to move away from legacy systems. With XRP’s growing prominence in the cross-border payment market, SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a prominent crypto researcher, has shared an excerpt from the Review of Banking & Financial Law highlighting Ripple’s potential role in international payments. The excerpt included Morgan Stanley’s analysis of Ripple’s distributed ledger and its capacity to act as an alternative to existing systems such as SWIFT. By sharing this, SMQKE presented how traditional financial research and institutional perspectives view Ripple’s technology. “Morgan Stanley considers Ripple to be a leading international payment alternative to SWIFT.” Documented. https://t.co/FEi7axe5pk pic.twitter.com/oVtaT3WwHY — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 23, 2025 Key Insights from the Document The highlighted text reveals that “Morgan Stanley has stated that adopting a Ripple-like payment system could ‘shorten settlement periods, speed up transactions and reduce the risk of fraud.’” The same section also noted that “Morgan Stanley considers Ripple to be a leading international payment alternative to Swift .” This evaluation places Ripple and XRP, which powers its payment network, in a unique position within the financial sector because it is being recognized not just as another blockchain project but as a direct challenger to one of the most established payment networks in the world. Morgan Stanley’s analysis suggests that Ripple’s efficiency provides a practical solution for banks . The ability to reduce settlement times and lower risks could encourage adoption among institutions seeking faster, more secure transactions. Such statements carry weight when they come from a leading investment bank, as they suggest that XRP is not only being studied but is also being considered as a realistic option for global payment infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Matters for XRP Recognition from a major financial institution provides validation of XRP’s utility. If banks adopt Ripple’s system more widely, XRP could benefit directly from higher usage in settlement processes. The cost savings highlighted in the document, such as lowering remittance fees and increasing the funds received by end users, also illustrate practical value that could encourage growth in adoption. This acknowledgment also demonstrates that XRP is being compared to existing global solutions rather than just other digital assets. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have their strengths, Morgan Stanley’s reference to XRP as a leading international payment alternative places it as a strong competitor in a space traditionally dominated by centralized systems. That positioning strengthens the case for XRP’s relevance in future financial infrastructure . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The price of Yes-side shares for the betting contract ""U.S. government shutdown in 2025?"" rose to 77%, the highest since the contract's launch in January. Traders are essentially pricing a 77% probability that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management will announce a shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations by Dec. 31. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a shutdown by Oct. 1 stood at 63%. According to media reports, the White House is preparing for large-scale job cuts in the event of a shutdown. On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo asking agencies to prepare plans for staff reductions and furloughs if a spending bill is not passed next week. The government is reportedly expected to run out of money by the end of September. To prevent the resulting shutdown, Congress must either approve a short-term funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, or pass 12 full-year funding bills. Since lawmakers won’t finish the full-year bills before the deadline, a temporary funding stopgap is needed. More importantly, to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to pass funding bills, support from both parties is usually necessary. BTC, ETH under pressure Ether fell over 3% in Asia, almost testing $4,000 for the first time Aug. 8, with bitcoin (BTC) falling over 1% to under $112,000. Other major tokens such as XRP (XRP), solana (SOL) and dogecoin (DOGE) fell by 2.6% to 3%. Solana's SOL appeared set to break below $200. The CoinDesk 20 Index was down 2% at 3,940 points. Meanwhile, futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, traded flat to positive. Although the exact cause of the cautious crypto market sentiment was not clear at the time of writing, growing concerns about a potential government shutdown may have contributed to the risk-averse mood among investors. Furthermore, overnight comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly reiterated her support for further rate cuts, but declined to provide a timeline, instead stressing data dependence, which may have hurt sentiment. The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points on Sept. 17 while hinting at two more rate cuts by the year's end. Since then, policymakers, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have signaled a cautious approach to future rate cuts. Seven Fed officials, including the New York Fed's Williams, are scheduled to speak on Thursday. Meanwhile, traders are awaiting Friday's PCE data, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation.

This significant shift has caught the attention of investors worldwide, sparking discussions about market stability and future trends. On platforms like Binance, ETH was recently observed trading at $3,995, reflecting a notable 3.66% decline. This movement is more than just a number; it signals a potential shift in momentum for the second-largest cryptocurrency. What Triggered This Urgent Ethereum Price Drop? The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic environment, and an Ethereum price drop often results from a confluence of factors. While no single event can be definitively pinpointed for this recent dip below $4,000, several influences are typically at play: Broader Market Sentiment: A general downturn in the wider crypto market, often led by Bitcoin’s performance, can drag ETH prices down. Macroeconomic Concerns: Global economic indicators, such as inflation reports or central bank policy decisions, frequently impact investor appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, some investors may choose to sell off their holdings to realize profits, leading to temporary price corrections. Technical Resistance: For many traders, $4,000 represented a psychological and technical support level. Breaking below it can trigger further sell-offs as stop-loss orders are activated. This complex interplay of forces means that understanding market movements requires a holistic view, looking beyond just the immediate price action. How Does an ETH Price Dip Impact Your Portfolio? For many investors, seeing an Ethereum price drop can naturally cause concern. However, it’s important to approach such market movements with a strategic mindset. A dip can present both challenges and opportunities. Challenges: Portfolio Value Reduction: The most immediate impact is a decrease in the fiat value of your ETH holdings. Emotional Stress: Market volatility can be stressful, potentially leading to impulsive decisions. Opportunities: “Buy the Dip”: For those with capital, a lower price point can be an attractive entry or accumulation opportunity. Rebalancing: It might be a good time to reassess your portfolio allocation and adjust your positions. Understanding your personal risk tolerance and investment goals is paramount during these times. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Consider After an Ethereum Price Drop? When facing market volatility, especially an unexpected Ethereum price drop , making informed decisions is key. Instead of reacting emotionally, consider these actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum. What are its long-term prospects? Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term market fluctuations and Ethereum’s long-term potential as a foundational blockchain technology. Many seasoned investors advocate for a “HODL” strategy during dips, focusing on the asset’s future utility and adoption. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of volatility over time. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of major crypto news, technological developments, and broader economic trends. However, avoid letting constant news cycles dictate your strategy. Remember, market corrections are a natural part of any asset class, and crypto is no exception. They often precede periods of recovery and growth. The recent Ethereum price drop below $4,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency market. While such movements can be unsettling, they also underscore the importance of informed decision-making, strategic planning, and a long-term perspective. Ethereum continues to be a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems, with ongoing developments and upgrades promising future innovation. By understanding the dynamics at play and adopting a resilient approach, investors can better navigate these challenging yet opportunity-rich periods. Frequently Asked Questions About the Ethereum Price Drop Q1: What does it mean when ETH falls below a key psychological level like $4,000? A1: When ETH falls below a significant level like $4,000, it can trigger increased selling pressure as some traders might have stop-loss orders set at or around that price. It also often signals a shift in market sentiment, moving from bullish to more cautious or bearish in the short term, as investors re-evaluate their positions. Q2: Is an Ethereum price drop a sign of a market crash? A2: Not necessarily. An Ethereum price drop , even a significant one, is often a market correction rather than a full-blown crash. Market corrections are natural and healthy, allowing prices to consolidate before potentially resuming an upward trend. A “crash” typically implies a much larger, rapid, and sustained decline across the entire market, usually triggered by systemic issues. Q3: Should I sell my ETH holdings if the price drops further? A3: The decision to sell or hold depends entirely on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. It’s crucial to avoid emotional decisions. Many long-term investors choose to “HODL” (hold on for dear life) during dips, or even “buy the dip” to average down their cost basis. Consult a financial advisor if you are unsure. Q4: What role does Bitcoin play in an Ethereum price drop? A4: Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the broader cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin experiences significant price movements, either up or down, other altcoins like Ethereum tend to follow suit. This is due to Bitcoin’s dominant market capitalization and its influence on overall market sentiment and liquidity. A dip in BTC often leads to an Ethereum price drop as well.

With its innovative technology and higher transaction speed, Layer Brett will provide additional advantages to investors. ADA’s Path to Recovery Cardano (ADA) has been resilient in the cryptocurrency market, with its price currently at $0.81. Recent predictions estimate that ADA is likely to hit a high of $1.20 by the end of 2025, which means that the coin will recover. The interest of the institutions and the recent development of technology drive this optimistic prediction. The introduction of the Hydra scaling solution has greatly enhanced the transaction throughput of Cardano, making it a formidable competitor in the blockchain industry. Moreover, the fact that Cardano was incorporated in the U.S. strategic crypto reserve has contributed to investor confidence. However, challenges remain. Whale activity has brought volatility and major sell-offs, which are affecting the stability of the ADA price. These fluctuations notwithstanding, the fundamental underpinnings are promising for the recovery path of ADA. Short-term volatility is still to happen, but the long-term outlook of the Cardano recovery is optimistic due to the technology and strategic prospects. LBRETT: Where the Smart Money Is Headed Next While Cardano predictions point to a potential recovery, the conversation seems to be shifting elsewhere, towards Layer Brett. Unlike many meme coins that rely on nostalgia or viral moments, Layer Brett is driven by purpose. It’s not a token waiting for utility; it’s already operational. As an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Layer Brett processes transactions at a fraction of the cost and with significantly faster speeds than the typical meme coins. Gas fees? Just pennies. Transaction speeds? Practically instant. However, the real attraction lies in staking. Early investors are securing rewards exceeding 630% APY, and with the presale still ongoing, entry points are low, offering substantial upside potential. This is why so many traders are shifting their attention. While Cardano remains a major market player, it struggles to meet current demands: real utility, returns, and robust infrastructure. Layer Brett delivers on all these fronts, while still embracing the fun, meme-driven culture that many in the space enjoy. The project’s community is also growing rapidly. The social interaction is good, and the ecosystem is steadying even before launching itself officially. This is not a temporary fad but an actual ecosystem that is in the process of development. To investors who spent their money on the first wave of meme coins or are disappointed in the slow recovery of Cardano, Layer Brett offers a new product with a great chance. Though it’s still early, that’s exactly why it’s worth considering now. Conclusion While Cardano price predictions remain hopeful, investors seeking the next big opportunity are already eyeing the future. Layer Brett isn’t relying on past trends; it’s delivering real-time infrastructure, rewards, and substantial growth potential. This shift in focus speaks volumes about where savvy investors are placing their bets for 2025. Don’t wait until the presale ends. Layer Brett is moving fast, and the opportunity to buy in early at record speed won’t last long.

International Business Settlement, a prominent Hong Kong-listed firm, has made a substantial Hong Kong Bitcoin purchase , acquiring 106 BTC for an impressive $12 million. This move is more than just a transaction; it represents a powerful statement about the growing confidence of traditional financial entities in the digital asset space. What Does This Bold Hong Kong Bitcoin Purchase Signify? This strategic investment by International Business Settlement (IBS) underscores a noticeable shift in corporate treasury strategies. For many years, Bitcoin was primarily the domain of individual investors and tech enthusiasts. However, we are now witnessing a robust trend of institutional adoption. IBS, a company known for its financial services and fintech solutions, is clearly positioning itself for the future. Their decision to execute this Hong Kong Bitcoin purchase suggests a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its potential as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. This kind of corporate endorsement adds immense credibility to the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Why Are Hong Kong Firms Leading the Charge in Crypto? Hong Kong has been proactively fostering an environment conducive to digital asset innovation. The region’s regulators have been working towards creating a clear and robust framework for cryptocurrencies, aiming to become a global hub for virtual assets. This progressive stance encourages local firms like IBS to explore and integrate digital assets into their operations. The clear regulatory landscape provides a sense of security and legitimacy that traditional businesses require before making such significant investments. Therefore, this Hong Kong Bitcoin purchase is not an isolated event but rather a reflection of a broader, supportive ecosystem. The Growing Global Wave of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption International Business Settlement is joining a growing list of public companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Pioneers like MicroStrategy and Tesla paved the way, demonstrating that corporate Bitcoin holdings can be a viable strategy for asset diversification and potential growth. These companies view Bitcoin as a strategic asset, aligning with the narrative of ‘digital gold’. Key benefits driving this trend include: Diversification: Bitcoin offers an alternative asset class, reducing reliance on traditional financial instruments. Inflation Hedge: Its fixed supply makes it attractive during periods of economic uncertainty. Technological Alignment: Investing in Bitcoin demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to financial technology. Potential Returns: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown strong long-term growth potential. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Crypto While the benefits are clear, corporate crypto adoption is not without its challenges. Volatility remains a primary concern for many businesses. The price of Bitcoin can fluctuate significantly, impacting the value of a company’s holdings. Furthermore, the regulatory environment, while improving in places like Hong Kong, can still be complex and varies across different jurisdictions. Companies also need robust solutions for custody and security of their digital assets. Managing these risks effectively is crucial for any firm contemplating a similar Hong Kong Bitcoin purchase . However, the increasing availability of institutional-grade services is making these challenges more manageable. In conclusion, International Business Settlement’s Hong Kong Bitcoin purchase is a significant development. It not only highlights the firm’s strategic vision but also reinforces the accelerating trend of institutional adoption within the cryptocurrency market. As more companies follow suit, Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape will undoubtedly continue to expand, cementing its position as a crucial asset for the modern era.

While many legacy crypto coins are losing momentum, analysts are pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a protocol that could set the pace heading into the 2026 altseason. With a presale price of $0.035 and a roadmap built around real utility, projections of a run toward $2 are being taken seriously by those looking for long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a different vision for decentralized finance by blending secure dual lending, borrowing, and staking into one platform. The models are based on P2C and P2P lending, where users will be able to earn on set and negotiated terms. The design features a buy-and-distribute system, where platform revenues are recycled into open-market token buybacks and redistributed to mtToken stakers. On top of that, a stablecoin pegged to $1 will soon play a key role in borrowing, repayment, and liquidity management, adding another layer of recurring demand. With Layer-2 integration, the protocol will deliver fast and low-cost transactions, while its upcoming beta launch will give users a live environment to test collateralized loans, mtToken staking, and rewards. Features like the dashboard and Top 50 leaderboard will gamify participation, encouraging users to track ROI and compete for recognition, locking in long-term engagement. Momentum around the presale is already proving that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has strong community backing. The project is now in Phase 6, with the token priced at $0.035. Around $16.23 million has been raised so far, supported by more than 16,600 holders, and half of the $170 million allocation for this stage has already been sold. The total supply of MUTM is capped at 4 billion, and the project has undergone security checks with CertiK, scoring 90 on Token Scan and 79 on Skynet. The revised audit timeline is set for May 20, 2025, further underlining the commitment to transparency and safety. Phase 7 will increase the token price to $0.040, a 15% jump from the current level. For investors, the presale traction signals two important things: liquidity is flowing into the project, and there is confidence in the design. Those who secure tokens now are locking in exposure at discounted levels ahead of key milestones such as the beta launch, stablecoin deployment, and expected global exchange listings. The ability for users to experience live loans, mtToken staking mechanics, and automated buybacks during beta will strengthen trust and encourage broader participation, making Phase 6 one of the most strategic entry points before listings push visibility to new heights. Path toward $2 before the 2026 altseason The case for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaching $2 is built on multiple demand drivers working in sync. The beta launch will introduce early adoption, giving investors and institutions alike the confidence of seeing real functionality in action. Layer-2 integration will ensure that this activity is fast and affordable, removing the friction that often keeps new users away from decentralized platforms. At the same time, the stablecoin and buy-and-distribute mechanism will create recurring demand for MUTM, ensuring that every transaction and fee cycle translates into buying pressure. Once exchange listings arrive on top-tier platforms expected on Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, MEXC, and Kraken, global visibility will expand dramatically. That exposure, paired with the already engaged presale community, sets the stage for a strong rally into and beyond the 2026 altseason. Investment math shows why analysts are confident. A Phase 6 investor who allocates $3,500 at $0.035 secures 100,000 MUTM. At the projected $2 target, that holding would be valued $200,000, a staggering value gain in under a year of market cycles. Early participants in Phase 1 who entered at $0.01 are even more strategically positioned, with $8,000 invested translating to 800,000 MUTM—worth $1.6 million at the same $2 projection. These confident figures demonstrate why the token is being highlighted as one of the best crypto investing opportunities in the current rotation. Final words There is less and less time to get MUTM at $0.035 because Phase 6 is already 50% sold. When the price goes up by 15% in Phase 7, the admission fee goes higher, which means that latecomers have less room to make money. More and more investors are looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next token to do well before the 2026 altseason. This is a project where loan mechanics, staking rewards, and sustainable buybacks all come together to make lasting value. If you’re keeping an eye on what’s going on with crypto right now, you might want to look into Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It’s the presale that has a lot of community support and a clear road to $2. With a live beta, Layer-2 speed, and worldwide exchange listings coming soon, things are moving quickly, and now is the time to act.

One of these lesser-known projects is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which provides a whole decentralized finance ecosystem that can be used in the real world. MUTM is a next-generation crypto investment that offers both growth and predictability. It does this by integrating new ways to lend and borrow money, a decentralized stablecoin, and a buy-and-distribute token strategy. As crypto investment gets more complicated, investors are looking for alternatives beyond the most popular coins. They are focusing on platforms that combine DeFi innovation with strong risk management. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is meant to be used for a long time. It draws users in with overcollateralized loans, stable-rate borrowing, and predictable treasury growth. These elements make a protocol that can run on its own and allows staking incentives and token buybacks. This makes sure that the ecosystem expands along with user engagement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): What is driving value Phase 6 of the MUTM presale has raised approximately $16.2 million, with 47% of the 170 million token allocation already sold. The current price of $0.035 represents a prime entry point for investors, while the next phase price of $0.040 reflects a 15% immediate gain. Over 16,550 holders have already joined the presale, signaling growing community trust and interest. For retail traders and institutional participants alike, this phase represents the final opportunity to secure discounted MUTM tokens before the beta launch amplifies demand and adoption. The upcoming beta launch will allow users to experience the platform’s lending, staking, and stablecoin features firsthand. This interactive exposure is expected to build confidence in the protocol’s reliability and scalability. Layer-2 integration will further enhance the user experience by reducing transaction costs and increasing speed, enabling higher-volume borrowing and staking activity. The resulting growth in on-chain activity will strengthen the treasury, fueling buy-and-distribute mechanisms that support token value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leverages several key demand drivers that make it attractive for investors seeking a high-utility crypto with predictable revenue. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency allows users to maximize borrowing against collateral safely, increasing platform activity and generating higher fees. Liquidity-aware liquidation incentives ensure smooth, efficient execution of liquidations, protecting user capital and maintaining systemic stability. Additionally, the reserve factor collects a portion of borrower interest, creating a treasury that can be deployed for staking rewards, governance incentives, and additional liquidity, reinforcing MUTM’s long-term demand. Investment examples highlight the protocol’s growth potential. Phase 1 investors purchased MUTM at $0.01 and have already realized a 250% value gain on paper at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035. Current Phase 6 participants can secure a 15% near-term upside before the next phase, with long-term projections targeting $2 per token. This represents an approximate 57× return from the current Phase 6 price, underscoring MUTM’s position as a standout crypto investment. The roadmap includes listings on major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, MEXC, and Kraken, which will increase visibility, liquidity, and adoption. Early access to the beta will allow users to test the platform’s full functionality, creating a network effect that drives sustained engagement and reinforces token demand. The combination of live feature experience, Layer-2 efficiency, and planned exchange integration ensures MUTM’s ecosystem will attract active users and continuous capital flow. Final words Security remains a cornerstone of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s design. The protocol has undergone a CertiK audit, receiving a TokenScan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. A $50,000 bug bounty incentivizes security reporting, while a $100,000 ongoing giveaway rewards ten participants with $10,000 each. Over 12,000 followers on Twitter form a vibrant community supporting early adoption and network effects. Phase 6 is already 47% sold. Retail investors are urged to lock in MUTM at $0.035 before the next-phase price increase to $0.040. With overcollateralized lending, dual lending pools, a decentralized stablecoin, and Layer-2 speed enhancements, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a rare combination of DeFi innovation, predictable revenue, and explosive upside. Its robust demand drivers, strategic presale positioning, and upcoming beta launch make it a compelling candidate for investors looking to capture significant returns ahead of ETH’s continued institutional adoption.

Among the sea of crypto coins, analysts are increasingly pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the standout project to watch. With its mix of utility, innovation, and presale momentum, MUTM is being positioned as the best cryptocurrency coin to buy ahead of the expected recovery, with projections pointing toward an 80x ROI. Presale traction signals investor confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale and is designed as a comprehensive DeFi protocol that blends dual lending mechanics, staking, and a sustainable buy-and-distribute system. Users will be able to lend and borrow directly, receive mtTokens that represent their holdings, and stake these for MUTM rewards. Revenue generated by the platform will later be used for open-market buybacks, which are then distributed to stakers, creating recurring demand. The project also integrates Layer-2 scaling for speed and low-cost transactions, alongside an upcoming stablecoin pegged to the dollar, which will play a central role in borrowing and repayment. The platform also features an ROI-tracking dashboard and a Top 50 leaderboard, designed to uplift user experience, drawing in both retail and larger investors. Unlike many speculative assets, MUTM positions itself as a utility-first token, engineered to attract both institutional and retail flows. The presale numbers already show strong momentum for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The token is in Phase 6 with a price of $0.035, having raised approximately $16.23 million so far. More than 16,600 investors are already on board, and half of the 170 million tokens available for this phase have been sold. The project’s total supply is set at 4 billion MUTM. Security and credibility are reinforced by a CertiK audit, where it scored 90 on Token Scan and 79 on Skynet, with a revised audit timeline scheduled for May 20, 2025. With 12,000+ Twitter followers and growing community engagement, momentum is building steadily. Importantly, Phase 7 will push the price up by 15% to $0.040, making the current stage an attractive entry point for those seeking discounted exposure. One of the strongest catalysts for MUTM is its upcoming beta launch at the token listing. This milestone will allow users to test key features directly, including borrowing, staking, and stablecoin minting. Having these tools live from the start provides investors with confidence in both the technology and the revenue model. Path to 80x ROI with real demand drivers The investment case for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rests on multiple, reinforcing drivers that create a clear path toward an 80x ROI. Expected exchange listings on top platforms such as Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, MEXC, and Kraken will deliver unmatched visibility and liquidity, exposing MUTM to a global audience. Every new listing is expected to accelerate adoption, increase trading activity, and attract institutional capital. At the same time, the buy-and-distribute revenue system ensures continuous buying pressure, as revenue will be recycled into MUTM token buybacks for redistribution to stakers. Layer-2 scaling will improve efficiency, making lending and borrowing smoother and cheaper, which in turn drives higher usage of the platform. The stablecoin introduces another dimension of growth, creating constant borrowing and repayment activity that ties directly back to MUTM’s demand. Finally, the beta launch gives users a first-hand experience with these features, reinforcing confidence and adoption early in the lifecycle. The math behind the projections shows why analysts are bullish. A Phase 6 investor who allocates $5,000 at $0.035 secures 142,900 MUTM tokens. At an $2.80 valuation—representing 80x from presale—this would be valued at $400,000. Meanwhile, a Phase 1 participant who committed $10,000 at $0.01 received 1,000,000 tokens. At the same $2.80 target, their holding would reach at the value of $2.8 million, highlighting the exponential upside created through early positioning. Such confident arithmetic demonstrates why the token is being labeled one of the most promising opportunities in crypto investing ahead of the market rebound. The time is also important. With Phase 6 nearly 50% sold, buyers don’t have much time to buy MUTM at $0.035 before the price goes up by 15% in Phase 7. Because of this urgency and the fact that beta access, Layer-2 efficiency, exchange listings, and the launch of the stablecoin are all coming up, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most interesting cryptocurrencies to buy before the rebound momentum picks up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is giving a presale window that combines low prices with good fundamentals as investors try to figure out what’s going on with crypto today. MUTM is not simply another token trying to ride the hype wave. It has a way to be used in the real world, ongoing buybacks, and integrations that are good enough for institutions. Analysts say it’s the best cryptocurrency coin to buy for an 80x return, and the fact that recovery signals are growing shows that people are becoming more confident in its long-term potential. But as Phase 6 comes to a finish, the window of opportunity is closing quickly.

Naver Financial, the company’s fintech arm, is in advanced talks with Upbit operator Dunamu, to carry out a comprehensive stock swap. Under this plan, the structure would see Naver issue new shares to acquire stakes from Dunamu’s existing shareholders. Both sides are now finalizing the swap ratio for the unlisted stock, Chosun Daily reported Thursday. In practice, a stock swap allows two companies to exchange shares instead of cash, creating a parent-subsidiary type governance structure. Ultimately, the move is seen as a way for Naver to cement its entry into digital finance and crypto markets. Naver Financial, the fintech arm of South Korea’s largest portal Naver, has agreed to a share-swap deal with Dunamu, operator of Upbit. The move effectively gives Naver control of Korea’s No.1 crypto exchange and marks its entry into the digital finance and won-pegged stablecoin… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 25, 2025 Overseas Expansion Plans Add Global Dimension To Merger Talks Naver Financial processes annual payment volumes worth 80 trillion Korean won ($58b). In contrast, pairing that scale with Dunamu’s Upbit platform, ranked the No. 1 exchange in Korea and No. 4 globally, could create one of the strongest alliances yet between South Korea’s tech and crypto sectors. Already, the two companies work together on a won-pegged stablecoin initiative and plan to use the deal as a springboard for overseas expansion. The move is seen as a stepping stone for Naver to become a global fintech player. If successful, the tie-up would reshape the financial services landscape in South Korea. Currently, Naver Pay is one of the country’s most widely used digital wallets, competing with Kakao Pay, Toss and established banks. With Upbit’s crypto dominance added, Naver could link payments, shopping, finance and digital assets under one ecosystem. Market Share Battle Intensifies As Naver Weighs Deal The timing of the news is notable. Korea Blockchain Week is underway in Seoul, drawing global attention to the nation’s fast-growing crypto sector. At the same time, earlier this week, Upbit’s rival Bithumb struck a partnership with World Liberty Financial , a crypto venture linked to US President Donald Trump. For years, Upbit has enjoyed a dominant position in South Korea, holding above 80% of market share in some months since 2022. That dominance has triggered criticism from lawmakers , who argue that Dunamu’s grip on the exchange market risks creating a monopoly. More recently, market dynamics have shifted. On Sept. 9, Bithumb’s domestic share climbed to 46%. Upbit held 50.6%. As a result, competition has tightened. This raises the stakes for Naver as it seeks control of Dunamu. Looking ahead, a deeper alliance between Naver and Dunamu would stand out. If completed, it would rank among the most significant M&A deals in South Korea’s fintech space.

This vision is rapidly becoming a reality in South Korea, thanks to a groundbreaking partnership. Sui, a leading Layer 1 blockchain, has joined forces with t’order, a prominent South Korean table ordering platform, to introduce a Korean won-based stablecoin payment system. This move marks a significant leap for Sui stablecoin payments , bringing digital currency closer to everyday transactions. What Are Sui Stablecoin Payments and Why Do They Matter? At its core, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or, in this case, the Korean Won (KRW). This stability makes them ideal for everyday transactions, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The introduction of Sui stablecoin payments means that consumers in South Korea can now use a digital representation of the KRW, backed 1:1 by actual Korean Won, for their purchases. This system leverages Sui’s high-throughput and low-latency blockchain, promising faster and potentially more cost-effective transactions compared to traditional methods. For a country as technologically advanced as South Korea, integrating blockchain into retail payments represents a natural evolution. It offers a glimpse into a future where digital assets seamlessly integrate into our financial lives, making payments more efficient and accessible. Bridging Blockchain and Everyday Commerce: The t’order Integration The partnership between Sui and t’order is not just about technology; it’s about practical application. T’order is a major player in South Korea’s hospitality sector, boasting an impressive network of over 300,000 point-of-sale (POS) terminals. This extensive reach provides a massive springboard for the adoption of Sui stablecoin payments . Here’s how this collaboration is set to unfold: Widespread Access: Over 300,000 POS terminals will be connected to Sui’s blockchain payment network. This means a vast number of restaurants, cafes, and retail outlets could soon accept stablecoin payments. Seamless Integration: The goal is to make the payment process intuitive and user-friendly, mirroring the ease of existing digital payment methods. Real-World Utility: This isn’t just a pilot project; it’s a direct integration into an established payment ecosystem, offering genuine utility for digital assets. This initiative directly addresses one of blockchain’s biggest challenges: bridging the gap between innovative technology and practical, everyday use cases.

For the Sui Ecosystem: This partnership significantly boosts the utility and adoption of the Sui blockchain. It demonstrates a powerful real-world use case for Sui stablecoin payments , attracting more users and developers to the platform. For the Wider Economy: It promotes financial innovation and could pave the way for broader acceptance of digital currencies in traditional commerce. Moreover, this initiative positions South Korea at the forefront of digital payment innovation, showcasing how blockchain technology can enhance national payment infrastructure. Navigating the Future: Potential Challenges and Opportunities for Sui Stablecoin Payments While the prospects are exciting, the path to widespread adoption for Sui stablecoin payments will naturally involve challenges. However, these challenges also present significant opportunities for growth and refinement. Key considerations include: User Education: Many consumers may still be unfamiliar with stablecoins. Educating the public on their benefits and ease of use will be crucial for adoption. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for stablecoins is continuously evolving. Adhering to current and future regulations will be vital for long-term success. Scalability and Security: As transaction volumes increase, Sui’s blockchain must demonstrate its ability to scale efficiently while maintaining robust security measures. Integration with Existing Systems: Ensuring seamless integration with diverse POS systems and accounting software will be key for merchant acceptance. Despite these hurdles, the opportunity to transform a significant portion of South Korea’s retail payments is immense. Successful implementation could set a precedent for other nations looking to integrate blockchain into their national payment infrastructures. The collaboration between Sui and t’order represents a pivotal moment for digital payments in South Korea. By integrating KRW stablecoin payments into over 300,000 POS terminals, Sui is not just launching a new payment option; it is laying the groundwork for a more efficient, secure, and technologically advanced financial future. This initiative showcases the immense potential of blockchain to move beyond niche applications and into the mainstream of everyday commerce. As this partnership unfolds, it will undoubtedly offer valuable insights into the future of global digital payments, solidifying Sui’s role as an innovator in the blockchain space.

Dogecoin dominated the spotlight after the first United States spot DOGE ETF went live on September 18, with talk of more approvals priming Q4 for fresh inflows. At the same time, a PayFi upstart that bridges crypto to real bank accounts ( Remittix ) is drawing serious attention, with major centralized exchanges already lined up. With Q3 closing, many early-stage crypto investment hunters see this payments play as a high-growth crypto that complements Dogecoin rather than competes with it. Dogecoin holding range as ETF catalysts build Dogecoin trades near $0.24 today, holding a tight band between support around $0.236 and resistance near $0.244 as traders weigh the next impulse. Analysts note that Dogecoin momentum followed the spot ETF debut, while on chain and whale flows suggest selective accumulation on dips. A decisive break above $0.244 may open a run toward $0.26 to $0.28, while losing $0.236 risks a slide into the mid $0.23s. The ETF narrative and friendlier approval pipeline can keep Dogecoin in focus, but confirmation still depends on volume expansion and trend strength. For active participants, Dogecoin remains a levels-driven market with improving institutional access, which is why Dogecoin continues to command attention on every pump or pullback. Remittix: PayFi rails built for real world spend Here is where the rotation gets urgent. Remittix addresses the everyday challenge of transferring value from crypto to bank accounts with speed and transparent foreign exchange. It is positioned as more than just a story; it is a tool for spending. Recent reports indicate that more than $26.4 million has been raised and over 669 million RTX tokens have been sold, with the token priced at around $0.1130. Security and execution signals are stacking up. The team has completed top-tier verification with CertiK and currently holds the leading pre-launch ranking. The mobile wallet beta is live with community testers, showing progress that aligns with the best crypto to buy now thesis. For investors who want utility plus distribution on day one, this cross-chain, low gas fee crypto angle is why eyes are moving fast. Why Remittix is gaining traction Users can send crypto to real bank accounts in over 30 countries for practical, everyday payouts. The wallet is scheduled for a Q3 go-live with real-time FX conversion to remove friction at the point of spend. Independent security verification by CertiK provides a clear trust signal from day one. Broad asset support and fiat pair coverage are designed for real-world usage, not just speculation. The product focuses on freelancers, remitters, and payments users who value speed and clarity. Compared to Dogecoin, Remittix’s approach prioritizes adoption over hype. Dogecoin can remain a strong momentum vehicle, but Remittix, with verified security, visible listings, and an accessible starting price around $0.1130, stacks the deck for a breakout. If Q4 flows accelerate, missing this window could be the decision that traders regret.

For a long time, many analysts observed a fascinating pattern with Bitcoin: its price often mirrored movements in the global M2 money supply, typically with about a 70-day lag. But what if that predictable dance has suddenly stopped? According to Joe Consorti, head of growth at the Bitcoin custody firm Theya, we are now witnessing a significant shift. He points out that the historical correlation between Bitcoin’s price and the global M2 money supply has ceased since May. This development, which we can call the Bitcoin decoupling , marks a new chapter in understanding how the leading cryptocurrency behaves. What’s Behind the Remarkable Bitcoin Decoupling? Joe Consorti’s analysis reveals a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. For years, the 70-day lag between Bitcoin’s price and the global M2 money supply was a key indicator for many. This meant that changes in the amount of money circulating globally would eventually influence Bitcoin’s value. However, that pattern is no longer holding true. Since May, Bitcoin has embarked on a new, independent path. This Bitcoin decoupling suggests that its price movements are now being driven by different factors, moving away from the direct influence of broader monetary aggregates. It’s a noteworthy change because it challenges long-held assumptions about Bitcoin’s market drivers. While gold continues to show a near one-to-one correlation with the M2 metric, Bitcoin is charting its own course, signaling a potential maturation of the asset. Understanding Global M2: Why Does It Matter for Asset Prices? To fully grasp the significance of this Bitcoin decoupling , it’s helpful to understand what global M2 money supply actually is. Simply put, M2 represents a broad measure of the total money circulating in an economy. This includes: Cash Checking deposits Savings deposits Money market accounts Historically, an increase in M2 often indicates more money chasing a relatively fixed supply of assets, which can lead to inflation and higher asset prices. This is why many traditional assets, like gold, tend to move in tandem with M2, acting as a hedge against currency devaluation. The fact that gold maintains this strong correlation while Bitcoin breaks away highlights a fundamental shift in their respective market roles and investor perceptions. Navigating New Market Waters: Implications of Bitcoin Decoupling Consorti suggests that this significant shift is unfolding amid a complex global economic landscape, characterized by a weaker U.S. dollar and heightened geopolitical risks. These broader macroeconomic factors are likely contributing to the changing asset correlations we are observing. The implications of this Bitcoin decoupling are substantial for investors and market watchers alike: Changing Asset Perceptions: Gold is traditionally seen as the ultimate safe-haven asset, attracting capital during times of crisis and uncertainty. Bitcoin, however, is increasingly viewed differently. Bitcoin as ‘Risk-On’: Consorti explains that Bitcoin is now perceived as an asset that moves more significantly in a ‘risk-on’ environment. This means that when investors feel confident and are willing to take on more risk for higher potential returns, Bitcoin tends to perform strongly. Independent Drivers: This new behavior suggests that Bitcoin’s price might be influenced more by crypto-specific adoption, technological advancements, regulatory clarity, or unique supply-demand dynamics within the digital asset space, rather than just broad monetary policy. This evolving narrative requires a fresh perspective on how Bitcoin fits into a diversified investment portfolio. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Strategy? The observation of a Bitcoin decoupling from global M2 money supply presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. It means that relying solely on past correlations might no longer be an effective strategy. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Re-evaluate Investment Theses: It’s crucial to reassess why you hold Bitcoin. Is it purely an inflation hedge, or are you recognizing its potential as a growth asset in a ‘risk-on’ environment? Broaden Your Analysis: Look beyond just M2. Pay attention to other macroeconomic indicators, geopolitical events, and, critically, developments within the cryptocurrency ecosystem itself. Diversification Remains Key: As correlations shift, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes and within the crypto space can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Continuously learning about new analyses and market shifts, like this Bitcoin decoupling , is essential for making informed decisions. This period of shifting correlations could define Bitcoin’s role for years to come. The Bitcoin decoupling from global M2 money supply is a truly remarkable development. It signifies a potential maturation of Bitcoin as an asset, with its movements now seemingly less tethered to traditional monetary metrics and more influenced by a complex interplay of risk sentiment and unique crypto-market dynamics. While gold continues its traditional role, Bitcoin is forging its own path, offering investors a new lens through which to view its value and potential. Understanding these evolving correlations is paramount for navigating the exciting, yet ever-changing, landscape of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the global M2 money supply? A1: The global M2 money supply is a broad measure of the total amount of money circulating in an economy, including physical currency, checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market funds. It’s often used as an indicator of liquidity and potential inflationary pressures. Q2: How did Bitcoin’s price previously correlate with M2? A2: Historically, Bitcoin’s price often showed a correlation with the global M2 money supply, typically with a lag of about 70 days. This meant that increases or decreases in M2 would often precede similar movements in Bitcoin’s price. Q3: Why is Bitcoin decoupling from M2 now? A3: According to analyst Joe Consorti, this Bitcoin decoupling has occurred since May. He suggests it’s happening amidst a weaker U.S. dollar and heightened geopolitical risks, leading to a re-evaluation of asset correlations and Bitcoin’s role as a ‘risk-on’ asset. Q4: Does this make Bitcoin more or less risky? A4: The decoupling doesn’t inherently make Bitcoin more or less risky, but it changes the nature of its risk. It suggests Bitcoin’s price movements may be driven by different factors, potentially increasing its volatility in ‘risk-on’ environments and requiring investors to adapt their risk assessment strategies. Q5: How does gold’s correlation with M2 compare to Bitcoin’s? A5: While Bitcoin is decoupling, gold continues to show a near one-to-one correlation with the global M2 money supply. This reinforces gold’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, contrasting with Bitcoin’s evolving ‘risk-on’ perception. Q6: What should investors do in light of this Bitcoin decoupling? A6: Investors should re-evaluate their investment theses, broaden their market analysis beyond traditional correlations, and consider how Bitcoin fits into a diversified portfolio as a dynamic asset influenced by both macro and crypto-specific factors.

Flare Launches First FAssets for XRP on Mainnet,https://cryptopotato.com/good-news-for-ripple-flare-launches-first-fassets-for-xrp-on-mainnet/,"The layer-1 decentralized finance (DeFi) interoperability network, Flare, has launched the first FAsset on its mainnet. This product, called FXRP v1.2, is designed for XRP holders, enabling them to leverage their assets across the DeFi ecosystem. According to a press release shared with CryptoPotato , FXRP minting will be capped at 5 million tokens for the first week, while Flare rolls out incentives to ensure sustainable growth. The team behind the interoperability network says the launch of FXRP marks the start of the XRP DeFi awakening. FXRP Goes Live on Flare FAssets are representations of non-smart contract-enabled cryptocurrencies that are used in the Flare DeFi ecosystem and beyond. They are pegged to the original asset and secured through an overcollateralized system. This system is run by independent agents and Flare’s data oracles. With FAssets, users can earn yield and engage in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading, lending, stablecoin minting, and liquid staking. Flare recently partnered with the Web3 software development entity Enosys to offer XRP-backed stablecoin loans. The loans will be powered by Enosys’ Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol and Flare-native tokens, such as FXRP. Flare says other protocols can integrate FAssets directly in their native building blocks, eliminating the need for special technicalities. As for security, Flare claims its protocols have undergone bug bounties, community-led reviews, and four independent audits. Since security for FAssets is considered an ongoing commitment, the system is monitored 24/7 with rapid response mechanisms in place. “Institutional stakeholders in particular demand not only initial assurance, but ongoing verification that the system remains resilient to new threats. The Flare Foundation will continue to invest in robust, scalable security measures to ensure FAssets uphold the highest standards of safety, trust, and reliability for both institutions and the XRP community,” the platform stated. Incentives for Sustainable Growth Henceforth, users can acquire FXRP by minting the token via self-custody wallets that support Flare and XRPL. Alternatively, they can swap any token on Flare for the FAsset using DEXs like Enosys, BlazeSwap, and SparkDEX. Additionally, they can acquire FXRP through crypto wallets like Luminite and Oxen Flow, which will offer built-in swap functionality. As Flare onboards more users, it will gradually increase the number of minted FXRP. Meanwhile, Flare intends to distribute FAssets incentives to DeFi pools that make substantial contributions to on-chain activity. The rewards will initially come in the form of rFLR; Flare will stop them as FXRP becomes more widely integrated across the ecosystem. The post Good News for Ripple?

This rapid downturn sent shockwaves through the trading community, contributing to an even larger sum of $401 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours across major exchanges. Such events are not uncommon in the fast-paced world of digital assets, but they always underscore the significant risks involved in leveraged trading. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? For those new to the derivatives market, understanding crypto futures liquidation is crucial. Essentially, a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a specific future date. Many traders use leverage, which means they borrow funds to amplify their potential returns. While leverage can boost profits, it also dramatically increases risk. Liquidation occurs when a trader’s position is automatically closed by an exchange because they no longer have enough margin (collateral) to cover potential losses. If the market moves significantly against a leveraged position, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses for both the trader and the platform. This ensures that the borrowed funds can be repaid. Why Such Massive Liquidations Occur: The Domino Effect The recent crypto futures liquidation of $105 million within an hour is a stark example of what happens during periods of extreme market volatility. Several factors typically contribute to such a rapid cascade: Sudden Price Swings: A sharp, unexpected price drop (or rise, depending on the position) can quickly push many leveraged positions below their maintenance margin level. High Leverage: Traders using high leverage (e.g., 50x or 100x) are particularly vulnerable. Even a small price movement can lead to a complete loss of their collateral. Cascading Liquidations: When one large position is liquidated, the forced selling can further depress prices, triggering more liquidations in a chain reaction. This creates a domino effect that accelerates market downturns. In this instance, the rapid movement suggests a significant market event or a coordinated sell-off that caught many traders off guard, highlighting the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets. Navigating the Storm: How Does Crypto Futures Liquidation Impact Traders? The immediate impact of a crypto futures liquidation on individual traders is, understandably, financial loss. Traders lose their initial margin, and sometimes even more if the market moves too quickly for the exchange to close the position precisely. Moreover, these events can foster a sense of fear and uncertainty across the broader market, influencing investor sentiment and potentially leading to further price corrections. However, liquidations also serve as a harsh but effective lesson for many traders, emphasizing the importance of robust risk management strategies. They remind us that while the allure of quick gains is strong, the potential for significant losses is equally real. Strategies to Mitigate Crypto Futures Liquidation Risks While the market will always have its unpredictable moments, traders can adopt several strategies to protect themselves from the severe consequences of crypto futures liquidation : Understand Leverage: Use leverage cautiously. Higher leverage means higher risk. Beginners should start with minimal or no leverage. Set Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order automatically closes your position if the price reaches a certain level, limiting your potential losses. Manage Your Margin: Keep an eye on your margin level. Adding more collateral to your position can prevent liquidation during a temporary market dip. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into highly leveraged futures contracts. Balance your portfolio with less risky assets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and macroeconomic factors that could influence crypto prices. The recent $105 million liquidation event is a powerful testament to the volatile and high-stakes environment of crypto futures trading. While the potential for substantial gains exists, the risks, particularly with leveraged positions, are equally significant. Understanding the mechanics of liquidation and implementing sound risk management practices are not just recommendations; they are essential for long-term survival in this dynamic market. Traders must prioritize capital preservation and informed decision-making over the pursuit of immediate, high-risk returns. Always trade responsibly and within your financial means. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the difference between spot trading and futures trading? A1: Spot trading involves buying or selling cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery at the current market price. Futures trading, on the other hand, involves contracts to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date, often with leverage. Q2: How does leverage contribute to crypto futures liquidation? A2: Leverage allows traders to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. While this can amplify profits, it also magnifies losses. If the market moves against a highly leveraged position, the trader’s margin can quickly deplete, leading to liquidation. Q3: Can I lose more than my initial investment in futures trading? A3: In some extreme cases, particularly with very high leverage and rapid market movements, it is theoretically possible for losses to exceed initial margin. However, most reputable exchanges have mechanisms like auto-deleveraging (ADL) or insurance funds to try and prevent this, though it remains a significant risk. Q4: Are crypto futures liquidations common? A4: Yes, crypto futures liquidation events are quite common, especially during periods of high market volatility. Large liquidations often occur when there are significant price swings, impacting many leveraged positions simultaneously. Q5: What is a margin call in futures trading? A5: A margin call is a demand from an exchange or broker for a trader to deposit additional funds into their margin account to bring it back up to the required maintenance margin level. If the trader fails to meet the margin call, their position may be liquidated. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your trading community on social media.

Bitcoin HODLer Whales Have Shown Profit-Taking Spree Recently As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, long-term holder whales have participated in some profit-taking recently. “Long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Sell 147,000 BTC Since August, Fastest Selloff Of Cycle This cohort is considered to represent the HODLers of the market, who rarely sell even in the face of volatility. That said, there are times when these investors do participate in selloffs, and one such instance seems to have occurred just recently. In the context of the current topic, the everyday LTHs aren’t of focus, but rather the LTH whales, diamond hands who carry more than 1,000 BTC (about $113.7 million) in their balance. Below is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Profit for the LTH whales over the last few weeks. The Realized Profit here is naturally an on-chain indicator that measures the total amount of profit that the Bitcoin LTH whales are locking in through their transactions. From the graph, it’s visible that this metric observed a notable spike on September 21st. This was the day BTC started a price drawdown that took it to the $112,000 level. Thus, it would appear possible that the profit-taking from the HODLers may have in part been to blame for the bearish action. In total, LTH whales harvested over $120 million in profits during this distribution spree. Meanwhile, the short-term holders (STHs), representing investors who entered the market during the past five months, participated in loss-taking instead, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post. As displayed in the above chart, Bitcoin STHs sent 15,700 BTC at a loss to exchanges during the price crash. Investors generally use these platforms when they want to sell, so these loss transactions could have been a sign of capitulation from the cohort. The STHs have a relatively short holding time, so they are assumed to include the weak hands of the sector. In that view, the latest capitulation would be on-brand for the group. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dip-Buy Calls Spike: Why This Could Actually Be Bearish Coming back to the LTHs, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared a chart that puts into perspective the total amount of profit that the LTHs as a whole have realized in the current cycle so far.

This marks a significant uptick in capital entering the XRP market, signaling optimism among institutional and retail investors alike. XRP’s recent $69M inflows reflect broader cryptocurrency bullishness, fueled by strong on-chain metrics, undervaluation, and optimism over crypto regulatory clarity, signals that historically precede accumulation and upward price moves. Therefore, CoinShares data shows that XRP is gaining from a shift toward assets with strong transactional utility. Its highly active network boosts appeal for both traders and long-term holders, while a low NVT ratio signals potential undervaluation relative to on-chain activity. ”Investor behavior reinforces this trend since short-term holders are consolidating, while long-term holders retain strong positions, stabilizing the market. Historically, such dynamics, especially in high-activity networks like XRP, follow major inflows with price recoveries and renewed accumulation, setting the stage for sustainable growth. Therefore, the $69 million weekly inflow into XRP underscores growing market confidence and highlights the cryptocurrency’s attractiveness amid evolving investor strategies. XRP Eyes $5 Breakout Target Amid Bullish Flag Pole Formation XRP is capturing the attention of traders and investors after technical analyst ChartNerd highlighted a potential breakout target of $5, citing a classic bullish flag pole formation. This pattern, widely recognized in technical analysis, often signals a continuation of an existing uptrend following a period of consolidation. Notably, a flag pole formation appears when a sharp price rally is followed by a brief sideways consolidation, forming a ‘flag’ on the chart. When the price breaks out, it often mirrors the initial surge, signaling strong upside potential. For XRP, ChartNerd denotes the current consolidation as the flag, with the preceding rally as the pole, if the pattern holds, XRP could climb toward $5, marking a significant milestone. XRP gains bullish momentum as rising on-chain activity and institutional interest boost investor confidence. Favorable technicals and a flag pole formation suggest recent consolidation may be a pause before the next breakout with the present dip seemingly being over after flipping $2.86. Conclusion XRP’s $69 million weekly inflows highlight growing investor confidence and underscore its potential undervaluation. With strong network activity, supportive on-chain metrics, and evolving regulatory clarity, XRP appears well-positioned for accumulation and possible upward momentum in the near term. Meanwhile, XRP’s flag pole formation signals a strong bullish setup, with $5 within reach if momentum holds.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-25 06:00:24

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-price-will-hit-5-in-3-weeks-from-now-heres-why/,"CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020), a well-known crypto analyst, has recently highlighted a sharp progression in XRP’s recent trading activity and suggested that the token is poised for another major rally. He pointed out that on June 22, the price stood at $1.92, and by July 13 it had climbed to $3.64. On September 23, XRP traded at $2.69, promting the analyst to predict that the asset could climb to $5 within next 3 weeks, potentially reaching a new all-time high like it did in July. On June 22, this year the #XRP price was $1.92. Twenty one days later the price was $3.64 (July 13). Yesterday the price of XRP was $2.69. In three weeks from now price will be $5. — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) September 23, 2025 Path Toward a New High The post comes as traders assess whether XRP can repeat its past patterns and build on momentum toward a new all-time high. The trend from June to July represented a near doubling in value over a short period, and the analyst expects similar trajectory to emerge again. A climb to $5 would represent not only recovery from recent pullbacks but also a level beyond its previous peak. Other analysts have echoed similar expectations, suggesting that XRP may be positioned for stronger performance in the coming weeks. The argument rests on its history of sharp uptrends once certain support zones hold, and recent trading activity has drawn comparisons to previous rallies that preceded significant breakouts. Market observers note that institutional flows and improved liquidity corridors could support such an outcome, and other analysts believe the $5 target is within reach .

Historically, lower interest rates reduce the appeal of holding cash, often prompting investors to allocate more into digital assets. The second factor is anticipation surrounding XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, with approval expected between mid- and late October . Such a development would open the door for broader institutional access and create new demand channels. Together, these events provide conditions that could reinforce the bullish outlook and accelerate XRP’s momentum if they unfold as expected. Community Responses Reactions from the XRP community have been mixed. Some supporters welcomed the $5 projection, as the recent trend resembles earlier periods that led to major breakouts. They pointed to the strength of past rallies and argued that the current setup supports optimism. On the other hand, skeptics dismissed the forecast. Some noted that the asset has failed to maintain momentum after reaching higher levels in the past. For them, the $5 target appears ambitious without stronger evidence of sustained buying pressure.

Analysts Warn Layer Brett May Deliver Bigger Multiples,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-price-set-to-break-5-analysts-warn-layer-brett-may-deliver-bigger-multiples/,"While analysts eye the potential for a major breakout by XRP to $5, some caution that the true potential may lie in Layer Brett ’s innovations. With Layer Brett’s emerging technology promising bigger multiples, the spotlight could shift from XRP’s price movements to the broader impact of these developments on the cryptocurrency market’s future. XRP Price at a Crossroads The subject of the question whether the XRP price can break $5 has brought a lot of attention to the crypto world. XRP price is currently trading at around $2.8, but the latest XRP price prediction has expectations of a bullish price target of $5. This optimistic prediction is based on the introduction of the first U.S. spot XRP ETF which has seen a lot of institutional involvement. Also, the XRP charts exhibit a symmetrical triangle on the technical indicator, which may turn out to be a breakout. Assuming that the XRP price will overcome the resistance points at about $3.10 and have a good volume, it can approach the mark of $5. Nonetheless, the XRP price has a major support at $2.75 and a fall below this point may be an indication of further losses. The wider market forces, including Federal Reserve policies and the development of ETFs will also have a strong influence on the XRP price. A target of $5 is possible, but investors must be vigilant and watch important support areas and the market environment. Layer Brett (LBRETT): The Ethereum Layer 2 That Could Overtake XRP A significant portion of discussions around the XRP revolve around its potential to hit $5. However, Layer Brett is quickly attracting the attention of leading market analysts due to its potential for much larger returns. Currently in presale at just $0.0058, it has already raised over $4 million and is gaining momentum rapidly. Layer Brett’s appeal goes beyond its meme-driven popularity as it is designed as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, offering ultra-fast transactions, low fees, and inherent scalability. The platform’s staking dApp is already live, with rewards exceeding 630%, a feature that XRP didn’t offer in its early stages. For investors, the opportunity to stake immediately and earn rewards gives Layer Brett a sense of stability, making it feel more like a functional ecosystem than a speculative bet. Analysts believe that Layer Brett’s combination of meme branding and strong blockchain infrastructure positions it to reach $10 well before XRP hits $5. The initiative is also getting better because more investors are getting involved. There are a lot of memes on social media, Telegram groups are getting bigger every day, and crypto Twitter is full of talks about LBRETT. For traders hesitant about the bullish outlook of XRP, Layer Brett is being seen as a low-risk, high-reward investment, bolstered by solid technology. The key differentiator lies in the potential for bigger multiples. While XRP price predictions suggest moderate gains, Layer Brett’s incredibly low starting price offers significantly more upside. This is why many believe this Ethereum Layer 2 solution has the potential to outperform XRP in the long run. Conclusion Most of the XRP price predictions say that the price might go up to $5, but it won’t give customers as much as it used to. Layer Brett, on the other hand, is looking for bigger multiples in Ethereum Layer 2 performance, live staking, and viral energy. The current Layer Brett presale might be the fastest way for traders who are seeking the next breakout to move forward. Don’t wait until the presale ends. Layer Brett is moving fast, and the opportunity to buy in early at record speed won’t last long.

That possibility puts the economy under new pressure eight months into President Donald Trump's second term. The Trump administration's tariffs imposed as part of its global trade war have driven up prices, while widespread public sector layoffs and mass deportations have squeezed the labor market. Now, a looming budget crisis could bring federal agencies to a standstill. “The economy is quite fragile right now. In a more resilient era, even a prolonged lockdown wouldn't be a major blow. But under current conditions, it could be the factor that could drag the economy down,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. In the event of a federal shutdown, millions of public employees will lose their salaries, and some will be forced to continue working without pay. While Social Security and Medicare payments will continue, citizens' access to many public services will be disrupted. It has also been reported that the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which provides food assistance to low-income families, will no longer be accepting new applications. Past lockdowns have shuttered national parks and museums, halted loans and permits for small businesses, and disrupted food safety inspections. Experts estimate that each week the federal government is closed represents a loss of about 0.1 percentage points of the country's quarterly economic growth. Related News: BREAKING NEWS: Critical Hearing on Taxation of Cryptocurrencies to Be Held in the US on This Date The 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted five weeks during Trump's first term, caused a significant decline in GDP. Ryan Sweet, Chief Economist at Oxford Economics, stated that such prolonged shutdowns negatively impact not only public spending but also private sector investment and consumer spending. This year's lockdown risk comes at a time when the economy is already under pressure due to high tariffs, a slowing labor market, and mass deportation policies. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has described the economy as “challenging,” and experts warn that a prolonged lockdown could also erode confidence in financial markets. *This is not investment advice.

Companies that breach these requirements could face penalties of up to 10% of their annual revenue. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre’s data shows roughly 400 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian watchdog, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, but only a fraction are actively operating. Mulino says the licensing framework will support the growth of the crypto industry In a consultation , the Treasury said the draft legislation would change the Corporations Act 2001 to “capture digital asset platforms and tokenized custody platforms by introducing each as a new financial product.” This would classify digital asset platforms (DAPs) and tokenized custody platforms (TCPs) as financial products, thereby bringing them under the full scope of licensing requirements and consumer protections, according to a Treasury fact sheet. “The focus of the framework is businesses that hold assets on behalf of clients, rather than on the digital assets themselves,” said the Treasury, noting that digital assets already fall under the state’s existing frameworks and are treated in the same way as other assets. Presently, anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules are the only requirements for crypto platforms in Australia. However, the new proposed laws will extend oversight by requiring AFSL registration. The penalties for violations, including dishonest or deceptive conduct, would also be set at whichever is greater: A$16.5 million, three times the advantage gained, or 10% of yearly sales. Nonetheless, the rules can still be altered, with industry participants allowed to comment on the draft until October 24. In the past few months, the nation’s key regulators, including financial regulators, the tax authority, and the central bank, have cautioned against Australians’ rising exposure to crypto assets. In August, AUSTRAC even ordered Binance Australia to appoint an external auditor over compliance concerns. So far, the Treasury has claimed that the planned rules will enhance the protection of crypto consumers. Federal Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino stated that the reforms are meant to nurture the sector while shielding Australians from potential losses, stressing that regulation will give investors more confidence in digital assets. He noted, “It is about legitimising the good actors and shutting out the bad.” John O’Loghlen, Australian Country Director and APAC Managing Director of Coinbase also commented: “Clear, fit-for-purpose regulation will support economic growth, increase choice for consumers, and ensure Australia remains competitive globally.We look forward to working constructively with government and industry as the legislation progresses.” Moreover, Jonathon Miller, general manager at Kraken, noted that he was pleased to see the draft finally published after a thorough collaboration period between industry players and regulators. The Australian government is planning on instituting stablecoin licensing rules According to the federal government, the legislation excludes digital asset creators and firms using crypto for non-financial activities. That means tokens used in video games and artistic NFTs remain outside the scope of regulation. It also noted that tokens that function as financial products will fall under current regulations, and ASIC is set to clarify in November which tokens will need an AFSL. Moreover, smaller platforms that process under $10 million in transactions yearly and hold under $5,000 per client will be exempt. Meanwhile, the country’s authorities are also working on a comprehensive payments licensing regime to cover digital assets such as stablecoins . The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) may oversee stablecoin issuers once the new “stored-value facilities” framework is implemented. The ASIC has also recently licensed two Australian dollar–backed stablecoins, AUDM from Macropod and AUDF from Forte, classifying them as non-cash payment facilities. Adding to the momentum, Coinbase announced Wednesday that it will add support for a third Australian dollar stablecoin, AUDD, enabling local users to buy, sell, convert, and transfer it.

The move underscores a push to connect Middle Eastern investors with new digital asset infrastructure at a time when the region is seeking a larger role in global finance. Ethena is best known for its crypto-native synthetic dollar, USDe, and its reward-bearing version, sUSDe. Both are backed by crypto collateral and maintained through hedging strategies designed to reduce volatility. The protocol has attracted more than $14 billion in deposits since launching in 2024, reflecting appetite for stablecoin-like products that also generate yield. M2 Global Wealth, an affiliate of M2 Holdings, will integrate Ethena into its wealth management offerings. The group says this adds a regulated way for clients to access returns from emerging digital assets. Kim Wong, M2’s head of treasury, said the deal sets a new standard for trust and security in the region’s market. The investment follows M2’s participation in a funding initiative for the Sui blockchain ecosystem earlier this year. It also comes as the UAE continues to strengthen its regulatory framework to attract crypto firms and investors.

The proposal, released on Thursday by the Treasury, outlines strict rules for licensing, compliance, and penalties. The most striking feature is the potential punishment of up to 10% of annual turnover for breaches of the law. This comes as Australia seeks to tighten oversight of exchanges and tokenised custody platforms, amid rising concerns from regulators over money laundering, terrorism financing, and consumer protection. The consultation period will remain open until 24 October, inviting detailed industry feedback. Penalties tied to turnover and conduct Under the draft rules, all digital asset platforms operating in Australia will be required to obtain an Australian Financial Services Licence. This framework will place them under the Corporations Act, aligning them more closely with traditional financial institutions and existing regulatory standards. Breaches of the licence conditions—such as failing to act “honestly and fairly” or engaging in “misleading and deceptive conduct and unfair contract terms”—could trigger penalties. These would be set at the greater of A$16.5 million ($10.9 million), three times the benefit obtained, or 10% of a firm’s annual turnover. Exemptions will be available for smaller platforms that hold less than A$5,000 per customer and process under A$10 million in transactions annually. Regulators push for stronger safeguards The move follows repeated calls from Australia’s financial crimes agency, central bank, and other regulators to curb risks associated with digital assets. In August, Binance’s Australian arm was ordered to appoint an external auditor due to concerns about compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. By placing crypto exchanges and tokenised custody providers under the same laws as traditional financial services, the government aims to expand consumer protection and reduce financial crime significantly. Global exchanges under scrutiny Global players such as Coinbase Global Inc. and Kraken already operate in Australia and will be directly affected by the legislation. Coinbase’s Australian country director, John O’Loghlen, stressed that regulation can support economic growth and help maintain Australia’s global competitiveness. Kraken’s Jonathon Miller noted that the new framework follows an extensive consultation process between industry and government representatives. These comments highlight the extent to which international exchanges are engaged in shaping Australia’s evolving regulatory environment. Next steps for the legislation The consultation period runs until 24 October, after which the Treasury will assess feedback from industry participants. If adopted, the law would represent one of the most significant shifts in Australia’s approach to digital assets, creating a comprehensive framework that combines licensing with severe penalties for non-compliance. The Treasury has emphasised that the new rules are intended to provide clarity and stability for investors while ensuring that digital asset platforms meet the same standards expected of other financial service providers in Australia.

The announcement was made at Korea Blockchain Week by WLFI co-founder Zak Folkman, who said the product and a companion retail app are due within weeks as the project pushes into Asia. Card And App Aim To Put USD1 In Wallets According to company statements and coverage , the card will let holders attach their USD1 balance to Apple Pay and use it at merchants that accept contactless mobile payments. WLFI says the app will combine peer-to-peer payments with simple trading tools, a design the team compared to popular retail fintech apps. Reports suggest the launch is meant to drive everyday use of the stablecoin. Partnerships Target Asia Expansion WLFI has signed a memorandum of understanding with South Korea’s Bithumb to explore joint work and wider distribution in the region. Got @worldlibertyfi ’s @zakfolkman to break news on stage at KBW The project will launch a debit card and retail app “soon.” They plan to have its stablecoin USD1 linked to Apple Pay and position its app like a “Venmo meets Robinhood.” pic.twitter.com/nPxCO6xn4Z — Jacquelyn Melinek (@jacqmelinek) September 23, 2025 Observers note that tapping a major local exchange could speed up outreach in Korea and nearby markets, where mobile payments are common. The move comes as WLFI shifts away from plans to build its own blockchain and says it will remain technology-agnostic. Token Supply And Governance Notes Based on market data and reporting, WLFI’s total token structure has been the subject of scrutiny. One breakdown showed about 27 billion tokens circulating against a 100 billion total supply at launch, with allocations for the company, partners, liquidity, and public sale. Token holders previously voted nearly unanimously to make the WLFI token tradable, with a result recorded at 99.94% in favor. Those figures are central to how the community and markets judge the project’s credibility. Price Action Has Been Volatile Market response was mixed. WLFI’s token fell about 10% on the news and amid broader market pressure, according to price trackers and industry coverage. That drop followed larger market moves that hit many cryptocurrencies and came as WLFI pushed its retail plans. Traders will watch whether the product announcement stabilizes demand or adds short-term selling. Regulatory And Operational Questions Remain Reports caution that linking a stablecoin to mainstream payment rails raises regulatory and custody questions. Apple Pay integration, card network approvals, reserve transparency for USD1 , and anti-money-laundering checks are among the items that WLFI needs to resolve before broad rollout. If any of these steps are incomplete, rollout could face delays or limits in some countries.

This week, however, Bitcoin has dropped to the lower end of its established consolidation range, fluctuating between $110,000 and $115,000. Analysts from The Bull Theory have pinpointed several factors contributing to this downturn. How Fed Policies And QT Are Impacting Crypto One of the primary reasons for the current situation is the ongoing capital flow favoring traditional assets. In the wake of rate cuts, institutional investors tend to channel their funds into stocks and gold first, as these are considered high-liquidity assets with a proven track record. In contrast, cryptocurrencies, particularly altcoins, often find themselves at the end of the liquidity pipeline. They typically see price increases only when risk appetite broadens significantly among investors.

While the central bank cut rates in September, other variables are restricting the flow of capital into cryptocurrencies. Quantitative tightening (QT) is still being implemented, with the Fed actively reducing its balance sheet. Moreover, the US Treasury is absorbing liquidity through the replenishment of the Treasury General Account (TGA), and money market funds are currently holding over $7.7 trillion in cash that remains largely idle. This lack of liquidity means that any spillover effect into the crypto market will be limited, resulting in a slower rotation of capital into digital assets. Cyclical Trends Suggest Potential Rebound The macroeconomic patterns observed in September 2024 are also reemerging. Last year, following a rate cut, Bitcoin surged past $60,000, while Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins enjoyed significant gains. However, this was followed by a sharp decline, with Bitcoin dropping 11% and Ethereum experiencing an even steeper fall. In a similar vein, this September has seen Bitcoin hover around $112,000 after briefly touching $118,000, while Ethereum has slipped from $4,600 to approximately $4.1,00. This cyclical pattern suggests that crypto may be primed for a rebound, but only after a period of consolidation and confirmation. Moreover, the impending expiry of options contracts for Bitcoin and Ethereum is adding another layer of volatility to the market. Stablecoin Movement And Institutional Inflows Another factor impacting the market is the supply and velocity of stablecoins. While the total supply of stablecoins has surged from $204 billion in January to $308 billion in September—an all-time high—the velocity of these assets is not keeping pace. The analysts have identified that much of this capital remains inactive, either sitting idle, bridged, or utilized off-exchange. Until stablecoin velocity increases, the price impact on cryptocurrencies is likely to remain subdued.

In the aftermath of all-time highs in equity markets, Bitcoin has previously averaged a 12% increase within 30 days and a remarkable 35% over 90 days. Notably, following the Nasdaq’s all-time highs, Bitcoin surged by an impressive 46% in the same 90-day timeframe. For crypto markets to regain their momentum, active movement of stablecoins is essential, along with a cooling off of derivatives trading and substantial purchases from institutional investors and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

52231877,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84341,1758783750,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Central Bank of Bahrain: XRP Is Compliant to Shariah,https://timestabloid.com/central-bank-of-bahrain-xrp-is-compliant-to-shariah/,"Crypto commentator Pumpius recently drew attention to an important development for XRP. Sharing documents, he highlighted that the Shariyah Review Bureau, licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain, has confirmed that XRP can be deemed Shariah compliant. The document, titled “Sharia Analysis Ripple,” contains a section called “Shariah Opinion” that evaluates the XRP Ledger and its native token. According to the analysis, the XRP Ledger is described as an open-source blockchain where XRP functions as the native token. It emphasizes XRP’s role in facilitating cross-border transactions, explaining that Ripple developed the ledger to enable payments between banks worldwide. The Shariyah Review Bureau stated that XRP can serve as a bridge between difficult-to-match fiat currencies, making it Shariah-compliant. Central Bank of Bahrain’s Shariyah Review Bureau has confirmed it: $XRP is COMPLIANT for their purposes. Ripple’s rails aren’t just fast, they’re crossing every regulatory and regional barrier. THIS IS BIG! $XRP pic.twitter.com/9WfcZQ1yPh — Pumpius (@pumpius) September 21, 2025 Implications for Financial Transactions This confirmation holds weight because it opens the possibility for broader adoption of XRP in regions where compliance with Islamic finance principles is essential. Many financial institutions in Muslim-majority countries require verification from licensed Shariah advisors before engaging with new financial instruments. The endorsement by the Shariyah Review Bureau, which operates under the Central Bank of Bahrain, provides formal validation that XRP may be used in financial operations without conflicting with Shariah principles. Pumpius commented on this outcome, saying, “Central Bank of Bahrain’s Shariyah Review Bureau has confirmed it: $XRP is COMPLIANT for their purposes. Ripple’s rails aren’t just fast, they’re crossing every regulatory and regional barrier. THIS IS BIG! $XRP.” His statement reflects how this decision could remove a significant barrier for financial institutions in the Middle East and beyond that operate under Islamic banking standards. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Community’s Reaction The post drew responses from several community members who recognized the significance of the ruling. An account named XRPToTheMoon stated , “If true, huge. The Shariyah law does not permit many types of bank-to-bank transactions with the Western world on the SWIFT messaging system.” This remark underlines how the decision could position XRP as a practical alternative for financial transfers where SWIFT’s mechanisms might face restrictions under Islamic law. The Shariyah Review Bureau’s endorsement situates XRP within a framework that could appeal to Islamic financial institutions seeking efficient digital payment solutions while remaining compliant with Shariah law. For Ripple , this recognition underscores the versatility of its technology and its potential alignment with regional financial systems that adhere to specific religious guidelines. While the immediate impact remains to be seen, the confirmation provides XRP with credibility that could influence adoption in markets where Shariah compliance is a mandatory requirement. The combination of cross-border functionality, regulatory recognition, and religious validation positions XRP in a unique place within the global digital asset ecosystem.

A 3x return is nothing to scoff at, especially in traditional markets, but in the meme coin arena, it can look almost tame. Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the genre’s titans, is lining up for just that, a potential tripling of value as token burns, Shibarium growth, and whale activity continue to strengthen its foundation. Yet while SHIB’s path points to steady gains, traders can’t ignore the frenzy swirling around Layer Brett ($LBRETT). Analysts are floating 150x projections for this presale star, framing it as a high-risk, high-reward moonshot. The question? Can SHIB’s 3x stability compete with Brett’s 150x hype. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Prediction: Aiming for 3x Gains Shiba Inu has proven it’s more than just a meme fad. Trading at $0.000012 with RSI hovering near 40, the Shiba Inu price prediction for Q4 2025 points to a potential 3x rally toward $0.000036. That kind of run hinges on Shibarium’s growing 1M+ daily transactions, whale accumulation, and consistent token burns driving momentum. Analysts see a realistic climb to an average of $0.00002184, with highs stretching to $0.0000326–$0.00004 if Bitcoin’s bull wave lifts the broader market. Still, SHIB has its limitations. Weekly dips (-1.54%) show sentiment isn’t bulletproof, and while governance tweaks and a potential double-bottom pattern hint at short-term moves to $0.000025, its $7.6B cap keeps things relatively grounded. For traders chasing big ROI, a 3x Shiba Inu price prediction feels solid, but far from the fireworks brewing in fresher meme projects. Analysts See Layer Brett at 150x: The Meme-L2 Powerhouse Set to Eclipse SHIB Layer Brett ($LBRETT) isn’t playing the same game as SHIB, it’s rewriting the script. Priced at just $0.0058 in presale with $4M+ already raised, this Ethereum Layer-2 meme coin combines viral culture with real utility. Think Solana-level speed (10K TPS) and near-free fees ($0.0001/tx), but with the branding power of Based.Brett’s meme lore. Instead of piling on red tape, Layer Brett keeps it simple, decentralized, self-custodial, and built for ease of use. Think of it as crypto without the gatekeepers: no exchanges locking you in, no middlemen clipping fees. You own your keys, your tokens, your yield. Whether you’re chasing staking rewards or diving into NFTs, Brett’s design keeps control where it belongs, with the community, turning everyday traders into power players in its growing ecosystem. Add gamified staking, NFT integrations, and juicy 630% APY yields, and Brett feels more like a theme park than a token. Early stakers are locking in rewards that make SHIB’s burn mechanics look tame by comparison. Big money is already circling. Former XRP and Cardano whales are loading up, while Brett’s $1M giveaway on X has turbocharged community buzz. Price watchers now throw out projections from $0.20 to $0.90 once Uniswap trading goes live. Stack that against SHIB’s 3x cap, and Brett suddenly reads less like a meme punt and more like Uptober’s headline act. The final word: chasing 3x vs 150x In crypto, the biggest wins often go to those willing to lean into momentum before the crowd piles in. That’s where Layer Brett sits right now: early, loud, and pulling capital and attention at breakneck speed. While Shiba Inu is carving out respectable, almost blue-chip-like credibility, Layer Brett is still the wild card with the kind of upside that keeps traders awake at night. Presale prices don’t last forever, and neither does the first-mover edge. Miss Brett now, and you may be chasing green candles later. Uptober doesn’t wait—and neither does a 150x shot.

On Thursday, local news outlet Yonhap News reported that the transaction is expected to be approved by both companies’ boards in the coming weeks, which will give Naver control of Upbit . The news led to a small rally in Naver Corp. shares (KRX), which climbed as much as 11%, now trading at around 247,000 won ($176) after news publications shared reports of the planned takeover. Naver to take control of Upbit via stock swap A stock swap allows two companies to exchange shares, creating a governance structure similar to that of a parent and subsidiary. Much different from traditional mergers financed in cash, it enables an acquisition by using equity as the primary vehicle, effectively folding Dunamu under Naver’s fintech umbrella. Upbit, launched in 2017, is ranked as South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume and users, with more than 180 listed assets and over 300 trading pairs. Naver Pay is among the most popular digital wallets in the country, competing with Kakao Pay, Toss, and major banks. Both sides see the deal as a springboard for a deeper push into the financial services industry, including South Korea’s stablecoin market. Naver Financial already processes annual payment volumes worth 80 trillion won ($58 billion), as it is one of the country’s most used digital wallets. Using its reach with Upbit’s $2.9 billion daily volumes would make it the fourth-largest crypto exchange in trading activity. A source with knowledge of the stock swap deal said the new entity will cover nearly every corner of consumer finance, including shopping, payments, and crypto trading at large. The companies have previously cooperated on the development of a won-pegged stablecoin . Sources close to the talks said that the planned merger will see the two firms formalize those efforts and will further pursue international business and partnerships in the coming months. “The two companies are each expected to soon hold board meetings to approve the comprehensive stock swap,” a person familiar with the matter told reporters in a press briefing earlier today. Rival Bithumb signs US partnership during Blockchain Week The announcement comes against the backdrop of the Korea Blockchain Week, a digital assets conference taking place in Seoul, hosted by Web3 ecosystem developer FACTBLOCK. On Wednesday, Bithumb, the country’s second-largest crypto exchange and Upbit’s main domestic rival, unveiled a partnership with World Liberty Financial , the US President Donald Trump family crypto venture. World Liberty Financial plans to launch a debit card and retail application “very soon,” co-founder Zak Folkman said during a panel at the conference. In collaboration with Bithumb, the card could link the WLFI’s stablecoin, USD1, with payment platforms from the US, including integration with Apple Pay. According to the company, the retail application will merge peer-to-peer transfers with trading functions. The partnership was formalized through a memorandum of understanding with Bithumb.

The asset was trading marginally above $4,000 at the time of writing, after shedding another 3.3% on the day. ETH is currently down 19% from its all-time high, and most of those losses have come over the past week. The sharp decline comes amid a general crypto market pullback that has seen total market capitalization shrink below $4 trillion. However, Ether is getting hit much harder following its epic 225% surge from April to August. Correction to $3,500 Possible Analyst ‘Sykodelic’ predicted a $3,900 bottom over the next few days as oversold signals grow stronger. The bottom is in for Bitcoin. And it’s almost in for $ETH . $ETH is approaching a very similar setup from back June this year with lower low into supply, joined with the RSI getting close to oversold. $3,900+ will be the bottom imo and it will be in the next day or so. Chill… pic.twitter.com/Yt4Y8wRsSw — Sykodelic (@Sykodelic_) September 25, 2025 Macro trader and investor Jason Pizzino said Ether’s abnormal moves “always lead to corrections of at least 20%, generally more like 30%-40%,” “It seems like Ethereum wants to go lower,” said analyst Ted Pillows, who added that the “next support level is around the $3,800 level, which is a good zone to accumulate.” A number of analysts have predicted that ETH would pull back to the $3,500 level, which will take it down around 30% from its peak, which is not unusual for a major correction. The price slump comes amid aggressive accumulation by digital asset treasuries and whale entities, suggesting that weak retail hands are panicking. Ten whales have bought more than 210,000 ETH worth $86s million over-the-counter, said ‘Ash Crypto’ on Thursday, before adding: “While you are panic selling, whales are buying your cheap Ethereum.” Meanwhile, the balance of Ethereum on centralized exchanges has fallen to its lowest levels since 2016, according to data from Glassnode and CryptoQuant. “Although this seems contradictory, as low exchange balances reflect decreased short-term selling, this divergence hints at a contrarian accumulation signal while macro headwinds could soon ease into a rebound for Ethereum,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. Altcoins in Pain While Ethereum is leading the altcoin bloodbath, several other assets are seeing similar or worse losses today. Avalanche (AVAX) has dumped 7.7% on the day in a fall to $31.38 following its stellar doubling in price in less than three months. Pump.fun (PUMP), Mantle (MNT), Cronos (CRO), and Sky (SKY) have lost a similar amount over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Flare (FLR) and Immutable (IMX) are the only top one hundred altcoins in the green at the moment.

Recently, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) made a significant move, unveiling draft rules aimed at enhancing crypto tax reporting . This development is crucial for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency market, signaling a new era of transparency and compliance. Why is Enhanced Crypto Tax Reporting Becoming a Priority? The IRS’s latest initiative stems from a clear objective: to minimize tax evasion and ensure fairness across all asset classes. As the crypto market expanded, so did the potential for unreported income and capital gains. Consequently, the agency has been working to close these gaps, ensuring that digital asset transactions are treated with the same rigor as traditional financial dealings. Crowdfund Insider reported on the draft amendment to the taxpayer information form (W-9). This isn’t just a minor tweak; it represents a foundational shift in how crypto-related financial activities will be monitored and reported. The IRS is making it clear that accountability is paramount. What Do the New Crypto Tax Reporting Rules Entail? Under the proposed changes, cryptocurrency brokers will bear a significant new responsibility. They will be required to collect and report detailed information regarding their customers’ crypto transactions directly to the IRS. Here’s a breakdown of the key requirements: Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) Verification: Brokers must verify the TIN of their crypto-trading customers. This ensures that every transaction can be accurately linked to an individual taxpayer. Income Reporting: Any income generated from crypto assets, such as capital gains from sales or other taxable events, must be accurately reported to the agency. This includes comprehensive data on transactions that result in profit. Effective Date: These amendments are scheduled to take effect in January of next year. This gives brokers and traders time to prepare for the upcoming changes. Penalties for Non-Compliance: The IRS has also outlined penalties for non-compliance. These measures underscore the seriousness with which the agency views these new reporting obligations, aiming to bolster adherence across the board. These rules are designed to create a more robust framework for crypto tax reporting , bringing digital asset transactions firmly into the established tax system. Navigating the Future of Crypto Tax Reporting : Challenges and Benefits While these new rules aim to enhance compliance, they also present both challenges and benefits for the crypto ecosystem. Potential Challenges: Data Management for Brokers: Implementing systems to accurately track and report all necessary transaction data will be a significant undertaking for many crypto brokers. User Understanding: Traders and investors will need to be more diligent in understanding their tax obligations and how their activities are reported. Privacy Concerns: Some users may express concerns regarding the increased sharing of their financial data with government agencies. Key Benefits: Minimizing Tax Evasion: The primary goal is to ensure that everyone pays their fair share, creating a more equitable tax system. Legitimization of Crypto: Enhanced regulation can lend more credibility to the crypto market, potentially encouraging broader institutional and retail adoption. Increased Clarity: Over time, clearer guidelines can reduce ambiguity for taxpayers and provide a more stable environment for digital asset investment. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders and Investors As these new rules approach, what steps should you take to ensure you are prepared for the changes in crypto tax reporting ? Maintain Meticulous Records: Keep detailed records of all your crypto transactions, including purchase dates, prices, sale dates, and sale prices. This will be invaluable for calculating capital gains and losses. Understand Your Broker’s Policies: Familiarize yourself with how your chosen crypto exchange or broker plans to implement these new reporting requirements. Consult a Tax Professional: Given the complexities, seeking advice from a tax professional specializing in digital assets can help you navigate your obligations effectively. Stay Informed: Continue to monitor official IRS announcements and financial news for any further updates or clarifications on these regulations. The IRS’s draft rules for enhanced crypto tax reporting mark a pivotal moment for the digital asset space. While they introduce new responsibilities for brokers and greater scrutiny for traders, these measures are ultimately designed to foster a more transparent and compliant market. By understanding and preparing for these changes, participants can confidently navigate the evolving regulatory landscape and contribute to the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies.

This isn’t a futuristic dream; it’s rapidly becoming a reality. A consortium of nine leading European banks has embarked on a groundbreaking initiative to develop a euro-based stablecoin , a strategic move poised to redefine the continent’s financial landscape. Why Are European Banks Launching a Euro-Based Stablecoin? The motivation behind this ambitious project is clear: to foster Europe’s strategic autonomy in the global payments sector. Currently, the U.S. dollar holds a dominant position in international transactions. This new euro-based stablecoin aims to provide a robust European alternative, offering a stable digital asset pegged directly to the euro. The consortium, which includes financial giants like UniCredit, ING, and Danske Bank, recognizes the need for a sovereign digital payment solution that supports the Eurozone economy. This initiative isn’t just about technology; it’s about economic independence and reinforcing the euro’s global standing. What Are the Benefits of This European Stablecoin Initiative? The development of a European euro-based stablecoin promises several significant advantages for businesses and consumers alike. Enhanced Stability: Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, a stablecoin is designed to maintain a stable value, mirroring the euro. This makes it ideal for everyday transactions, remittances, and cross-border payments. Faster, Cheaper Transactions: Leveraging blockchain technology, this stablecoin could enable near-instantaneous transactions with lower fees compared to traditional banking rails, especially for international transfers. Strategic Autonomy: By offering a European alternative, the project reduces reliance on non-European payment infrastructures, strengthening the continent’s financial sovereignty. Innovation Catalyst: It encourages further innovation within the European fintech ecosystem, potentially leading to new financial products and services built on this digital euro. This collective effort by nine major banks underscores a unified vision for a more efficient and independent European digital economy. When Can We Expect This Euro-Based Stablecoin to Launch? While the project is still in its developmental stages, the consortium has set an ambitious target for its public debut. The launch of this much-anticipated euro-based stablecoin is currently slated for the second half of 2026. This timeline allows for thorough development, rigorous testing, and necessary regulatory approvals across various European jurisdictions. The banks involved, including DekaBank, Banca Sella, and KBC Group, are working collaboratively to ensure the stablecoin meets the highest standards of security, compliance, and user-friendliness. This phased approach is crucial for building confidence and ensuring widespread adoption upon release. What Challenges Might This Euro-Based Stablecoin Face? Despite its promising outlook, the journey to widespread adoption for a new euro-based stablecoin is not without its hurdles. Regulatory Harmonization: Operating across multiple European countries means navigating a complex web of national and EU-level regulations. Ensuring consistent compliance will be paramount. User Adoption: Convincing both businesses and the general public to switch from established payment methods will require significant education and incentives. Competition: The stablecoin will face competition from existing digital payment systems, other stablecoins, and potentially central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) like the digital euro. Technological Scalability: The underlying blockchain infrastructure must be robust enough to handle high transaction volumes efficiently and securely. Addressing these challenges proactively will be key to the project’s long-term success and its ability to truly counter dollar dominance. The collaborative effort by nine prominent European banks to develop a euro-based stablecoin marks a pivotal moment for the continent’s financial future. This initiative is more than just a technological advancement; it’s a strategic declaration of Europe’s intent to forge its own path in the rapidly evolving digital economy. By offering a stable, efficient, and sovereign digital alternative, this project has the potential to enhance economic stability, foster innovation, and ultimately strengthen Europe’s position on the global financial stage. The journey ahead will undoubtedly present challenges, but the collective vision for a more autonomous and efficient payment ecosystem is a powerful driving force. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a euro-based stablecoin? A1: A euro-based stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged 1:1 to the euro. This means its value should always be equivalent to one euro, offering the stability of traditional currency with the benefits of digital assets. Q2: Which banks are involved in this consortium? A2: The consortium includes nine major European banks: UniCredit, ING, DekaBank, Banca Sella, KBC Group, Danske Bank, SEB, CaixaBank, and Raiffeisen International. These institutions are collaboratively working on the development of the euro-based stablecoin . Q3: What is the primary goal of this stablecoin project? A3: The primary goal is to enhance Europe’s strategic autonomy in payments and counter the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the global market. It aims to provide a reliable, efficient, and European-controlled digital payment alternative. Q4: How will this stablecoin differ from a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) like the Digital Euro? A4: While both aim for digital euro payments, this bank-led euro-based stablecoin is a private initiative, whereas a Digital Euro would be issued and managed by the European Central Bank (ECB). They could potentially coexist or even complement each other, offering different functionalities or target audiences. Q5: When is the euro-based stablecoin expected to launch? A5: The consortium is targeting the second half of 2026 for the launch of their euro-based stablecoin , allowing ample time for development, testing, and regulatory compliance.

He also urged the Trump administration to act quickly to reassure Koreans concerned about getting detained for working there. Kim believes that meaningful progress remains virtually impossible without resolving the visa issue. He spoke in an exclusive interview with Bloomberg News in Seoul, and also talked about defense spending and North Korea. U.S. detains South Korean workers in Georgia The country’s official argued that although the projects have not been completely put on hold or formally halted, it will be very difficult for many South Korean workers to enter or re-enter the U.S. until the problem is resolved. Kim also believes the visa issue obscures the recent $350 billion investment fund agreed by both parties in a July trade deal. The prime minister was referring to the incident where hundreds of South Koreans were taken into custody in a raid on a Hyundai Motor Co. and LG Energy Solution Ltd. battery plant under construction in Georgia earlier this month. The U.S. released the detainees, who returned home about a week after the incident. The incident cast a shadow over the ties between South Korea and the U.S., where images of shackled workers circulated widely and fueled public anger. South Korea is now allegedly reconsidering the hefty investment plans for the U.S. by its conglomerates. “In the absence of firm assurances regarding their safety, both they and their families are understandably reluctant to enter the U.S. again while this matter remains unresolved.” – Kim Min-Seok , Prime Minister of South Korea. According to the Korean senior government official, the visa issue has also cast a shadow on the intense negotiations between South Korea and the U.S. to finalize a trade deal. The agreement involves a 15% tariff set on South Korean goods, including automobiles. The two sides remain at a crossroads on finalizing the agreement, since they are divided over how to structure and execute the $350 billion investment package, which is a central pillar of the agreement. Kim revealed that the investment pledge with the U.S. accounts for more than 70% of South Korea’s foreign reserves. He believes the shock to the Korean economy would be severe without a currency swap agreement with Washington. Cryptopolitan previously reported that President Lee Jae Myung acknowledged that a swap agreement between both countries is crucial to avoid an economic crisis. He compared a potential economic crisis similar to what South Korea experienced in 1997 during the Asian Financial Crisis if the country tries to meet all U.S. demands. Kim didn’t elaborate further on the ongoing negotiations but maintained that a deal that fiscally jeopardizes South Korea may require parliamentary approval. The Korean official also hopes that talks between both parties over the deal wouldn’t extend into next year. Kim believes that it’s difficult for South Korea to accept the deal, not just the negotiating team, but also among the public. He was referring to U.S. demands similar to those included in Japan’s $550 billion investment pledge. According to the Korean official, the Japanese deal allows Washington to hike levies on Tokyo if it decides not to fund projects Donald Trump puts forward or settle the deal within 45 days. South Korea raises its defense budget Kim revealed that the country plans to raise its defense spending to 3.5% of its GDP over the next decade. He said the plan is part of a broader push to strengthen its independent national defense. The government official said South Korea mentioned the 3.5% threshold because it judged that it was capable of sustaining that level. He added that South Korea also plans to spend 2.32% of its GDP on defense this year. Kim’s office also maintained that a decision on the defense budget hasn’t been officially made since it’s still under discussion.

Kvardin crypto (KRN) is a cryptocurrency project at the forefront of integrating blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to transform the e-commerce landscape. This innovative approach aims to create a secure, transparent, and efficient decentralized marketplace for trading both virtual and physical goods. As of September 25, 2025 , public interest in Kvardin is clearly reflected in its growing Google search trends, which signal a notable rise in attention from potential investors and tech enthusiasts alike. This article will break down Kvardin’s core features, its market buzz, and the factors driving its trending status. What is Kvardin Crypto and What Problem Does It Solve? Kvardin (KRN) is a purpose-built cryptocurrency designed to solve key inefficiencies in traditional and emerging digital commerce. By leveraging both blockchain and AI , the project seeks to build a trusted, decentralized e-commerce platform. The core problem it addresses is the lack of transparency, high costs, and fragmented user experience prevalent in many online marketplaces today. Kvardin aims to create an all-in-one ecosystem for buying and selling, with its native KRN token acting as the primary access and utility token. Decentralized E-commerce Marketplace: Kvardin is building a marketplace where transactions are secured by blockchain technology, allowing users to engage in peer-to-peer commerce without relying on a centralized intermediary. This reduces transaction fees and increases trust. AI-Powered Enhancements: The platform uses AI for critical functions such as personalized shopping recommendations, intelligent chatbots, and most notably, for building a trusted review ecosystem . The AI processes reviews to identify and flag unreliable or biased content, ensuring customers can make informed decisions. Kvardin Pay and Kvardin Card: The project includes a blockchain payment gateway, Kvardin Pay , to reduce settlement times and overcome foreign exchange inefficiencies. It also offers a “Touch & Pay” crypto card, the Kvardin Card , to facilitate seamless real-world payments. Mobile Wallet Integration: The Kvardin Mobile Wallet is designed for a smooth user experience, providing a simple way to connect with traditional banks and crypto exchanges. Why is Kvardin Crypto Trending in Google Search in 2025? Public interest in Kvardin crypto has been accelerating, and this is clearly visible in the Google search trends for queries like “ Kvardin crypto ” and “ kvardin token .” This heightened search interest is not coincidental; it is being driven by several key factors and recent strategic developments. Integration with Major AI Platforms: A primary driver of its momentum is the project’s reported integration with advanced AI platforms like xAI and the X platform . This strategic move exposes Kvardin to a massive, pre-existing user base, fostering rapid awareness and adoption.z Recent Presale and Upcoming Exchange Listings: The launch of its presale and the anticipation of its upcoming listing on major exchanges are directly fueling the surge in Google searches. This marks a critical moment for the project, as new presales often generate significant public buzz and speculative interest. Media and Analyst Coverage: As seen in publications like StreetInsider , articles discussing Kvardin’s launch and unique features in January and September 2025 have significantly contributed to the increased buzz and search volume. This media attention acts as a powerful signal of topical authority and credibility. Community-Driven Token Model: Kvardin’s emphasis on a fair and community-driven token distribution model—allocating most tokens to participants rather than insiders—resonates with the wider crypto community and reduces the risk of price manipulation, further attracting organic interest. What is the Significance of Kvardin’s AI and Blockchain Integration for E-commerce? The combination of AI and blockchain is a key differentiator for Kvardin. While blockchain provides the foundational security and decentralization for transactions, AI enhances the user experience and builds trust. The AI-powered review system, for instance, addresses a major flaw in current e-commerce: the prevalence of fake or unreliable product reviews. By processing and validating these reviews, Kvardin provides a more authentic shopping environment. This synergy is designed to create a more efficient, secure, and personalized digital commerce experience that stands out in a crowded market. What Role Does the KRN Token Play in the Kvardin Ecosystem? The KRN token is not just a cryptocurrency; it is the central utility token that powers the entire Kvardin ecosystem. It serves multiple purposes: Transaction Currency: KRN is the primary token used for all transactions within the Kvardin marketplace. Governance: It may grant holders governance rights, allowing them to participate in key decisions about the platform’s future. Access Token: KRN can be required to access certain premium features or services on the platform. The utility of the token is crucial to its long-term value and is a key factor that differentiates it from speculative meme coins, positioning it as a fundamental part of the platform’s infrastructure. What is the value proposition of Kvardin (KRN) for users and investors? The value proposition of Kvardin (KRN) is its ability to merge the most impactful technologies of today—blockchain and AI—into a single, cohesive e-commerce ecosystem. For users, this means a more secure, trustworthy, and efficient shopping experience with features like AI-validated reviews and low-fee transactions. For investors, Kvardin represents an investment in the future of decentralized commerce, with a clear utility model and a strategy to gain rapid user adoption through integrations with major AI platforms, distinguishing it from purely speculative assets. How does Kvardin Pay simplify e-commerce payments? Kvardin Pay simplifies e-commerce payments by leveraging blockchain to provide a seamless, low-cost payment gateway. This system is designed to reduce the high transaction fees and slow settlement times associated with traditional payment processors. Additionally, it aims to eliminate foreign exchange inefficiencies by allowing direct, cross-border payments in various cryptocurrencies, with KRN as the core token, thereby streamlining international commerce for both merchants and customers. What are the main investment risks associated with Kvardin crypto? Like all cryptocurrencies, Kvardin crypto carries significant investment risks, including market volatility and the potential for a complete loss of capital. While its Google search trends indicate rising interest, it is crucial to remember that sentiment and hype do not guarantee long-term success. Investors should be cautious and conduct thorough due diligence, as the value of the token is tied to the successful development and user adoption of the Kvardin platform, and the competitive landscape in both e-commerce and crypto is highly dynamic. Conclusion The rise of Kvardin crypto and its corresponding surge in Google search trends underscore a significant shift in the digital economy: the convergence of decentralized finance and artificial intelligence. By building a platform that uses AI to enhance trust and efficiency while relying on blockchain for security and transparency, Kvardin presents a compelling new model for e-commerce. Its strategic integrations with platforms like xAI and its fair token distribution model signal a project with a clear vision for real-world utility. However, as with any new cryptocurrency, potential investors should approach with strategic caution, recognizing that while market interest is high, thorough research and an understanding of inherent market volatility are paramount to making informed decisions.

Growth Potential: As the DeFi sector matures, projects like Ethena that address core market needs with innovative solutions are poised for significant growth. This Ethena investment aligns with a forward-thinking strategy. This move positions M2 Holdings at the forefront of integrating cutting-edge DeFi solutions into conventional wealth management.

Consider these implications: Simplified Onboarding: M2 Global Wealth will handle the complexities of interacting with the Ethena protocol, making it easier for their clients to benefit from ENA’s yield-generating capabilities. Increased Demand: A wider pool of institutional and high-net-worth individuals accessing ENA could lead to increased demand for the token, potentially influencing its market dynamics. Enhanced Liquidity: Greater participation through M2 Global Wealth could also contribute to deeper liquidity for ENA, benefiting all participants in the Ethena ecosystem. This Ethena investment is expected to significantly broaden the appeal and practical application of ENA’s offerings. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Ethena and Its Investors? With this fresh Ethena investment, the protocol is well-positioned for accelerated development and expansion. The partnership with M2 Holdings could unlock new avenues for adoption and innovation.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF. This landmark decision marks a pivotal moment, especially for those eagerly awaiting broader access to the cryptocurrency market through a spot crypto ETF . The Dawn of a New Era: Hashdex’s Spot Crypto ETF Approval On September 24, the SEC gave its nod to Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF. This approval came under a new listing rule change, as confirmed by Nate Geraci, CEO of Novadius Wealth Management. This isn’t just about another fund; it’s about a significant shift in how mainstream investors can engage with digital assets. What makes this particular fund stand out? It’s designed to hold a diverse basket of cryptocurrencies. This includes well-known giants like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), but also features other prominent assets such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), and Uniswap (UNI). This broad inclusion signifies a growing acceptance beyond just the top two. What Does This Mean for Future Spot Crypto ETF Approvals? According to Nate Geraci, the SEC’s recent easing of regulations is a game-changer. It now opens the door for investors to hold a wider array of cryptocurrencies directly through spot ETFs, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is a crucial step forward for the entire industry. Geraci highlighted several cryptocurrencies as strong contenders for the next wave of approvals. He specifically mentioned XRP , Solana (SOL) , and Stellar (XLM) as the most likely candidates. Why these three? Their market capitalization, growing utility, and increasing regulatory clarity are all factors that could make them attractive to regulators. XRP: With its ongoing legal clarity developments, XRP is often seen as a strong candidate. Solana (SOL): Known for its high performance and robust ecosystem, SOL has garnered significant institutional interest. Stellar (XLM): Similar to XRP in its focus on cross-border payments, XLM could also be a strong contender. Unlocking New Investment Horizons with Spot Crypto ETFs The approval of a spot crypto ETF like Hashdex’s offers several compelling benefits for investors. Firstly, it provides a regulated and accessible pathway to invest in a diversified portfolio of digital assets without directly owning the underlying cryptocurrencies. This simplifies the investment process significantly. Secondly, it enhances security. Investors don’t have to worry about managing private keys or securing their digital wallets. Instead, they can rely on the robust security infrastructure of a regulated financial product. This institutional-grade security can attract a new wave of investors who might have been hesitant due to perceived risks. Thirdly, it signals growing institutional acceptance. When major financial bodies like the SEC approve such products, it lends credibility and legitimacy to the entire cryptocurrency market. This can lead to increased capital inflow and further innovation within the space. Navigating the Path Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities for Spot Crypto ETF While the recent approval is undoubtedly positive, the path forward for broader spot crypto ETF adoption isn’t without its challenges. Regulatory clarity, particularly for altcoins, remains an evolving landscape. Each asset presents unique considerations for regulators, from market manipulation concerns to custody solutions. However, the opportunities are immense. As more spot ETFs gain approval, we could see a significant influx of capital from traditional finance into the crypto ecosystem. This could lead to increased liquidity, greater price stability, and a more mature market overall. It also empowers investors with more choices and diversified exposure to this dynamic asset class. The Future is Bright: A Compelling Summary The SEC’s approval of Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF is more than just a regulatory green light; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving perception and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. This momentous decision paves the way for a future where diversified crypto investments become increasingly accessible and secure through spot crypto ETF offerings. With XRP, Solana, and Stellar already on the radar for potential future approvals, the landscape of crypto investing is poised for unprecedented growth and innovation. This development promises to democratize access to digital assets, making them a more integral part of modern investment portfolios. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot crypto ETF? A: A spot crypto ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) allows investors to gain exposure to the actual, current market price of cryptocurrencies without directly owning or holding the digital assets themselves. It trades on traditional stock exchanges, making crypto investing more accessible through regulated financial products. Q2: Which cryptocurrencies are included in the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF? A: The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF includes a diversified basket of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), and Uniswap (UNI). Q3: Why are XRP, Solana, and Stellar considered likely candidates for future spot ETF approvals? A: These cryptocurrencies are viewed as strong candidates due to their significant market capitalization, growing utility, and increasing regulatory clarity. Experts like Nate Geraci suggest the SEC’s easing regulations make their approval more probable. Q4: What are the main benefits of investing in a spot crypto ETF? A: Benefits include easier access to diversified crypto investments, enhanced security (as investors don’t manage private keys), and a signal of growing institutional acceptance, which can attract more capital to the market. Q5: How does this SEC approval impact the broader cryptocurrency market? A: This approval is a significant step towards legitimizing digital assets within traditional finance. It can lead to increased institutional investment, greater market liquidity, and potentially pave the way for more diverse crypto investment products in the future, fostering a more mature market.

Questioned by reporters about the extent of the breach, MTA spokesperson Veronica Battisti said: “The agency is unable to disclose specific or additional details regarding what data has been lost because of the sensitivity of the ongoing investigation.” The Maryland Department of Information Technology has confirmed it is working with law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity firms to trace the source of the intrusion and assess the depth of the damage. Transportation systems, including buses, subways, and light rail, were not directly impacted. However, the attack affected several real-time information services and tools, including those linked to a program known as Mobility, a service that orders shared rides from home through a website for those who do not use bus stops. Per cybercrime news outlet The Record, Rhysida was responsible for a ransomware attack against Prince George’s County Public Schools (PGCPS), one of the largest districts in the Washington, DC, suburbs. The attack, which occurred in August 2023, caused a network outage that disrupted operations just before the new school year. PGCPS, which serves about 130,000 students, later confirmed in a regulatory filing that personal information of nearly 100,000 individuals may have been exposed. “The information present in the files that may have been viewed or acquired as a result of this incident varies per person, and includes individuals’ names, financial account information, and Social Security numbers,” the district said at the time. Pennsylvania attorney general’s office hit by ransomware In other-related news, ransomware attacks were also reported by Pennsylvania’s Office of the Attorney General in early September. According to Attorney General Dave Sunday, the cybercrime group Inc. ransomware had encrypted files and communications systems on August 11. AG Sunday said courts granted extensions in certain cases where evidence and court filings had been affected, and that no prosecutions or investigations would fail “because of the cyberattack.” “This situation has certainly tested OAG staff and prompted some modifications to our typical routines; however, we are committed to our duty and mission to protect and represent Pennsylvanians, and are confident that mission is being fulfilled,” Sunday said in a statement. The office has not disclosed if any personal data was stolen, but officials said anyone whose information was compromised would be notified once the investigation concludes. Security researchers said the Pennsylvania incident may have been caused by security flaws in Citrix NetScaler devices that are used by several government and corporate networks . A CVE-2025-5777 or “Citrix Bleed 2” exploit could allow attackers to bypass authentication to access sensitive government systems. Cybersecurity analyst Kevin Beaumont published evidence suggesting that at least two internet-exposed Citrix NetScaler appliances in the attorney general’s office were vulnerable before being taken offline.

Price Prediction and Risks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/is-dogen-crypto-a-good-investment-price-prediction/,"BitcoinWorld Is Dogen Crypto a Good Investment? Price Prediction and Risks DOGEN crypto is a Solana-based meme coin that combines the popular “ Swole Doge ” meme with degen culture, targeting a niche of investors who are open to high-risk, high-reward opportunities. As of September 25, 2025 , its price stands at approximately $0.000114 , having experienced significant volatility since its all-time high of $0.006535 . This article provides a comprehensive overview of its features, potential for growth, and the critical risks associated with investing in DOGEN . What is DOGEN Crypto and What Are Its Core Features? DOGEN crypto is a digital asset built on the high-speed Solana network , leveraging the chain’s low fees and fast transaction times. Unlike utility tokens with a specific real-world application, DOGEN is a meme coin driven primarily by community sentiment and social media buzz. Its core features are designed to attract and retain a loyal investor base within the volatile meme coin market. Community-Centric Ecosystem: The project is supported by a highly active community, reportedly boasting over 15,000 holders during its presale phase. A strong community is a vital component for the growth and survival of meme coins. Staking Opportunities: DOGEN offers staking with a reported 30-50% APY , providing a passive income stream for long-term holders and incentivizing them to keep their tokens locked, which can reduce selling pressure. DogenTap App: A key part of the roadmap is the planned DogenTap App , a Telegram-integrated application that will introduce gamified elements like PvP battles and seasonal events. This feature is intended to increase engagement and provide a form of utility beyond simple trading. Referral Program: To expand its user base, DOGEN has a multi-level referral program that rewards existing holders for attracting new investors, further strengthening its community-driven growth model. What Are the DOGEN Price Predictions for 2025 and Beyond? Price predictions for highly volatile assets like DOGEN crypto are speculative and should be treated with extreme caution. However, based on market analysis and its roadmap, optimistic projections suggest potential for significant growth. The project’s presale activities have already seen surges of 300-400% , and some analyses even point to potential thousand-fold returns in a highly bullish market. Optimistic Scenario: In a very bullish market, some analysts predict that DOGEN could reach price targets of $0.004-$0.01 or even $0.05-$0.15 . Factors Driving Potential Growth: The team is actively working toward listings on both decentralized ( DEX ) and centralized ( CEX ) exchanges, including a potential major platform like Binance.US . A successful listing on a top-tier exchange could exponentially increase liquidity and public visibility, leading to a price surge. Is DOGEN Crypto a Good Investment? Understanding the Risks While the potential for high returns is a major draw, it is essential for any investor to be fully aware of the significant risks associated with DOGEN crypto . Investing in a meme coin is a form of high-risk speculation and is not suitable for all investors. Extreme Volatility: The price of DOGEN is highly volatile, as evidenced by its 90% drop from its 2024 peak. Such dramatic price swings are common with meme coins and can lead to rapid and substantial losses. Limited Utility: Compared to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or even other meme coins like SHIB that are developing ecosystems with utility, DOGEN’s primary function is speculative. The limited utility could hinder its long-term growth and make it more susceptible to market downturns. Liquidity and Market Recognition: The token’s current market value is not yet widely recognized, and its circulating supply is currently 0 . This lack of liquidity can make it difficult to buy or sell large quantities without causing significant price impact. Is DOGEN a Good Investment if I am a beginner? No, DOGEN crypto is not considered a suitable investment for beginners due to its high volatility and speculative nature. Beginner investors are generally advised to start with established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum , which have a longer history, proven utility, and lower risk profiles. Meme coins, including DOGEN, are best suited for experienced investors who understand the risks and are prepared for the possibility of a total loss of their investment. What is the APY for staking DOGEN? According to the project’s details, staking DOGEN can yield an estimated 30-50% APY . Staking is a process where holders lock up their tokens to support the network and, in return, earn rewards. This APY is a key feature designed to attract investors who want to earn passive income, but it’s important to note that the high yield can also be a reflection of the high-risk nature of the asset. What is the purpose of the DogenTap App? The DogenTap App is a key feature on the DOGEN roadmap designed to provide tangible utility and engagement for the community. Integrated with Telegram, the app will include gamified elements like PvP battles and seasonal events, which are aimed at increasing user interaction and giving holders a reason to use and hold the token beyond pure speculation. This move from a pure meme coin to a more interactive project is a crucial step for its long-term viability. Conclusion In the world of meme coins, DOGEN crypto presents a classic high-risk, high-reward proposition. Its success is heavily reliant on community engagement, social media trends, and the successful execution of its ambitious roadmap, including major exchange listings and the launch of the DogenTap App . While its recent presale performance and some optimistic price predictions may seem compelling, the inherent volatility and lack of long-term utility remain significant risks. For any investor considering DOGEN , a deep understanding of these factors and a willingness to accept the possibility of a total loss are crucial. This post Is Dogen Crypto a Good Investment?

South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has made a significant announcement that’s got the community buzzing: the official Popcat listing is happening soon. This move is set to bring new opportunities and attention to the popular meme coin, making it a key event for traders and enthusiasts alike. If you’re looking to dive into the latest trends, this development on Bithumb is definitely one to watch. What is the Popcat Listing on Bithumb All About? Bithumb, one of South Korea’s largest and most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges, has officially announced that it will list Popcat (POPCAT) against the South Korean won (KRW). This highly anticipated Popcat listing is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. UTC on September 25. For traders, there’s an added bonus: trading will be entirely fee-free until 10:00 a.m. UTC on September 27. This limited-time offer provides a unique window for early participants. Popcat itself is a well-known meme coin that has captured the attention of a vibrant online community. Its listing on a major exchange like Bithumb signifies a growing acceptance and institutional recognition for these community-driven digital assets. The availability of POPCAT against the KRW pair means that South Korean investors will have direct access, potentially boosting its liquidity and market presence significantly. Why is This Popcat Listing a Major Opportunity? The decision by Bithumb to proceed with the Popcat listing carries substantial weight for several reasons. For Popcat, it’s a massive leap forward. Being listed on a top-tier exchange like Bithumb immediately grants it increased visibility and accessibility to a broader investor base, particularly in the robust South Korean market. This can lead to: Enhanced Liquidity: More trading activity typically results in better price discovery and easier entry/exit for traders. Increased Legitimacy: A listing on a regulated exchange lends credibility to meme coins, which are sometimes viewed with skepticism. Community Growth: Greater exposure can attract new members to the Popcat community, fostering further development and engagement. For Bithumb, this move demonstrates its commitment to expanding its offerings and staying relevant in a dynamic market. By including popular meme coins, Bithumb can attract a new demographic of traders who are interested in these trending assets, potentially increasing its user base and trading volumes. Navigating the Popcat Listing: Key Considerations for Traders While the Popcat listing presents exciting opportunities, it’s crucial for traders to approach it with a well-informed strategy. The initial days following a new listing, especially with fee-free trading, can be characterized by high volatility. Here are some actionable insights: Understand the Fee-Free Period: Take advantage of the initial fee-free trading window, but be mindful of market dynamics. This period often sees increased activity and potential price swings. Research Popcat: Before investing, thoroughly research Popcat’s community, development, and market sentiment. Understand what drives its value. Risk Management: Meme coins can be highly speculative. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to mitigate potential downside risks. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on social media and crypto news outlets for real-time updates and community sentiment surrounding the Popcat listing. The influx of new traders and capital can create significant price movements, both upwards and downwards. Being prepared for these fluctuations is key to making informed decisions. The Future Landscape for Popcat and Meme Coins The Bithumb Popcat listing is more than just a single event; it reflects a broader trend in the cryptocurrency space where meme coins are gaining significant traction and mainstream recognition. While they offer immense potential for rapid growth, they also come with inherent challenges, primarily their price volatility and reliance on community sentiment and viral trends. However, the increasing number of listings on major exchanges suggests a maturing market for these assets. Successful meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have demonstrated that strong communities and strategic listings can lead to sustained interest and even utility development. The future of Popcat will largely depend on its ability to maintain community engagement and potentially explore new use cases beyond its meme status. In conclusion, Bithumb’s announcement to facilitate the Popcat listing is a landmark event for both the exchange and the meme coin community. It opens up new avenues for investment and further solidifies the presence of community-driven tokens in the mainstream crypto landscape. While the initial fee-free trading period offers an attractive entry point, prudent trading strategies and thorough research remain paramount. This development underscores the ever-evolving nature of the crypto market, where innovation and community engagement continue to drive exciting new opportunities.

Understanding the September 2025 Downturn,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/why-is-the-crypto-market-crashing-understanding-the-september-2025-downturn/,"BitcoinWorld Why is the Crypto Market Crashing? Understanding the September 2025 Downturn The cryptocurrency market has entered a period of significant turbulence, commonly referred to by analysts as “ Red September 2025 .” As of September 25, 2025 , the global crypto market capitalization has seen a sharp decline, with over $162 billion wiped out in a short period. This downturn is not caused by a single event but is a perfect storm of macroeconomic headwinds, market-specific vulnerabilities, and recurring seasonal trends. For investors, understanding these factors is critical for navigating the current volatility. What Are the Key Factors Driving the Crypto Market Crash? The recent crash is a result of several interconnected issues that have collectively put downward pressure on the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. These factors are influencing everything from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to smaller altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) . Macroeconomic Pressures: A strengthening U.S. dollar is a primary driver. As the dollar gains momentum and is sought after as a safe-haven asset during geopolitical tensions, investor appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrency wanes. Disappointing U.S. jobs reports and broader economic concerns have also contributed to a “risk-off” sentiment. Massive Liquidations from Leveraged Trading: The market has experienced a cascade of liquidations exceeding $1.65 billion . High levels of leveraged trading positions meant that even a small price decline triggered massive sell-offs as traders were forced to close their positions, which amplified the initial downward momentum. Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing debates and proposed regulations in key markets like the U.S. and E.U. concerning crypto exchanges and anti-money laundering measures have introduced significant market volatility and investor caution. The “September Effect” Seasonal Trend: Historically, September has been a weak month for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, a phenomenon sometimes called the “ September curse .” This recurring pattern often leads to lower trading volumes and technical selling pressures, which can make the market more susceptible to downturns. How Have Major Cryptocurrencies Performed in the Downturn? The market-wide sell-off has hit major cryptocurrencies, reversing some of the gains seen earlier in the year. Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , has fallen below $112,000 from recent highs above $122,000 . Much of this decline is attributed to heavy liquidations in the futures market, where a massive amount of leveraged bets were wiped out. As of September 25, 2025 , Bitcoin is trading near the $111,000-$112,000 range. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum has also experienced a significant drop, falling below $4,200 from its recent peaks. The second-largest crypto is particularly sensitive to market pressures because of its deep integration with the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Altcoins: While some major altcoins like Solana and Dogecoin have also experienced pressure, the sell-off has been widespread, affecting the entire market and shrinking the global crypto market capitalization to approximately $3.80 trillion . What Is the Current Market Sentiment and Outlook? The current market sentiment, as reflected by the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , has shifted toward “ fear ,” indicating that investors are becoming more cautious and risk-averse. Despite this short-term negativity, the long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic for several reasons. Institutional Confidence: Analysts note that institutional inflows into the crypto market remain strong despite the recent sell-off, which signals long-term confidence in the asset class. Strong Fundamentals: Ongoing network upgrades and the continued expansion of ecosystems like Ethereum support a longer-term positive view. Natural Market Correction: Many experts view this downturn as a natural and necessary market correction, which can help flush out over-leveraged positions and set the stage for a healthier, more sustainable recovery in Q4 2025 and beyond. What is the “September Effect” in cryptocurrency? The “ September Effect ” refers to the historical trend of negative returns for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market during the month of September. This pattern has been observed in multiple years, with September often showing weaker performance than other months. While the exact causes are debated, it is often attributed to seasonal factors like the end of summer trading, profit-taking, and broader market sentiment that contributes to selling pressure, making the market more susceptible to downturns like the one seen in September 2025 . How do liquidations amplify a crypto market crash? Liquidations play a critical role in amplifying a crypto market crash by creating a domino effect of forced selling. When traders use borrowed funds (leverage) to open a position, they risk losing their collateral if the market moves against them. If the price falls to a certain level, the exchange automatically sells their assets to cover the debt, a process known as liquidation. This forced selling adds immense downward pressure to the market, causing prices to fall even further and triggering more liquidations, leading to a cascade effect that can quickly wipe out billions of dollars . Is the crypto market outlook for 2025 still positive despite the crash? Despite the crash in September 2025 , many analysts maintain a positive long-term outlook for the crypto market. While short-term volatility is expected, the underlying fundamentals of the market remain strong. Factors such as continued institutional adoption , ongoing network upgrades, and the normalization of regulatory environments are seen as strong tailwinds for a potential recovery. The current downturn is largely viewed as a necessary correction that could pave the way for a more sustainable and robust rally later in 2025 and beyond. Conclusion The current crypto market crash in September 2025 is a complex event driven by a convergence of global economic factors and crypto-specific market dynamics. While the short-term outlook is cautious, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index signaling fear, the sell-off is viewed by many as a healthy correction that cleans out excess leverage and repositions the market for future growth. For investors, understanding these drivers is essential to avoid panic selling and to focus on the long-term fundamentals of the market, which remain supported by institutional interest and technological advancements.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, faces a liquidity crunch on major exchanges that some believe could propel it to $200,000 within months. Yet while these large-cap assets dominate headlines, a presale token, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , is quietly positioning itself for what analysts project could be a 45x rally, offering the kind of growth that Solana and Bitcoin can no longer deliver at their size. Solana Targets 4500: Whale Accumulation and DeFi Growth Fuel SOL Outlook Fresh data shows 17 treasury firms now hold 17.1 million SOL, close to 3% of the circulating supply. Forward Industries recently deployed $1.65 billion into Solana DeFi, while Galaxy Digital added $1.55 billion in just five days. Helius also raised another $500 million for Solana-focused strategies, positioning SOL as a leading target for corporate allocations. Stablecoin inflows are another catalyst. Solana’s total supply has reached $13.3 billion, the highest in its history, signalling “dry powder” ready for deployment into DeFi protocols. Solana’s TVL now sits at $12.9 billion, cementing its #2 spot behind Ethereum, while weekly DEX volumes have jumped more than 32%. Traders are watching the $250 zone as pivotal. A clean break above could ignite momentum toward the $300–$500 range, with technical setups such as a monthly cup-and-handle pattern pointing to higher targets. Bitcoin’s Scarcity Pushes $200,000 Forecasts. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is back in the spotlight as exchange reserves hit critically low levels. Reports from Binance show available BTC balances shrinking rapidly, echoing the conditions that preceded June’s rally to $124,000. With a circulating supply capped at 21 million and institutional demand accelerating, analysts like Timothy Peterson suggest BTC could touch $200,000 within 170 days if current conditions hold. Scarcity-driven value remains Bitcoin’s defining feature, and a repeat of previous parabolic rallies is firmly on the table. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Presale With a 45x Target Momentum has been striking. After raising almost $25.9 million, Little Pepe has entered stage 13 of its presale at $0.0022, with the final stage closing at $0.0030. Early buyers have doubled their stakes since stage 1, and the fundraising pace suggests demand is only accelerating. The presale window is narrowing quickly, with just over a billion tokens left in allocation. What Sets LILPEPE Apart Unlike meme coins that exist only on borrowed hype, Little Pepe is building its Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 chain explicitly designed for meme tokens. This chain eliminates high gas fees and integrates protections against sniper bots and rug pulls — problems that have plagued meme traders in past cycles. The project’s tokenomics are structured to ensure long-term sustainability: 26.5% allocated to presale buyers 10% to liquidity 30% held in reserves for ecosystem growth 10% for marketing and DEX allocation 13.5% dedicated to staking and rewards 0% transaction tax This balance ensures both strong liquidity at launch and incentives for holders, while maintaining a capped 100 billion token supply. Trust has been another focus. LILPEPE has completed a Certik audit, scoring 95.49%, and has already secured a CoinMarketCap listing before its debut. Its presale has also been amplified by a $777,000 giveaway and additional ETH rewards for top buyers. With presale momentum, structured tokenomics, and a fast-growing community, LILPEPE is emerging as a compelling meme coin of 2025. It is a project designed with the infrastructure to support long-term expansion. Conclusion Solana’s path to $500 and Bitcoin’s race toward $200,000 highlight the strength of institutional flows and scarcity-driven demand. But for investors looking beyond steady gains, Little Pepe offers a different proposition: a presale-driven project with the potential for transformative returns. As the final stages of its presale unfold, Little Pepe may soon prove that smaller, well-structured tokens can still deliver the most explosive upside in a cycle dominated by whales and institutions.

Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin (BTC) are two such currencies with predictions of substantial price increases due to specific market dynamics. Another intriguing development in the crypto space is Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a presale token that is gaining traction due to its unique offering and potential for a high return on investment. Understanding Solana's Potential Surge to $500 Solana, a leading cryptocurrency known for its high-speed transactions, is now experiencing a significant uptick in interest from both retail and institutional investors. Recent statistics indicate that treasury firms presently hold about 3% of SOL's circulating supply. Moreover, large investments have flowed into Solana's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems, with firms like Forward Industries and Galaxy Digital contributing billions towards its DeFi projects. This influx is creating a bullish scenario for SOL, suggesting a possible surge to the $500 mark. Bitcoin on the Path to $200,000? Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, is witnessing a renewed interest that might drive its price to unprecedented levels. Recent analysis highlights a severe liquidity crunch on major exchanges, a signal historically linked to substantial price increases. Current trends and expert predictions suggest that if these market conditions persist, Bitcoin's price could escalate to around $200,000, underscoring its ongoing relevance and potential as a lucrative investment. The Rise of Little Pepe: A 45x Growth Prospect Amidst the high market caps of established cryptocurrencies, Little Pepe emerges as a promising new player. The token is in the last stages of its presale, having already garnered significant attention and funding, setting the stage for explosive growth post-launch. Little Pepe distinguishes itself by creating an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 chain tailored for meme tokens, which aims to address common issues such as high transaction fees and market manipulations. Tokenomics and strategic giveaways, such as a $777,000 giveaway and ETH rewards for top participants, are propelling Little Pepe forward, creating a strong foundation for its future in the cryptocurrency market. Final Thoughts The ongoing developments in the cryptocurrency markets highlight the potential for significant financial growth in both established and emerging tokens. While Solana and Bitcoin continue to attract substantial investor interest due to their potential for high returns, Little Pepe offers a unique opportunity through its innovative approach and aggressive presale strategy. For investors looking for opportunities beyond the usual suspects, Little Pepe presents a compelling option.

Just as the rise and fall of the ‘digital gold’ gives investors and market participants a good sense of where the broader crypto market could be headed, Dogecoin’s price movements are also closely watched for the same reason. After all, DOGE was the first major meme coin. To really understand its dominance, consider the difference in market capitalizations. Dogecoin, at number one, commands over $35B , while Shiba Inu, the second-largest meme coin, trails far behind with just $7B – a whopping 5x difference. Although Dogecoin has largely been in an uptrend since October 2023 , those rallies haven’t been as one-sided as we’re used to seeing with this dog-themed crypto. That might be about to change, though, as the token has just flashed a very important bullish technical signal, which could suggest a strong run upward is on the cards. Even better, to ensure we aren’t swayed by emotions and instead adopt a 100% objective approach, we turned to ChatGPT for analysis. Read on to see what the AI believes Dogecoin’s immediate future could look like. Plus, we’ll also highlight some of the next 1000x cryptos you can buy right now to benefit from Dogecoin’s upcoming rally. Why Dogecoin’s Golden Cross Could Spark the Next Big Rally On the weekly chart, Dogecoin’s 9-period exponential moving average (EMA) has only recently crossed above the 26-period EMA. Why’s this important? Because this technical indicator is widely looked at as a bullish signal, suggesting not only a shift toward bullish price action but also an explosive one. And there’s plenty of precedent to back that up. For instance, Dogecoin’s last two major rallies – one in early 2024 and the second in late 2024 – both occurred right after the 9 EMA crossed over the 26 EMA, forming the Golden Cross. The arrows in the image above represent when these crossovers occurred. In the case of early 2024, the rally was around 230%, while in late October the rally was a whopping 300%. If we see something similar this time around, Dogecoin could be well on its way to hitting the $0.75 mark. Even better, Ali Martinez, a renowned crypto analyst with over 157K followers on X, recently shared his Dogecoin analysis suggesting that ‘ This is a great zone to buy Dogecoin $DOGE before a bullish breakout to $0.50! ’ All in all, with Dogecoin gaining positive momentum – not to mention the launch of the latest REX Osprey Doge ETF, which is another bullish development for the token – the stage looks set for low-cap altcoins and meme coins to rally alongside. If you’re looking for ideas, here are ChatGPT’s top 3 picks for the best altcoins to buy now . 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Dogecoin-Themed Meme Coin Aiming for 1000x Returns Maxi Doge ($MAXI) ‘s association with Dogecoin certainly makes him one of the best cryptos to buy right now . That said, don’t mistake Maxi for yet another cute-looking Shiba Inu. It’s, in fact, gone to great lengths to become the exact opposite: a fierce, ripped, and hungry ‘dawg.’ Maxi’s determination to outshine Doge as the most popular meme coin comes from his rough childhood, where he was left in the shadows because his popular cousin, Dogecoin, stole all the limelight. Now, with a chunky 40% of its total token supply reserved for PR campaigns, influencer collaborations, and social media marketing, $MAXI has his eye set on becoming the next top trending crypto . While it’s a no-nonsense meme coin – it doesn’t bother itself with any utility or underlying value – $MAXI holders do benefit from exclusive trading competitions and leaderboard prizes. Also, $MAXI plans to list on futures platforms, giving die-hard meme coin traders the ultimate opportunity to crank up leverage and aim for moonshot gains. Currently in presale, Maxi Doge has already pulled in over $2.4M from early investors, with each token priced at just $0.000259. Here’s how to buy $MAXI . Lastly, according to our $MAXI price prediction , the token could hit $0.0024 by year-end. So, if you invest $100 right now, you could make $920 in just a few weeks. Visit Maxi Doge’s official website to learn more about its rage-filled mission, roadmap, and tokenomics. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – New Bitcoin L2 for Solana-Like Speeds, Affordability & Web3 Support Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) wants to improve Bitcoin’s real-world utility by bringing lightning-fast transactions, low fees, and full Web3 support to the network. It could, therefore, be one of the most defining new cryptocurrency projects . And it’s not just us saying so; thousands of big-money investors have poured in millions of dollars in $HYPER’s ongoing presale. It has so far raised over $18.1M, and looks far from done. Each token is currently available for just $0.012975, so you can still get in nice and early. $HYPER’s game-changing mission is powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which lets developers build smart contracts and dApps on Bitcoin itself. And to provide seamless access to this SVM-powered Web3 environment, $HYPER’s non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge enables you to convert your Layer 1 Bitcoin into ‘wrapped’ Layer 2-compatible tokens in just a few simple steps. As a result, Bitcoin users will finally have a jam-packed suite of Web3 applications to work with, including: High-speed DeFi trading apps NFT marketplaces Lending, staking, and swapping DAOs and governance Gaming dApps Can $HYPER be the next crypto to explode ? Our research-backed Bitcoin Hyper price prediction certainly thinks so. The token could churn out a massive 2,300% ROI by the end of 2025, reaching a high of around $0.32. Read through our step-by-step guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper to grab it in the most seamlessly way possible. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website to learn more about how the SVM and Canonical Bridge work. 3. Tutorial ($TUT) – Viral Utility-Based Altcoin Enjoying Fresh Momentum In addition to the two crypto presales above, ChatGPT recommends also including a listed, proven performer like Tutorial ($TUT) in your crypto portfolio. $TUT made its debut in February 2025 and rose to mainstream success shortly after, rising nearly 200% within just a few weeks in June-July. Now, it looks primed for yet another explosive rally. $TUT has only just broken out of a long-drawn consolidation zone, giving it the necessary fuel to charge toward new all-time highs. Even better, Tutorial’s growth is rooted in strong fundamentals. It’s, in fact, tied to the growth of crypto itself. That’s because it’s an AI-powered educational tool designed to teach people about blockchain, cryptocurrency, and specifically the BNB chain ecosystem. So, as crypto gains more ground, the hype around Tutorial is likely only going to increase. Interested? Buy $TUT on Binance or any of the other major crypto exchanges. Recap : With Dogecoin flashing a powerful Golden Cross, there couldn’t be a better time to grab low-priced, high-upside altcoins like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , and Tutorial ($TUT). Disclaimer: None of the above constitutes financial advice. Crypto was and is highly risky, so please do your own research before investing.

The plan includes making advanced versions that will be used to make artificial intelligence chipsets . The U.S. increased export regulations in December to limit Beijing’s access to high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a specialized type of DRAM required to create an AI chip. The state-backed chipmaker’s action highlights China’s increasing need to increase its capacity to produce advanced processors. YMTC launches new venture YMTC chairman Chen Nanxiang led this new venture, which was established last week with a registered capital of 20.7 billion yuan ($2.9 billion). According to Chinese corporate data source Oichacha, YMTC held a 50.2% stake in the partnership, with the remaining ownership being held by state-run Hubei Changsheng Phase III Investment Development Co. The new business would handle every step of the integrated circuit supply chain, from design and production to sales. The disclosure omitted information about the products it will produce. Jukan, a Korean Analyst, stated that the move by YMTC to use DRAM for HBM is not exclusive to one business. He believed that YMTC is collaborating on HBM development wth ChangXin Memory Technology (CXMT). The initiative coincides with significant shifts in the global memory chip business as Chinese big tech companies like YMTC and ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) challenge established firms like US memory chip leader Micron Technology and South Korean giants like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. YMTC expands production capacity Earlier this month, Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. opened a new entity to build a third chip factory in Wuhan. According to Morgan Stanley, by the end of 2024, the two YMTC existing firms in Wuhan, which focus on NAND chips, had the capacity to create 160,000 12-inch wafers per month, with an additional 65,000 wafers anticipated this year. YMTC was added to the U.S. entity list in 2022. The company has played a key role in China’s push for flash memory chip self-sufficiency. The nation had previously relied mostly on imports from Japan, South Korea, and the United States. The Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, released a report on December 2, 2024, to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The report announced China’s capability to produce advanced-node semiconductors for the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced computing. Despite US sanctions, the YMTC has made strides in its NAND technology. Its 3D NAND chip, which featured its revolutionary Xtacking4.0 memory chip design earlier this year, was a major technological advance for the business. In March, YMTC announced around 20 additional patents for methods that can optimize chip-stacking designs and increase processing efficiency. YMTC remained privately owned, with a valuation of 161 billion yuan ($22.5 billion) despite experiencing a loss of 84 million yuan ($11.8 million) in the first nine months of 2024. US government waivers allowed Samsung and SK Hynix to freely transport necessary manufacturing equipment to their facilities in mainland China. The waivers are expected to expire by the end of the year. Samsung and SK Hynix, which make a huge share of their DRAM chips and NAND on the mainland, would need to apply for individual licences to ship US-origin chipmaking tools to China. According to data from research firm TrendForce , YMTC had a revenue share of 8.1% in the first quarter of this year, placing it sixth in the global NAND market. At 31.9%, 16.6%, and 15.4%, respectively, Samsung , SK Hynix, and Micron held the largest shares. The SSD enterprise demand is strong in the fourth quarter, pushing the NAND Flash capacity.

The Fear and Greed Index shows we are firmly in a greedy state, meaning investors are no longer hiding in stablecoins. They are chasing tokens with high upside. Solana, Dogecoin, and PENGU are attracting strong attention. Still, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) shows signs of delivering the explosive move that could mean projected gains of more than 15,000% for early buyers. Solana (SOL): Strong Price and Institutional Backing Solana is currently trading around $244. The price action has been supported by huge institutional inflows, with Galaxy Digital recently buying over $1.5 billion worth of SOL. That demand is rare in crypto and shows that serious players are betting big on this network. From a technical view, Solana has moved above its short-term moving averages and is holding well above longer trends. The MACD indicator has turned positive, and momentum is on the buyers' side. Analysts believe this setup could carry SOL much higher as liquidity keeps flowing in. If bullish energy holds, Solana could aim for levels between $400 and $600 in the months ahead, with longer-term projections from some traders reaching as high as $1000 in a strong cycle. This would make SOL one of the top performers of the large-cap coins. Dogecoin (DOGE): Whales Are Buying Dogecoin is trading in the range of $0.26 to $0.28. After dipping slightly, whales stepped in and bought hundreds of millions of DOGE, pushing open interest in derivatives to record highs. This kind of activity suggests large traders are preparing for a bigger move. On the charts, Dogecoin is trading above its key averages, and the RSI remains in bullish territory without being overheated. The MACD has also confirmed a strong upward trend. These are the signals that frequently cause significant price spikes in assets driven by memes. Dogecoin may reach $0.35 in the near future and $0.45 in early 2026 if favorable conditions persist. In the best-case scenario, if social momentum and ETF speculation pick up steam, it might move toward $0.60 to $0.70. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): The Penguins March Higher PENGU is priced around $0.037 with a market cap of over $2.3 billion. Its daily volume remains strong, often in the hundreds of millions, showing that the market has not lost interest. The token has benefited from whale accumulation and a steady flow of community activity linked to the Pudgy Penguins NFT brand. Technicals look constructive, with RSI and MACD pointing up and the token trading over its short-term averages. Analysts have noted the breakout from a longer downtrend and expect the move to gather speed if the market stays bullish. Aggressive projections put PENGU at $0.05 to $0.06 in the short run, $0.08 to $0.10 in the medium horizon, and possibly $0.15 to $0.20 if it catches full-cycle momentum with strong brand adoption. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Real Standout While Solana, Dogecoin, and PENGU are seeing strong bids, Little Pepe has emerged as the dark horse with the most upside potential. The presale is now in stage 13 at $0.0022 per token. Over $25.9 million has already been raised, with more than 15.9 billion tokens sold. Stage 13 is already over 92% sold out. Momentum is undeniable. LILPEPE has completed a Certik audit, added anti-sniper bot protections, and offers zero trading tax. The community is being powered by the $777k giveaway, which has already gathered more than 378,000 entries. The project has also confirmed upcoming centralized exchange listings, which could provide a surge in liquidity and visibility. Because Little Pepe is starting from a zero market cap, analysts believe the upside could reach as much as 15000% if adoption and listings roll out as planned. This combination of meme culture, real infrastructure, and presale momentum explains why many view LILPEPE as the most compelling buy this quarter. Conclusion The crypto market is heating up as Q4 begins, with greed and ambition returning fast. Solana has institutional backing, Dogecoin has whale support, and PENGU has community energy. Yet Little Pepe stands out with its presale strength, unique features, and cultural momentum. With projections of 15000% gains, it may offer the kind of upside that defined earlier bull markets.

The term originated from a simple typo in a December 2013 Bitcoin forum post and has since evolved into a powerful philosophy. HODLing represents the conviction in the future value of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, making it a popular approach for both new and experienced investors. What is the Origin and Meaning of HODL? The term HODL originated from a misspelling of the word “ hold ” in a now-legendary December 18, 2013 , post on the BitcoinTalk forum . A user, frustrated by a significant price crash in Bitcoin , declared his intention to “ I AM HODLING ” rather than selling in a moment of panic. The typo quickly became a meme and a rallying cry for the community, eventually being retroactively adapted into the acronym “ Hold On for Dear Life .” This encapsulates the core principle of a passive, long-term investment strategy that looks past short-term market fluctuations. What Are the Key Benefits of a HODLing Strategy? Adopting a HODL strategy provides several key advantages that make it a compelling choice for many crypto investors, particularly those new to the space. Potential for Capturing Long-Term Gains: Historically, assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have rewarded patient holders with extraordinary returns. For instance, an investor who held Bitcoin from $250 in 2015 to its recent price of $115,000 in 2025 would have seen a return of over 45,000% , demonstrating the power of a long-term mindset. Reduces Emotional Decision-Making: HODLing minimizes the impulse to panic sell during market crashes or to make emotional, fear-driven decisions. By committing to a long-term plan, investors are less likely to fall victim to the market’s “fear and greed” cycle. Lowers Transaction Costs: A buy-and-hold approach significantly reduces the number of trades, which in turn lowers transaction fees, spreads, and other associated costs, thereby improving overall returns. Potential Tax Advantages: In many jurisdictions, long-term capital gains from holding assets for a certain period are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains, providing a potential tax benefit for HODLers . What Are the Major Risks of HODLing Crypto? While HODLing has notable benefits, it is not without its risks. Investors must be aware of the potential downsides to effectively manage their portfolio. Exposure to Prolonged Volatility: A HODL strategy requires weathering significant and often dramatic price drops, which can be mentally challenging. Risk of Project Failure: Not all cryptocurrencies will succeed. Some projects may become obsolete or fail entirely, leaving investors with worthless assets. Opportunity Cost: Funds tied up in a long-term HODL strategy are not available for other short-term trading or investment opportunities. Security Risks: Storing cryptocurrencies for the long term requires robust security measures to protect assets from hackers and theft, particularly if not using a hardware wallet . What are the main differences between HODLing and active trading? HODLing and active trading are fundamentally different investment strategies. HODLing is a passive, long-term approach focused on buying and holding assets for months or years, regardless of short-term volatility. It requires minimal time and emotional involvement. In contrast, active trading involves frequent buying and selling of cryptocurrencies over short periods (minutes, hours, or days) to profit from price fluctuations. This strategy requires a high level of market knowledge, constant monitoring, and is often much more stressful. How can a beginner effectively HODL cryptocurrency? Beginners can effectively HODL by following a few simple but critical steps. First, perform thorough research to select cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and real-world utility, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum . Second, diversify your portfolio by investing in a few different, well-established assets to spread risk. Third, utilize a strategy like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) , where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, which helps mitigate the impact of market volatility. Finally, secure your assets in a hardware wallet to protect them from hacks. Is HODLing a safe strategy for all cryptocurrencies? No, HODLing is not a safe strategy for all cryptocurrencies. While it has proven effective for long-term, foundational assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum with a strong track record, it is a high-risk gamble for less-established altcoins or meme coins. Many of these projects have a high risk of failure or are prone to sudden price crashes. It is critical to conduct diligent research into a project’s team, technology, and community before deciding to HODL . Conclusion The term HODL has evolved from a simple typo to a powerful and widely adopted investment philosophy that is at the heart of the cryptocurrency movement. For those who believe in the long-term potential of digital assets, HODL is more than just a strategy; it is a declaration of conviction against the emotional turmoil of a highly volatile market. By understanding its origins, embracing its benefits, and diligently managing its risks, investors can use this core principle to build a resilient portfolio focused on long-term growth.

Among these, Solana, Dogecoin, and PENGU stand out, while Little Pepe (LILPEPE) emerges as a potential game-changer, hinting at possible gains surpassing 15,000% for early adopters. Overview of Solana's Market Dynamics Solana's trading price is approximately $244, bolstered by substantial institutional investments, such as Galaxy Digital's acquisition of over $1.5 billion in SOL. This influx of serious capital, alongside positive technical indicators like a bullish MACD and solid positions above key moving averages, suggests potential for significant price increases. Projections estimate that Solana could reach between $400 and $600 soon, with the possibility of touching $1000 in a favorable market cycle. Dogecoin: The Favorite of Crypto Whales Currently priced between $0.26 and $0.28, Dogecoin has seen substantial purchases by large investors, propelling its market indicators into bullish territories. The active involvement of these 'whales' can potentially drive up DOGE's price to $0.35 or even towards $0.60 to $0.70, supported by strong chart signals and growing ETF speculations. The Ascension of Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) PENGU's market cap has soared above $2.3 billion, supported by high trading volumes and continuous accumulation by whale investors. Linked closely with the Pudgy Penguins NFT brand, PENGU shows positive technical setups that may soon push its price from the current $0.037 to as high as $0.20, backed by robust community engagement and market sentiment. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A Dark Horse in the Crypto Race Though lesser-known, Little Pepe is quickly gaining momentum in its stage 13 presale, with a token price of $0.0022 and over $25.9 million raised. The token has almost sold out its current stage, supported by a strong infrastructure including a Certik audit and innovative anti-sniper features. With its market foundation strengthening, LILPEPE is positioned for potentially explosive growth, enhanced by upcoming exchange listings and a vibrant community. Concluding Thoughts The return of greed in the crypto market favors bold moves and strategic investments in tokens like Solana, Dogecoin, and PENGU, each backed by unique strengths. Little Pepe, with its ground-breaking potential and cultural appeal, could redefine success metrics in crypto investments.

52233852,588930,1758787205,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52233852.jpeg,Kraken Donates $2M To Pro-Crypto PACs To Support Fight For ‘Core Rights’,https://bitcoinist.com/kraken-donates-2m-pro-crypto-pacs-fight-core-rights/,"Kraken has pledged to donate $2 million to two pro-crypto political action committees (PACs) to continue supporting the fight for the “core rights” of individuals and protect privacy and innovation in the US. Kraken Commits $2M For Crypto Rights Fight On Tuesday, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi announced that the crypto exchange will donate $2 million to two pro-industry political groups to continue to push for innovation and privacy rights in the US. In an X post, Sethi asserted that “the fight for crypto in the United States is far from over,” despite the positive developments and the shift in tone in Washington, from “fear to understanding,” throughout 2025. He highlighted that the US Congress has made progress with digital assets legislation, including the recently enacted GENIUS Acts and the development of a market structure bill by both chambers. Crypto was born as a peaceful revolution to give people the ability to hold value, transact freely, and operate outside systems of arbitrary control. That vision is deeply American. (…) These are not fringe ideals. They are extensions of the Bill of Rights, rendered in code. Nonetheless, Kraken’s co-CEO considers that the fight for “the core rights of individuals in a digital age” continues, and the foundations of open financial systems remain under threat due to regulatory uncertainty, headline-driven enforcement, attempts to criminalize infrastructure, and bans on privacy tools. As a result, the crypto exchange is donating $1 million to the Digital Freedom Fund PAC, which aims to support President Trump’s crypto vision, and increasing its 2025 commitment to America First Digital to $1 million. Sethi noted that the exchange is not backing a political party, but principles, such as the right to self-custody assets and the freedom to opt out of surveillance-based finance. Therefore, the contributions are “strategic investments in the legal and regulatory frameworks that will define crypto’s future in the United States, not just for Kraken, but also for every developer, founder, and user building in this space.” PACs Push For Pro-Industry Candidates Kraken’s contribution follows the recent donation by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, founders of Gemini, to the Digital Freedom Fund PAC. As reported by Bitcoinist, they donated 188.45 Bitcoin, approximately $21 million at the time, to the group. The group is set to support “champions of President Trump’s crypto agenda” and secure their victories in the upcoming primary races and the midterm elections, Tyler Winklevoss explained in August. Similarly, a new US-based group, the Fellowship PAC, was established last week. The group pledged over $100 million to champion candidates who advocate for the digital assets sector, innovation, and transparent regulations. In July, Fairshake, the largest super PAC, unveiled that it had raised $52 million in the first half of 2025 and held more than $141 million in assets for its “aggressive, targeted strategy for next year to ensure that pro-crypto voices are heard in key races across the country.” The super PAC, along with its two affiliate groups Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress, reportedly invested more than $130 million to support nearly 60 pro-industry candidates during the 2024 election race.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto exchange Kraken|crypto market structure bill|Fairshake|gemini|Kraken|Kraken CEO|Political Action Committee|Super PACs|US Congress,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-25 08:00:05

Related Reading: Solana DATs Arrive In Australia: Fitell Corporation Announces $100M SOL Treasury Strategy Institutional Momentum Fuels Avalanche Price On Wednesday, Avalanche continued its recovery from the start-of-week pullback and is currently retesting the $34 area as support. The cryptocurrency recently fell to the $29 level, but quickly bounced toward a seven-month high of $36.1 on Tuesday, fueled by institutional interest in the ecosystem. AgriFORCE Growing Systems recently announced its rebrand to a crypto treasury company under the name AVAX One, marking the first Nasdaq-listed entity focused on Avalanche. The company, supported by Hivemind Capital and SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, aims to raise $550 million to accumulate the cryptocurrency. Notably, the Avalanche Foundation, the nonprofit behind the project, also revealed it was seeking to raise $1 billion to establish two US-based crypto treasury vehicles. Last week, South Korean crypto custodian BDACS launched KRW1, the country’s first Korean won–pegged stablecoin, on Avalanche. Previously, Ava Labs secured a strategic partnership with Toyota Blockchain Lab to build a blockchain-based system, the Mobility Open Network (MON), designed to pave the road for new emerging use cases such as robotaxi fleets. AVAX Monthly Close Holds Rally’s Key Analyst Rekt Capital noted that the cryptocurrency has had a strong three-month rally within its Macro Wedge pattern but also cautioned that there’s “further work to be done” for a bullish trend continuation. The cryptocurrency has seen a 43% increase in the monthly timeframe, turning the $30 level into support two weeks ago. Since then, the AVAX price has attempted to reclaim the $35 resistance twice, but failed to sustain the breakout. Avalanche has been trading inside a Macro wedge pattern since the start of 2024, with the price steadily hovering between the formation’s upper and lower boundaries. The recent rally has sent the price toward the pattern’s resistance zone, with the breakout level sitting around the $38.40 mark. According to the analysis, AVAX’s next crucial step is to close September above the Macro Downtrend and have a post-breakout retest of this level as support. A monthly close above this area would “open the path toward repeating bullish history similar to mid-2021 and early 2024.” Related Reading: Analyst Says Ethereum Bounce Is Imminent As BitMine Continues To Accumulate Failing to secure a monthly close above the $38.40 area could see Avalanche up for a retest of the $29-$30 support, further risking a drop toward the monthly opening of $23.6. To target the Macro Wedge resistance, the cryptocurrency still must reclaim the $35-$36 zone, where the next major sell wall is located. Despite the warning, the analyst detailed that a retest of the support region could “extend base-building further into Q4, ultimately enabling a more sustainable breakout attempt later.” As of this writing, AVAX is trading at $33.75, a 1% decline in the daily timeframe.

In his post, he stated that Trump’s Gold Reserve is eyeing XRP as the platform to tokenize gold. Xaif emphasized that physical gold could be brought onto the blockchain through the XRP Ledger, combining the stability of gold with blockchain speed and settlement efficiency. He framed this as not just an example of adoption but the beginning of what he described as a new financial era. Big Moves Incoming! Trump’s Gold Reserve eyeing XRP to tokenize gold Physical gold meets blockchain speed real-world value flowing through the XRPL! This isn’t just adoption… it’s a new financial era. pic.twitter.com/ubpkHEHlkW — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) September 22, 2025 Insights from the Paul Barron Podcast Xaif’s post included a clip from the Paul Barron podcast where host Paul Barron and author Kurt Wuckert Jr. discussed the concept of tokenizing gold to address U.S. debt challenges. Wuckert explained that the United States is actively exploring ideas around tokenized real-world assets as a potential mechanism for shifting away from its $35 trillion in U.S.-denominated debt. He suggested that making gold into money again through tokenization could be as straightforward as issuing a central bank digital currency. Barron responded by referencing existing examples such as PAX Gold and XAUT, both of which represent tokenized versions of gold already in circulation. However, Wuckert highlighted the limitations of these models, particularly concerning trust structures, and suggested that the involvement of longstanding institutions such as Lloyds, Brinks, or Stonex could give credibility to tokenized gold initiatives. He argued that centuries-old firms with a strong reputation in asset protection could deliver consistent audits and attestations to guarantee the legitimacy of tokenized gold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Effect on Tokenization and Utility In the discussion, Wuckert elaborated on the advantages of tokenizing gold. He pointed out that tokenization allows gold to be broken down into fractions as small as needed, enabling microtransactions. According to him, this feature could diminish the role of silver as a monetary alternative, since small units of gold would become practical for everyday transactions. Barron added that silver would still hold utility within industries such as defense and technology. However, he acknowledged that its relevance as a monetary system could decline if tokenized gold gained traction. Furthermore, there was discussion on how tokenized assets might reshape existing markets and challenge conventional financial systems. Wuckert noted that the ability to tokenize and fractionalize gold makes it possible to build a transparent and auditable monetary system. Barron concluded by stating that these ideas represent a significant threshold moment in global finance. Connection to XRP Ledger Xaif’s reference to XRP in connection with Trump’s Gold Reserve ties this broader conversation about tokenized gold directly to the XRP Ledger. He argued that the XRPL’s transaction speed and scalability position it as a strong candidate for hosting tokenized gold. By combining the real-world value of physical gold with blockchain infrastructure, he suggested that the XRPL could enable global liquidity and financial interoperability on a new scale. Xaif’s comments align with a growing narrative around the role of tokenization in addressing large-scale financial challenges. If such initiatives were to be formally pursued, the integration of tokenized gold on XRP Ledger could represent one of the most notable uses of blockchain in sovereign and institutional finance to date.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/australia-prepares-to-include-crypto-companies-in-its-financial-services-framework-here-are-the-details/,"The Australian Treasury Department has presented a new draft law that aims to include crypto companies in the country within the existing financial services framework. Australia Prepares to Include Crypto Firms in Financial Services Framework Under the bill, crypto firms would be required to obtain a financial services license, making them subject to oversight by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Under the new regulation, digital asset platforms (DAP) and tokenized custody platforms (TCP) will be considered in the same category as other financial intermediaries. These companies will undergo licensing processes and be required to comply with investor protection regulations, ensuring that the crypto industry is held to the same legal standards as traditional financial institutions. Deputy Treasurer Daniel Mulino announced the bill today. “The final legislation will create a new framework for digital asset companies in Australia. We will do this by expanding existing financial services laws in a targeted manner,” Mulino said in a statement. The draft text has been opened to public comment. Interested parties can submit their comments and suggestions to the ministry until October 24, 2025. Experts say this move could make crypto assets more transparent and secure within the regulatory framework. It's also seen as a significant step toward investor protection. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Australia Prepares to Include Crypto Companies in Its Financial Services Framework!

The decision was confirmed by Xu Fei, vice president at the Beijing-based company, during a televised CNBC interview that aired Thursday. She revealed that executives had completed field research in June, visiting various European cities to study potential sales locations and build a local distribution strategy. “We had our field research here in June,” Xu said. “A couple executives [are] leading the field research so that we are preparing for the sales network, for the partnerships. The whole organization is getting started.” The expansion will place Xiaomi in direct competition with other Chinese EV firms like Xpeng and Guangzhou Automobile Group, both of which are already rolling out their cars in the region. The company confirmed it will not be designing an entirely new vehicle for Europe, meaning the cars sold there will likely be modified versions of existing models. Xu didn’t name which car will be sold first, but Xiaomi’s SU7 sedan and YU7 SUV are the company’s two flagship vehicles. They both launched last year, marking Xiaomi’s first foray into the auto space. Since then, more than 300,000 units have been delivered, pushing Xiaomi’s shares up by over 170% in 12 months. Xiaomi moves carefully as rivals rush into the European market Even as competitors scramble to grow fast, Xiaomi is moving differently. Xu made it clear the company is taking its time. “We need full time to do all these kinds of preparations to make sure the car is solid enough for those people here in the Europe market … because … we need to set a very high standard,” she said . The European rollout comes as the EU keeps tariffs in place on China-made EV imports, pushing many companies to rethink how they expand. While some automakers are choosing to build production sites in Europe now, Xiaomi isn’t jumping in yet. Xu was blunt about that. “Theoretically, in [the] future, I think we definitely will do that,” she said, when asked if the company planned to open a European production plant. “The logic is very simple. We want to be one of the top five players in the world in 15 to 20 years. If you want to do that, you definitely have to have your own factory here, right?” The goal is global dominance, but with a slower launch pace. Still, Xiaomi’s name is now on the list of China’s biggest EV exporters trying to break into Europe. That list includes Guangzhou Automobile Group, which is planning to increase its EV sales across Europe 17 times over the next two years, and is also exploring local manufacturing options. Xu said Xiaomi’s showrooms in Europe will resemble those in China, and they won’t just be for test drives. “Users need to experience the car, not just for test drive … they also need to understand the ecosystem,” she said. That “ ecosystem ” includes everything Xiaomi already sells, from smartphones to home appliances, all tied into the car’s software. Company bets on ecosystem integration to drive user loyalty The idea is to have European customers walk into a Xiaomi showroom, try out the car, and also experience how it connects with everything else in their lives; their phones, their homes, and even their TVs. It’s a strategy they’ve used in China, and they’re betting it will land in Europe too. Xu didn’t promise a rollout model or pricing, but she made one thing clear: Xiaomi isn’t coming in half-prepared. “When we get into the market, we are very dedicated. And it’s not just some random Chinese product we have coming here in the Europe market. It’s a product, with the best user experience for the European users.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Tech|BYD|Tesla|Xiaomi|XPeng,EN,0,0,MARKET|ASIA|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-25 08:03:46

This individual, who had held approximately 80,202 BTC for 14 years , executed the sale, which has been associated with the passage of new digital asset legislation. This monumental transaction serves as a powerful testament to the HODL philosophy and has sparked a debate about its potential impact on Bitcoin’s price, even as the market shows signs of remarkable resilience. What Are the Key Details of the $9.5 Billion Bitcoin Whale Sale? This historic sale involved the liquidation of a substantial, long-dormant Bitcoin wallet. The key details provide a clear picture of the scale and profitability of the transaction. Acquisition Value: The Bitcoin was reportedly acquired in 2011 for a total of approximately $132,000 . Extraordinary Returns: This sale represents an incredible return on investment, exemplifying the core tenet of the HODL strategy—holding assets for the long term despite market volatility. Transaction Facilitator: The sale was reportedly facilitated by Galaxy Digital , a major player in the institutional crypto space. The use of an over-the-counter (OTC) desk, rather than a public exchange, likely helped mitigate any immediate and drastic price impact from such a large sell-off. Related Legislation: The sale occurred amid the passing of three major U.S. cryptocurrency bills, including the GENIUS Act , which provides a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. How Did the Crypto Market Respond to the Whale’s Selloff? Despite the immense size of the Bitcoin whale sale, the market’s response has been a mix of initial concern and notable stability. This event highlights the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Initial Concern: Some industry experts initially expressed concern about a potential Bitcoin correction , fearing that such a large sale would trigger a market crash. Signs of Maturity and Resilience: In a sign of the market’s growing resilience, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable, with its price consolidating around $112,000 . This suggests that the current market has enough institutional adoption and liquidity to absorb even a $9.5 billion sell-off without a major collapse. Comparison to Other Whales: This whale’s activity is not isolated. Other dormant Bitcoin whales have also become active during recent bullish market phases, including a miner who recently sold 50 BTC for a profit of over $3 million . These movements often trigger speculation but are increasingly being seen as a sign of a healthy, monetizing market. What is a “Bitcoin whale” and why are they so important? A “ Bitcoin whale ” is a term used to describe an individual or entity that holds a massive amount of Bitcoin , often enough to influence market prices through their trades. They are significant because their large-scale buying or selling can create a supply shock, causing a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency market. When a whale sells off a substantial portion of their holdings, it can temporarily increase selling pressure, but as seen in this $9.5 billion sale, a maturing market can absorb such actions without a catastrophic crash. How does the GENIUS Act relate to this crypto sale? The GENIUS Act is a landmark piece of U.S. legislation designed to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. While not directly related to the Bitcoin whale’s sale, the timing suggests a correlation between growing regulatory clarity and the willingness of large, long-term investors to liquidate their holdings. The new legislation provides a clearer path for digital assets to be integrated into traditional financial systems, which may have given the seller the confidence to move such a large amount of capital into regulated financial channels. What does the $9.5 billion sale say about the “HODL” strategy? The $9.5 billion sale is arguably one of the greatest real-world examples of the HODL strategy’s potential. The individual who acquired the 80,202 BTC for just $132,000 and held it for 14 years was rewarded with an extraordinary return. This event reinforces the core belief that long-term conviction and patience in a volatile market can lead to life-changing gains, proving that the HODL philosophy can be an incredibly effective strategy for early investors. Conclusion The $9.5 billion Bitcoin whale sale stands as a landmark event in cryptocurrency history, perfectly encapsulating the immense profitability of long-term holding while also testing the market’s newfound maturity. While a transaction of this size would have likely caused a catastrophic crash in a less-developed market, the recent stability of Bitcoin’s price demonstrates the growing institutional liquidity and resilience of the ecosystem. This event confirms that while individual whales can still make waves, the cryptocurrency ocean is now deep enough to absorb their movements without being overwhelmed, signaling a new era of stability and institutional adoption.

The community is listening intently, as XRP has been positioned for years as a blockchain platform with the potential to change the dynamics of payments globally. While traditional platforms remain in control, XRP is growing at light speed and reducing costs, which are drivers of adoption. Besides this, newer entrants like Remittix (RTX) are also emerging in the same payments arena, increasing competition in the space. XRP Market Performance and Price Prognosis XRP is one of the best-known cryptocurrencies for border crossings. Its current selling price stands at $2.89, marking a 0.59% increase in a day. With a market capitalization of $172.31 billion, XRP continues to rank among the top digital assets. Trading volume, on the other hand, has fallen to $5.22 billion, indicating a 20.74% drop in a day. Ripple Price Prediction, XRP narrative often relies on institutional partnerships, and speculation has been fueled by speculation about BlackRock involvement. Major investors are of the general view that heavy-hitting financial backing could add muscle to Ripple’s standing in decentralized finance as well as international remittances. Meanwhile, new altcoin competition is forcing XRP to catch up with innovation and adoption. Remittix’s Accelerating Growth While XRP takes center stage, Remittix (RTX) goes under the radar to emerge as one of the hottest potential crypto projects. Traded at $0.1130 per token , RTX has run over $26.4 million in presale and disposed of more than 669.6 million tokens. Being a low gas fee crypto project with utility in real-world payments, Remittix is attracting early-stage crypto investment by users seeking the next 100x crypto. RTX has also made future listings on LBank and BitMart, which are big centralized exchanges. Those were made following the project’s $20M and $22M milestones. Apart from exchange announcements, Remittix is beta-testing its wallet and has introduced a referral program that pays out users 15% in USDT. The project even started a $250,000 Remittix Giveaway as appreciation to its community for expanding. CertiK Verification and Industry Validation Another powerful driver of RTX’s exposure is its validation on CertiK Skynet. The project is complete certified by CertiK and currently #1 for pre-launch tokens on the platform. Such third-party affirmation lends security and clarity, two of the most critical aspects investors seek in high-rated crypto presale 2025 projects. Why Remittix Is Getting Noticed: $26.4Million+ presale raised with strong demand #1 ranked on CertiK for pre-launch tokens Future listings confirmed on BitMart and LBank Real-world payments hub with low gas costs Ripple Price Prediction is imperative for holders, especially with BlackRock-related news scheduled. But with Remittix growing, it illustrates how the crypto community is changing. With presale momentum, security established, and future listings, RTX is being ranked as one of the top crypto under $1 and a new altcoin to keep an eye on in 2025.

Remittix is catching buyers attention by blending real payments with rewards, while the Ethereum price story and Bitcoin headlines keep big money engaged. If you want the next 20x, watch how Ethereum price reacts at support, how Bitcoin handles demand, and how Remittix turns PayFi into growth you can actually use. Ethereum price: Holding support for the next break Source: Lingrid The Ethereum price pulled back into the $4,100 – $4,200 support zone after a swift rejection at resistance. The chart shows triangle-style compression and steady accumulation. If the Ethereum price holds this base, momentum can build toward $4,950 and beyond. Lose the level and the Ethereum price risks a deeper dip before buyers try again. On fundamentals, a rising stablecoin supply and stronger ETFs on the NYSE help boost liquidity. As frameworks improve, the Ethereum price often reacts with higher volume on breakouts. For now, bulls want clean closes above local highs. Bitcoin: Demand, policy, and big wallet moves Source: Investopedia Bitcoin bounced hard from the $111,400 to $111,800 support area with strong volume. Holding above this zone favors a push to $113,000 to $117,000. A close below support could point Bitcoin toward $107,000. With institutions adding reserve exposure, Bitcoin keeps acting like a macro asset. Policy headlines matter too. If 401(k) plans start allowing Bitcoin, we could see steady long-term money flow into the market. But seeing 30,000 Bitcoin sent to exchanges is a warning that near-term swings may rise. Big investors often buy when others are scared, yet most traders still keep an eye on funding rates, ETF inflows, and on-chain liquidity before making their next move. Remittix (RTX): PayFi growth with real rewards Remittix stands out for investors who want utility as well as incentives. The project has raised over $26.4 million from more than 669 million tokens at $0.1130. CEX listings are announced on Bitmart and LBank . The wallet beta is live, the team is CertiK-verified , and Remittix ranks #1 on CertiK Skynet for Pre-Launch Tokens. That mix keeps RTX on investors’ watchlists. Why investors are choosing RTX Built for cross-border payments with faster settlement and lower fees 15% USDT referral rewards, claimable daily in the dashboard CEX routes to deepen liquidity and price discovery Wallet beta live, letting users test PayFi features now Strong security backing and visibility through CertiK and rankings With real utility, rewards, and growing liquidity, Remittix fits investor demand for cryptos with real use, staking-style yields, and clear adoption. It also pairs well with Bitcoin, and the Ethereum price trades in a balanced basket. How to position for 20x If support holds, the Ethereum price can set up a strong breakout as stablecoin and ETF flows grow. Bitcoin keeps its uptrend while institutions accumulate on dips. Remittix adds a practical PayFi angle with daily USDT rewards and live product traction. For many portfolios, combining Bitcoin, the Ethereum price trend, and Remittix creates a smart mix of scale, tech, and utility that can ride the next 20x wave.

You’re not alone. While many anticipate a crypto bull run, an in-depth analysis by XWIN Research Japan, a respected contributor to CryptoQuant, points to a clear explanation for the current crypto market lag . They’ve identified four crucial factors that are holding digital assets back from matching the impressive gains seen elsewhere. Why is the Crypto Market Lagging Behind Gold and Stocks? The recent market dynamics show a distinct preference for traditional safe-haven assets. As central banks consider interest rate adjustments, institutional capital often seeks stability. This initial phase of rate cuts sees significant funds flowing into highly liquid assets like established stocks and gold. The analyst explains that investor risk appetite needs to increase substantially before we see a widespread shift of funds into more volatile assets, including altcoins. This cautious approach directly contributes to the noticeable crypto market lag . It’s a classic case of “safety first.” Large institutional players prioritize capital preservation during uncertain economic periods. Only once the broader economic outlook stabilizes and confidence grows will these larger capital pools likely venture into higher-risk, higher-reward territories like the altcoin market. Is Stablecoin Liquidity a Misleading Metric for Crypto Market Lag? At first glance, the stablecoin market looks robust. The total stablecoin supply recently hit an all-time high of $308 billion this month, suggesting plenty of capital is waiting on the sidelines. However, a deeper dive reveals a different story. Stablecoin balances held on exchanges have actually continued to decrease. Total Supply vs. Exchange Balances: While the overall supply is high, fewer stablecoins are sitting on trading platforms ready for immediate deployment into crypto assets. Investor Sentiment: This decrease in exchange balances reflects a broader risk-averse sentiment among investors. People are holding stablecoins, but they are not actively using them to buy into the market, contributing significantly to the crypto market lag . Implication: This indicates that despite the available liquidity, the willingness to engage in speculative buying is currently low. This dynamic creates a scenario where potential buying power exists, but it’s not being utilized, further dampening upward price momentum in the crypto space. The Double-Edged Sword of Expanding Leverage in Derivatives Another significant factor highlighted by XWIN Research Japan is the expanding leverage in the derivatives market. While derivatives can offer opportunities for traders, high leverage can also amplify market volatility and risk. When leverage expands without a corresponding increase in underlying spot market demand, it can create a fragile market structure. This means that large, leveraged positions can be quickly liquidated during price swings, leading to cascading effects that can push prices down further. This inherent instability makes investors more cautious, and it can deter new capital from entering, thereby perpetuating the crypto market lag . Traders using high leverage are betting on significant price movements. However, if the market remains sideways or experiences unexpected dips, these leveraged positions become vulnerable, creating a cycle of fear and uncertainty. Post-Halving Hype: What Happened to the Bitcoin Boost? The Bitcoin halving event is historically a major catalyst for the crypto market, often preceding significant bull runs. However, the conclusion of the recent halving cycle has not yet delivered the expected immediate price surge. The analyst suggests that much of the “buy the rumor” activity had already occurred, leading to a “sell the news” effect post-halving. This means that speculative interest might have peaked before the event itself, leading to a temporary lull afterward. Investors might be waiting for clearer signs of sustained demand and institutional adoption before committing more capital. This post-halving cool-down period also plays a role in the broader crypto market lag we are observing. The halving’s long-term effects on supply scarcity remain, but short-term market sentiment often dictates immediate price action. Navigating the Current Crypto Landscape Understanding these four factors—the preference for safe havens, stablecoin liquidity dynamics, expanding derivatives leverage, and the post-halving market sentiment—provides a clearer picture of why the crypto market is currently lagging. It’s not a sign of fundamental weakness in the long term, but rather a reflection of current investor psychology and broader economic conditions. For investors, this period might represent an opportunity for careful consideration and strategic planning, rather than impulsive decisions. As the global economic landscape evolves, and risk appetite eventually returns, we could see capital begin to flow back into the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is the crypto market lagging behind traditional assets like gold and stocks? The crypto market is currently lagging due to a preference for safe-haven assets during U.S. interest rate cut discussions, a lack of stablecoin liquidity on exchanges, expanding leverage in the derivatives market, and the conclusion of the Bitcoin halving cycle which led to a ‘sell the news’ event. Q2: What role do stablecoins play in the current market sentiment and crypto market lag? While the total stablecoin supply is at an all-time high, balances on exchanges are decreasing. This indicates that investors are holding stablecoins but are not actively deploying them into crypto assets, reflecting a risk-averse sentiment and contributing to the lag. Q3: How does the Bitcoin halving impact the broader crypto market’s performance? The recent Bitcoin halving’s impact has been a ‘sell the news’ event, meaning much of the speculative buying occurred before the halving. This has led to a temporary decrease in speculative interest post-event, contributing to the overall cautious sentiment in the market. Q4: When might altcoins see significant capital inflow and overcome the crypto market lag? According to analysts, altcoins are expected to see significant capital inflow only when investor risk appetite increases. This typically happens after the initial phase of rate cuts, once institutional capital has established positions in highly liquid assets like stocks and gold, and broader market confidence improves. Q5: What is “expanding leverage” in the derivatives market, and why is it a concern? Expanding leverage in the derivatives market means traders are using more borrowed funds to amplify their positions. While it can increase potential gains, it also significantly amplifies risks. High leverage can lead to rapid liquidations during market volatility, creating instability and deterring new capital, thus contributing to the cautious sentiment and crypto market lag .

Recently, the Riksbank delivered just such a shock, slashing its key interest rate to 1.75%. This decisive action has sent analysts scrambling to revise their outlooks, with UBS being among the first to adjust its EURSEK forecast downwards, signaling potential further weakness for the Swedish Krona. For anyone tracking global economic shifts or managing a portfolio, understanding the implications of this bold monetary policy decision is crucial. Riksbank’s Bold Move: What Triggered the Surprise Rate Cut? The Riksbank’s decision to cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 1.75% caught many by surprise, diverging from the expectations of several major financial institutions. This move marks a significant shift in monetary policy, particularly as other central banks globally are still grappling with persistent inflation or maintaining a cautious stance. So, what prompted Sweden’s central bank to take such a decisive step? Slowing Inflation: While inflation has been a global concern, Sweden has seen a more rapid deceleration in its inflation rate compared to many other developed economies. The Riksbank likely views the current trajectory as sustainable towards its 2% target, providing room for easing. Weak Economic Growth: Concerns about domestic economic stagnation have been growing. A rate cut aims to stimulate borrowing and investment, thereby boosting economic activity and averting a deeper recession. Strengthening Swedish Krona (Initially): Prior to the cut, there might have been concerns that a relatively strong Krona, driven by previous hawkish signals, could hinder export competitiveness and further depress inflation. A rate cut can help to rebalance this. Divergent Policy Path: The Riksbank might be signaling its independence and willingness to chart its own course, prioritizing domestic economic stability over syncing with the broader European or global central bank narrative. This Riksbank rate cut is a clear indication of the central bank’s assessment of the current economic landscape, prioritizing growth and inflation targeting in a unique way. UBS’s Revised EURSEK Forecast: A Deeper Dive into the Numbers Following the Riksbank’s unexpected rate reduction, UBS, a prominent global financial services firm, quickly recalibrated its projections for the EURSEK forecast . The core of their revised outlook points to a weaker Swedish Krona against the Euro, reflecting the immediate impact of lower interest rates. Previously, UBS might have held a more neutral or even slightly stronger view on the SEK, anticipating a different Riksbank trajectory. However, the 1.75% rate cut necessitates a significant adjustment. Here’s a simplified look at what such a revision implies: UBS EURSEK Forecast Revisions (Illustrative) Period Previous Forecast (EUR/SEK) Revised Forecast (EUR/SEK) Implication for SEK 3 Months 11.30 11.55 Weaker 6 Months 11.20 11.60 Weaker 12 Months 11.10 11.50 Weaker These figures, while illustrative, demonstrate the direction of UBS’s adjustment: a higher EUR/SEK value means it takes more Swedish Krona to buy one Euro, indicating a weaker SEK. The rationale behind this revision is straightforward: lower interest rates make a currency less attractive to yield-seeking investors, leading to capital outflows and depreciation. Furthermore, the rate cut could signal a prolonged period of accommodative policy, reinforcing the negative sentiment towards the Swedish Krona . The Swedish Krona’s Vulnerability: Why It’s Feeling the Pressure The Swedish Krona has faced a challenging period, and the recent Riksbank rate cut has only intensified the spotlight on its vulnerabilities. Several factors contribute to the Krona’s current predicament, making it susceptible to further depreciation against major currencies like the Euro and the US Dollar. Interest Rate Differential: The most immediate impact comes from the interest rate differential. When the Riksbank cuts rates while other major central banks (like the ECB or Fed) maintain or even hike theirs, the yield advantage for holding SEK diminishes. This encourages investors to shift capital to currencies offering higher returns. Economic Outlook: Sweden’s economy, heavily reliant on exports, is sensitive to global economic health. If the domestic outlook remains subdued, and global demand falters, the Krona will likely struggle. The rate cut itself is an acknowledgment of these domestic challenges. Geopolitical Risks: As a smaller, open economy, Sweden is also sensitive to broader geopolitical tensions and shifts in global risk sentiment. During times of uncertainty, investors often flock to “safe haven” currencies, and the SEK typically does not fall into this category. Housing Market Concerns: Sweden’s housing market has shown signs of stress, with high household debt levels. While the rate cut might offer some relief, persistent concerns could weigh on overall economic confidence and, by extension, the currency. Understanding these underlying pressures is key for anyone observing the dynamics of the Forex market impact from this policy shift. Navigating the Forex Market Impact: Strategies for Traders The Riksbank’s unexpected Riksbank rate cut has undoubtedly created significant ripples across the Forex market impact , particularly for pairs involving the Swedish Krona. For traders and investors, this presents both challenges and potential opportunities. Understanding how to navigate this volatile environment is crucial. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Surprise rate cuts typically lead to sharp movements, increasing the risk for short-term traders. Uncertainty: The Riksbank’s divergence from other central banks adds a layer of uncertainty regarding future policy moves and their alignment with global trends. Shifting Fundamentals: Traders need to quickly re-evaluate their fundamental analysis for SEK-denominated assets and currency pairs. Actionable Insights and Opportunities: Re-evaluate SEK Exposure: For those with existing SEK positions, it’s vital to assess the implications of a weaker Krona. Consider hedging strategies or adjusting portfolio allocations if the risk profile has changed. Focus on Relative Value: Look for opportunities in currency pairs where the interest rate differential has widened in favor of the non-SEK currency. EUR/SEK and USD/SEK are prime candidates for continued upward momentum if the Riksbank maintains its dovish stance. Monitor Economic Data: Keep a close eye on Swedish inflation figures, GDP growth, and employment data. Any signs of further economic weakness or persistent low inflation could prompt additional easing from the Riksbank, reinforcing the Krona’s depreciation. Consider Carry Trades: While riskier, a weakening SEK due to lower rates could make it a funding currency for carry trades, where investors borrow in a low-interest currency and invest in a high-interest one. However, this strategy carries significant exchange rate risk. Risk Management is Key: Given the increased volatility, robust risk management practices, including appropriate stop-loss orders and position sizing, are more critical than ever. The current environment demands vigilance and adaptability from all participants in the foreign exchange markets. Central Bank Policy Shifts: A Global Trend? The Riksbank’s surprise central bank policy shift raises a pertinent question: Is this an isolated incident, or does it signal a broader trend among global central banks? While each central bank operates within its unique economic context, there are certainly overarching themes that influence their decisions. The Riksbank’s move to cut rates while some major central banks are still contemplating their next steps highlights a growing divergence in monetary policy. This divergence is driven by: Varying Inflationary Pressures: Different economies are experiencing inflation at different rates and with different underlying causes. This necessitates tailored responses. Diverse Economic Growth Trajectories: Some nations might be facing imminent recessionary pressures, while others show resilience. Central banks react accordingly to support their domestic economies. Debt Levels and Fiscal Space: High government and household debt levels in some countries might limit the central bank’s room for aggressive tightening, or conversely, necessitate easing to prevent defaults. Political and Social Pressures: Central banks, though independent, are not entirely immune to political and social pressures to support economic growth or alleviate cost-of-living crises. The Riksbank’s action could potentially embolden other central banks facing similar economic headwinds to consider easing their own policies, especially if inflation is perceived to be under control. However, the path forward remains highly uncertain, making the study of central bank policy crucial for understanding global currency movements. The Riksbank’s unexpected rate cut to 1.75% has undeniably reshaped the landscape for the Swedish Krona and the broader forex market. UBS’s subsequent downward revision of its EURSEK forecast underscores the immediate impact of this bold monetary policy decision. As the Swedish Krona grapples with increased vulnerability due to interest rate differentials and domestic economic concerns, traders and investors must remain agile. The move also highlights a potential divergence in global central bank policy , urging market participants to closely monitor economic indicators and adapt their strategies accordingly. In a world of evolving monetary dynamics, staying informed is the best defense against market surprises.

The round included contributions from existing investors Galaxy Ventures and Vertex Ventures, the company said in a Thursday email. RedotPay aims to blend blockchain speed and efficiency with traditional payment networks. Founded in 2023, the company has more than 5 million users across over 100 markets and processes an annualized $10 billion through stablecoin-powered cards, multicurrency wallets and global payout services. The new money will accelerate growth, compliance and integration with the broader blockchain ecosystem, CEO Michael Gao said in the emailed announcement. RedotPay’s Global Payout feature allows users to send stablecoins directly to local bank accounts or e-wallets, an offering that has seen strong adoption in emerging markets like Latin America, the company said.

Speaking Thursday in response to an X thread by Dragon XYZ’s head of data, Hildebert Moulié, Buterin explained that the technology will help nodes verify data without requiring them to download the entire blockchain. “The way PeerDAS works is that each node only asks for a small number of chunks, as a way of probabilistically verifying that more than 50% of chunks are available,” Buterin wrote on X. “If more than 50% of chunks are available, then the node theoretically can download those chunks, and use erasure coding to recover the rest.” The programmer reiterated that this would allow a live blockchain on Ether to operate without any single node having to store full datasets. Ethereum network reaches blobs per block record Late Wednesday, Moulié noted that Ethereum had reached its target of six blobs per block for the first time in history. Blobs, or Binary Large Objects, were introduced to Ethereum through the Dencun upgrade in March 2024 under EIP-4844 , also known as proto-danksharding. According to Moulié, blob usage during the spike was largely driven by activity across several L2 rollups. Base accounted for 42% of blob activity, followed by World with 25%, while other contributors included Arbitrum at 8%, OP Mainnet at 4%, and Soneium and Scroll at 3% each. 5/ current used blobspace % 42% Base 25% World 8% Arbitrum 4% OP Mainnet 3% Soneium 3% Scroll 2% Unichain 2% Shape 2% Lighter 1% Ink pic.twitter.com/J6EWWp0VF7 — hildobby (@hildobby) September 24, 2025 Blobs were developed to reduce transaction costs for Layer-2 networks by providing dedicated storage for compressed data. They may have proven effective before, but per Moulié, forecasting blob usage is difficult due to “inconsistent posting by different chains.” The Dragon XYZ head of data also mentioned the current requirements for validator storage exceed 70 gigabytes of space for uncompressed blobs, with estimates topping 1,200 gigabytes for unpruned data. Each blob carries compressed information, but compression ratios vary by chain and rarely surpass 25%. “Each stack has its own compression algo, but generally the more diverse the chain’s usage is, the harder it is to reach higher compression ratios,” he remarked. According to Moulié, more than 10% of blobs are not fully utilized, originating from smaller rollups that post data regularly before blobs reach their 128-kilobyte limit. He also said around 30% of blocks containing blobs have been affected by miner extractable value (MEV) issues. Fusaka will allow different nodes to perform tasks for different blocks EF co-founder Buterin addressed some of the L2 scalability problems, saying that in the initial PeerDAS launch, there will still be cases requiring full data storage. “In the first version, there are two cases where the full data of a block still needs to exist in one place: initial broadcasting, and reconstruction in case a publisher only provides between 50% and 100% of a block,” he surmised. He clarified that the protocol requires only a single honest actor to uphold its integrity, even if several others attempt to act dishonestly. “We only need one honest actor to do them; if there are also 100 dishonest actors, the protocol simply bypasses them. And different nodes can perform this task for different blocks,” Buterin noted. Fusaka upgrade timeline slated for December As reported by Cryptopolitan, the Fusaka upgrade , scheduled for December 3, will formally introduce EIP-7594 and double blob capacity from the current target and maximum of six and nine blobs per block. Ether developers are planning a phased approach like the previous upgrades, with two Blob Parameter Only forks to gradually increase capacity. The maximum blob count will be increased from nine to fifteen in the first fork, then from sixteen to twenty-one in the second, according to Ethereum researcher Christine Kim. The second fork is scheduled for January. Although PeerDAS and related methods have been developed for a long time, Buterin warned developers that they are still untested.

Key Takeaways: Circle is considering reversible USDC transactions to address fraud and align more closely with traditional finance. Its new blockchain, Arc, targets institutional use but faces criticism for being overly centralized. As stablecoins gain political support, Circle is repositioning USDC for broader adoption and regulatory acceptance. Speaking to the Financial Times , Circle President Heath Tarbert said the company is weighing how to add refund capabilities to USDC payments in cases of fraud or disputes, without compromising the finality of settlement that blockchain systems are built on. “There’s an inherent tension between being able to transfer something immediately, but having it be irrevocable,” Tarbert noted. Circle Rethinks Strategy as It Targets Institutional Stablecoin Adoption The comments reflect a broader rethink within Circle as it courts financial institutions and prepares for wider stablecoin adoption in the mainstream. The company recently began testing Arc, a new blockchain designed for institutional use, where banks, asset managers, and corporates could settle transactions such as FX payments using stablecoins. However, Arc has drawn criticism for being too centralized, potentially clashing with the founding ethos of decentralization. While Circle said Arc will not support direct transaction reversals, it could introduce a “counter-payment” layer, similar to how credit card refunds work. The design would let parties agree to reverse a transaction off-chain in a compliant, transparent process, potentially making blockchain-based payments more acceptable to large institutions wary of irreversible errors or scams. Community Insight: Stablecoin Valuations Under Spotlight Tether eyes a raise at a $500B valuation, while Circle trades at just ~$30B. Is Circle underestimated — or is Tether rewriting stablecoin dominance? How would stablecoin issuers' revenue survive after rate-cut? High… pic.twitter.com/VRpdDYh754 — SoSoValue (@SoSoValueCrypto) September 24, 2025 The push for reversible payments also reflects Circle’s effort to close the gap between crypto and traditional financial systems, even as some in the industry see the move as a betrayal of blockchain’s core principles. A venture capitalist called the concept “offensive,” questioning whether such a system still qualifies as blockchain at all. Meanwhile, stablecoins are gaining traction in Washington. A landmark federal bill regulating the sector passed in July, and the Trump administration has voiced strong support, viewing stablecoins as a tool to extend the reach of the US dollar in global markets. Tarbert echoed that vision but dismissed fears that stablecoins would pull deposits away from banks, suggesting the money may instead come from other assets or new capital inflows. Goldman Sachs projects a $77 billion expansion of USDC by 2027, and Circle is adjusting its products accordingly. Trump-Backed GENIUS Act Boosts US Push for Dollar-Pegged Stablecoins The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , signed by President Trump, aims to cement the dollar’s dominance by backing dollar-pegged stablecoins in global markets. The Treasury Department expects the stablecoin market to exceed $2 trillion by 2028, a projection that places greater emphasis on liquidity, interoperability, and regulatory alignment across the ecosystem. Tether’s latest move underscores a pragmatic shift toward that future. As reported, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the stablecoin sector is poised for explosive growth, projecting the market could balloon from its current $250 billion capitalization to as much as $2 trillion in the near future. “Many people think it will reach $1 to $2 trillion in a handful of years,” Garlinghouse said, adding that Ripple is positioned to benefit from that trajectory. Meanwhile, Western Union is positioning itself for a new phase of digital transformation, signaling strong interest in using stablecoins to modernize its global remittance operations.

While many have called this out as only a temporary stop, expecting the Bitcoin price to continue its ascent once the decline is over, crypto analyst EXCAVO has taken a more bearish outlook. According to the analyst, the current market trend actually points to the end of the bull market and the beginning of the next bear market. Why The Bitcoin Price Will Crash In the analysis, EXCAVO outlined why they believe that the Bitcoin bear market was actually over. These were given as the classic signs of a top of the market, and there were three in total. The first of these is what the analyst referred to as “Universal Optimism.” This universal optimism simply points to the fact that everyone seems to be bullish at this point, in addition to seemingly bullish developments. EXCAVO points to the fact that governments are now accepting crypto and creating reserve funds as the reason universal optimism is a sign of the top. Related Reading: These Analysts Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash And Their Forecasts Say It’s Not Over Next is that corporate buying has continued, especially for the likes of Bitcoin. Public companies such as Strategy have accumulated massive reserves of Bitcoin, with Ethereum treasuries not left out. These treasury companies have now bought tens of billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Last but not least, is that positive news around crypto is currently dominating the media. The analyst believes that with so much positive news and investors being reluctant to sell as they wait for higher prices, such as $200,000, $300,000, and $500,000, it is a signal that the Bitcoin price has topped. The Exit Strategy Playing into the idea that the Bitcoin price has topped and is headed into another bear market, the crypto analyst explained that they have sold everything. The plan is to wait until September 2026 before buying back in. According to the crypto analyst’s chart, they expect the Bitcoin price to fall below $61,000 at this time. Related Reading: XRP Burn Rate Suffers Drastic Crash To Near Zero, What’s Going On? The analyst also backs this up with the cycle theory, which says there are around 151 weeks of growth followed by 51 weeks of decline. Going by this, the growth phase is already completed, and between September 13 and October 6 is the beginning of the reversal zone that begins the bear market decline. Additionally, the crypto analyst also dismisses the idea of an altcoin season. Due to the large number of cryptocurrencies right now, sitting at over 1 million coins, EXCAVO says it is not possible for all coins to be pushed up at the same time, like it did in 2017. Rather, there will be selective pumps on altcoins that players are interested in. “I have not become a bear forever. I believe Bitcoin will hit $300,000. But not in the coming months,” the analyst stated. “It will be worth that in 2.5 years, after a healthy 50-60% correction from the peak.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-09-25 09:30:46

This surge reflects renewed investor confidence and growing adoption across digital assets, indicating a strong bullish sentiment in the market. As more individuals achieve significant wealth in crypto, emerging tokens like Pudgy Pandas are also gaining traction. Pudgy Pandas, Asia’s rising meme coin phenomenon, is capturing attention with its unique blend of scarcity, cultural resonance, and a mission-driven narrative, positioning itself for global meme coin dominance. Crypto wealth hits new high This impressive 40% increase in crypto millionaires is largely driven by Bitcoin’s recent gains, which have reignited strong investor confidence and broadened participation across both retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin continues to dominate as the market’s flagship asset, setting the tone for overall market movements and fueling renewed enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies as a serious investment class. Alongside Bitcoin’s momentum, the broader market has seen an influx of capital flowing into diverse digital assets, highlighting increased adoption amid evolving market dynamics. The sharp rise in crypto wealth encapsulates the ongoing maturation of the sector, signalling that digital currencies are moving beyond speculative instruments to become embedded in mainstream investing strategies. Market liquidity has improved markedly, and new technological developments and regulations are shaping a more robust environment for long-term growth. Additionally, meme coins have experienced renewed interest, especially those with compelling stories and strong community engagement. In this environment, Pudgy Pandas , a meme coin originating from Asia, has leveraged market momentum to raise $3.3 million in its presale. Capitalizing on the spotlight of Korean Blockchain Week through viral competitions and marketing, Pudgy Pandas is positioning itself as a culturally significant token with a unique scarcity model and a socially driven mission, setting the stage for broader global impact in the meme coin space. Pudgy Pandas presale momentum drives crypto buzz Asia is once again setting the pace in the meme coin arena with Pudgy Pandas, a rare token combining cultural significance, scarcity, and a purpose-driven mission. Launched through ZenFi’s presale on September 15, 2025, at 2 PM KST, Pudgy Pandas has rapidly captured the attention of crypto traders across Korea, China, Japan, and beyond. With only 1,864 Pudgy Pandas tokens in existence, vastly fewer than the 40 million-plus Pudgy Penguins, this coin appeals to Asian whales who crave deep value and long-term staying power in their investments. The presale, running until October 18 with zero delays expected, consists of 11 pricing stages designed to reward early participation. Starting at $0.021 on September 15, prices rise incrementally every three days, reaching $0.0605 by presale’s final phase. This structured price movement generates urgency and FOMO, encouraging early investors to secure their positions before costs escalate. The 33-day window ensures sustained momentum with phased price increases carefully calibrated for maximum market impact. Pudgy Pandas also boasts robust tokenomics: 68% is allocated for presale and community, 8% for liquidity, 2% for marketing, and a significant 10% reserved for the Panda Conservation Foundation, locked over 10 years with a 12-month cliff. Another 10% fuels the Panda Birth Initiative, a unique scarcity mechanism where 1% of the remaining token supply burns each time a new panda cub is born. This dual focus on conservation and scarcity offers investors a token with soul and financial appeal. Currently making waves at Korean Blockchain Week (September 22-28), Pudgy Pandas hosts viral competitions, billboards, and side events, stimulating intense buzz within Asia’s vibrant crypto markets. This presence highlights Asia’s dominance in setting meme coin trends and builds anticipation for the token’s broader global breakout.

Fans of crypto gambling often visit https://tychebets.gr/bitcoin-casino while searching for a fresh Casino Bonus. Many explorers of the crypto scene open https://www.mse.com.cy/crypto-casino to scan limited offers before choosing a table. Careful players trust listings on online casinos on casinopantheon , which help them feel safe when booking rooms in Cyprus. Enthusiasts drawn to the lively spirit of soliteris gatherings rely on soliteris.lt to learn, join, and play online with confidence. People who type online casino mk into a browser often land on https://online-casino.mk before dealing a quick hand or spinning a reel. These gateways, serving different needs, point toward one clear direction for rewards. Bettors will earn unique, tradable NFT items instead of simple points tracked in closed systems. Every spin or roll will feel like stepping into a vault of digital collectibles. Players will carry benefits across sites, trade badges with friends, and build reputations on the chain. Casinos will move from counters toward items that mark milestones, unlock access, and inspire return visits. Understanding NFTs and Digital Ownership An NFT is a token on a blockchain that proves one-of-a-kind ownership of an item. Unlike a standard casino point, which is only a number in a database, an NFT can be transferred, sold, or displayed in a public wallet. This feature changes how people view loyalty benefits across online gaming. When a casino issues an NFT, it hands the player a tiny piece of coded art nobody else can claim. The holder may keep it as a badge of pride, swap it for chips, or list it on an open marketplace for cash. Because each transfer is recorded on the chain, neither side can fake or duplicate a reward. Permanent records mean a free-spin voucher minted today can be verified years later. Designers can add artwork, rarity traits, and hidden unlocks that give each piece personality beyond a counter. That sense of ownership turns loyalty programs into living collections, closer to trading cards than punch cards. How NFTs Reshape Player Rewards Traditional loyalty programs rely on tiers: wager more, rise higher, unlock perks and gifts. NFTs offer a new path by turning each achievement into a discrete asset with direct utility. Imagine a player finishing a week-long roulette challenge and receiving a “Roulette Maverick” NFT that marks the feat. Holding that token could unlock free bets across roulette tables in several rooms. Trading it with another player might convert its value into slot credits or chips. Some casinos attach cash-back multipliers directly to certain NFTs issued during tournaments. Scan a code with a connected wallet, and the bonus rate updates instantly based on the token held. During Halloween, a pumpkin-themed series might double as raffle tickets for a trip to Vegas. Because supply is set at minting, scarcity creates value that a spreadsheet of points cannot match. The outcome is a flexible system where rewards live outside one venue and move with the player. Perks can be gifted, traded, or displayed, which grows community energy and keeps interest alive. Security and Transparency Benefits Security matters whenever money meets the internet, and casinos share that concern in full. NFTs include an audit trail that helps both house and guest resolve disputes quickly. Each token sits on a public ledger that anyone can check without permission. Fraud grows harder because cloning would require overpowering a broad network of independent nodes. From the casino side, this can reduce costs tied to running a closed loyalty database. From the player side, it builds trust by linking benefits to a wallet they control. Smart contracts push these gains further by encoding rules for expiration dates, transfer limits, and bonus percentages. No staff member can quietly alter terms after launch, since the logic runs on-chain as written. When paired with provably fair game engines, NFT rewards raise transparency across outcomes and attached perks. Players can verify rolls, spins, and bonuses, while support teams can audit records with ease. Future Outlook for NFT-Powered Casinos The next generation of casinos will blend gaming, social spaces, and digital collectibles. Metaverse lounges will let guests display rare jackpot NFTs on virtual walls. People will chat with live dealers while showing prize badges and animated art. Cross-platform portability will drive partnerships between casinos, sportsbooks, and major content studios. A blackjack badge from one site could grant VIP seating in a partner sportsbook. Regulators are watching closely, and their actions will shape adoption speed. Early pilots in parts of Europe cite improved accountability and clearer audits for promotions. Developers are testing dynamic NFTs that evolve as milestones are reached or new achievements unlocked. A plain card could morph into a gold emblem after a high roller weekend or a streak. Casinos that ignore NFTs risk feeling dated, much like venues that resisted mobile payments. Embracing this technology promises a reward system as engaging and flexible as the games. Players will not just gamble; they will collect, curate, and trade lasting, valued casino memories. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

With the advent of blockchain technology, casinos are now offering unique digital assets as part of their loyalty programs, allowing players to own, trade, and utilize their rewards in innovative ways. Introduction to Blockchain and NFTs in Casinos Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent a breakthrough in offering personalized and transferable value to casino patrons. Unlike conventional reward points, NFTs provide a blockchain-based proof of ownership and the ability to trade or sell tokens, making each reward a potential investment. The Enhanced User Experience with NFT Rewards Imagine a world where your casino rewards could be used beyond gaming tables or slot machines. With NFTs, players can earn exclusive digital assets for their activities on platforms like Tychebets and MSE . These tokens can then be showcased or traded in a variety of marketplaces, adding a layer of strategy and value to the casino experience. Navigating Through Various Platforms Players looking for safe and reliable online gaming environments often resort to reputable sites such as Casino Pantheon to enjoy their gaming sessions securely. Meanwhile, those interested in joining vibrant online communities might find platforms like Soliteris appealing for their interactive and engaging setups. For quick gaming options, Online Casino MK serves as a straightforward portal to a variety of games. Revamping Reward Systems with NFTs The shift towards NFT-based rewards systems enables casinos to issue digital collectibles that celebrate achievements and milestones. Each token is unique, enhancing the user's sense of accomplishment and personal connection to the venue. This not only motivates return visits but also enriches the player's collection, turning every game into a quest for the next valuable token. Security Advantages of NFTs NFTs inherently enhance security and transparency within online casinos. Since each NFT is recorded on a blockchain, it provides a tamper-proof record of ownership and transaction history, ensuring that rewards cannot be duplicated or falsified. This leads to a more secure and trustworthy environment for both players and operators. Looking Forward: The Future of NFT Casinos As we look to the future, the role of NFTs in online casinos is set to expand significantly. Alongside classic gaming, we can anticipate the emergence of casino metaverses where players can display and interact with their NFTs in virtual environments. This could potentially include cross-platform integrations, enhancing the utility and appeal of casino NFTs across various entertainment sectors.

An exploit that minted unauthorized GAIN tokens caused the rapid loss of value. Griffin AI (GAIN) was one of the projects featured on Binance Alpha in the past day, offering a special airdrop for eligible users. Just hours after the token launch, the asset was down by 87%, based on a period of concentrated selling. Griffin AI’s GAIN token crashed by up to 85% after the unauthorized minting of 5B new tokens. | Source: Coingecko Although Binance Alpha tokens are curated, their initial trading is often risky and can cause deep losses. However, a nearly 90% crash for GAIN was linked to an on-chain exploit. A Binance address minted an additional 5B GAIN, later dumping only a small part of the tokens through PancakeSwap. Due to the limited liquidity, the mint was enough to tank GAIN. In its initial trading, the asset was mostly represented on PancakeSwap and Uniswap. The accident involved a fake LayerZero peer token for GAIN, which allowed the exploiter to offer non-existent liquidity. The contract then allowed the attacker to create 5B GAIN and fully use them for swaps. Griffin AI project requests official trading freeze Following the trading disaster and unauthorized token minting, the Griffin AI team called out to all exchanges to halt GAIN trading. For now, the token can still be transferred and swaps through Binance’s DEX router continue to go through. GAIN tokens are still held by only around 4K users, and the losses are limited. The asset hovers around $0.02 after trading started at $0.18. The team requested to stop centralized markets, where available, to prevent the attacker from transacting more tokens. We have formally requested all exchanges to pause trading, deposits & withdrawals of $GAIN (BSC). This prevents the attacker from transacting and protects our community.

The Mexc exchange noted the unauthorized supply gain even earlier and stopped GAIN trading even before the Griffin AI team explicitly requested. However, even with a trading halt, the attacker has already swapped out multiple tranches of GAIN and bridged around 2,500 BNB to the main network. The Griffin AI project was a multi-chain structure, and the attacker used a fake Ethereum contract, but ended up taking BNB tokens after swapping. The big problem is that GAIN still has 4.8B tokens outstanding in unauthorized supply, with no decision yet on freezing or removing the assets. Griffin AI stops airdrop campaign Following the exploit, Griffin AI has announced the end of its airdrop campaign. The previous Binance Alpha airdrop will not be affected, but no new tokens will be issued from the project’s reserves. The token is still live, and Binance Alpha traders have full access to swaps. The recent GAIN token event recalls the recent exploit of the UXLink token, which also fell due to unauthorized minting. As Cryptopolitan reported , the token remains active.

This unexpected turn of events has left analysts and investors alike questioning the traditional playbooks of monetary policy, highlighting the intricate dynamics at play within the forex market analysis . For those accustomed to straightforward cause-and-effect in economics, this scenario offers a fascinating case study into how market expectations, existing positions, and relative central bank stances can create counter-intuitive outcomes. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for anyone navigating the complexities of currency trading and macroeconomic trends. Unpacking the Riksbank’s Pivotal Rate Cut Decision The Riksbank, Sweden’s central bank, made headlines by becoming one of the first major central banks in the G10 bloc to initiate an interest rate cut in the current cycle. This significant Riksbank rate cut , reducing the policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%, marked a pivotal moment for the Swedish economy. The decision was not entirely without precedent, as the Riksbank had previously signaled its intention to ease monetary policy, citing a decline in inflation and a weakening economic outlook. However, the timing was earlier than many market participants had anticipated, particularly given the persistent strength of the Swedish krona in recent months and the still-present inflationary pressures. The rationale behind the Riksbank’s move was multi-faceted. Primarily, the central bank pointed to a clear deceleration in inflation, which had been steadily moving towards its 2% target. Economic activity in Sweden had also shown signs of cooling, with GDP growth slowing and unemployment rates beginning to tick up. By cutting rates, the Riksbank aimed to stimulate economic growth, support domestic demand, and prevent a deeper recession. They emphasized the importance of anchoring inflation expectations at the target while also ensuring the economy has sufficient support. However, the market’s reaction to this Riksbank rate cut was far from conventional. Typically, a rate cut by a central bank is expected to weaken the domestic currency, as lower interest rates make the currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns. Yet, the Swedish krona defied this expectation, gaining ground against the euro and other major currencies immediately following the announcement. This counter-intuitive response sparked considerable debate and underscored the nuanced interplay of various factors in the global currency markets. Key aspects of the Riksbank’s decision: Timing: Earlier than many analysts had predicted, indicating a proactive stance on economic support. Inflationary Context: Inflation had fallen significantly from its peak, providing room for policy easing. Economic Outlook: Concerns about economic slowdown and rising unemployment were central to the decision. Forward Guidance: The Riksbank signaled the possibility of further rate cuts in the latter half of the year, contingent on inflation developments. This bold step by the Riksbank sets a precedent and provides valuable insights into how central banks are navigating the post-pandemic economic landscape, balancing inflation control with growth imperatives. Why Did the Swedish Krona Show Unexpected Strength Against the Euro? The most intriguing aspect of the Riksbank’s announcement was the immediate and sustained Swedish krona strength against the euro, a reaction that initially baffled many observers. Conventional economic theory suggests that lower interest rates should reduce a currency’s attractiveness, leading to depreciation. However, several factors converged to create this unusual outcome, demonstrating the complex dynamics of modern forex markets. One primary driver was likely the ‘dovish pricing’ already embedded in the market for the European Central Bank (ECB). While the Riksbank acted, the market had already significantly priced in aggressive rate cuts from the ECB in the near future. This meant that the Riksbank’s cut, while earlier, might have been perceived as less ‘dovish’ in relative terms compared to what was already expected from the ECB. In essence, the market was already positioned for a weaker euro, and the Riksbank’s move simply confirmed a broader trend of G10 central banks moving towards easing. Another crucial element was the unwinding of ‘carry trades’. For months, many investors had borrowed in low-interest-rate currencies (like the euro or yen) to invest in higher-yielding currencies, including the Swedish krona , especially when expectations for Riksbank hikes were strong. As the Riksbank cut rates, and the prospect of further cuts loomed, these carry trades became less profitable. Investors began to unwind these positions, which involved buying back the krona to close out their short positions. This sudden demand for the krona, driven by position adjustments rather than new investment, contributed significantly to its appreciation. Furthermore, the market’s perception of Sweden’s economic fundamentals might have played a role. Despite the Riksbank’s concerns, some analysts might view Sweden’s economy as relatively resilient compared to parts of the Eurozone, or that the Riksbank’s proactive stance could lead to a quicker recovery. This relative optimism, combined with the technical factors, provided a strong tailwind for Swedish krona strength . Key reasons for the krona’s appreciation: Relative Dovishness: The market had already priced in more aggressive easing from the ECB compared to the Riksbank. Carry Trade Unwinding: Investors closing out profitable short-krona positions, leading to buying pressure. Technical Factors: Short squeezes and stop-loss triggers for those betting against the krona amplified the move. Reduced Uncertainty: The rate cut removed some uncertainty, potentially attracting investors back to Swedish assets. This complex interplay of expectations, positioning, and technical flows underscores that currency markets are not always driven by simple interest rate differentials alone. Understanding these underlying dynamics is essential for accurate forex market analysis . Navigating the Volatility of the EURSEK Exchange Rate The immediate consequence of the Riksbank’s unexpected decision was a sharp and notable movement in the EURSEK exchange rate . Prior to the announcement, the pair had been trading in a relatively tight range, with market participants largely anticipating a later Riksbank move or a more gradual approach. However, the 25 basis point cut triggered an immediate sell-off in EUR/SEK, pushing the euro lower against the Swedish krona. This movement reflects a significant shift in market sentiment and positioning. Historically, the EURSEK exchange rate has been a sensitive barometer of relative economic health and monetary policy divergence between the Eurozone and Sweden. A weaker krona has often been a concern for the Riksbank, as it can fuel imported inflation. Conversely, a stronger krona can help curb inflation but might also hinder export competitiveness. The recent move suggests that, for now, the market is prioritizing other factors over the direct impact of the rate cut on interest rate differentials. From a technical perspective, the rapid appreciation of the krona pushed EUR/SEK through key support levels. This can trigger further selling as automated trading systems and trend-following strategies reinforce the initial move. Traders often look at these levels as psychological barriers, and a breach can signal a new directional bias for the pair. The speed of the move indicated a high degree of surprise and a scramble among participants to adjust their positions. Consider the comparative interest rate outlook: Central Bank Policy Rate (Post-Cut/Current) Market Expectations (Next 6-12 Months) Riksbank (Sweden) 3.75% Further cuts likely, potentially 2-3 more by year-end. ECB (Eurozone) 4.50% (Deposit Facility Rate) High probability of cuts starting in June, aggressive easing expected. Federal Reserve (US) 5.25%-5.50% Fewer cuts expected, possibly delayed due to persistent inflation. This table illustrates that while the Riksbank has cut, the perceived trajectory of the ECB’s policy, combined with the Fed’s higher-for-longer stance, creates a complex backdrop for the EURSEK exchange rate . The market is constantly re-evaluating these relative positions, leading to significant volatility. The Shifting Landscape of Global Central Bank Policy The Riksbank’s move is not an isolated event; it contributes to a broader narrative of shifting central bank policy across the globe. After a period of synchronized rate hikes to combat surging inflation, central banks are now grappling with the timing and pace of easing monetary policy. This divergence in approaches creates significant opportunities and risks for global markets, including currencies, equities, and even cryptocurrencies, which often react to shifts in liquidity and risk sentiment. The Riksbank’s decision places it among a handful of central banks, such as the Swiss National Bank (SNB), that have already commenced rate cuts. This contrasts sharply with the Federal Reserve, which has adopted a more cautious stance, waiting for clearer signs of sustained inflation decline. The European Central Bank, while expected to cut rates soon, has been somewhat more hesitant than the Riksbank, leading to the relative market reaction observed in EUR/SEK. This divergence in central bank policy is driven by several factors: Inflationary Pressures: The persistence and drivers of inflation vary significantly across economies. Economic Growth: Some economies are experiencing sharper slowdowns, necessitating quicker policy responses. Labor Market Conditions: Tight labor markets in some regions (e.g., US) give central banks less urgency to cut rates. Currency Strength/Weakness: Central banks must consider how their policies impact their domestic currency and, consequently, inflation and trade. The implications of this shifting landscape are profound. A more dovish stance by some central banks, like the Riksbank, could inject liquidity into the global financial system, potentially supporting risk assets. Conversely, central banks maintaining higher rates could lead to capital outflows from countries with lower rates. For investors, monitoring these policy divergences is critical for understanding capital flows and asset performance. This is a key aspect of forex market analysis , as these policy decisions directly shape currency valuations. The Riksbank’s decision serves as a reminder that central banks are navigating uncharted waters, balancing the risks of reigniting inflation with the imperative to support economic growth. Their policy choices will continue to be a dominant theme influencing financial markets throughout the year. Actionable Insights from Forex Market Analysis The Riksbank’s surprising rate cut and the subsequent Swedish krona strength offer several key insights for traders, investors, and anyone interested in global macroeconomic trends. Understanding these dynamics can help in making more informed decisions in a volatile market environment. 1. Relative Monetary Policy is Key: The krona’s appreciation, despite a rate cut, underscores that absolute interest rates are less important than relative interest rate expectations. The market’s existing ‘dovish’ pricing for the ECB meant the Riksbank’s move was relatively less surprising or impactful than it might have been in a different context. Always consider how a central bank’s action compares to what other major central banks are expected to do. 2. Beware of Positioning and Technical Factors: The unwinding of carry trades and short-covering played a significant role in the krona’s surge. This highlights the importance of understanding market positioning. When a large number of participants are positioned on one side of a trade, a catalyst can trigger a rapid reversal as they rush to close their positions. Technical analysis, identifying key support and resistance levels, can help in anticipating these movements. 3. The Importance of Forward Guidance: While the Riksbank rate cut was delivered, the central bank’s forward guidance regarding potential future cuts will be crucial. If the Riksbank signals a more aggressive easing path than currently priced, the krona could eventually weaken. Conversely, if other central banks become more dovish, the krona might maintain its strength. Closely follow official statements and economic projections. 4. Diversification and Risk Management: In an environment where traditional correlations break down and unexpected market reactions occur, diversification becomes even more critical. Relying solely on one type of analysis or one market assumption can be risky. For those in crypto, understanding these macro shifts can inform broader risk assessments, as global liquidity and sentiment often spill over into digital asset markets. 5. Stay Updated on Economic Data: Future movements in the EURSEK exchange rate will heavily depend on incoming economic data from both Sweden and the Eurozone. Inflation figures, GDP growth, and employment reports will influence the Riksbank’s and ECB’s future decisions. A stronger-than-expected Swedish economy might limit further Riksbank cuts, while persistent weakness in the Eurozone could force the ECB to act more aggressively. This event serves as a powerful reminder that financial markets are complex adaptive systems, often defying simplistic interpretations. A thorough forex market analysis requires looking beyond the headlines and delving into the underlying market structure, expectations, and relative policy stances. The surprising strength of the Swedish krona is a testament to this complexity, offering valuable lessons for navigating future market surprises. Conclusion: Lessons from the Riksbank’s Unconventional Impact The Riksbank’s surprise interest rate cut, which led to an unexpected strengthening of the Swedish krona against the euro, has provided a compelling case study in the nuanced world of modern monetary policy and currency markets. This event challenges the conventional wisdom that rate cuts automatically lead to currency depreciation, demonstrating how factors like relative central bank policy, market positioning, and technical flows can override traditional economic models. The Riksbank rate cut was a bold move, intended to support a slowing economy and guide inflation to target, yet its immediate market impact was anything but straightforward. For investors and analysts, the saga of the EURSEK exchange rate serves as a potent reminder of the importance of comprehensive forex market analysis . It highlights that the global financial landscape is constantly evolving, driven by an intricate web of interdependencies that demand a flexible and adaptive approach. As central banks navigate the delicate balance between controlling inflation and fostering economic growth, their divergent policies will continue to shape currency valuations and global capital flows. The central bank policy decisions made today will have lasting repercussions, and understanding their full scope is paramount for informed decision-making in the financial world. The surprising strength of the krona against the euro underscores that in financial markets, the ‘why’ is often more complex than the ‘what’. This event encourages a deeper dive into market mechanics, pushing us to look beyond initial reactions and understand the underlying forces that truly move currencies. As we move forward, vigilance and a holistic understanding of macroeconomic trends will be key to deciphering the next unexpected twist in the global financial narrative.

As a presale-stage DeFi protocol, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a dual lending system that will merge peer-to-contract pools for blue-chip and stable assets with peer-to-peer markets for riskier tokens. ETH & SOL’s Early Bull Runs in 2025 ETH & SOL’s early bull runs in 2025 Ethereum (ETH) kicked off 2025 with a robust early bull run, climbing over 35% from its January open of around $3,320 to test $4,600 by mid-year, marking its first breach of that level since November 2021. This surge, fueled by $11 billion in spot ETF inflows since July and corporate treasuries like SharpLink Gaming adding $400 million in holdings, propelled ETH to a market cap exceeding $540 billion. Key drivers included the Dencun upgrade’s Layer-2 fee reductions, boosting daily transactions to 1.74 million and DeFi TVL to $120 billion, alongside $160 billion in stablecoin issuance. Technicals showed a bullish flag pattern, with support at $4,500 and RSI at 55, though U.S. tariffs introduced volatility. Solana (SOL) mirrored this momentum, rallying 50% from its January price of $150 to hit $225 by September 2025, driven by 140% DEX volume growth to $1.4 trillion and DeFi TVL reaching $14 billion. Institutional buys, including Galaxy Digital’s $306 million acquisition, and the Alpenglow upgrade’s 100ms finality enhanced scalability, processing 30 million daily transactions at low fees. SOL’s market cap topped $100 billion, with RSI at 66 and support at $185. Both assets benefited from pro-crypto policies and rate cut expectations, but tariff risks could cap gains at $5,000 for ETH and $300 for SOL by year-end. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Why structural design outshines hype The DeFi market has shown time and again that fundamental design determines long-term winners. Meme tokens can rise and fall with a single tweet, but protocols with stablecoin adoption, dependable oracles, treasury accumulation, and token incentives tied directly to usage are positioned to withstand market swings. This is why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being called one of the best opportunities in crypto investment today. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Presale Phase 6, priced at $0.035 per token, with approximately $16.23 million already generated and over 16,600 holders onboard. Half of the 170M tokens allocated for this phase have already been sold, highlighting the growing momentum. The total supply of MUTM is fixed at 4B, and Phase 7 will soon raise the token price by 15% to $0.040. To build trust with investors, the project has undergone a CertiK audit using both manual review and static analysis, achieving a TokenScan score of 90.00 and a CertiK Skynet score of 79.00, with the audit timeline requested in February 2025 and revised in May 2025. The platform also continues to grow its community with over 12,000 followers on Twitter. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will enforce liquidation rules that stabilize lending positions. When collateral values fall below set thresholds, the system liquidates and applies penalties. These penalties are distributed between liquidators and the protocol treasury, meaning that every liquidation event strengthens the project’s balance sheet. Over time, these recurring flows will generate predictable revenue that funds staking rewards and MUTM buybacks, ensuring sustained demand for MUTM. Alongside this, the reserve factor plays a critical role. Each borrower’s interest is partially routed into reserves, with higher-risk assets charged steeper rates. These reserves accumulate on-chain and serve as both a safety net and a treasury for future incentives. This creates confidence for larger counterparties, paving the way for higher total value locked (TVL) once the platform launches. Institutional adoption will be supported by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s robust oracle strategy. Chainlink feeds will serve as the primary source of asset pricing, complemented by fallback feeds, aggregated sources, and time-weighted averages. This layered approach will minimize manipulation and protect the system during volatile swings, exactly the type of reliability required to attract institutions and funds that demand stability before deploying capital. Finally, the utilization-based interest model ensures balanced liquidity. As borrowing demand rises, interest rates automatically increase, pulling in more lenders. Conversely, when demand drops, rates fall to encourage new borrowers. This feedback loop guarantees that pools remain healthy while scaling fee flows that cycle back into buybacks and staking rewards. Demand path toward 1,700% growth Analysts tracking the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project a price trajectory that takes the token from $0.035 in Phase 6 to $0.63 post-launch, a gain of 1,700%. The path is built step by step. Once the beta goes live, borrowers will mint stablecoins while lenders stake mtTokens. Fee flows will accumulate into reserves and treasury, liquidation events will generate penalties, and the first tranche of open-market buybacks will begin. As expected, centralized exchange listings roll out, retail and institutional exposure will widen, Layer-2 integration will reduce costs and expand throughput, and ongoing buybacks will compress supply. This cycle of recurring demand and lower sell pressure is what fuels the projection toward $0.63. These triggers, combined with the trust anchors of a CertiK audit scoring 90/79, a $50,000 bug bounty, a $100,000 giveaway for community engagement, and 12,000+ active Twitter followers, give Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the credibility retail investors demand.

However, ETH, which could not escape the downward trend it experienced afterwards, could not recover and dropped below $4,000 with its latest decline. While ETH is performing poorly in the short term, institutional demand continues to increase. At this point, the amount of Ethereum held on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges has fallen to its lowest level since 2016 due to the increase in institutional accumulation. The exodus of ETH from exchanges accelerated in mid-July and has since fallen 20% due to the aggressive accumulation of digital asset treasuries. As of Thursday, it had fallen to 14.8 million ETH, according to Glassnode data. CryptoQuant’s Ethereum exchange supply ratio (exchange reserves divided by total supply) is also at 0.14, the lowest level since July 2016. This suggests that selling pressure in the market has decreased significantly. What Does It Mean for Ethereum? A decrease in exchange supply is typically a sign that the asset is being transferred to cold storage, staking, or DeFi for higher returns. This is interpreted as a signal that investors are moving ETH to cold storage wallets for long-term holding, and that the Ethereum price will rise in the future. Conversely, an increase in stock market balances is generally a sign that investors are preparing to sell. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Ethereum Supply on Exchanges Is Alarming!

No one moved, no one blinked. Wall Street futures barely shifted, with the S&P 500 ticking up 0.1%, the Nasdaq 100 holding the line, and Dow futures creeping 52 points higher. Everyone’s watching one thing: upcoming U.S. jobs data that could flip the whole risk picture. Intel made a quiet move after hours, surging by 1.5% when Cryptopolitan reported the news that the chipmaker has reached out to Apple for a potential investment. It’s not clear how far talks have gone, but the ask is real. Intel wants Apple’s backing, and the conversation is underway. Tech weakness hits Asia while exporters gain ground In Japan, the Topix index moved up 0.2% to 3,176.97 by 9:30 a.m. Tokyo time, boosted by a weaker yen that helped exporters: car companies, electronics makers, and machinery stocks. Sony added 1.6% and led the gainers. Out of 1,673 stocks in the index, 860 rose, 711 fell, and 102 went nowhere. Bank shares also edged up, driven by speculation that the Bank of Japan could lift rates soon. The Nikkei didn’t join the optimism, falling 0.2% to 45,535.32. Some AI-related names like SoftBank and Advantest were dumped early in the session, as nerves over U.S. tech valuations dragged sentiment lower. Other Asia-Pacific markets moved with no clear direction. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dipped 0.13% to close at 26,484.68. Local EV name Chery jumped 11% on its debut, starting at HK$30.75, spiking to HK$34.16, and then ending the session at HK$31.92. Xiaomi gained 3.69% after showing off a stack of new phones and home devices aimed straight at Samsung’s turf. China’s CSI 300 index on the mainland rose 0.6%, ending the day at 4,593.49. While U.S. stocks dragged, some pockets of Asia stayed resilient… barely. Retail lifts Europe as crypto dumps and FX stalls Over in Europe, the Stoxx 600 opened down 0.2% by 8:45 a.m. London time. Every major bourse was painted red except one sector… retail. H&M came in hot with third-quarter results that beat estimates, and that was enough to launch its shares up 10.5%. That pushed the broader Stoxx 600 retail index 1.2% higher. Still, the overall mood didn’t change. Investors there are just as cautious. Currencies barely moved. The Swiss National Bank kept interest rates at zero, exactly what was expected. That’s the lowest policy rate among major economies. The franc was unchanged against the dollar, which nudged up 0.1% to 0.7960. The euro also ticked 0.1% higher against the franc to 0.9345. The SNB flagged concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs hurting the Swiss economy into 2026. The dollar inched 0.1% lower against the yen to 148.71, pulling back from a recent three-week high. Traders reacted to the Bank of Japan’s July meeting minutes, which revealed some board members are ready to restart rate hikes. Crypto was where the real blood was. Ether crashed below $4,000, dropping 4.7% to $3,969, its lowest point in nearly seven weeks. Bitcoin lost 1.7%. Over $140 billion in crypto value has vanished since the week began. Rachael Lucas, an analyst at BTC Markets, said “institutional inflows cooled,” and technicals were flashing red. Since Monday, almost $300 million has been pulled from U.S.-listed Ether ETFs. That came after $1.7 billion in bullish positions were erased. Lucas said more liquidations are coming if Ether breaks below $3,800. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This trend is powerfully highlighted by the latest news: French investment firm Melanion Capital is making a significant move into the cryptocurrency space. They have announced ambitious plans to raise €50 million, equivalent to about $58.72 million, specifically for strategic Bitcoin investment . Why is Melanion Capital Making This Strategic Bitcoin Investment? Melanion Capital, a respected player in the European investment landscape, is not new to the digital asset arena. Their decision to pursue a substantial Bitcoin investment reflects a growing confidence in the long-term viability and potential of the leading cryptocurrency. This move isn’t just about chasing headlines; it’s a calculated strategy driven by several key factors: Market Demand: There’s increasing client interest in gaining exposure to digital assets. Belief in Bitcoin’s Value: The firm likely sees Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value and a hedge against inflation. Pioneering Spirit: Melanion Capital has a history of innovation, being among the first to launch a Bitcoin-linked ETF in Europe. Their foresight suggests a belief that digital assets will play an increasingly central role in diversified investment portfolios. How Will This Significant Bitcoin Investment Be Executed? The firm’s plan involves raising €50 million through a dedicated fund, which will then be used for direct purchases of Bitcoin. This approach offers investors a regulated pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership or managing private keys. It’s a sophisticated method designed to integrate digital assets into traditional financial structures seamlessly.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has cut approval times by two-thirds while also lifting acceptance rates to 45%. Previously, less than 15% of applications secured approval, drawing accusations that the UK was falling behind global peers. This shift is sparking renewed investor interest in identifying the top crypto to buy as the UK moves toward a full regulatory framework in 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Progress Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing its presale, now in phase 6 out of 11. The current phase is already 45% filled, and $16,200,000 has been raised since the opening phase began. The project has attracted 16,500 total holders so far. Tokens are selling at $0.035 in this phase, which is a 250% increase from the first phase price of $0.01. Phase 6 is underway and moving fast, meaning the chance to acquire tokens at this level is closing quickly. The next phase will lift the price by 14.3% to $0.04, before reaching a final launch price of $0.06. Current buyers are positioned to see returns of 360% once the token goes live. Moreover, Mutuum Finance has already finalized a Certik audit with a token score of 90 out of 100, confirming strong security standards. The team has also partnered with Certik to launch a $50,000 bug bounty program, ensuring any vulnerabilities are identified and rewarded based on severity. In addition, the project is running a $100,000 giveaway, splitting the prize pool among 10 winners, each receiving $10,000 in MUTM. A minimum $50 investment in the presale is required to qualify, and all participants must complete simple eligibility steps. Utility Behind Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing platform designed to improve efficiency in crypto investing. The protocol uses interest rate models linked to liquidity levels, balancing supply and demand for capital. When liquidity is plentiful, borrowing rates stay low to encourage loans. When liquidity tightens, rates rise to attract more deposits and ensure stability. This dynamic structure helps sustain long-term usage and reduces risks of insolvency. While other crypto coins are struggling with questions around what is going on with crypto today, Mutuum Finance is advancing with clear product goals and steady adoption. Unlike older projects that depend on broad market cycles, Mutuum is combining real utility with attractive early entry pricing. Its security audit and structured incentives strengthen trust at a time when many investors remain cautious after every crypto crash. Additionally, crypto prices today show volatility across major coins, and investors are frequently asking why crypto is down or why is crypto crashing. Mutuum’s design addresses these risks through caps, reserve factors, and reliable price feeds to ensure resilience. This makes it an appealing option when evaluating which crypto to buy today for long-term stability. Looking Ahead To UK Regulation As the FCA pushes forward with quicker approvals and prepares new rules in 2025, projects like Mutuum Finance are emerging as the best crypto to buy now. The presale has already signaled strong traction, while the UK’s regulatory momentum adds confidence for global investors. Clear safeguards, transparent tokenomics, and a measured rollout distinguish Mutuum Finance from many alternatives. Investors looking for the top crypto to buy should weigh the FCA’s progress alongside the opportunities in presale projects. Mutuum Finance, currently priced at $0.035 and set to launch at $0.06, is aligning its growth with these wider regulatory shifts. Those positioning now are securing tokens ahead of phase 7, where prices increase again. The window is narrowing as approvals speed up and attention shifts toward the next big crypto investment.

NH Nonghyup Card, a prominent financial institution, has taken a significant step by filing for 12 trademarks related to a Korean won stablecoin . This bold move, initially reported by News1, includes the notable name NHCardKRW, indicating a serious commitment to integrating stablecoins into their services. This initiative isn’t just a minor update; it represents a pioneering effort by a major traditional financial player to embrace the future of money. For many, it confirms that stablecoins are moving beyond niche crypto circles and into the mainstream financial ecosystem. What Exactly is a Korean Won Stablecoin and Why Does it Matter? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or, in this case, the Korean Won. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, a Korean won stablecoin aims to offer the best of both worlds: the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology combined with the price stability of traditional money. Imagine making international payments or daily purchases with a digital asset that holds its value consistently. This stability is crucial for mass adoption, as it removes the speculative risk often associated with cryptocurrencies. NH Nonghyup Card’s foray into this space suggests a future where digital transactions could become even more seamless and trustworthy. The filing of 12 distinct trademarks indicates a comprehensive strategy. This isn’t just about one coin; it’s about building an entire ecosystem around a digital won. Such a move by a traditional financial giant lends immense credibility to the stablecoin concept. NH Nonghyup Card’s Vision: Pioneering Digital Finance with a Korean Won Stablecoin Why would a well-established card company delve so deeply into the world of stablecoins? The answer lies in innovation and staying ahead of the curve. By securing trademarks like NHCardKRW, NH Nonghyup Card is positioning itself at the forefront of digital financial services in South Korea. Enhanced Payment Solutions: A Korean won stablecoin could facilitate faster, cheaper, and more efficient domestic and international payments, bypassing traditional banking intermediaries. E-commerce Integration: Imagine using NHCardKRW for online shopping with instant settlements, reducing friction for both consumers and merchants. Remittance Services: Stablecoins can dramatically cut down costs and time for cross-border remittances, a significant benefit for many users. Financial Inclusion: Providing accessible digital financial tools to a broader population, potentially reaching those underserved by traditional banking. This proactive approach by NH Nonghyup Card could set a precedent for other financial institutions in the region and globally. Their investment in intellectual property for a Korean won stablecoin demonstrates a long-term vision for a digitized financial future. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Challenges for the Korean Won Stablecoin While the prospects are exciting, the journey to widespread adoption of a Korean won stablecoin is not without its hurdles. Understanding these challenges is key to appreciating the full scope of NH Nonghyup Card’s ambitious undertaking. Opportunities Ahead: Increased Efficiency: Streamlined transactions and reduced operational costs for businesses and consumers alike. Global Competitiveness: South Korea could solidify its position as a leader in financial technology innovation. New Business Models: The stablecoin infrastructure could enable entirely new financial products and services. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Landscape: The need for clear and comprehensive regulations governing stablecoins is paramount to ensure trust and prevent illicit activities. Technological Infrastructure: Ensuring robust, scalable, and secure blockchain infrastructure to handle mass transactions. User Adoption: Educating the public about stablecoins and encouraging their use over familiar fiat currencies or existing digital payment methods. Interoperability: Ensuring the NH Nonghyup Card’s stablecoin can seamlessly interact with other digital platforms and financial systems. Overcoming these challenges will require collaborative efforts between financial institutions, regulators, and technology providers. NH Nonghyup Card’s commitment through these trademark filings is a strong indicator of their readiness to engage in this complex but rewarding endeavor.

The inquiry follows a New York Times report that highlighted two multibillion-dollar transactions with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which raised alarms over the US decision to allow the Emirates to import American-designed artificial intelligence (AI) chips, despite concerns about their ties to China. Scrutiny Over UAE Deals And Crypto Interests Senators Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts and Elissa Slotkin from Michigan have directed inspectors general at the Commerce and State Departments to examine the circumstances surrounding these multibillion-dollar agreements. They expressed serious concerns about the implications of these deals, especially in light of the close ties between the UAE and China, which they assert could jeopardize US security interests. “The pattern of these transactions is deeply troubling,” the senators noted in their letter. At the center of this controversy is Mr. Witkoff, a White House adviser who was involved in advocating for the chip exports to the UAE while simultaneously facilitating a significant investment in his family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial (WLFI). This company has garnered attention for its substantial ties to the cryptocurrency market, with reports indicating that the Witkoff family holds a considerable stake in the firm, potentially valued at nearly $800 million based on current trading prices. The potential conflict of interest is further complicated by the involvement of David Sacks, another White House adviser and venture capitalist, whose participation in the chip negotiations has raised eyebrows among colleagues. Concerns have been voiced regarding the appropriateness of a venture capitalist negotiating deals that could directly benefit his financial interests. Although Sacks was granted an ethics waiver to partake in these discussions, questions remain about the transparency and propriety of the deals. Senator Van Hollen Demands Clarity The White House has stated that both Witkoff and Sacks are cooperating with ethics officials to ensure compliance with government regulations. However, critics argue that the overlapping nature of their business interests and government roles creates a troubling ethical landscape. As the senators pointed out, the intersection of personal financial interests with national security decisions poses a significant risk to the integrity of US foreign policy. The current political climate raises uncertainty about whether these investigations will lead to tangible consequences. Lawmakers are keenly aware of the need for oversight, particularly given President Trump’s controversial business dealings and his administration’s approach to the crypto industry. As scrutiny mounts, Democratic leaders are taking steps to address these conflicts. Senator Chris Van Hollen is using his position on a committee overseeing the Commerce Department’s budget to demand clarity regarding the UAE deals. Additionally, a group of Democratic representatives has initiated inquiries into whether Sacks has adhered to the regulations governing special government employees.

This strategic move aims to advance genomic identity solutions in the region by onboarding certified laboratories and clinics to securely anchor genomic data on the XRP Ledger. The initiative represents a convergence of cutting-edge biotechnology and blockchain technology, offering a robust platform for storing and verifying genomic information. By leveraging the XRP Ledger, DNA Protocol ensures that DNA data is not only secure but also immutable and easily verifiable. This approach reduces the risk of data tampering and enhances trust among healthcare providers, researchers, and individuals. Certified labs and clinics participating in the program will undergo a rigorous onboarding process to ensure compliance with DNA Protocol’s standards for data integrity and privacy. Once onboarded, these institutions will have the capability to anchor genomic identity records directly onto the XRP Ledger, enabling a transparent and decentralized ecosystem for genomic data management. For Rwanda, this initiative aligns with broader goals to strengthen healthcare infrastructure, foster innovation, and support precision medicine. By enabling secure genomic data storage and verification, DNA Protocol empowers healthcare providers to make more informed clinical decisions, supports research initiatives, and creates opportunities for personalized treatment plans tailored to an individual’s unique genetic profile. Therefore, DNA Protocol’s East African expansion underscores its mission to bring genomic identity solutions continent-wide. Rwanda, renowned for its tech-driven public health and governance, offers the perfect launchpad. This initiative is set to drive regional collaboration, boost biotech investment, and position Rwanda as a genomic innovation hub. XRP Signals Strong Reversal as Triple Bottom Pattern Emerges Crypto trader Kamran Asghar has highlighted a potentially significant move for XRP, citing the emergence of a clear triple bottom pattern on its price chart. According to Asghar, this technical setup often indicates a strong reversal, signaling that XRP could be poised for a bullish breakout in the near term. A triple bottom forms when an asset tests a support level three times without breaking it, signaling strong demand and a potential trend reversal. Therefore, technical analysis depicts this pattern as a reliable precursor to upward momentum once resistance is broken. For XRP, Asghar highlights that repeated support tests indicate weakening selling pressure and growing buyer strength, setting the stage for a possible bullish rally to $4.2. Therefore, XRP is nearing a critical resistance zone, and a breakout could confirm its triple bottom reversal pattern, driving the price toward $3.7. Trader Kamran Asghar notes that this setup signals a bullish shift, with a surge in buying likely to propel XRP to new short-term highs once resistance is cleared. Early bullish signals from oscillators and trend indicators, combined with a well-formed triple bottom, strong volume, and positive momentum, position XRP for a potential major rally despite inherent market volatility. Conclusion DNA Protocol’s launch in Rwanda marks a transformative leap for genomic identity in East Africa. By linking certified labs and clinics to the XRP Ledger, the initiative ensures secure, transparent, and verifiable DNA data, empowering healthcare providers, researchers, and individuals. Rwanda’s adoption of this biotech-blockchain convergence positions it as a regional hub for genomic innovation, driving personalized medicine, improved healthcare outcomes, and a new era of data-driven solutions across the continent. Meanwhile, XRP’s emerging triple bottom pattern signals a high-probability reversal, with strong support and growing buying interest laying the groundwork for a breakout.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|WALLET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-25 10:01:50

Through AI, anyone can select stocks, monitor performance, and do what was previously limited to banks: run market analysis. The so-called “ robo-advisory market ,” which includes fintechs, banks, and wealth managers who have keyed in their advice into the algorithm, has grown exponentially over the past 12 months. Data firm Research and Markets projects revenues will grow by roughly 600% to reach $470.91 billion by 2029, up from $61.75 billion last year. Analysts against paywalls are using AI for trading Jeremy Leung, who spent nearly two decades analyzing companies for Swiss bank UBS, began using ChatGPT after losing his job earlier this year. He told Reuters that he now applies the chatbot’s responses to manage his multi-asset portfolio. “I no longer have the luxury of a Bloomberg terminal, or those kinds of market-data services which are very expensive,” he said. “Even the simple ChatGPT tool can replicate a lot of the workflows I used to do.” Even though ChatGPT can read the internet, no AI chatbot can access subscription data behind paywalls like Bloomberg’s stock aggregator, so when using LLMs, you might miss some important investment details. Leung uses prompts such as “assume you’re a short analyst, what is the short thesis for this stock?” or “use only credible sources, such as SEC filings.” He believes context improves the quality of answers, but admits they come with risks. “If people get comfortable investing using AI and they’re making money, they may not be able to manage in a crisis or downturn,” he said. According to a survey done by eToro, 13% out of 11,000 retail investors use AI LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini for investments, while around half said they would consider them. Another one from UK-based comparative site Finder saw 40% of respondents say they prefer chatbots to agencies when it comes to personal financial advice. When Finder asked ChatGPT in March 2023 to select stocks, it produced a list including Nvidia, Amazon, Procter & Gamble, Walmart, alongside 30 other entities. The portfolio has gained nearly 55% since, beating the average return of the UK’s 10 most popular funds by 19 percentage points. Do not blindly rely on AI “AI models can be brilliant,” said Dan Moczulski, UK managing director at eToro. “The risk comes when people treat generic models like ChatGPT or Gemini as crystal balls.” He is warning investors against using tools that are not specifically trained on markets, noting that general models can misquote figures, misdate events, and issue outdated price trends. When deployed as advanced search engines, LLMs can find information quickly or issue good tips on budgeting and credit. However, when users seek precise answers to complex questions about money, health, or law, some researchers find that they come up short. “It is quite dangerous to seek advice [from AI] of pretty much any sort, legal, financial, or medical,” said Andrew Lo, director of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at MIT Sloan School of Management. “All three of those areas have very large dangers if they’re not done well.” Chatbot predicted S&P 500 index gains, but is not entirely reliable The US stock market S&P 500 index is up 13% in the last 12 months, while the pan-European STOXX 600 is up almost 10%. The rally has made AI-powered selections look prescient, but according to naysayers, chatbots have only made the right picks because the market is doing well overall. According to Lo’s research paper on generative AI in finance, ChatGPT may recommend Microsoft as a strong investment option. A human advisor might also do so, but would be expected to disclose that Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, taking up almost half of ChatGPT’s parent company’s profits. The chatbot does not automatically reveal that connection, which is a clear conflict of interest. “There are winners and losers every time you introduce new technologies,” Lo said. “The early adopters are the ones that may end up making a lot of the mistakes, but they’re also the ones more likely to innovate with the technology, as opposed to pushing against it.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Business|Google|OpenAI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-25 10:01:51

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin jumped over 1% yesterday, finding support not only at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level but also at the 100 EMA. This formed the bullish picture of a classic Fibonacci retest pattern, which typically suggests the token could move toward at least the Fibonacci swing highs. In this case, this would be a 5% rise toward $118K. However, so far today Bitcoin has given back all of yesterday’s gains, once again putting the spotlight on those two key support levels. The next few hours will be crucial, as losing these supports could signal that the token is ready to rally downward, at least for the next few days. That said, even a deeper correction from here would still not change Bitcoin’s long-term bullish direction. For instance, on the daily chart, the token has yet to even touch the 200 EMA since its June rally. And on the weekly chart, Bitcoin hasn’t even made contact with the 20 EMA. Now, we’re not suggesting that the token will surely trade lower and touch those levels; we’re saying that even if it does, it would still be in bullish territory. All you need to do is be patient and wait for a potential rebound, which could then prompt a nice low-risk, high-upside bullish setup.

This isn’t just a number; it represents a significant milestone, reflecting growing trust and utility in the digital asset space. According to CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization of stablecoins now stands at an impressive $307.7 billion, showcasing a steady upward trajectory. This phenomenal growth signals a pivotal moment for digital currencies. What Does a $300 Billion Stablecoin Market Cap Mean for Crypto? Reaching this astounding figure signifies more than just monetary growth; it highlights the increasing integration of stablecoins into the global financial ecosystem. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value against a fiat currency like the US dollar, act as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. This expanded stablecoin market cap indicates a broader acceptance and reliance on these digital assets for various purposes. This remarkable growth reflects several key trends: Increased Adoption: More individuals and institutions are using stablecoins for transactions, remittances, and as a safe haven during market volatility. Enhanced Liquidity: A larger market cap provides deeper liquidity, making it easier to trade in and out of cryptocurrencies without significant price impact. Growing Trust: The consistent performance and regulatory efforts surrounding major stablecoins contribute to greater confidence among users. The Powerhouses Driving the Phenomenal Stablecoin Market Cap While the overall stablecoin market cap is impressive, a few key players dominate the landscape. Tether (USDT) remains the undisputed leader, commanding a colossal capitalization of $173.03 billion. Its widespread use across exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms cements its position as a cornerstone of the crypto economy. Following closely is USD Coin (USDC), with a robust market cap of $74.19 billion, recognized for its strong regulatory compliance and transparency. These two giants, along with others like Dai (DAI) and First Digital USD (FDUSD), collectively represent the majority of the market. Their continuous growth underscores their utility and the demand for reliable digital dollars. The competition among these stablecoin providers also drives innovation, leading to better services and more secure offerings for users globally. Why is the Stablecoin Market Cap Expanding So Rapidly? The rapid expansion of the stablecoin market cap isn’t accidental; it’s fueled by compelling benefits and diverse use cases. Stablecoins offer a unique combination of stability and the efficiency of blockchain technology, making them incredibly versatile. Here are some primary drivers: Market Volatility Hedge: Traders frequently convert volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin into stablecoins during market downturns, preserving capital. Cross-Border Payments: Stablecoins enable faster and cheaper international transfers compared to traditional banking systems, bypassing intermediaries. DeFi Ecosystem Growth: They are the lifeblood of decentralized finance, used for lending, borrowing, and yield farming, providing liquidity to various protocols. Accessibility: Stablecoins provide access to dollar-denominated assets for individuals in countries with unstable local currencies or limited access to traditional banking. Furthermore, increasing institutional interest and clearer regulatory discussions are providing a more stable environment for stablecoin adoption, encouraging further investment and usage, which in turn boosts the stablecoin market cap . Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for the Stablecoin Market Cap While the $300 billion milestone is celebratory, the journey ahead for the stablecoin market cap involves both challenges and immense opportunities. Regulatory clarity remains a paramount concern. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to effectively oversee stablecoins, balancing innovation with consumer protection and financial stability. Potential regulations could impact issuance, reserves, and operational standards, posing challenges for the continued growth of the stablecoin market cap . However, the opportunities are equally significant. As global economies become more digitized, stablecoins are poised to play an even larger role in facilitating seamless digital transactions. Innovations in blockchain technology, coupled with evolving regulatory frameworks, could unlock new use cases and drive the stablecoin market cap to even greater heights. This could include: Integration into traditional payment systems. Development of new stablecoin types (e.g., commodity-backed). Increased adoption by corporations for treasury management. The remarkable surge of the stablecoin market cap past $300 billion is a testament to their undeniable utility and growing importance in the digital economy. From providing stability in volatile markets to enabling efficient global transactions, stablecoins are reshaping how we interact with money. This milestone not only celebrates past achievements but also paves the way for a future where digital currencies play a central, stable role in finance. The journey of stablecoins is far from over; indeed, it’s just gaining incredible momentum. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin?
