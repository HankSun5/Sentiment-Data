Total market capitalization now stands at $294 billion, The majority of these tokens continue to circulate on Ethereum, cementing its place as the backbone of the stablecoin ecosystem. But this growth isn’t just about the old giants like USDT and USDC. New entrants are making waves with innovative models and fresh incentives for users. Let’s take a closer look at the latest developments. Total Stablecoin Market Cap just hit a new ATH of $294 BILLION Guess where most of those stablecoins live? You guessed it: Ethereum pic.twitter.com/0QQBqS4Y26 — Crypto-Gucci.eth ᵍᵐ (@CryptoGucci) September 24, 2025 USDH Launches on Hyperliquid Native Markets has officially rolled out USDH, a fully backed stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. The token is now live on Hyperliquid with a USDH/USDC trading pair already seeing more than $2.2 million in early trading volume. The reserves behind USDH are managed through a hybrid structure. Backing comes from cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, while transparency is maintained through oracle feeds. An initial mix of off-chain and on-chain allocation ensures liquidity and stability. HYPERLIQUID RA MẮT STABLECOIN USDH USDH đã ghi nhận hơn 2 triệu USD khối lượng giao dịch ngay trong giai đoạn đầu Được bảo chứng bằng tiền mặt và trái phiếu kho bạc Mỹ ngắn hạn, USDH nhằm giảm sự phụ thuộc vào các stablecoin bên ngoài như USDC,… pic.twitter.com/4IRnySisKX — ThuanCapital (@ThuanCapital) September 24, 2025 The issuer has also mapped out a yield-sharing model: 50% of reserve yields will be used to buy back HYPE tokens. The remaining 50% will support Hyperliquid’s ecosystem growth. For Hyperliquid, this launch is a step toward reducing reliance on USDC, which still represents over 90% of total deposits. USDH could help diversify liquidity on the platform and create new demand for the HYPE token. Key stat: USDH has already generated over $2 million in trading activity since launch. 1/ USDF is @Aster_DEX 's native stablecoin. Holders earn airdrop points for holding the token. Lets dive into the metrics of this token. pic.twitter.com/TrxC3mfQg8 — Pine Analytics (@PineAnalytics) September 24, 2025 USDF Supply Explodes on Aster DEX Another stablecoin gaining attention is USDF, the native token of Aster DEX. Unlike USDH, USDF is directly tied to user incentives,holders earn airdrop points simply for holding the token. The supply growth has been nothing short of aggressive. Just nine days ago, total supply hovered around 34 million USDF. Today, it has surged to nearly 250 million, marking an increase of more than 220 million in under two weeks. But the distribution tells a different story. According to data: 83% of USDF remains in the project treasury. 8.7% is staked as auUSDF. 6.8% is held by other protocol addresses. Staking plays a key role in USDF’s tokenomics. Users can convert their USDF into auUSDF, which not only earns extra points but also provides yield. At present, auUSDF is trading at 1.042, translating to an implied 7.5% APY over the last five months. Most recent activity shows wallets buying USDF primarily to farm Aster DEX points, before depositing them directly on the platform. This mix of incentives has fueled rapid supply expansion while anchoring liquidity within the ecosystem. Key stat: USDF supply jumped 7x in just over a week, from 34M to 250M. Kazakhstan Enters the Stablecoin Race with KZTE It’s not just DeFi protocols experimenting with stablecoins. Nation-states are beginning to make their mark too. The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) has launched a pilot program for KZTE, a tenge-backed stablecoin. Developed inside NBK’s regulatory sandbox, KZTE is being issued on Solana by licensed exchange Intebix, with support from Mastercard and Eurasian Bank. This marks the first national tenge stablecoin to hit a blockchain. Kazakhstan launches Stablecoin $KZTE pegged to the Tenge! The National Bank of Kazakhstan @Nationalbank_KZ has kicked off a pilot program to issue the tenge-backed KZTE stablecoin on Solana, developed within its regulatory sandbox for digital assets. Issued by licensed… pic.twitter.com/1iHhTgC9BP — Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) September 24, 2025 The pilot introduces a few key benefits: Seamless fiat-to-crypto exchange with KZTE integration. Direct crypto card settlement via Mastercard rails. Expanded digital asset access for Kazakhstan’s retail and institutional market. A significant step toward NBK’s goal of modernizing payment infrastructure. By choosing Solana, the initiative gains access to high-speed, low-cost transactions, which makes sense for a retail-friendly stablecoin. With Mastercard in the mix, KZTE is positioned for real-world payments and cross-border settlement. This move also signals Kazakhstan’s intent to carve out a role in the global stablecoin race,not just as a miner-friendly hub, but now as a player in blockchain-based finance. Key stat: KZTE is the first stablecoin pegged to the Kazakh tenge issued under a national pilot program. Why These Launches Matter Stablecoins remain the backbone of crypto markets, accounting for nearly every on-chain dollar transaction, lending protocol, and DeFi yield farm. The rise to $294 billion market cap shows they are not slowing down. But the entry of new players like USDH, USDF, and KZTE highlights the evolution of this space: USDH is focused on decentralizing liquidity within trading venues while tying yields back to governance tokens like HYPE. USDF reflects how DeFi projects gamify liquidity through airdrops and staking incentives, driving rapid supply growth. KZTE represents a government’s attempt to merge fiat and crypto payments under a regulated framework. The mix of private issuers, DeFi-native tokens, and state-backed experiments suggests stablecoins are becoming more diverse in purpose and design. Ethereum still hosts the lion’s share of stablecoin activity, but ecosystems like Solana, Hyperliquid, and Aster DEX are carving out niches. Whether it’s new collateral models, reward mechanisms, or direct fiat integration, the stablecoin market is moving beyond its USDT/USDC duopoly. As the market cap pushes into new record territory, expect even more issuers,both private and state-linked,to step in. Each new launch tests how stablecoins can evolve from just a crypto dollar to something that underpins financial systems at scale. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The goal is to boost liquidity across both ecosystems by letting investors redeem their fund shares for RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin that already boasts a $700 million market cap . While redemptions will begin on Ethereum , Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that they’ll soon transition to the XRP Ledger , bringing even more real-world utility to the network. This unlocks a key catalyst for a bullish XRP price prediction , potentially accelerating transaction volumes and supporting the case for long-term targets as high as $1,000 . XRP Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch As Consolidation Continues XRP has been consolidating for a while after it hit its latest swing high at $3.65. The token is still on an uptrend and the key area of support to watch is the $2.60 level. Hence, while XRP may see short-term pullbacks in the coming days, its long-term trajectory remains bullish thanks to major project developments and improving market conditions. A strong rebound from the $2.60 level could set the stage for a breakout to a new all-time high, with $10 firmly in sight this cycle – representing a 230% upside. And while the $1,000 mark may sound ambitious, the rapid pace of institutional adoption and integration of Ripple’s technology points to a long-term trajectory where such a valuation becomes increasingly plausible over time. In the meantime, high-potential crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are attracting serious attention. With altseason heating up fast, this could be the best chance to get in before the next 10x explosion . Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Turns High-Leverage Trading Into a Meme-Powered Movement Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is more than just another Shiba in the meme pack; it’s a token wired on 1,000x leverage and built for retail traders who want to play the same game as whales. Backed by one of crypto’s most recognizable memes, $MAXI has already pulled in over $2.4 million just a few weeks after its presale kicked off. Through the MAXI Fund, the project will invest up to 25% of the presale proceeds in the most promising tokens of the cycle with 1000X leverage to amplify results. Add in gamified challenges like Max Gains and Max Ripped, and the token becomes a trading club for degens who thrive on risk. To buy $MAXI, visit the official Maxi Doge website and connect a compatible wallet (such as the Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card at checkout.

His call is bold: slash gas from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei, cutting average transaction costs nearly in half. That would make BNB one of the cheapest major blockchains in 2025,on par with Solana and Base,while maintaining performance for traders and builders. Gas fees matter.

For high-frequency traders and market makers, even small fee differences shape where liquidity flows. Lower fees also attract new apps and retail users who may otherwise avoid costly networks like Ethereum. BNB Chain validators are proposing to cut gas from 0.1 to 0.05 Gwei and shorten block intervals from 750ms to 450ms, dropping fees to about $0.005 per tx and keeping BSC competitive with Solana and Base. Past cuts from 3→1 Gwei and 1→0.1 Gwei lowered fees 75% and boosted daily… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 24, 2025 BNB Chain validators are now proposing two big changes: Cut minimum gas from 0.1 Gwei → 0.05 Gwei Shorten block intervals from 750ms → 450ms If approved, this would push median fees down to ~$0.005 per tx. That cements BSC’s role as a low-cost chain for trading, swaps, and onchain experimentation. A Track Record of Bold Cuts This isn’t new territory. BNB Chain has repeatedly slashed gas, and each time activity soared: April 2024: Gas fell 3 Gwei → 1 Gwei (–67%) May 2025: Gas fell 1 Gwei → 0.1 Gwei (–90%) The results: median fees dropped from $0.04 → $0.01 (–75%). Daily transactions jumped 140%, breaking 12M+ per day. October 2025 now brings the next chapter: 0.05 Gwei as the new floor. Trading Drives the Network The shift in activity is clear. At the start of 2025, swap-related activity made up just 20% of BSC transactions. By June, it surged to 67%, making trading the chain’s dominant use case. For these users, every fraction of a cent in fees matters. Low gas doesn’t just help,it decides where trades land. BNB’s staking yield remains above 0.5% APY, meaning validator rewards are stable. Network capacity also sits under 30% utilization, leaving plenty of headroom for volume growth. Risks and Safeguards Critics often point to three risks: failed transactions, validator incentives, and infrastructure strain. But the chain’s data suggests otherwise: Infrastructure has been tested to handle 3x today’s state load. Higher transaction counts offset lower per-tx fees, keeping validator APY healthy. Gas remains dynamic if congestion spikes. The system is designed to flex with demand while prioritizing accessibility. A New Principle for Growth The community is discussing a guiding principle for BNB Chain: “As long as staking APY stays above 0.5%, the network should aim for the lowest gas possible.” This ensures validators remain rewarded while users enjoy ultra-low costs. The long-term target is even more ambitious: ~$0.001 per tx, which would put BSC among the cheapest large chains globally. ATHs Back the Case Momentum is already on BNB Chain’s side. Last week, the chain hit fresh records: 17.4M active addresses $3.32B perpetuals volume 100M+ weekly transactions $1M+ daily fees Much of this surge is powered by @Aster_DEX, which has reignited the perpetuals trading narrative on BSC. These milestones strengthen the argument that lowering fees further won’t hurt sustainability,it may instead accelerate adoption. BNB Chain hits new weekly ATHs with 17.4M active addresses and $3.32B in perps volume. The growth is driven by @Aster_DEX , which attracted traders to @BNBCHAIN and reignited the perps narrative. Other metrics are climbing too: weekly trxns сrossed 100M, and daily fees hit $1M. pic.twitter.com/f7tFPcTNEK — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) September 24, 2025 BNB’s Market Position BNB is consolidating after recently breaking $1,000 for the first time. The rally reflects growing confidence in Binance’s ecosystem, even as competitors like Solana, Ethereum, and Base push for liquidity dominance. Cutting fees at this moment isn’t just tactical,it’s strategic. It signals BNB Chain intends to lead the next wave of onchain trading by staying the cheapest, fastest option. The proposal is now in community hands. Validators and users will weigh the pros and cons before voting. If approved, fees would halve within weeks, further positioning BNB Chain as the backbone for high-frequency onchain activity. The message from leadership is clear: performance and accessibility will drive the next stage of growth. BNB Chain has always moved forward with validator consensus and user support. This proposal continues that path. Community feedback will shape whether the chain pursues 0.05 Gwei now and $0.001 per tx long term. With adoption climbing and trading now dominant, the fee debate is more than numbers,it’s about securing BSC’s place in the future of DeFi. BNB trades at $1,014, with 24h volume at $3.8B and circulating supply of 139M BNB, per CoinMarketCap. The road ahead will be decided by the same principle that has guided past success: build fast, keep fees low, and grow together. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Yet the one-word message went viral, drawing over 8.6 million views within hours. The response was immediate. $FTT, the native token of the defunct FTX exchange, erupted in trading volume and price. According to Coingecko, $FTT jumped 30.2% in early trading, later peaking near a 60% gain on the day. $FTT is up 30.2% following a 'gm' tweet from Sam Bankman-Fried's X account. pic.twitter.com/9Zqk33Y01b — CoinGecko (@coingecko) September 24, 2025 Who’s Posting From Prison? The sudden appearance of SBF online fueled speculation. How does someone behind bars manage to post on X? Shortly after the “gm,” a follow-up clarification appeared. The account explained that Sam himself is not directly posting, but that “a friend” has access and is sharing updates on his behalf. The clarification did little to calm the chatter. Screenshots, reposts, and memes flooded crypto Twitter. Reactions split between disbelief, anger, and amusement at the idea of a casual “good morning” shaking up a dead token. The Market Impact The effect was undeniable. Traders rushed back into $FTT, a token once written off after FTX’s collapse in 2022. At press time, $FTT trades around $0.97, up 18% in 24 hours, with a market cap of $319 million, according to CoinMarketCap. Daily volume surged past $79 million. Timing Ahead of Repayment Round The surge also coincides with a crucial date for FTX creditors. On September 30, the exchange is scheduled for its third repayment round, distributing $1.6 billion back to creditors. Speculators may be linking the renewed activity around SBF’s account to renewed hopes for the FTX estate. While there’s no official connection between the tweet and the repayment, markets often react emotionally to symbolic signals. Digital Resurrection of #SBF Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced genius serving 25 years for massive fraud, has just broken his silence on X after months of digital silence.

A… pic.twitter.com/QkPzrpSn1f — Ismeidy (@ismeidyfinanzas) September 24, 2025 A Community Divided The broader crypto community remains torn. Some view the $FTT move as a cynical pump, with little substance behind it. Others frame it as proof of the token’s resilience, even years after its parent exchange collapsed. Crypto commentator @g13m noted that “the fact a single ‘gm’ can do this says more about trader psychology than fundamentals.” GieM The unexpected awakening of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in X, where he is serving a 25-year sentence in an American prison, led to a nearly 60% increase in the price of the FTT exchange token. After the ""Good Morning"" message, another post was published, clarifying that… pic.twitter.com/4iOyJ4FOqu — Captain GM (@g13m) September 24, 2025 Memes also poured in, with “gm from prison” trending across X. Some joked about Sam tweeting workout updates or prison cafeteria reviews next. Others criticized the ethical implications of humanizing someone convicted of one of the largest frauds in financial history. The SBF Factor Sam Bankman-Fried has been largely absent from public conversation since his conviction earlier this year. Legal experts had predicted a quiet disappearance from headlines as the FTX bankruptcy played out. Instead, his digital ghost just sent shockwaves through crypto markets. Even from behind bars, the mere suggestion of SBF’s presence still moves money. That fact alone raises questions about how much influence individuals continue to hold over crypto sentiment, even after disgrace. Whether today’s surge sustains is uncertain. $FTT remains a speculative asset tied to a collapsed exchange, with little utility outside creditor speculation. Still, today’s price action shows that narratives,especially unexpected ones,can reignite interest. As the September 30 repayment round approaches, all eyes will remain on both $FTT price action and the X account of Sam Bankman-Fried. A casual post already triggered one rally. Traders are now watching closely for the next digital whisper from prison. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While the market shows attempts at recovery, the unclear wave patterns leave traders divided on whether the next move will be a breakout or a deeper correction. Messy Subwaves Keep Bitcoin’s Next Move Clouded TARA, a crypto analyst, recently shared fresh insights on X regarding Bitcoin’s ongoing price action. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is currently in the middle of forming another wave down, but the subwave structure is still messy and unclear. This uncertainty makes it harder to predict the exact short-term direction, though the broader trend signals that further movement is likely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Signals Bullish Edge As Traders Eye Fed Pivot She noted that BTC has already tested the resistance zone around $113,500, but the market still seems drawn toward lower targets. The rejection from that resistance highlights the weakness in immediate bullish momentum, leaving room for bears to reassert control. TARA also emphasized that the $111,000 level remains a critical area to watch. This zone aligns closely with important Fibonacci retracement levels, particularly the .618 support fibs. As long as Bitcoin holds above this threshold, there’s still a chance for the bulls to regain momentum and avoid deeper downside pressure. However, if $111,000 is broken decisively, the analyst warned that Bitcoin would most likely extend its decline toward the next major Fibonacci level near $99,000. Such a move would shake out weak hands before the market establishes a more stable foundation for recovery. BTC Finds Support As Liquidity Grab Sparks Bounce Crypto VIP Signal, in a fresh update, noted that Bitcoin recently grabbed liquidity at a key support zone before bouncing higher. This liquidity sweep allowed the market to reset after testing lower levels, showing that buyers were quick to step in and defend the area. Such reactions often serve as early signs of strength, suggesting that Bitcoin still holds bullish potential as long as the support remains intact. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Drops To $115K After Rate-Cut Rally — But BTC Far From Capitulation Attention now turns to the $113,000–$113,300 resistance zone, which stands as the next major hurdle for price action. This level has acted as a tough ceiling in previous attempts, making it a critical zone to watch. According to the analyst, a decisive close above $113,300 could pave the way for BTC to target the $115,000 level in the short term. Such a breakout would not only reinforce bullish momentum but also strengthen the case for a continuation of the broader upward trend. In the meantime, speculations are whether Bitcoin can hold onto its rebound or if resistance will once again prove too strong to overcome.

52215414,588435,1758754842,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52215414.jpeg,XRP And DeFi: The Roadmap That Tells It All,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-and-defi-the-roadmap/,"Ripple has unveiled the next phase of its roadmap for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in relation to institutional DeFi. The roadmap focuses on tokenization, privacy, and native lending, and plans to introduce more stablecoins on the network, which is a positive for XRP’s utility. Ripple Reveals Latest Roadmap For Institutional DeFi On The Ledger In a blog post , Ripple noted that tokenization remains the central enabler of the XRP Ledger’s institutional strategy. Therefore, plans are in place to introduce the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard by October on the network. The crypto firm explained that these MPTs are a flexible token standard that can carry essential metadata without relying on complex smart contracts. In relation to institutional DeFi on the XRP Ledger, Ripple noted that the MPT enables assets of bond issuers, money market funds , and structured products to be represented faithfully and traded natively on the network. The crypto firm further revealed that the next phase will enable the integration of MPTs into the DEX for easy trading, AMM liquidity pools, and cross-token payments. Furthermore, Ripple also plans to introduce a native lending protocol on the Ledger, which it described as the “most significant near-term milestone.” The lending protocol is set to go live in XRPL Version 3.0.0 later this year. The crypto firm said that the protocol introduces pooled lending and underwritten credit directly at the ledger level. Ripple remarked that the appeal of a native lending protocol on the Ledger is clear for institutions. The firm claimed that no financial institution will turn down low-cost capital if it can be sourced within KYC/AML standards . The protocol will pool liquidity from a global base of smaller investors into institutional-sized loans while maintaining compliance. For loan managers, this will be an opportunity to meet the rising demand for liquidity from TradFi by tapping into the growing crypto liquidity, specifically on the XRP Ledger. The Push For Programmable Privacy Ripple revealed that one of the XRP Ledger’s next major upgrades is programmable privacy . The firm noted that for financial institutions, full transparency doesn’t always work, but that privacy features must still meet compliance and auditability standards. The first privacy-focused application, confidential MPTs, is said to already be in development and is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of next year. These confidential MPTs will support privacy-preserving collateral management, which Ripple noted is a critical requirement for institutional adoption of tokenized finance . As a whole, the crypto firm indicated that the goal is to introduce more stablecoins, RWAs, lending, compliance tooling, and privacy directly at the protocol level at a global scale. Meanwhile, Ripple stated that over the last year, the Ledger has broken into the top 10 chains for RWAs and has reached its first $1 billion month in stablecoin volume. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.84, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Ripple|AMM Liquidity Pools|DeFi|DEX|KYC/AML Standards|MPTs|Multi-Purpose Token|ripple|ripple news|stablecoin|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|WALLET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-24 23:00:42

AML Software has filed a lawsuit against Athena Bitcoin, claiming that Athena conspired with Taproot Acquisition Enterprises and its CEO, Jordan Mirch, in a scheme to wrongfully obtain AML’s proprietary source code. Athena Bitcoin faces lawsuit over alleged source code theft Athena Bitcoin Global Inc., a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator , has run into legal trouble with the Illinois firm AML Software. AML Software filed a lawsuit accusing Athena Bitcoin of engaging in a scheme to steal its proprietary source code. The complaint was lodged on Tuesday in federal court and contains allegations of copyright infringement, trade secret theft, and other unlawful conduct. AML Software claims that its code is copyrighted and was never licensed for sale to Athena despite the company’s attempt to directly purchase AML’s code. The 16-page filing made allegations of collusion between Athena and Jordan Mirch, the CEO of Taproot Acquisition Enterprises. Mirch was implicated as the “motivating force” behind the alleged misappropriation and accused him of using fraudulent tactics to gain access to more than 3,000 ATMs still running AML’s software that Athena sought to acquire starting in 2023. The legal case involves SandP Solutions, which is a company that once operated 2,800 Bitcoin ATMs. After regulators barred SandP from operating in Ohio, the company faced mounting financial strain. The complaint alleges that Mirch seized the opportunity, securing SandP’s ATMs through “fraudulent misrepresentations and other unlawful conduct.” Once in possession of the machines, Mirch allegedly reached out to Athena to negotiate a transfer of both hardware and software. The lawsuit further claims that Mirch hired an AML developer as a consultant in an effort to wrongfully obtain AML’s existing copyrighted platform. Athena faces different customer protection lawsuit AML’s lawsuit also references a recent $9M settlement agreement involving Athena, Taproot, and associated entities. Under the terms, Athena announced earlier this month that it was gaining “immediate ownership of ATMs and source code,” while terminating a revenue-sharing deal with Taproot. AML, however, argues that the source code transferred under the agreement did not legally belong to Taproot or Athena, but to AML alone. Earlier this month, Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb filed a separate lawsuit accusing Athena of exploiting elderly customers through predatory practices . Schwalb alleged Athena profited from scams, charging up to 26% in hidden fees. Progressive Democrats have called for tougher consumer protections in the crypto sector.Senator Cynthia Lummis said Tuesday that she plans to address issues like those raised in the Athena case through forthcoming market structure legislation, co-sponsored with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.

On Wednesday in New York, nearly 500,000 fed funds futures contracts for September were traded, breaking a record set in April 2023 when Trump’s tariff news hit markets. The surge is happening while the effective fed funds rate quietly crept up to 4.09% on Monday. That single basis point move outside of a policy change was enough to rattle the futures market and raise red flags over overnight borrowing stress. Traders are responding to a tightening repo market, where firms borrow cash overnight in exchange for Treasuries, as month-end and quarter-end always bring more pressure, with shrinking bank reserves and more Treasury bills flooding the market. Traders expect spike in repo rates before month-end Scrutiny on the rate has jumped since July. That’s when Treasury started pumping out more bills, while the Fed kept slashing its balance sheet. Bank reserves are now falling. Some traders are warning this combo could lead to serious funding pressure at quarter-end. Dealers slow their repo activity to clean up their books, and that usually pushes up borrowing costs. Everyone’s trying to front-run that pressure. The bulk of the action in September futures happened during Asia hours, with two blocks of 50,000 contracts traded. That frenzy picked up again once U.S. markets opened, especially as traders eyed the effective rate possibly hitting 4.10% before the month wraps. For almost 20 years, U.S. funding markets were soaked in cheap cash. Not anymore. Now, rates on very short-term borrowing, used by banks and asset managers, are climbing. That’s because the Treasury is rebuilding its cash pile while the Fed keeps tightening. Meanwhile, use of the Fed’s overnight reverse repo tool, a barometer for excess cash, just fell to its lowest in four years. “We are seeing a level shift in funding,” said Mark Cabana of Bank of America. “Money funds no longer have excess cash to deploy to the RRP.” As more T-bills get sold, investors move money out of repo and into those bills, which is dragging demand down while pushing rates up.Interest-rate benchmarks tied to overnight repos are now sitting near the Fed’s interest on reserve balances rate, showing the strain. The spread between repo and the fed funds rate has widened to about 11.5 basis points, the biggest gap since April. That spread was under 10 basis points for most of July and August, before the new wave of T-bills hit. Fed weighs tools as collateral and reserves drop together Things may get worse fast. Corporate tax payments and new auctions are about to pull even more money from the system next week. That could upset the balance between cash and collateral — and banks already hold fewer reserves at the Fed. Those balances have fallen to around $3.15 trillion, and Fed Governor Christopher Waller has warned that $2.7 trillion is probably the floor for what counts as “ample.” Meanwhile, rates tied to overnight financing keep climbing, which creates a headache for the Fed’s quantitative tightening strategy, the balance sheet reduction started in June 2022 and is supposed to finish by year-end. But it’s getting harder to manage with rates rising and reserves shrinking. Roberto Perli, who runs the Fed’s securities portfolio, said the central bank’s short-term interest rate tools will become even more critical in times like this. The more efficiently they work, the less damage markets take. To avoid another 2019-style repo panic, the Fed now uses the Standing Repo Facility (SRF), letting eligible firms borrow cash by pledging Treasuries or agency debt. That facility charges a rate aligned with the top of the Fed’s target range, now at 4.5%. It saw its biggest usage at the end of June since being made permanent in 2021. But it hasn’t been tested under real stress yet. JPMorgan’s team said the SRF could contain spikes in repo rates, reducing the need to cut QT short. But others aren’t so sure. September is already looking shaky, and more volatility could force that debate to the front. Some Fed officials, including Waller and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, admit funding stress is building. But they’re not pushing for an early end to QT.

Senators Push For Probe According to the Wednesday letter , Slotkin and Warren want a probe launched into David Sacks and Steve Witkoff for allegedly “advocating for the United States to sell sensitive national security technology to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).” The Senate duo allege Sacks and Witkoff “played key roles” over the White House’s choice to ease AI system security restrictions in shipments sent to the UAE. However, the senators claim the two had not “disclosed their financial ties to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan,” UAE’s national security advisor. Trump Administration Ties Questioned By U.S. Lawmakers Slotkin and Warren say that Witkoff’s son, World Liberty Financial CEO Zach Witkoff, failed to recuse himself from U.S. decisions involving the UAE despite MGX – a state-owned investment firm controlled by Sheikh Tahnoon – investing $2 billion worth of WLF’s issued stablecoin , USD1, into Binance. The senators allege that Sacks and Witkoff “were in positions to control government decisions to personally enrich themselves – even as they created significant national security concerns.” “In the history of our country’s foreign policy, one is hard-pressed to find two senior officials with such significant conflicts of interest involved in decisions regarding national security,” Slotkin and Warren said. “Such unbridled conflicts of interest have no place in the U.S. government, and we urge you to undertake a swift and thorough evaluation of these allegations,” they added. “This information is also critical as Congress considers legislation for digital asset market structure and attempts to ensure that crypto corruption does not undermine our national security.” The post Senators Call For Probe Into Top Trump Administration Officials, appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Elizabeth Warren|Trump|World Liberty Financial,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BNB|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-24 23:28:45

Per the South Korean media outlet Electronic Times , the ruling party said the task force would “create policies that spur future growth.” South Korean Crypto Policy: Task Force Set to Meet Biz Leaders At a press event at the National Assembly on September 24, task force members said they plan to pass pro-business legislation before the end of the year. Han Jeong-ae, the Chair of the DP’s policy committee, said: “We need to establish a system that keeps pace with evolving trends in the new financial market.

(Source: @jongmun.lee.1/Facebook) The new unit will initially focus its efforts on stablecoin legislation, with lawmakers still to finalize their token issuance and distribution plans. But the DP’s plans will likely bring much cheer to South Korean crypto firms. The media outlet wrote that the lawmakers are “expected to focus on streamlining the system to foster industries.” It added that it would move away from existing crypto laws, which focus primarily “on operator regulation and user protection measures.” The lawmaker Lee Jeong-moon will head the task force. Members include the likes of Min Byoung-dug, the chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee and a vocal proponent of stablecoin-powered growth . The lawmaker Min Byoung-dug (center), ahead of legislative elections last year. (Source: @anyangminbest/Facebook) Task Force to Speak to Regulators, Central Bank The task force has already asked ministries and the top financial regulators (the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service) to come forward with policy proposals. The lawmakers have also asked the Bank of Korea to do likewise. They also plan to hold talks with companies in the sector, such as crypto exchanges and fintech companies. The task force said it would form an advisory group comprised of private sector experts. Lee said that the force’s goal was to roll out crypto-related legislation during the National Assembly’s final session of the calendar year. He explained: “We will treat the digital asset market as a new paradigm for the financial markets. Our goal is to develop policies that will foster future growth.” Han, meanwhile, lauded the government for its recent move to lift a ban on venture capital funding for crypto firms. She said the move would help revitalize the industry, and added: “We will communicate closely with the government and listen to and reflect diverse opinions from experts, financial institutions, crypto exchanges, and fintech companies.” The lawmaker Ahn Do-geol, another DP MP with a pro-business stance on crypto policy, stated: “The government must lead the way in financial innovation. We have already fallen a long way behind. We could miss out on the innovation and growth potential of the digital asset sector, including stablecoins .” Ahn concluded that lawmakers have “formed a consensus” on many crypto-related matters, with a general “bipartisan agreement” on stablecoins now in place.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/13-of-xrp-supply-could-be-taken-off-the-market-heres-why/,"Concerns are growing within the XRP community about a possible reduction in available supply, as new projects target large allocations of the token for staking and yield-bearing products. Digital Asset Investor (DAI), a well-known voice in the community, recently highlighted figures from both Axelar Network and Flare that, if realized, could remove billions of XRP from circulation. Ambitious Targets from Axelar and Flare Axelar Network recently introduced mXRP, a yield-generating asset that runs on both the XRP Ledger and its EVM Sidechain. In an interview with Crypto in America , Axelar Foundation co-founder Georgios Vlachos explained that the team measures success primarily by assets under management. So @axelar 's goal is to lock up 5% of the XRP circulating supply and @FlareNetworks 's goal is to lock up 5 Billion XRP. That's just two companies. Can you say supply shock?? pic.twitter.com/KBDahqMxfx — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) September 23, 2025 According to Vlachos, their goal is to reach $10 billion in XRP locked within the system. This figure translates to about 5% of the circulating supply. Similarly, Flare’s co-founder, Hugo Philion, set out his vision during an appearance on the Paul Barron Show. When asked about the expected growth of FXRP, Philion stated that he hopes to see 5 billion XRP secured on the Flare network by mid-2026. Combined, the objectives from both projects amount to roughly 8 billion tokens, which equate to approximately 13% of the current circulating supply. Current Progress Toward the Targets While the long-term goals are substantial, the actual progress so far is modest. Data shows that the mXRP product, which was formally launched at XRP Seoul 2025, currently holds about 3.851 million XRP. Of this amount, 2.786 million resides on the EVM Sidechain and the remainder on the XRP Ledger. When compared with the $10 billion target, this represents only about 0.006% of the total circulating supply. Nonetheless, since mXRP has only recently gone live, advocates argue that the project still has significant time to expand. Shrinking Exchange Reserves DAI’s warning about a possible supply crunch comes at a time when XRP balances on major exchanges appear to be decreasing sharply. Coinbase provides one example. In June, the exchange held around 970 million XRP spread across 52 cold wallets. By September 20, this figure had dropped dramatically to just 32 million XRP in two wallets. The sudden reduction has raised questions within the community, though Coinbase has not offered any public explanation for the shift. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Concentration of XRP Holdings Beyond exchange balances, a large proportion of XRP is already locked or controlled by key entities. Ripple retains control over 37.3 billion XRP in escrow and an additional 3.5 billion in liquid form. Co-founder Chris Larsen holds 2.3 billion, while Arthur Britto is estimated to control about 1.3 billion. Altogether, these allocations account for nearly 44.4% of the total token supply. Institutional interest is also beginning to emerge. For instance, Purpose ETF has disclosed holdings of 29.6 million XRP, while Canadian firm 3iQ manages approximately 45 million. Analyst 24HrsCrypto recently estimated that retail investors may collectively own no more than 15% of the circulating supply. According to 24HrsCrypto , the market could see even greater supply reductions once large financial institutions enter the space. Banks such as JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs are frequently mentioned as potential future participants. In addition, speculation continues about the possible approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds later this year, which could result in further tokens being moved into long-term storage. Although Axelar’s and Flare’s current holdings remain small relative to their ambitious goals, their stated objectives combined with declining exchange balances and institutional accumulation have intensified community discussions about a potential supply squeeze. If the projects achieve their targets, as much as 13% of circulating XRP could be removed from open markets, significantly reshaping the asset’s liquidity profile.

Now it says batteries have to follow. On Wednesday, during an auto industry event in Milan, Alfredo, the company’s European adviser, made it clear: if BYD is serious about making EVs locally, it can’t keep flying batteries in from China. The company’s factory in Hungary is almost ready and should start running by the end of this year. A second plant in Turkey is set for 2026. These two alone will give BYD the capacity to build about 500,000 cars a year in Europe. That’s a huge change from where the company started, which is with selling only electric cars in Europe. Now it’s adding plug-in hybrids to the mix, because European buyers seem to like the flexibility. BYD lays out the options for its next big move Alfredo said the company hasn’t decided what comes next. It’s weighing two options: a third car plant or its first battery facility in the region. Either way, BYD is not slowing down. “It does not make sense to invest in car assembly but bring batteries from China,” he told the audience in Milan. “Several factors come into play when choosing a new location,” Alfredo said , pointing to things like energy prices. “Energy cost is objectively one of the most important competitiveness factors,” he added, since both types of factories use a ton of electricity. Right now, the focus is on getting Hungary’s plant running at full speed. But BYD is already talking to governments across Europe about where it might set up its next base. The company says it wants all the EVs it sells in Europe to be built in Europe by 2027. That goal is meant to help the company avoid EU import tariffs. And for now, plug-in hybrids will likely dominate sales, according to Stella, the company’s EVP. Fully electric models are still part of the plan, but BYD sees hybrids as the near-term money maker. On top of all that, Alfredo had something to say about Warren Buffett. Last month, Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, finished selling its full stake in BYD after 17 years. Some thought that move meant he was losing trust in the company. Alfredo wasn’t having it. “Buffett made a profit of 20 times the capital he invested. He did very well to do what he did,” he said. “We’ve been extremely glad to have had Buffett, but the fact that he monetised his position is exactly what Berkshire Hathaway does for a living: buying, earning and selling.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|BYD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-24 23:41:57

However, the crypto community pushed back against his remarks, with many arguing that his analysis relied too heavily on short-term data. BTC Down 20% against Gold The economist dismissed Bitcoin in a September 24 post on X, stating it is “not living up to its hype.” He pointed out that the cryptocurrency has dropped 20% against gold since its August peak, a fall that he said means it’s in bear market territory. Schiff added that since the crypto asset is promoted as “digital gold,” the 20% drop terms is comparatively more than the 10% decline in dollar terms. Bitcoin recently experienced a sharp correction that dragged it more than 8% down from its all-time high of $123,800 on August 13 to a recent 13-day low of $112,200 on September 22. On the other hand, gold has continued setting fresh highs this year, climbing more than 11% over the past month. This isn’t the first time Schiff has made such claims. A few days ago, he predicted that the metal’s steady strength could set the stage for a breakout while it’s counterpart continues to slip. His view is supported by analyst Stockmoney Lizards, who pointed to a bearish rising wedge in the leading cryptocurrency’s pattern. The latter’s chart shows $112,000 as the immediate support level, with $110,000 identified as the critical threshold, which means that a break below that point could signal a deeper decline. Crypto Community Fires Back Crypto supporters have rejected Schiff’s bearish outlook, with people accusing him of not factoring in the digital asset’s long-term dominance. Some claimed he is “moving the goalposts” by measuring Bitcoin in gold, pointing out that the cryptocurrency is still up triple digits against the metal over the past five years. Others dismissed his argument that a 20% decline constituted a bear market, saying that “in crypto, calling a 20% dip a ‘bear market’ is like calling a drizzle a flood.” Another X user highlighted the leading digital asset’s long-term dominance, noting that over the past decade, gold priced in Bitcoin has collapsed by 99.3%, dropping from about 4.84 BTC per ounce in 2015 to just 0.033 BTC today. The 62-year-old has remained relentless in his bearish stance. According to the artificial intelligence platform Grok, he has made 237 separate predictions since 2011 forecasting Bitcoin’s crash, collapse, or eventual worthlessness.

Recently, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin underscored a critical point: safety is the absolute top priority for this pivotal network enhancement. This isn’t just about speed; it’s about building a robust and secure foundation for the decentralized world. Understanding the significance of the Fusaka upgrade helps us appreciate the meticulous planning behind Ethereum’s evolution. Why is the Fusaka Upgrade So Important for Ethereum? The Ethereum network is constantly evolving to meet the demands of a growing ecosystem. The Fusaka upgrade represents a significant step forward, primarily focusing on enhancing scalability and security. Buterin’s emphasis on safety highlights the careful approach core developers are taking to ensure the network remains resilient. At the core of this upgrade is a feature called PeerDAS. This technical innovation is designed to revolutionize how nodes interact with blockchain data. It’s not just a minor tweak; it’s essential infrastructure for the long-term health of Ethereum. Enhanced Scalability: PeerDAS will enable the network to handle more transactions efficiently. Improved Security: Nodes can verify and reconstruct blocks without needing to store all data, reducing the burden on individual participants. Future-Proofing: This feature is crucial for both Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling solutions, paving the way for broader adoption. Understanding PeerDAS: A Glimpse into Scalability What exactly is PeerDAS, and why is it so vital? PeerDAS, short for “Peer Data Availability Sampling,” allows Ethereum nodes to check if all data for a block is available, even if they don’t download the entire block themselves. Think of it like a smart sampling method. Traditionally, nodes would need to store every piece of data to ensure the network’s integrity. However, as Ethereum scales, this becomes increasingly impractical. PeerDAS addresses this by: Enabling light clients to participate more effectively. Reducing the hardware requirements for running a node. Ultimately supporting a more decentralized and robust network. This mechanism is a game-changer for how Ethereum manages its ever-increasing data load, directly contributing to the success of the Fusaka upgrade . Navigating the Blob Expansion: A Conservative Approach Another key aspect of the Fusaka upgrade involves increasing the number of “blobs.” Blobs are essentially temporary data packets designed to hold transaction data for Layer 2 rollups. They are crucial for improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these scaling solutions. Buterin stated that the number of blobs will be increased “conservatively at first.” This cautious approach underscores the commitment to safety. Rushing to expand blob capacity could introduce unforeseen risks, potentially compromising network stability. The gradual increase allows developers to: Monitor network performance in real-time. Address any potential bottlenecks or vulnerabilities. Ensure a smooth and secure transition for the entire ecosystem. This careful expansion is a testament to the development team’s dedication to making the Fusaka upgrade a success without compromising Ethereum’s foundational security. What Challenges Does the Fusaka Upgrade Address? The Fusaka upgrade is designed to tackle some of Ethereum’s most pressing challenges head-on. As the network grows, issues like transaction costs, processing speed, and data storage become more pronounced. This upgrade directly targets these areas. By implementing PeerDAS and carefully expanding blob capacity, Ethereum aims to: Reduce Transaction Fees: More efficient data handling can lead to lower gas costs for users. Increase Throughput: The network will be able to process a higher volume of transactions per second. Enhance Decentralization: Lower hardware requirements for nodes make it easier for more individuals to participate, strengthening the network’s decentralized nature. These improvements are not just technical advancements; they translate directly into a better user experience and a more accessible blockchain for everyone. The Road Ahead: Fusaka Upgrade Timeline and Impact Ethereum core developers have set a tentative date of December 3 for the Fusaka upgrade . While dates in blockchain development can sometimes shift, this target provides a clear indication of the project’s momentum. The successful deployment of the Fusaka upgrade will have far-reaching implications: It will solidify Ethereum’s position as a leading blockchain for decentralized applications. It will accelerate the adoption of Layer 2 solutions, making Ethereum more practical for everyday use. It reinforces the network’s commitment to continuous improvement and robust security. This upgrade isn’t just another technical milestone; it’s a foundational step towards a more scalable, secure, and user-friendly Ethereum ecosystem. In conclusion, Vitalik Buterin’s unwavering focus on safety for the Fusaka upgrade underscores Ethereum’s commitment to building a resilient and future-proof blockchain. With innovations like PeerDAS and a conservative approach to blob expansion, the upgrade promises to significantly enhance scalability, security, and decentralization. As the tentative December 3rd date approaches, the crypto community eagerly anticipates the positive impact this pivotal upgrade will have on Ethereum’s journey towards mass adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Fusaka upgrade? The Fusaka upgrade is an upcoming enhancement to the Ethereum network, primarily focused on improving scalability and security through features like PeerDAS and an increase in data blobs. Who is Vitalik Buterin, and what is his role in the Fusaka upgrade? Vitalik Buterin is the co-founder of Ethereum. He has emphasized that safety is the top priority for the Fusaka upgrade, guiding its development philosophy. What is PeerDAS, and how does it relate to the Fusaka upgrade?

This dramatic shakeout has left investors searching for opportunities amid the chaos, with many turning to best crypto presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as potential havens from mainstream market volatility. Market analysts suggest this liquidation event could mark a crucial reset point for the broader crypto ecosystem. Liquidation Tsunami Rocks Bitcoin Markets The September 2025 crypto market downturn began when more than $1.7 billion worth of leveraged positions were closed during a single 24-hour period. Bitcoin price reached $111,800 during the liquidation period, but it now trades at $112,863. Major exchanges experienced their largest-ever market collapse due to massive leverage liquidations, which reached unprecedented levels. The crypto market experienced its fourth-largest long liquidation in 2025 on Monday when Bitcoin prices reached their lowest point and $1.6 billion worth of leveraged positions got wiped out. The system accumulated dangerous speculative amounts which this data demonstrates. The exchange data shows that $1.6 billion worth of liquidated positions were long bets which indicates most traders held optimistic views about price increases. The market became exposed to massive liquidation waves because traders maintained excessive bullish positions until essential support levels failed. Major market cycles follow this specific pattern. Market euphoria leads to excessive leverage which creates conditions for price drops to trigger massive liquidation waves that exceed their initial causes. Technical Analysis Points to Critical Juncture Bitcoin price has reached its support zone between $110K and $112K while liquidation spikes indicate intense market volatility. Technical experts monitor these specific price points because they could serve as triggers for upcoming market trends. The 30-day volatility of BTC decreased to 1.33% which approaches its yearly minimum value just like the August beginning. The current market situation holds essential value for traders because this compression pattern typically leads to explosive price movements in any direction. The liquidation data shows that excessive leveraged positions have been removed from the market which might establish better technical market conditions. Market structure experts believe this type of market reset creates essential moments for crypto market cycles to shift direction. The liquidation event showed institutional-grade selling activity while professional investors started buying at lower price points. Major market bottoms show themselves through the distinct behavior of retail investors who panic while professional traders seek opportunities. Best Crypto Presale Projects Gain Attention As mainstream cryptocurrency markets face turbulence, investor interest in best crypto presale opportunities has surged. The cryptocurrency market in 2025 finds itself at a pivotal juncture, with investors increasingly focused on finding the best crypto presales. MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as a standout opportunity during this market reset. While Bitcoin and major altcoins face liquidation pressure, presale projects offer insulation from margin trading volatility that has plagued established markets. The appeal of presale investments during market shakeouts is straightforward. These projects aren’t subject to the leverage-driven volatility affecting exchange-traded assets. Additionally, early-stage pricing often provides better risk-reward profiles than buying established coins at elevated levels. Professional investors increasingly view presale opportunities as portfolio diversification tools. During periods of mainstream market stress, these alternative investments can provide uncorrelated returns that smooth overall portfolio performance. Hidden Gems Emerge from Market Chaos Investors seeking to uncover hidden gems should examine market disruptions, as they often generate the most promising investment opportunities. The market currently supports projects that integrate new technology with dedicated communities and established listing strategies. The current market situation favors projects with solid fundamentals over those based solely on speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE presents itself as a hidden investment opportunity that matches the criteria of emerging projects. The current market instability allows smart investors to identify new breakthrough projects which traders overlook while monitoring Bitcoin technical indicators and liquidation events. The project launch date matches the current market conditions. The market shift toward stable assets attracts institutional investors who support community-based projects that demonstrate practical uses. The market transition toward fundamental value discovery benefits MAGACOIN FINANCE because it moves away from speculative price movements. Quality projects find their best entry points during major market downturns which early-stage investors understand. The current market volatility presents an excellent chance for investors who want to move past surface-level price movements. Market Reset Creates Strategic Opportunities The $1.8 billion liquidation event demonstrates both the dangers and the resilience of the crypto market in the face of challenges. The event serves as a warning to investors about the risks of excessive leverage in their trading activities. The market will enter a new expansion period after this final period of market adjustment, according to some market participants. The professional investment community views this liquidation event as a necessary step to clean up the market. The removal of excessive speculation has created a more favorable environment for sustained market growth. The current market conditions support projects which deliver practical value and maintain active community involvement. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the best crypto presale investment because it allows users to access explosive market potential without facing the leverage-related dangers that have destroyed overleveraged positions. The fundamental elements of crypto adoption continue to advance despite short-term market price swings. The development of institutional infrastructure, alongside improved global regulatory frameworks and practical blockchain solutions in real-world applications, continues to advance. The fundamental growth factors operate independently of market price movements to drive long-term expansion. Investment Strategy During Market Uncertainty Experienced crypto investors capitalize on market shakeouts as an entry point, rather than rushing to sell their holdings. The current market situation favors investors who plan their moves instead of making impulsive trades. The strategic exposure of MAGACOIN FINANCE as a best crypto presale project enables investors to participate in the market. Strategic portfolio management through diversified investments in various project types and market capitalizations enables better navigation of market volatility. The technical challenges faced by Bitcoin and major altcoins create presale investment opportunities that provide distinct risk and reward dynamics for portfolio growth. Professional traders understand that liquidation events require them to stay patient, as markets tend to swing excessively in both positive and negative directions. The market tends to make excessive movements in both positive and negative directions which professional traders use to their advantage when others lose control. Conclusion The $1.8 billion liquidation event marks a significant reset point for cryptocurrency markets. While short-term volatility creates challenges, it also generates opportunities for strategic investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE and similar best crypto presale projects offer compelling alternatives to mainstream market exposure during uncertain times. Market cycles consistently reward those who position early in quality projects rather than chasing momentum in overvalued assets. The current shakeout creates exactly these types of opportunities for discerning investors willing to look beyond immediate headline volatility.

The Numbers Behind the Price Target,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-to-1-the-numbers-behind-the-price-target/,"The idea of Shiba Inu (SHIB) reaching a value of $1 continues to circulate within the crypto community, but closer examination of the numbers reveals that the target is largely unrealistic under current conditions. While some community leaders and market commentators maintain optimism, the scale of SHIB’s supply and current burn rates present significant obstacles. Community Sentiment and Predictions Price projections for SHIB vary widely, ranging from modest targets of $0.0001 to more ambitious levels such as $0.001 . The most extreme prediction, $1 per token, remains the most controversial. Supporters argue that strong utility growth combined with aggressive token reduction strategies could make the goal achievable. Lucie, Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, previously referenced external analysis suggesting that expanded adoption and accelerated burns could, in theory, support such a valuation. Why the $1 Target Is Unlikely The primary challenge is SHIB’s vast supply. Current data places the circulating supply at approximately 589.24 trillion tokens. With SHIB trading at $0.00001227, the token’s market capitalization sits around $7.14 billion. To reach $1, the price would need to climb more than 8 million percent, creating a market capitalization of roughly $589 trillion. For perspective, that figure is several times larger than the global economy and far beyond the entire cryptocurrency sector’s combined valuation, which is estimated at about $4 trillion. This mathematical reality underscores why analysts remain skeptical that SHIB can achieve a $1 price point without extreme changes in supply dynamics. Token Burn Efforts Shiba Inu has attempted to address the supply issue through token burns. Soon after its launch, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin removed approximately 410 trillion SHIB from circulation, reducing the total supply from one quadrillion to roughly 590 trillion. Since then, the community has continued to push for ongoing burns as a price support mechanism. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In practice, however, the burn rate has slowed. Monthly reductions have ranged between 13 million and 2.31 billion tokens, with daily activity often registering in the hundreds of thousands. At the current pace, it would take decades to bring the supply down to the estimated 7 billion tokens needed to support a $1 price with today’s market capitalization. Additional supply control efforts have come through Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain. The network converts part of its gas fees into SHIB and directs them to a burn wallet. Since its introduction in August 2023 , Shibarium has removed billions of tokens from circulation. However, Shibarium’s impact depends on the level of activity on the network. Transaction volumes have recently fallen to around 20,460 per day, a sharp drop compared to peaks of over 4 million daily transactions earlier in the year. This decline limits the scale of SHIB reductions that can be achieved through the mechanism. The $1 dream remains a central talking point for many SHIB enthusiasts, but the mathematics demonstrate that such a price level is not feasible without extraordinary supply cuts and broader adoption of Shibarium or other burn mechanisms. While community-driven burns and utility expansion efforts provide long-term potential, the gap between current realities and the $1 target is significant.

Drawing on historical price patterns and critical support levels, the analyst suggests that XRP could be on track for either a slightly conservative surge toward $9.6 or an explosive rally to $33. XRP Price Retest Signals Path Toward $9.6 In his post released on X social media, Egrag Crypto highlights XRP’s market behavior during the 2021 cycle, particularly the cryptocurrency’s interaction with the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and how it has played a role in fueling massive gains. At the time, XRP faced one of its most turbulent periods in its history. Related Reading: 8-Year Accumulation Phase Could Catapult XRP Price To $6 The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple had triggered a sharp drop, pushing the XRP price below the 21 EMA. This move disrupted the bullish structure that had supported XRP in earlier rallies, spreading uncertainty and fear across the market. However, XRP eventually managed to reclaim the 21 EMA and hold it as a critical support level. The chart analysis shows that after the cryptocurrency executed a successful retest, it staged a powerful rebound, driving its price up by approximately 414%. Applying this same percentage gain to XRP’s current market structure, the analyst presents his first bull rally scenario, projecting targets that point to a peak around $ 9.60. His chart analysis reveals that the current market setup resembles the key conditions observed in 2021, particularly with XRP’s recent retest of the 21 EMA on June 9 this year. The Altcoin Faces Potential Moonshot To $33 Egrag Crypto’s second scenario for the XRP price outlook is modeled after its explosive rally during the 2017 cycle, when the 21 EMA acted as a powerful launchpad for growth. At the time, XRP bounced off this key support level twice, paving the way for a remarkable 1,610% rally. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Major XRP Warning: Last Chance To Get In As Accumulation Balloons This breakout marked one of the most defining moments in XRP’s history, propelling the asset from sub-dollar levels to a fresh ATH around $3.84 at the peak of that bull cycle. If XRP repeats the 2021 cycle dynamics in 2025, Egrag Crypto forecasts that the measured move points to another 1,610% increase, potentially pushing the price to a more ambitious target of $33. Such a rally would represent one of the strongest performances in XRP’s history, firmly establishing it as a standout asset in the market. With the US SEC lawsuit finally concluded and XRP completing its third retest of the 21 EMA this year, the conditions are aligning for a potential surge toward $9.6 or $33. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.87, having declined in the past week by approximately 5%.

Recent proposals suggest that digital asset platforms operating in the country will soon face mandatory Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing requirements. This move signals a growing global trend towards establishing clear rules for the rapidly evolving digital finance sector. Why is Australia Embracing Mandatory Digital Asset Licensing? The Australian government’s draft regulation, as reported by Yahoo Finance, aims to bring much-needed clarity and protection to the digital asset space. The primary goal is to safeguard consumers and foster market integrity. Without proper oversight, the risks of fraud, scams, and market manipulation can be higher, eroding public trust in digital assets. This initiative seeks to level the playing field, ensuring that all platforms adhere to a baseline of operational excellence and accountability. It’s about creating a secure environment where innovation can still thrive, but not at the expense of user safety. Key Requirements for Digital Asset Platforms The proposed framework outlines several crucial obligations for platforms dealing with digital assets. These are designed to ensure transparency, security, and consumer recourse: Financial Services License: Platforms will need to obtain a specific financial services license, aligning them with traditional financial institutions. This ensures they meet stringent regulatory standards. Dispute Resolution System: A robust system for resolving customer complaints and disputes will be mandatory. This gives users a clear path to address issues, enhancing consumer protection. Minimum Standards for Custody: Platforms holding customer digital assets must meet specific standards for secure custody. This protects users’ funds from hacks, theft, and mismanagement. Payment Standards: Requirements for payment processes will be introduced, aiming to ensure efficient and secure transactions. This builds confidence in the operational reliability of these platforms. What are the Benefits of Robust Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing? While some in the crypto community might view regulation with skepticism, there are significant advantages to a well-structured regulatory framework. Firstly, it can dramatically boost investor confidence. Knowing that platforms are licensed and subject to oversight can encourage more mainstream adoption and institutional investment. Moreover, it helps in combating illicit activities. By requiring platforms to identify their clients and monitor transactions, the new rules can make it harder for bad actors to use digital assets for money laundering or terrorist financing. This ultimately strengthens the reputation of the entire digital asset industry. Navigating the Challenges of Digital Asset Licensing Of course, implementing such comprehensive regulations is not without its challenges. Smaller platforms and startups might face increased compliance costs, potentially hindering their ability to compete. There’s also the delicate balance of fostering innovation versus imposing overly restrictive rules. Regulators must work closely with the industry to ensure the framework is practical and forward-looking. Another challenge is the dynamic nature of digital assets themselves. The technology evolves rapidly, and regulations must be flexible enough to adapt without becoming outdated too quickly. The success of Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing will depend on its ability to strike this balance. What Does This Mean for You, the Crypto User? For individuals trading or holding digital assets in Australia, these proposed changes are generally positive. They promise a safer and more transparent environment. You can expect platforms to be more accountable, with clearer avenues for support and dispute resolution. This shift could lead to a more stable and trustworthy market, encouraging broader participation. It’s an exciting time as Australia moves to solidify its position in the global digital economy, demonstrating a commitment to responsible growth in the crypto space. The framework for Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing is a pivotal step. Conclusion: Australia’s proposal for mandatory digital asset licensing marks a pivotal moment for its crypto industry. By introducing clear regulatory standards, the nation aims to enhance consumer protection, foster market integrity, and build greater trust in digital assets. While challenges in implementation will exist, this proactive approach positions Australia as a leader in creating a secure and responsible environment for the future of finance. It’s a move that promises a more mature and reliable ecosystem for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of Australia’s proposed digital asset licensing? A1: The primary goal is to enhance consumer protection, ensure market integrity, and prevent illicit activities within the digital asset sector by requiring platforms to meet specific regulatory standards. Q2: Which platforms will be affected by these new regulations? A2: The regulations will primarily affect digital asset platforms operating in Australia that facilitate the exchange, custody, or payment services involving cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Q3: What are some key requirements for platforms under the new licensing? A3: Key requirements include obtaining a financial services license, establishing a robust dispute resolution system, and meeting minimum standards for the custody and payment processing of digital assets. Q4: How will these changes benefit crypto users in Australia? A4: Crypto users can expect a safer, more transparent, and trustworthy environment. Platforms will be more accountable, with clearer processes for dispute resolution and enhanced security for their digital assets. Q5: When are these new regulations expected to come into effect? A5: The proposal is currently in a draft stage. After public consultation and parliamentary processes, a final timeline for implementation will be announced.

To help investors navigate these emotional tides, we have the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This vital sentiment indicator currently stands at 44, signaling that “Fear” continues to hold sway among market participants. This reading, unchanged from the previous day, highlights ongoing caution. But what exactly does this specific number mean, and how can understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index empower your investment journey? What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Really Tell Us? Developed by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a clear snapshot of the market’s emotional temperature. It uses a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Intense anxiety, often leading to panic selling. 25-49: Fear – A cautious market, characterized by investor hesitation. 50-74: Greed – Growing optimism, typically fueled by rising prices. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoric sentiment, potentially indicating an overheated market. A score of 44 places us firmly in the “Fear” zone. This suggests that investors are generally wary, possibly holding back on new purchases or even considering selling due to concerns about potential losses. Recognizing this collective sentiment is crucial for making more objective investment decisions, rather than being swept away by market emotions. Unpacking the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: The Factors at Play The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s a sophisticated calculation combining six distinct market factors, each contributing to the final score: Volatility (25%): Measures Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. High volatility often signals an uncertain market, driving the index towards “Fear.” Market Momentum/Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volume and momentum. Strong buying volume indicates greed; low volume during a downturn suggests fear. Social Media (15%): Scans crypto-related posts for sentiment. Negative chatter can push the index towards fear. Surveys (15%): Historically, these polls captured direct investor sentiment. (Currently paused but a key factor in its design). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s market cap share. Rising dominance often implies investors are seeking safety in BTC, reflecting broader market fear. Google Search Trends (10%): Examines search queries like “Bitcoin crash.” Spikes in such terms indicate growing retail investor fear. These components collectively paint a comprehensive picture of market psychology, informing the daily reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . Navigating the ‘Fear’ Territory: Investor Strategies and Challenges When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals “Fear,” it presents both challenges and potential opportunities. Many seasoned investors recall the wisdom: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” This suggests that periods of market fear could be prime moments for strategic accumulation. Potential Opportunities: For long-term investors, “Fear” territory can offer chances to acquire assets at reduced prices. Historically, significant value has been found when market sentiment is low, provided the underlying projects have strong fundamentals. Key Challenges: Investing during fearful times demands strong conviction. The emotional pressure to sell or avoid buying can be intense, especially if prices continue to decline. It’s vital to differentiate between short-term market noise and genuine shifts in fundamentals. Actionable Insight: Employing Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is a smart strategy during periods of fear. By investing a consistent amount at regular intervals, you average out your purchase price over time. This mitigates the impact of short-term volatility, allowing you to build positions steadily even when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests caution. Remember, emotional decisions rarely lead to optimal outcomes. The index serves as a guide, not a definitive trading command. Beyond the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Balanced Perspective While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers valuable insight into market sentiment, it is just one tool in your analytical arsenal. Relying solely on any single indicator can lead to incomplete conclusions. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by numerous factors, necessitating a holistic approach. Consider these additional elements when evaluating the market: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global inflation, interest rate policies, and geopolitical events profoundly affect investor risk appetite across all asset classes, including crypto. Regulatory Developments: New legislation or government stances on digital assets can significantly alter market sentiment and price trajectories. Technological Advancements: Innovations in blockchain technology, new project launches, or major network upgrades can generate positive sentiment and drive adoption. Fundamental Analysis: Thorough research into a crypto project’s utility, development team, tokenomics, and community remains critical for long-term investment success. By combining the sentiment from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with a broader understanding of market fundamentals and external influences, you can forge a more robust and resilient investment strategy. In conclusion, the current 44 reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals a period of caution and uncertainty in the crypto market. While “Fear” can be a challenging environment, it has historically presented opportunities for disciplined investors who look beyond short-term volatility. Use this index as a valuable guide, but always complement it with thorough research and a comprehensive understanding of the market’s diverse dynamics. Staying informed and making rational, rather than impulsive, decisions are your best assets in navigating the exciting, yet unpredictable, world of cryptocurrency.

For those of us tracking economic trends and their ripple effects on the cryptocurrency landscape, this movement is particularly noteworthy. It signals potential shifts that could influence everything from trade to digital asset valuations. What’s Behind the South Korean Won’s Recent Dip? On September 25, the South Korean won experienced a notable weakening, trading past 1,400 against the U.S. dollar. This marks the first time since August 1 that the currency has crossed this threshold, with the exchange rate settling around 1,401.98, according to data from TradingView. This movement isn’t just a number; it reflects underlying economic pressures that are impacting a major Asian economy. Such a shift often indicates a complex interplay of global and domestic factors. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone looking to make informed decisions in the current economic climate. Why is the South Korean Won Under Such Pressure? The recent depreciation of the South Korean won is not an isolated event. Several key factors are contributing to this trend: Aggressive U.S. Interest Rate Hikes: The U.S. Federal Reserve’s continued efforts to combat inflation by raising interest rates have significantly strengthened the U.S. dollar. This makes other currencies, including the won, relatively weaker. Global Economic Slowdown Fears: Concerns about a potential global recession are dampening demand for exports. As an export-driven economy, South Korea is particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in international trade. High Energy Import Costs: South Korea is a net importer of energy. Elevated global oil and gas prices mean the country needs more U.S. dollars to pay for these essential imports, increasing demand for USD and weakening the won. Domestic Economic Concerns: Local factors, such as persistent inflation and rising household debt, also contribute to economic uncertainty, which can put downward pressure on the national currency. These combined forces create a challenging environment for the South Korean won , making it susceptible to further volatility. How Does a Weaker South Korean Won Affect Crypto Investors? South Korea boasts one of the most active cryptocurrency markets globally. Therefore, a weakening South Korean won has direct implications for crypto investors in the region: Increased Cost of Stablecoins: For investors holding won, buying U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT or USDC becomes more expensive. This can affect trading strategies and hedging costs. Potential for Capital Flight: If local economic confidence erodes significantly, some investors might seek to move their assets out of the won into perceived safer havens, potentially including cryptocurrencies. However, this also carries risks. Reduced Purchasing Power: A weaker won means that Korean investors have less purchasing power when acquiring international crypto assets priced in USD or other stronger currencies. While a weaker currency can sometimes spur interest in alternative assets like crypto as a hedge, it also introduces additional layers of risk and complexity for investors. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the market. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for South Korean Won Holders In times of currency volatility, thoughtful planning and risk management become paramount. Here are some actionable insights for both traditional and crypto investors impacted by the movement of the South Korean won : Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider diversifying across different asset classes and geographies to mitigate risks associated with single-currency exposure. Monitor Global Indicators: Keep a close eye on global economic data, particularly U.S. inflation and interest rate decisions, as these significantly influence currency markets. Understand Stablecoin Mechanics: If you are a crypto investor, comprehend how stablecoins maintain their peg and the potential risks involved, especially during periods of high fiat currency volatility. Practice Prudent Risk Management: Avoid making impulsive decisions. Implement stop-loss orders, manage your position sizes, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Regularly consume reliable economic news and analysis. Knowledge is your best defense against market surprises. The financial landscape is always evolving, and being prepared helps investors adapt to changing conditions. Conclusion: Vigilance in a Volatile World The recent weakening of the South Korean won past 1,400 against the U.S. dollar serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of global financial markets. From aggressive central bank policies to geopolitical tensions and energy prices, numerous factors influence currency valuations and, by extension, the broader investment landscape, including cryptocurrencies. For investors, particularly those in South Korea and those trading with the won, vigilance and a clear understanding of these economic forces are essential. While challenges exist, informed decision-making and a well-thought-out strategy can help navigate these turbulent waters. Staying updated on economic trends and their potential impact on both traditional and digital assets remains a top priority. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when a currency ‘weakens’ against another? When a currency weakens, it means you need more units of that currency to buy one unit of another currency. For example, if the South Korean won weakens against the U.S. dollar, it takes more won to buy one dollar. Q2: How do U.S. interest rate hikes affect the South Korean won? Higher U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors seeking higher returns. This increases demand for the U.S. dollar, causing it to strengthen and other currencies, like the won, to weaken. Q3: Is a weaker South Korean won always bad for the economy? Not necessarily. While it makes imports more expensive, a weaker won can make a country’s exports more competitive on the global market, potentially boosting export-oriented industries. Q4: Should crypto investors in South Korea be concerned about the won’s depreciation? They should be aware. A weaker won increases the cost of acquiring U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and international crypto assets. It also adds a layer of currency risk to their portfolio, making careful risk management even more important. Q5: What is TradingView and why is it mentioned? TradingView is a popular charting platform and social network for traders and investors. It’s mentioned as the source of the exchange rate data, lending credibility and transparency to the reported figures. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

While SOL has potential for growth, its upside is quite modest when compared to some of the newer projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is now presale for $0.035, is making headlines for its lending-and-borrowing protocol with DeFi emphasis, set to provide real-world adoption and scale-fit utility. Mutuum Finance is available for $0.035 at presale level 6. The protocol has exceeded more than $16.2 million in funds raised from more than 16,550 holders. With significantly lower price, the majority of investors believe that MUTM can return up to 25x, and this would be one of the top choices for investors seeking more solid returns in the year 2025. Solana Price Prediction Solana (SOL) is fluctuating around $231.50, holding ground below the critical $245–$250 resistance point. Analysts note that SOL will need a clear break above this level to build momentum towards its $270–$300 level that has been projected for Q4. Failure to break through resistance could have the asset stuck in the between $220 and $250 range, and overall market sentiment will be the determiner of whether higher levels are an achievable target. On the other hand, new project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being heralded as having improved growth opportunities. Strong Presale Performance Mutuum Finance has hit Stage Six of presale, with tokens selling at $0.035 after experiencing a 16.17% price increase from the previous round. Investor demand remains strong, with more than 16,550 participants and more than $16.2 million raised in capital. To strengthen platform security, Mutuum Finance is introducing a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The vulnerabilities are categorized into four types, critical, major, minor, and low, in order to ensure proper detection and fixing. The protocol uses strict control on collateralized assets to safeguard the system and participants. Controls take the shape of definite collateral ratios, caps on lending, and limits on deposits. Positions that are undercollateralized are rapidly closed, and call penalties and remediation fees are charged to ensure systemic stability. Building an Efficient Platform Efficiency is ensured through the optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, especially in cases of overcollateralized credit. Reserve requirements offer a buffer to dampen market shocks, while additional reserves may be employed for risk-absorbing purposes with risky assets. Mutuum Finance’s overall goal is to fundamentally transform the DeFi model on the premises of long-term sustainability, reliability, and inclusiveness. The project is not only building a secure lending and borrowing platform but also opening up a new era where decentralized finance becomes more accessible to retail and institutional investors. To encourage early adoption as well as community building, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway contest in which 10 winners will get $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. This initiative highlights the project’s commitment to rewarding its supporters while driving awareness and participation across the ecosystem. A key pillar of its capital model, Mutuum Finance employs a dynamic, liquidity-driven interest rate mechanism. This system ensures lending and borrowing are always in balance with shifting market conditions. When there is plentiful capital on the platform, borrowing rates are kept deliberately low, encouraging more use of funds available and driving market activity. By contrast, if liquidity is constricted, the cost of borrowing increases, and that incentivizes existing borrowers to repay existing loans and draws in fresh deposits as well. This self-reinforcing process creates a better, more sustainable climate that protects user interests, moderates liquidity streams, and weakens the overall protocol’s exposure during both periods of calm and turmoil in the markets. MUTM’s Early-Stage Upside vs. SOL’s Consolidation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction as investors look beyond Solana’s (SOL) price surge to $300. At $0.035 in Stage 6, MUTM has raised $16.2M from 16,550+ holders, with analysts predicting up to 25x returns based on its lower market cap and strong DeFi utility. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, strong collateral governance, and a $100K giveaway, the project combines security, efficiency, and adoption-fueled growth. Whereas SOL builds strength around $231.50 for a breakout, MUTM offers early investors better upside. Lock-in Stage 6 tokens now before the price rises in the next phase.

This movement signals a potentially exciting shift in the market dynamics, drawing attention to altcoins and their performance against Bitcoin. For many crypto enthusiasts, this rise in the Altcoin Season Index is a compelling indicator worth watching closely. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Mean? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for anyone tracking the broader crypto market. Developed by CoinMarketCap, this index serves as a barometer for altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. It helps us gauge whether the market sentiment favors altcoins or if Bitcoin continues to dominate. Here’s how the Altcoin Season Index is calculated: It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Stablecoins and wrapped coins are intentionally excluded from this calculation to provide a clearer picture of genuine market movements. The performance of these top 100 coins is measured against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. An altcoin season is officially declared when 75% of these top coins outperform Bitcoin within that 90-day window. Conversely, if Bitcoin is the dominant performer, it’s considered a Bitcoin season. A reading closer to 100 on the Altcoin Season Index indicates a stronger, more pronounced altcoin season. Is a Full-Blown Altcoin Season on the Horizon? With the Altcoin Season Index now standing at 72, many are wondering if we are on the cusp of a full-fledged altcoin season. While 72 is an impressive figure and a strong indicator of growing altcoin strength, it’s just shy of the 75-point threshold required for an official declaration. However, this upward trend is undeniably positive for altcoin investors. This recent four-point increase suggests a noticeable shift in capital flows and investor interest. People are actively exploring opportunities beyond Bitcoin, indicating a broadening of the market. This momentum could easily push the index past the 75-mark, potentially ushering in a period where many altcoins see significant gains. Therefore, staying informed about the Altcoin Season Index becomes even more vital. Navigating the Potential Altcoin Season: Benefits and Challenges A rising Altcoin Season Index brings both exciting opportunities and inherent risks for investors. Understanding these aspects is key to making informed decisions in a dynamic market. Potential Benefits: Higher Returns: Altcoins often exhibit higher volatility and, consequently, can offer greater percentage gains compared to Bitcoin during an altcoin season. Diversification: Investing in a variety of altcoins can help diversify a crypto portfolio, reducing reliance on a single asset. Innovation Exposure: Many altcoins represent groundbreaking technologies and use cases, offering investors a chance to support and profit from future innovations. Potential Challenges: Increased Volatility: While offering higher returns, altcoins are also prone to more significant price swings, leading to higher risk. Research Intensive: Identifying promising altcoins requires extensive research into their utility, team, tokenomics, and community support. Liquidity Issues: Some smaller altcoins might have lower liquidity, making it harder to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. The current movement of the Altcoin Season Index highlights the need for a balanced approach. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts As the Altcoin Season Index climbs, here are some actionable insights for navigating the evolving crypto landscape: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on hype. Thoroughly research any altcoin before committing capital. Understand its whitepaper, development team, and community. Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your funds into one altcoin, consider spreading your investments across several promising projects. This strategy helps mitigate risk. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear entry and exit strategies, and consider using stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, technical analysis, and, of course, the Altcoin Season Index itself. Market conditions can change rapidly. Even with a positive trend in the index, a disciplined approach remains paramount for long-term success in the crypto space. The recent rise in the Altcoin Season Index to 72 is undoubtedly a thrilling development for the cryptocurrency market. It suggests a potential shift towards altcoin outperformance, offering exciting prospects for investors willing to explore beyond Bitcoin. While the 75% threshold for an official altcoin season is within reach, it’s crucial to approach this period with both enthusiasm and caution. Diligent research, strategic diversification, and robust risk management are your best allies in harnessing the potential of a burgeoning altcoin market. The journey ahead promises to be dynamic, and the Altcoin Season Index will continue to be a key guide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric created by CoinMarketCap that measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. How is an Altcoin Season officially declared? An Altcoin Season is declared if 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) outperform Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. What does a high Altcoin Season Index reading, like 72, imply? A high reading, such as 72, indicates that a significant majority of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. While not yet an official Altcoin Season (which requires 75), it suggests strong momentum and growing interest in altcoins. What’s the difference between an Altcoin Season and a Bitcoin Season? An Altcoin Season occurs when altcoins largely outperform Bitcoin. Conversely, a Bitcoin Season happens when Bitcoin’s performance surpasses that of most altcoins within the top 100. Should I invest in altcoins if the Altcoin Season Index is high? A high Altcoin Season Index can signal favorable conditions for altcoins, but it’s essential to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and manage risks effectively. Market conditions can change rapidly, so informed decisions are crucial. Did you find this article insightful?

52219401,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84318,1758762018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Repeats Technical Cycle, Analyst Sets Bullish Price Target",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-repeats-technical-cycle-analyst-sets-bullish-price-target/,"XRP has recently declined below the $3 threshold, now trading near $2.8 in line with the broader weakness across the cryptocurrency market. Despite this pullback, several analysts remain optimistic about its long-term trajectory. Among them, EGRAG Crypto has highlighted recurring historical price structures that could guide XRP’s next major movement. Based on past cycles, he projects two potential targets: $9.6 or $33, depending on how current conditions unfold. Historical Performance and Key Levels EGRAG’s assessment is based on the two-week chart, which tracks XRP’s performance from 2014 to date. His analysis focuses on the 21-period exponential moving average (EMA), which has repeatedly acted as a pivotal support level. #XRP – 2 Scenarios Based on Historical Price Action ($9.6 – $33): If you're not yet familiar with the most likely outcomes, it might be time to catch up! Here’s a closer look at two pivotal cycles in #XRP 's history. 21 EMA Historical Support Levels 2017 Cycle: #XRP … pic.twitter.com/oE1MAMhsXA — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 23, 2025 In the 2017 cycle, XRP tested the 21 EMA twice before launching into a rapid upward trend. That sequence culminated in a gain of approximately 1,610%, bringing the token to around $3.31 by January 2018. By contrast, the 2021 cycle unfolded differently due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple . In December 2020, XRP briefly lost support at the 21 EMA, but once the price reclaimed and retested the level, it advanced by about 414%, reaching close to $1.96 in April 2021. Current Setup and Possible Long-Term Scenarios EGRAG points out that June 2025 marked another retest of the 21 EMA, when XRP fell to roughly $1.9. He argues that this event could be the start of a major upward move similar to those seen in previous cycles. From this point, two outcomes appear likely. If conditions mirror the 2017 pattern, XRP could record another 1,610% increase, driving prices toward $33 . Alternatively, if market behavior resembles the 2021 cycle, the token could rise by about 414%, leading to a price near $9.6. In either case, the assumption is that the rally would begin from the $1.9 level observed during the June retest. At present, XRP is trading around $2.95, still facing resistance at $3.31, which coincides with its 2017 peak. Volume data during these retests suggests that investor participation is strong, reinforcing the importance of these price zones for determining the next trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short-Term Market Outlook While EGRAG emphasizes long-term potential, other analysts are monitoring near-term behavior. Market commentator DustyBC has described XRP’s four-hour chart as stagnant, suggesting that sideways trading may continue until the asset breaks above a defined buying zone. He recommends patience, noting that this strategy helps avoid premature entries. Conversely, Casi Trades holds a more bullish short-term view. She recently identified a double-bottom formation near $2.70 following a sharp drop that she attributes to excessive leverage rather than sustained selling. Since that decline, XRP has reclaimed the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement at $2.79, which is now serving as support. Casi anticipates a potential retest of $2.79, combined with a bullish divergence on the relative strength index. If confirmed, this could trigger a Wave 3 rally with projected targets at $4.00 and $4.40, aligning with the 2.618 and 3.618 Fibonacci extension levels. However, she cautions that a breakdown below $2.70 would undermine this setup and could redirect the price toward $2.58, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. XRP’s price action remains closely tied to historical patterns and key support levels. While long-term projections suggest potential targets of $9.6 or $33, short-term movement will depend on whether the token maintains critical support zones and overcomes near-term resistance.

However, it remains above the 200-day moving average at $0.735, signaling that while sellers dominate in the short and medium term, the longer trend is still supported. ADA's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Daily charts show oversold signals with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 36.6, a negative Commodity Channel Index (CCI), and near-zero Stochastic RSI levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Soak Up Trillions From China And Russia, Billionaire Predicts Despite this, downside pressure persists, with ADA likely consolidating between $0.768 and $0.790 in the coming sessions. Momentum indicators remain neutral, suggesting that any rebound could be limited unless buying volume strengthens. Cardano ETF Optimism and Roadmap Fuel Longer-Term Outlook While ADA struggles in the near term, longer-term fundamentals look stronger. Odds for a Cardano-based ETF approval have surged to 9%, a development that could lift market sentiment and drive institutional adoption. The Cardano Foundation’s new roadmap also supports a bullish case, with significant funding allocated to decentralized finance (DeFi), governance, and ecosystem growth. Whale transactions have increased, and major firms like Reliance Global have added ADA to their treasuries, signaling growing institutional confidence. These developments could help ADA break above critical resistance at $0.868, the Ichimoku Kijun level, which analysts view as the threshold for confirming a rebound. Until then, traders may see sideways consolidation or slight downside risk. Short-Term Consolidation, Long-Term Potential According to market expert Anton Kharitonov of Traders Union, ADA remains technically vulnerable. “As long as Cardano trades below major resistance, the upside case lacks credibility,” he noted, adding that reclaiming $0.868 is essential for any sustainable rebound. For now, ADA’s immediate price corridor remains narrow, with a low probability of a breakout in the next five days. However, the long-term picture is brighter, with forecasts suggesting a potential climb toward $1.20–$1.38 within the next 6–12 months, supported by ETF optimism and institutional demand.

Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a prominent crypto analyst, drew attention to this, stating that $2.8 is now the most important support level for the digital asset. He attached a chart from Glassnode highlighting how XRP holders are distributed across various realized price ranges, with a particular concentration at the $2.80 level. $2.80 is the most important support level for $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/6sCz11GR91 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 23, 2025 Understanding the Chart Data The chart shared by Martinez displays XRP’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), partitioned at its all-time high . It illustrates how large portions of XRP holdings are associated with different historical price levels. The data reveals that more than 2.1 billion XRP, representing approximately 3.32% of the supply, is tied to $2.8. This makes that level a key zone of support where significant buying interest has been established. Considering the overall structure, the chart shows multiple points where XRP has notable concentrations of realized prices. These include areas around $0.33, $0.6, $1.64, $1.93, and other levels closer to $3. However, the $2.8 level stands out as one of the largest concentrations near the higher range, which indicates that many investors entered at this point. What the Analysis Suggests for XRP XRP is trading at $2.85 after bouncing off the $2.80 support. Holding above this level would signal strong support from existing holders and create a foundation for further advances . On the other hand, failure to defend this level could expose XRP to renewed selling pressure and potentially trigger a test of lower realized price zones. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The focus on realized price distribution offers a unique perspective because it measures actual positions taken by market participants rather than just speculative chart patterns. This allows for a clearer understanding of where major groups of investors may act, whether through buying to defend their entry levels or selling to limit losses. Possible Next Steps for XRP Should XRP sustain momentum above $2.8, attention may shift to the next significant resistance areas identified on the chart. These levels cluster around $2.95 and above $3, where another wave of historical entries exists. A move toward these prices would likely test the conviction of holders who entered near XRP’s prior peaks. Analysts have also drawn attention to XRP’s peak of $3.65, predicting double-digit targets if the asset can surpass this level . How the market reacts at these levels will provide further clarity on whether XRP can establish a stronger base for growth.

52219421,588172,1758762051,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52219421.jpeg,Stablecoins Recognized As Future Collateral: CFTC Opens Public Consultation,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoins-recognized-future-collateral-cftc/,"The US CFTC has launched an initiative to explore the use of stablecoins as collateral in derivatives markets, with public input open until Oct. 20th. CFTC Launches Initiative For Tokenized Collateral & Stablecoins In Derivatives As revealed in a press release , Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham has enacted an initiative for the use of tokenized collateral in derivatives markets. Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency, are set to play a role in the effort. “The public has spoken: tokenized markets are here, and they are the future,” said Pham. “For years I have said that collateral management is the ‘killer app’ for stablecoins in markets.” The initiative is part of CFTC’s “ Crypto Sprint ” announced at the start of August. Pham introduced it to implement recommendations from the President’s Working Group report on digital assets. The push mirrors the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) “ Project Crypto .” The President’s Working Group report asked the CFTC to “provide guidance on the adoption of tokenized non-cash collateral as regulatory margin.” The latest move comes in response to this recommendation and also builds on the regulator’s Crypto CEO Forum held back in February 2025. The Acting Chairman noted: At our historic Crypto CEO Forum, we discussed how innovation and blockchain technology will drive progress in derivatives markets, especially for modernization of collateral management and greater capital efficiency. The regulator has invited interested stakeholders to provide written feedback and suggestions on its website regarding the use of stablecoins as collateral in derivatives markets by October 20th. “The CFTC continues to move full speed ahead at the cutting edge of responsible innovation, and I appreciate the support of our industry partners,” added Pham. Stablecoins have been enjoying capital inflows recently, with their combined market cap sitting at the $294 billion mark today, a new all-time high (ATH). Below is a chart from DeFiLlama that shows how the market cap of these cryptocurrencies has changed during the last few years. From the graph, it’s visible that stablecoins have been in a phase of growth since 2024, with inflows only accelerating recently. During the past week alone, the market cap of these fiat-tied tokens has increased by over $4 billion.

The task force will foster growth in the crypto and blockchain sector by developing friendly policies. Its leaders unveiled the task force on September 24 in the National Assembly. They promised much quicker action, even suggesting that the country might pass its first pro-crypto regulations by the end of 2025. Han Jeong-ae, the policy committee chair, said South Korea needed a system to keep pace with global financial transformations. She added that they expected stable and sustainable innovation, noting that the first major focus would be stablecoin regulation. The token issuance and dissemination laws might be enacted even before the end of the year. One of the main arguments favoring this amendment is that it is required to spur investor interest and establish new business models. Representative Lee Jeong-moon will guide the task force’s work. He will work with Min Byoung-dug, the party’s Digital Asset Committee Chair, who has always insisted that stablecoins drive the next phase of financial innovation. The Democratic Party has offered a significant contrast to the previous laws, which focused on the exchanges’ activity and ensured that no user funds would be lost to hacking. This time, the party says it would instead like to see the industry grow while keeping a clear foundation for investor activity. Task force engages regulators and industry The lawmakers have reportedly cooperated with the most significant institutions, asking the ministries, the Financial Services Commission, and the Financial Supervisory Service to submit their proposals on what the new law should specifically contain. A representative of the Bank of Korea has also been invited to share his outlook on the matter. The task force seeks to involve the private sector, not just regulators. Organizers are also expected to seek guidance from crypto exchanges, fintech startups, and venture capital firms. There will also be a panel of advisors comprised of industry experts. Lee Jeong-moon said they were seeking to consider the digital asset market as a new way for people to carry out transactions. He added that the focus was on policies that would generate future growth. The DP has also expressed support for a ruling by the government to end the proscription of venture capital investments to crypto companies. Legislators say new funding could come soon to startups hamstrung by tight banking restrictions. Lee Jeong-moon said they were seeking to consider the digital asset market as a new way for people to carry out transactions. He added that the focus was on policies that would generate future growth. Lawmakers balance innovation with caution South Korea’s push for pro-crypto laws comes as debate over stablecoins heats up, with lawmakers eyeing won-based tokens to rival dollar-backed assets. In July, a similar bill allowing non-financial firms to issue won-denominated stablecoins was introduced in parliament. It was a huge step in opening Korea’s financial world. But the Bank of Korea has been cautious. This month, Deputy Governor Kim Woong-seok said regulated banks should be allowed to issue stablecoins gradually. He maintained that a more measured rollout would safeguard financial stability. The central bank has subsequently established a crypto oversight unit to help coordinate regulation. Analysts say the DP’s push for swift innovation could collide with the central bank’s conservative approach. The months ahead may determine whether South Korea can reconcile growth and safety. South Korea is one of the world’s most active crypto markets. Already among Asia’s top performers, South Korea boasts millions of retail investors who trade daily. The government has frequently been repressive, but new measures indicate a move from simply policing and supporting the industry. If the DP manages to push through new legislation by year-end, South Korea could be among the earliest major economies to enact a full-fledged stablecoin regime. Not only would this protect domestic firms, but it could also work to reinforce the country in the global digital economy. Get seen where it counts.

This substantial transaction, executed approximately six hours ago, according to astute on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, suggests a strategic maneuver by the prominent crypto investment firm. Such large-scale withdrawals from exchanges are often interpreted as a strong signal of accumulation, indicating a potential long-term bullish outlook or a specific strategic intent. What Does This Galaxy Digital ASTER Withdrawal Signify? The recent Galaxy Digital ASTER withdrawal isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a noteworthy event in the digital asset space. When an entity like Galaxy Digital moves a substantial amount of tokens off an exchange, it typically means they intend to hold these assets rather than trade them in the short term. This action reduces the immediate supply available on exchanges, which can influence market dynamics. Accumulation: The address associated with Galaxy Digital now holds a staggering 114 million ASTER tokens. This substantial holding points towards a deliberate strategy to build a significant position in ASTER. Long-Term Vision: Institutional players often withdraw assets for long-term holding, staking, or to utilize them within their own ecosystem for various financial products. Reduced Selling Pressure: Assets held off-exchange are less likely to be immediately sold, potentially easing short-term selling pressure on the token. This pattern is a common indicator that a major player sees considerable value or future potential in the asset. It’s a powerful signal that warrants closer examination by market observers. Understanding ASTER Token and Galaxy Digital’s Interest While the focus is on the withdrawal, it’s crucial to understand what ASTER token represents. ASTER, or Astar Network, is a dApp hub on Polkadot that supports EVM and WebAssembly. It aims to be a multi-chain smart contract platform, enabling developers to build various applications. Galaxy Digital’s consistent interest, as evidenced by this latest Galaxy Digital ASTER withdrawal , suggests they see significant promise in Astar’s technology and ecosystem. What might be driving this continued interest from a major institutional investor like Galaxy Digital? Ecosystem Growth: Astar Network’s development and increasing adoption within the Polkadot ecosystem could be a key factor. Technological Innovation: Its support for multiple virtual machines and focus on interoperability might appeal to institutional investors looking for scalable and versatile platforms. Strategic Partnerships: Galaxy Digital may have insights into upcoming developments or partnerships within the Astar ecosystem that are not yet public. These large-scale movements by institutional giants often precede periods of increased attention and potential growth for the underlying asset. Is This a Strategic Move by Galaxy Digital? Absolutely, it is highly probable that this Galaxy Digital ASTER withdrawal is part of a carefully considered strategy. Institutional investors like Galaxy Digital don’t make multi-million dollar moves without extensive research and a clear objective. Their actions can often serve as a bellwether for broader market sentiment and future trends. They might be: Preparing for Staking: Locking up ASTER tokens to earn staking rewards and participate in network governance. Integrating ASTER into Products: Potentially using ASTER in new investment products, funds, or services offered to their clients. Long-Term Bet: Viewing ASTER as a fundamental building block for the future of decentralized applications and Web3 infrastructure. The scale of their holdings, now at 114 million ASTER, underscores the depth of their conviction in the asset’s long-term value proposition. This is not a speculative day trade; it’s an investment in the future. What’s Next for ASTER and Crypto Enthusiasts? For individuals interested in the crypto market, Galaxy Digital’s actions provide valuable insights. While not financial advice, observing such institutional accumulation can be a catalyst for further personal research.

Recently, a significant development in the stablecoin space caught attention, involving Chinese fintech firm AnchorX and its much-anticipated yuan stablecoin , AxCNH. This clarification is not just a minor detail; it’s a crucial piece of information shaping how we understand the future of digital currencies and their global adoption. Clarifying the Yuan Stablecoin ‘s True Home: Kazakhstan, Not Hong Kong There was a ripple of confusion across the crypto landscape regarding the operational base of AnchorX’s AxCNH. Initially, various media outlets reported that this new yuan stablecoin was being issued out of Hong Kong. However, AnchorX has stepped forward to set the record straight and provide essential clarity. The company officially clarified that AxCNH, which is pegged to the Chinese yuan, operates under a license granted by Kazakhstan’s Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA). This statement directly addresses and corrects earlier misinformation, which had also led the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to deny any involvement. Initial Reports: Claimed Hong Kong issuance, leading to market uncertainty. AnchorX’s Clarification: Officially licensed by AFSA in Kazakhstan, ensuring transparent operations. HKMA’s Stance: Denied any connection to AxCNH’s issuance, reinforcing the need for accurate reporting. AnchorX secured the necessary approval to issue this innovative yuan stablecoin from Kazakhstan back in February. This move highlights a strategic choice in jurisdiction, underscoring the importance of a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in an increasingly complex global financial environment. Why Does the Yuan Stablecoin ‘s Jurisdiction Matter So Much? You might wonder, why is the exact licensing location for a yuan stablecoin such a big deal? The answer lies in trust, regulation, and the stability of the digital asset itself. The jurisdiction dictates the legal and operational environment in which the stablecoin functions, directly impacting its reliability and acceptance. Robust regulatory oversight provides several key benefits: Investor Protection: Clear rules and frameworks safeguard users from potential risks and fraudulent activities. Operational Transparency: Licensed entities often face stricter reporting requirements, ensuring accountability. Market Integrity: A well-regulated environment fosters confidence among users and institutions, promoting long-term stability. For a stablecoin like AxCNH, which aims to maintain a stable value against a major fiat currency like the yuan, robust regulatory backing is absolutely essential. It assures users that the asset is properly collateralized and that its operations are subject to scrutiny by a recognized financial authority, thereby building crucial trust. Kazakhstan’s AFSA: A Hub for Yuan Stablecoin Innovation? Kazakhstan, through its Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA), has been actively positioning itself as a forward-thinking jurisdiction for fintech and digital assets. AFSA operates within the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), which boasts an independent legal system based on English common law, providing a familiar and reliable framework for international businesses. This environment offers a distinct advantage for companies looking to innovate in the crypto space with regulatory certainty. AnchorX’s decision to seek approval for its yuan stablecoin here is a testament to AFSA’s progressive approach to digital asset licensing, signaling its commitment to fostering innovation within a regulated ecosystem. The February approval for AxCNH signifies AFSA’s commitment to fostering a regulated yet innovative ecosystem for digital currencies. This move could potentially attract other fintech firms seeking clear guidelines for launching similar financial products, establishing Kazakhstan as a key player in the global digital finance landscape. The Broader Implications of a Licensed Yuan Stablecoin The emergence of a properly licensed yuan stablecoin like AxCNH carries significant implications beyond just AnchorX. Stablecoins are crucial bridges between traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies, offering much-needed price stability in a volatile market. A yuan-pegged stablecoin can facilitate easier cross-border transactions involving the Chinese currency, potentially reducing friction and costs for businesses and individuals alike. It also opens new avenues for liquidity and financial innovation within the digital asset ecosystem, enhancing global connectivity. Potential impacts of AxCNH and similar stablecoins include: Enhanced efficiency for international trade and remittances, making global payments faster and cheaper. Increased adoption of digital currencies for everyday transactions, bridging the gap between crypto and mainstream commerce. Greater integration of the Chinese yuan into the global digital economy, reflecting its growing international importance. As the digital finance landscape matures, the demand for stable, regulated digital assets will only grow. AnchorX’s strategic licensing in Kazakhstan sets a precedent for how other global currencies might find their digital counterparts within clear, regulated frameworks, paving the way for a more integrated financial future. AnchorX’s clear statement regarding the licensing of its AxCNH yuan stablecoin in Kazakhstan is a pivotal moment for regulatory clarity in the crypto world. It underscores the critical importance of accurate information and proper jurisdictional backing for stablecoins. This development not only provides a stable digital asset pegged to the yuan but also highlights Kazakhstan’s growing role as a significant player in the regulated digital finance sector. As the industry continues to evolve, such transparent and compliant initiatives will be key to fostering trust and widespread adoption, ensuring a more secure and predictable digital financial ecosystem for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is AxCNH? AxCNH is a yuan stablecoin launched by the Chinese fintech firm AnchorX, meaning its value is pegged to the Chinese yuan (CNH). Q2: Where is AnchorX’s yuan stablecoin officially licensed? AnchorX’s yuan stablecoin , AxCNH, is officially licensed and issued under the regulatory oversight of Kazakhstan’s Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA). Q3: Why was there confusion about AxCNH’s licensing? Initial media reports incorrectly stated that the yuan stablecoin was issued in Hong Kong, a claim later denied by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and clarified by AnchorX. Q4: What is the significance of AFSA’s licensing for AxCNH? AFSA’s licensing provides regulatory clarity, investor protection, and operational transparency for AxCNH, establishing a trusted framework for the yuan stablecoin ‘s operations within a recognized financial center. Q5: How does a yuan-pegged stablecoin benefit the crypto market? A yuan stablecoin can facilitate more efficient cross-border transactions involving the Chinese currency, enhance liquidity in the digital asset ecosystem, and further integrate the yuan into the global digital economy.

Following a challenging security incident, UXLINK has delivered some urgent news: a dedicated UXLINK token swap portal is set to open its doors for on-chain users within the next five business days. This is a crucial step towards restoring stability and confidence for all involved. What Exactly Happened with UXLINK, and Why the Swap? Recently, UXLINK faced a significant hacking incident that impacted its token ecosystem. Such events can be unsettling for any project and its community, raising immediate concerns about asset security. In response, UXLINK moved swiftly. The team announced on X that they have successfully deployed a new UXLINK smart contract. Furthermore, they submitted a detailed incident report and a comprehensive migration plan to key regulatory bodies, including South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) and other major exchanges. The core reason for this rapid action and the upcoming UXLINK token swap is to isolate the compromised tokens and transition users to a secure, new contract. This ensures that the integrity of the UXLINK ecosystem is maintained. How Will the UXLINK Token Swap Portal Work for You? Understanding the process of the UXLINK token swap is key for all legitimate token holders. UXLINK has outlined a clear and straightforward plan to facilitate this transition: One-to-One Exchange: All existing, legitimate circulating UXLINK tokens will be swapped for new tokens on a direct one-to-one basis. This means your holdings will maintain their value relative to the new tokens. Exclusion of Illicit Tokens: A critical aspect of this recovery is that tokens illicitly issued by the hacker will be specifically excluded from the swap process. This prevents the attacker from profiting from their actions and protects the legitimate supply. Official Portal: The swap will occur through a dedicated portal. It is absolutely vital that users only engage with this official platform to perform their token swap. Always verify the source to avoid phishing attempts. This systematic approach aims to ensure a fair and secure migration for the entire community, paving the way for a more robust UXLINK going forward. Beyond the Swap: Addressing Stolen Assets and Future Compensation While the UXLINK token swap addresses the immediate need for a secure token, the incident also involved stolen assets. UXLINK has been proactive in tackling this challenge: Frozen Assets: The project confirmed that most of the stolen tokens have been successfully frozen. This is a significant achievement in limiting the hacker’s ability to liquidate or further distribute the illicitly obtained assets. Ongoing Monitoring: Despite freezing efforts, UXLINK acknowledged that some stolen tokens are still being traded. This highlights the persistent challenges in tracking and recovering digital assets post-hack. Compensation Plan: For victims who have suffered losses due to the hack, UXLINK has committed to arranging a separate compensation plan. Details on this plan will be provided in due course, demonstrating the project’s dedication to its community members affected by the incident. These measures collectively form UXLINK’s strategy for comprehensive recovery and support for its user base. Securing Your Assets: Your Role in the UXLINK Token Swap As UXLINK prepares for this crucial recovery phase, user vigilance is paramount. To ensure a smooth and secure UXLINK token swap , consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow UXLINK’s official channels (like their X account) for the exact date and link to the token swap portal. Do not rely on unofficial sources. Verify Links: Before clicking any links related to the swap, double-check that they are from UXLINK’s verified official sources. Scammers often create fake portals. Be Patient: The swap process will be clearly communicated. There is no need to rush or panic. Take your time to understand the instructions before proceeding. Never Share Private Keys: Legitimate platforms will never ask for your private keys or seed phrases. Be extremely cautious of any request for this information. By taking these precautions, you can help protect your assets during this critical period. The opening of the UXLINK token swap portal marks a pivotal moment for the project and its community. It signifies a robust response to a challenging incident, demonstrating UXLINK’s commitment to security and user trust. While the path to full recovery can be complex, this proactive step provides a clear direction forward. Users are encouraged to stay informed through official channels and participate in the swap to secure their assets and support UXLINK’s journey towards a stronger, more resilient future.

The trial, done with IBM’s Heron quantum processor, ran real, anonymized European bond trading data through the system, not fake models or simulations, and resulted in a major accuracy jump. That’s the first time any bank has used quantum to process real trading data at full scale. The test didn’t involve live trades, but it wasn’t theoretical. HSBC confirmed it was a production-scale demonstration. That means this wasn’t just another one of those tech tests that sit in a sandbox forever. This was finance in the wild, just without actual money moving. The bank believes this step sets the tone for how quantum will start creeping into daily financial systems worldwide. Banks build teams to extract real-world results The quantum test focused on over-the-counter bond markets, where trades happen privately between two firms, no exchange involved. These are harder to predict due to low transparency and fragmented data. That’s exactly why HSBC picked this use case. IBM’s Heron processor, the latest in its quantum lineup, handled the task by running calculations in parallel, unlike classical chips that go line by line. Philip Intallura, HSBC’s head of quantum tech, said , “Is this a ‘Sputnik moment’ for quantum? My instinct is yes.” He pointed to how this milestone could trigger a wave of fast-moving adoption. “It will create a flurry of activity,” Philip added, hinting that rivals will rush to close the gap. Josh Freeland, HSBC’s global head of algo credit trading, gave a glimpse into what was happening behind the scenes. He said the trial involved 16 experts (physicists, machine learning engineers, AI specialists) who were “working around the clock” to replicate what the chip had done. “If you could get something like this result every day, that would be quite something,” Josh said. He explained that in trading, even a single-digit gain, when repeated thousands of times, can move the needle in a big way. This tech push isn’t limited to HSBC. Other big names like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup are also pouring resources into quantum. In March, JPMorgan said it created and validated truly random numbers with a quantum computer built by Quantinuum. The bank claims this tech will help improve encryption, security, and maybe even trading systems. That work was later published in Nature, a top science journal. Meanwhile, Google’s Willow quantum chip, separate from the HSBC effort, solved a specific mathematical task in five minutes that classical supercomputers couldn’t solve in the entire age of the universe. That kind of speed is what has the financial sector throwing billions into quantum development, even if widespread rollout still seems distant. McKinsey expects banks to chase quantum profits Quantum revenue is expected to skyrocket to $72 billion in the next ten years, up from just $4 billion last year, according to consulting firm McKinsey. The report, published in June, lists finance alongside industries like life sciences and chemicals as key drivers. Henning Soller, who leads McKinsey’s quantum research in Frankfurt, said the tech’s value is clearest when it’s applied to pricing predictions. In finance, every percentage counts. “If one bank is able to start using quantum computing to develop a program, then the others will be developing it the next day and people will not sleep until they have it,” said Miklos Dietz, McKinsey’s senior partner in Vancouver. He didn’t hold back on what’s coming next. “When it comes, it will be explosive.” HSBC isn’t pretending the tech is perfect yet. But it believes it’s on the edge of something real. Philip said the work is proof that banks don’t have to wait five or ten years to see results. “We have great confidence we are on the cusp of a new frontier of computing in financial services, rather than something that is far away in the future.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

According to Bloomberg calculations, central and local authorities have only 16% — some 2.2 trillion yuan ($309 billion) — of their annual quota remaining, paving the way for the slackest fourth-quarter net supply since 2022. Bond supply shrinks as Beijing front-loads issuance The decline in issuance may help bring some balance and confidence to the bond markets, whose investors have become skittish with a proposal on the table to tax investment income and raise redemption fees for short-term funds. Yields betray the warning: The 10-year benchmark rate has risen 23 basis points this quarter, to roughly 1.88% as of Tuesday. “The significant supply shrinkage ahead will benefit market sentiment and help curb the ascent in bond yields,” said Zhou Guannan, analyst at Huachuang Securities, who expects the 10-year yield to fall to 1.7% by year-end. Beijing front-loaded much of its 2025 bond issuance to cushion a faltering economy, persistent property troubles, and escalating trade frictions following US tariff hikes. Bloomberg data show that bond sales in the first half of the year outpaced levels seen in the same period over the past three years. Easing pressure offers relief to skittish investors Officials say they favor a strategy of acting early, Finance Minister Lan Fo’an said this month, and wanted to seize the critical window,” and issue their policies decisively in one single action. Bloomberg compiled data that show that local governments have already issued almost all of their 2 trillion yuan quotas for special refinancing bonds to replace off-balance-sheet debt. Several pending deals are about to be completed, as the central government is scheduled to release its final tranche of 1.3 trillion yuan in ultra-long special sovereign bonds on Oct. 10, according to its published schedule. As the “predictable supply from the special bonds concludes, the market is better able to absorb the remaining, more regular issuance,” said Wei Li, head of multi-asset investments at BNP Paribas Securities (China). With supply expected to ease, Beijing may be able to expand debt programs and increase the bond quota — as it had done in recent years — if growth lags its target of about 5%. However, economists are expecting only modest steps, as China has already pushed up its annual budget deficit to a decade high in response to lingering economic problems. China’s fiscal strategy stands apart from global peers Some investors are adjusting allocations. U-Shine Private Equity FD Mgt Co., which holds one of the biggest caches of 30-year sovereign notes, is gradually adding to its position as yields will slide on better supply dynamics and a potential rate cut, said Xu Yongbin, co-chief investment officer. Market expectations for reduced bond supply stand in contrast to those of developed economies. In the US, Japan, and Europe, longer-dated bond yields have soared as investor concerns mount over fiscal sustainability and widening budget deficits. According to BNP’s Li, China’s fiscal and supply outlook looks stronger than that of many developed markets, with the government taking a cautious approach that prioritizes optimizing existing funds instead of further expanding debt.

Recently, the GAIN token community experienced a **devastating token exploit** that saw an attacker make off with a significant sum, leaving investors reeling. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the ever-present security challenges within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. What Exactly Happened in This GAIN Token Exploit? Approximately two hours before the news broke, an attacker successfully executed an unauthorized mint of five billion GAIN tokens. This wasn’t just a small transaction; it was a massive injection of new tokens into the market without proper authorization. Following this illicit mint, the attacker promptly sold these newly created tokens, triggering a dramatic chain of events. Massive Price Plunge: The sudden influx and sale of five billion GAIN tokens caused the token’s price to plummet by an alarming 95%. This rapid depreciation wiped out significant value for legitimate holders. Significant Profit: On-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa confirmed that the attacker secured a staggering $3.01 million in profit from this dump. Funds Transfer: To obscure their tracks and move the illicit gains, the attacker is reportedly transferring these funds to other major networks, including Solana and Ethereum, utilizing deBridge for cross-chain transactions. It’s worth noting that Binance Alpha had only recently added GAIN to its listings on September 24, making the timing of this **token exploit** particularly unfortunate for new investors. Understanding the Mechanics: How Does an Unauthorized Token Exploit Occur? An unauthorized mint is a critical vulnerability, often stemming from flaws in a smart contract’s code. In essence, the attacker found a way to bypass the intended minting controls, allowing them to create new tokens out of thin air. This is akin to a counterfeiter printing money without the central bank’s approval, severely devaluing the legitimate currency. The core issue typically lies in: Access Control Weaknesses: The smart contract might have insufficient checks to prevent unauthorized accounts from calling the minting function. Re-entrancy or Logic Bugs: Complex interactions within the contract could be exploited to trick it into minting more tokens than allowed. Owner Key Compromise: Though less common for minting exploits, a compromised private key of the contract owner could also grant minting privileges. Such a **token exploit** highlights the absolute necessity of rigorous smart contract audits and continuous security monitoring for any DeFi project. Safeguarding Your Assets: Lessons from the GAIN Token Exploit While project developers bear the primary responsibility for securing their protocols, individual investors also have a role to play in protecting their assets. The GAIN incident offers valuable lessons: Perform Thorough Due Diligence: Before investing in any new token, especially in the volatile DeFi space, research the project’s team, its smart contract audit reports, and its community. Look for transparency and a track record of security. Understand the Risks: DeFi is an innovative but high-risk environment. Be aware that even audited projects can have undiscovered vulnerabilities. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Monitor On-Chain Activity: Tools and analysts like ai_9684xtpa provide crucial insights. Following reputable on-chain monitors can offer early warnings of suspicious activities. The Broader Impact of a Token Exploit on DeFi Trust Every **token exploit** like the one affecting GAIN chips away at investor confidence in the broader DeFi ecosystem. These incidents can deter new users and capital, slowing down innovation and adoption. Projects must prioritize security, implementing multi-layered defenses and robust incident response plans. Moreover, the ease with which funds can be transferred across networks via bridges like deBridge, while a benefit for liquidity, also presents a challenge for tracking and recovering stolen assets. Collaboration between exchanges, blockchain analytics firms, and law enforcement becomes paramount in such scenarios. The GAIN token incident is a somber reminder that the promise of decentralization comes with significant security responsibilities. As the crypto space matures, the industry must collectively work towards creating more resilient and secure protocols to prevent future **token exploit** events and protect investor interests.

What exactly happened to the GAIN token? An attacker performed an unauthorized mint of 5 billion GAIN tokens, then immediately sold them. This caused the token’s price to crash by 95%. 2. How much profit did the attacker make from this token exploit? The attacker secured approximately $3.01 million in profit from selling the illicitly minted GAIN tokens. 3. What does “unauthorized mint” mean in the context of a token exploit? An unauthorized mint occurs when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in a smart contract to create new tokens without proper permission or beyond the intended supply limits, effectively printing money out of thin air. 4. How can I protect my crypto assets from similar token exploits? Always conduct thorough due diligence on projects, check for reputable smart contract audits, understand the inherent risks of DeFi, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay informed by following on-chain analytics and security alerts. 5. Are the stolen GAIN funds recoverable? While blockchain transactions are public, recovering stolen funds is often challenging due to the attacker’s use of cross-chain bridges (like deBridge to Solana and Ethereum) and various obfuscation techniques. Recovery efforts typically require collaboration between affected projects, exchanges, and law enforcement. Did you find this article informative?

The committee confirmed the date in a notice first reported by Eleanor Terrett, and witnesses lined up include Jason Somensatto, Policy Director at Coin Center; Andrea S. Kramer, founding member of ASKramer Law; Lawrence Zlatkin, Vice President of Taxation at Coinbase; and Annette Nellen, Chair of the Digital Asset Taxation Working Group under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. This hearing is meant to address a problem that’s pissed off crypto users for years, which is why every small crypto transaction, even a few dollars, triggers a tax headache. The Senate is being pushed to finally look at de minimis exemptions, which would let people use crypto for daily stuff (like grabbing a coffee) without reporting every damn thing to the IRS. Trump administration backs small crypto tax relief Cryptopolitan reported back in July that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt had said that the Trump administration still wants to push through the de minimis exemption in upcoming laws. “The president did signal his support for de minimis exemption for crypto and the administration continues to be in support of that,” Karoline said. She explained that right now, using crypto for basic purchases is too complicated because of tax rules, but a change could make everyday payments smoother. “We are definitely receptive to it to make crypto payments easier and more efficient for those who seek to use crypto as simple as buying a cup of coffee — of course, right now, that cannot happen, but with the de minimis exemption perhaps it could in the future.” Karoline also revealed that President Trump plans to host a signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-focused bill expected to pass soon. That bill is part of his administration’s broader goal to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the world.” The Senate has already tried and failed to deal with this issue before. In 2020, two Democratic lawmakers proposed the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act, which aimed to ignore tax on crypto gains below $200. It didn’t even make it to a vote. A similar version in 2022 also died on the floor. Then came a broader bill in 2025 called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which covered everything from taxes to border control. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming, tried to get a crypto exemption added in for gains under $300, but that proposal got scrapped before the final bill passed. President Trump signed it into law on July 4 without the crypto language attached. Right now, the IRS says every single crypto transaction must be reported, even if there’s no gain or the amount is tiny. If you spend $5 of bitcoin, that’s a taxable event. The idea behind the de minimis exemption is to cut through that nonsense and give users room to breathe. But it hasn’t been easy. Lawmakers face real obstacles. First, the federal government depends on tax income. If it suddenly lets millions of small crypto transactions go untaxed, that means less money coming in. And there’s no sign yet of how they’ll offset that shortfall. Even with strong voices like Cynthia and Jason in the room, the Senate still hasn’t landed on a solution. October 1 might give them a chance to do something useful. Or it might be another meeting where everyone talks and nothing happens. Get seen where it counts.

The agreement , known as the Canada-Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), was signed in Ottawa on Wednesday by Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. It is Canada’s first bilateral trade agreement with an ASEAN country, so it is a historic milestone for both countries. The agreement comes as both countries try diversifying trade in light of global uncertainty. Skyrocketing US tariffs and friction with China have made new economic alliances more urgent than ever. Under the agreement, more than 95% of Canada’s exports to Indonesia will be duty-free when the deal is fully implemented. It will provide Canadian businesses, from farmers to clean energy developers, with new access to one of the fastest-growing markets in Asia. The agricultural sector will be the first beneficiary, according to Canada’s Trade Minister Maninder Sidhu. Canadian wheat, soybeans, and potash are already going to Indonesia, but the agreement will clear more room for processed foods, high-tech agri-products, and value-added goods. Sidhu told reporters that the opportunities created by the deal cut across sectors, ranging from agriculture to energy. He explained that Indonesia’s population of 280 million makes it a massive market that Canadian companies are eager to serve. And the deal opens the door to investment in nuclear power. Canada’s technology in small modular reactors could even be used to help Indonesia expand its power and, at the same time, keep a lid on emissions. Indonesia secures access and investment growth Beyond goods, the CEPA establishes rules for digital trade and intellectual property. Officials say it will provide an easier and more predictable environment for Canadian technology multinationals to do business in Southeast Asia. Canada’s Global Affairs department reported last year that Indonesia was the country’s largest export market in Southeast Asia and its second-biggest destination for known direct investment in the region. Export Development Canada is now preparing to provide up to CAD 825 million in financing to the Indonesia Investment Authority. This is expected to assist in financing large-scale projects in infrastructure, energy, and digital industries, EDC vice-president Franco Sciannamblo said. The business community is also pleased to note that a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the Business Council of Canada and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to help companies from both countries to benefit from trade initiatives. Canada pursues broader strategy in Asia This CEPA agreement is part of a larger Canadian strategy for Asia. Ottawa, which takes three-quarters of Canada’s exports, has taken steps to conclude trade agreements with Asian countries outside of China to diminish US dependence. In addition to Indonesia, Canada is considering a partnership with ASEAN to launch a regional agreement over time. Canadian officials emphasized that ASEAN’s closer ties can help strengthen Canada’s position in one of the globe’s fastest-expanding areas. Meanwhile, Indonesia is carving out its place in the world. Just this week, Jakarta announced that a nearly decade-long trade negotiation with the European Union had been completed . The EU and Canada deals represent a dramatic shift in Indonesia’s trade strategy as it seeks to assert itself as a linchpin of global supply chains. The CEPA and similar ones will not become effective immediately. The deal requires domestic ratification in both countries for it to take effect. The official hopes to complete this process by 2026. Once it does, trade between the two nations, valued at some $4 billion last year, is anticipated to increase sharply. Analysts said the deal could catalyze a new wave of Canadian businesses in Asia and increase market access for Indonesian goods in North America.

This milestone marks the beginning of a broader expansion for the XRP Ledger, positioning it as a serious player in the race to blend global liquidity with everyday usability. Why A Native Stablecoin Matters For XRP The recent launch of the first native stablecoin for XRP on the Flare Network marks a significant development for the XRP ecosystem. Onur, a trader and ambassador to NEARProtocol and Somnia_Network, has mentioned on X that the new stablecoin is designed to provide extra utility for XRP and create new liquidity rails for holders. It is worth noting that this initiative is part of Flare Network’s broader strategy to expand the utility of FAssets adoption. Related Reading: XRP Price Stability Signals Opportunity – Is a Fresh Breakout on the Horizon? Onur also drew attention to the stablecoin design, which is based on a battle-tested collateralized Debt position (CDP) and stability pool model. He also sees this as a first step toward a more self-sustaining DeFi layer on Flare, where liquidity is generated natively rather than depending solely on external assets. Onur concludes by expressing his curiosity about the level of demand from XRP holders for liquidity without selling for this new product. Based on a new report highlighted by a technical analyst, ALLINCRYPTO, Ripple is positioning the XRP Ledger as a top-tier platform for institutional DeFi. In addition, the report reveals significant milestones, including securing over $1 billion in monthly stablecoin volume and ranking among the top real-world asset tokenization activities. Meanwhile, the report also confirms that zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are currently being developed for the XRPL to strike a balance between user privacy, regulatory compliance, and scalability. Major Analysts Are Now Targeting XRP An Italian crypto expert, Fabio Zuccara, has drawn attention to a shift in the market’s perception of XRP, referencing bold price predictions from major market voices on Wall Street. These forecasts, which place XRP’s potential value between $10,000 and $35,000, are not mere random speculation. Related Reading: $480 Million In 2 Weeks? XRP Whale Movements Could Reveal The Next Price Direction Zuccara’s core argument is that the adoption of XRPL for RWAs is poised for an explosion. He points to the $653.39 trillion global real estate market, which is preparing to migrate onto the XRPL through Real token. The token was launched with a phase one supply of just 100 million tokens, with a remarkable 80% already burned. Specifically, this extreme scarcity creates the foundation for a massive supply squeeze. Zuccara illustrates this with a compelling calculation that if a mere 1% of the $650 trillion market flows through the XRPL, the value of the Real token could surge from its current price of $0.023 to $64,500. However, this kind of supply shock could unfold overnight, positioning the REAL Token as the premier RWA and DeFi asset on the XRP Ledger.

52221425,588490,1758765633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52221425.jpeg,Strategist Publishes Bitcoin ‘Cheat Code’ As Factors That Led To Previous ATHs Return,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-cheat-code-published/,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price action is once again under scrutiny as historical indicators that preceded past All-Time Highs (ATHs) have reappeared. A recently published Bitcoin “cheat code,” by a crypto strategist, points to cyclical markers that have perfectly aligned with every major rally in the past. With BTC currently trading above $112,500, traders are watching closely as the same setup that triggered explosive runs in previous bull markets comes back into play. A Closer Look At The Bitcoin “Cheat Code” Crypto strategist, CrypFlow, shared a new technical analysis of Bitcoin in an X social media post on Monday. The analysis focuses on the Bitcoin (2M) SNAB Relative Strength Index (RSI) chart, which he describes as the core “cheat code” for identifying cycle tops and bottoms. He explained that the 73 level on this indicator has been the heartbeat of every major Bitcoin bull market move since 2013. When the RSI is below 73, it has historically acted as resistance, preventing BTC from moving higher. But once Bitcoin reclaimed that level, the RSI transformed into powerful support, triggering massive rallies that culminated in new all-time highs . Every cycle from 2013, 2017, and 2021 followed the same rhythm: a reclaim of the 73 level, a sustained rally to fresh highs, and eventually a breakdown from the extreme purple line near the 98 level that signaled the ultimate cycle top . CrypFlow stated that the current market cycle appears to be repeating this pattern, with the same SNAB RSI indicator flashing for Bitcoin. After previously forming a double bottom , the cryptocurrency surged to reclaim the critical level, mirroring setups from past bull market cycles. Looking ahead, the crypto strategist confirms that BTC is yet to reach its final cycle top, despite its record-breaking run and new ATH this year . As with past bull cycles, the final exhaustion point is expected only when RSI loses strength from its overheated levels near 98. Until then, the analyst’s confidence in his Bitcoin cheat code remains high, with signals still pointing to significant upside potential. Bollinger Band Squeeze And RSI Cross Spark Momentum Setup In a follow-up analysis, CrypFlow highlighted another recurring chart signal—the Bitcoin (1W) Bollinger Bands squeeze combined with a bullish stochastic RSI cross. This pairing has reportedly been a reliable trigger point for Bitcoin’s upward momentum throughout the current cycle. Historically, the pattern begins when the Bollinger Bands tighten around the price, indicating reduced volatility and an increased likelihood of a breakout. Each time this squeeze has coincided with a bullish stochastic RSI cross , CryptoFlow notes that Bitcoin has launched into a fresh upward swing. This was the case during previous surges from mid-2023 through 2025, with each squeeze setting the stage for significant price rallies. Right now, the setup is flashing once again. CrypFlow highlights that Bollinger Bands have compressed, and the stochastic RSI has just confirmed another bullish cross.

From late 2023 through mid 2025, the region’s on-chain value received rose sharply, climbing from about $81b a month in mid 2022 to a peak near $244b in Dec. 2024, and holding above $185b per month this year, according to a Chainalysis report published Wednesday. Japan is now the standout. On-chain value received rose 120% in the 12 months to June 2025, outpacing South Korea , India and Vietnam . Growth follows rule changes that treat more tokens as investment instruments, planned updates to crypto taxation, and the licensing of the first yen-backed stablecoin issuer. With stablecoin listings beginning to loosen, traders channeled heavy volumes into XRP, then BTC and ETH, while markets watch how USDC and JPYC gain traction. In our next preview chapter of the 2025 Geography of Crypto Report, we explore APAC's acceleration as the world's fastest-growing crypto region.

It leads APAC in total on-chain value at about $338b dollars, supported by UPI rails, a large diaspora that uses crypto for remittances, and young investors who trade for supplementary income. Industry groups are helping normalize usage, while authorities build clearer oversight without stifling fintech growth. South Korea’s market looks distinctly professional. Nearly half of on-chain activity sits in the $10,000 to $1m band. The 2024 Virtual Asset User Protection Act is reshaping exchange practices, and growing USDT and KRW stablecoin pairs have lifted volumes. Image Source: Chainalysis Policymakers are debating KRW-backed stablecoins, with rules expected to address issuance, distribution and secondary trading. Tighter Supervision In Australia Sets The Stage For Institutional Entry Vietnam shows everyday utility. Crypto supports remittances, gaming and savings, reflecting wide grassroots adoption. Activity has matured, which explains slower percentage growth compared with Japan, yet usage remains deeply embedded in daily flows. Australia is laying foundations. Steps to modernize AML and CFT rules and to clean up inactive exchange licences point to tighter supervision and a more durable market structure. That groundwork matters as institutions seek clearer counterparties. Hong Kong and Singapore continue to shape policy in different ways. Hong Kong’s Policy Statement 2.0 accelerated local activity by signalling a path for regulated trading. Singapore’s measured stance has shifted flows toward stablecoins, which now surpass bitcoin pairs as institutions use them for payments, liquidity and hedging. Across APAC, monthly on-chain value received climbed from about $81b in July 2022 to that Dec. 2024 peak. Volumes eased afterward but stayed high through mid-2025. The region frequently ranks second to Europe and at times outpaces North America, underscoring its growing influence on global flows. Beyond Trading, New Use Cases Keep Volumes Elevated Into 2025 Market triggers were clear. Late 2023 and early 2024 produced the first months above $100b as prices recovered. Q4 2024 delivered the top prints, helped by a global risk rally. The trend persisted into 2025 even as prices cooled, pointing to broader use cases beyond trading alone. APAC’s diversity is the driver. Japan’s reform cycle, India’s digital public infrastructure, Korea’s trader centric market, Vietnam’s everyday use, Australia’s compliance push, and the twin hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore together create multiple paths to adoption. That mix also buffers the region. When trading slows in one market, remittances, payments or treasury activity sustain volumes elsewhere. As rules continue to harden, APAC’s role as a bellwether for how crypto will be used at scale looks set to grow.

As of this week, it hit its most overbought level in 45 years, with a monthly RSI of 89.72. That’s the highest RSI for gold since 1980. Anyone who follows charts knows that anything above 70 usually signals overbought territory. So, near 90? That’s insane. And this is happening on a monthly chart, which means the trend’s been cooking for a while. The rally’s been brutal and steady. This year alone, gold has surged 43%, driven by falling real yields, global instability, and central banks shoveling gold into reserves like it’s running out. Traders are glued to the charts right now. This level of RSI doesn’t pop up often, and when it does, a correction usually follows. Some are already bracing for a short-term pullback. But for now, this metal isn’t cooling off. Traders rush into ETFs as gold keeps climbing On Friday, gold-backed ETFs added 27 tonnes in a single day. That’s the biggest spike since January 2022 and more than double the daily average this year. It triggered a 0.9% surge in ETF holdings, the biggest one-day jump in over two years. Bloomberg says those holdings have grown almost every month in 2025, except May, adding close to 400 tonnes total. Traders are going all in. This push has lined gold up for its sixth straight weekly gain, the longest winning streak since February. It’s turning into a historic run. At the same time, silver’s moving too. The largest silver ETF, $SLV, saw daily options volume jump to 1.2 million shares on Friday. That’s the highest since April 2024. On Tuesday, silver touched $44 an ounce, while spot gold held steady at $3,760.70 as of 8:16 a.m. in Singapore. Platinum barely moved. Palladium ticked lower. But the real action’s all on the yellow metal. Fed rate cuts and Trump’s NATO comments heat up the gold trade The Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points a week ago, dragging real yields down even further, as Cryptopolitan previously reported. Naturally, that has pushed even more investors into non-yielding assets like gold. Inflation’s still sticking around, fiscal deficits are rising, and tensions across Europe and the Middle East haven’t let up. Central banks haven’t missed the party either. They’ve been stacking gold this year like their lives depend on it. That demand hasn’t let up, and it’s kept support under prices. Now, there’s even talk that gold could hit $5,000 by the end of the year. Traders are watching the U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index this week. That’s the Fed’s favorite inflation metric. If it slows down again, that could mean more cuts are coming, and more support for gold. On the political front, President Donald Trump, speaking during a UN General Assembly meeting in New York, said NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace. When asked whether Ukraine can still win the war, Trump said, “Yes, I do.” Those comments dropped straight into the middle of already tense global markets. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index stayed flat, giving no help to the greenback. That’s just one more reason traders are clinging to gold. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

In a move that has caught the attention of analysts, ten major whale addresses collectively pulled an astounding 210,452 ETH, valued at approximately $860 million, from prominent exchanges like Kraken, Galaxy Digital OTC, BitGo, and FalconX. This substantial outflow, reported by Lookonchain, suggests a potentially crucial shift in market dynamics. Such large-scale movements by powerful market players often provide valuable insights into upcoming trends and investor sentiment. Understanding these actions is key for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. What Do These Significant ETH Whale Withdrawals Mean? When large holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ move substantial amounts of cryptocurrency off exchanges, it typically indicates a change in their strategy. These particular ETH whale withdrawals represent a significant portion of Ethereum’s circulating supply being taken out of immediate trading environments. Historically, such movements can signal several things, from increased confidence in the asset’s long-term value to preparation for specific off-exchange activities. Moreover, these withdrawals are not merely transactions; they are strategic decisions with potential ripple effects across the entire market. They offer a glimpse into the mindset of those who hold substantial influence. Reduced Selling Pressure: By removing ETH from exchanges, these whales are effectively reducing the supply available for immediate sale, which can alleviate short-term selling pressure. Accumulation Phase: It could indicate that these large investors are accumulating ETH, believing its price will appreciate significantly in the future. Self-Custody Preference: A growing trend among savvy investors is to move assets to personal wallets for enhanced security, away from potential exchange risks. Why Are Investors Opting for ETH Whale Withdrawals Now? Several factors might be influencing these large-scale ETH whale withdrawals . One primary reason could be the desire for greater security. Holding assets on an exchange always carries inherent risks, including potential hacks or regulatory uncertainties. Moving ETH to cold storage or self-custody wallets provides investors with full control over their funds, mitigating these concerns. Furthermore, these withdrawals could be linked to participation in Ethereum’s staking ecosystem. By withdrawing their ETH, whales might be preparing to stake their assets to earn rewards, thereby contributing to the network’s security and decentralization. Another possibility involves over-the-counter (OTC) deals, where large transactions are executed directly between parties, bypassing public exchanges to minimize market impact and price slippage. What Are the Potential Market Implications of These ETH Whale Withdrawals? The implications of such substantial ETH whale withdrawals are far-reaching for the broader crypto market. Firstly, a decrease in exchange supply often leads to a perception of scarcity, which can contribute to bullish sentiment. If demand remains constant or increases while supply on exchanges diminishes, upward price pressure may build over time. Secondly, these actions can serve as a strong signal to smaller investors. When major players demonstrate conviction by holding assets off-exchange, it can inspire others to follow suit, further strengthening market confidence. However, it is also crucial to consider that these movements do not guarantee immediate price appreciation. Market sentiment and broader economic factors always play a significant role. Short-term Volatility: While often bullish long-term, large movements can sometimes precede short-term volatility as the market digests the news and speculators react. Indicator of Health: Consistent outflows, especially during market dips, can be seen as a sign of underlying strength and growing institutional interest in Ethereum. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Landscape of ETH Whale Withdrawals The recent ETH whale withdrawals of $860 million from major exchanges are undoubtedly a significant event in the Ethereum ecosystem. They highlight a strategic decision by powerful market participants, potentially signaling a move towards greater self-custody, increased staking, or the execution of large private deals. For investors, monitoring such on-chain metrics provides valuable insights into the intentions of institutional and high-net-worth individuals, helping to inform personal investment strategies. While the immediate impact is always subject to broader market forces, these withdrawals generally paint a picture of long-term conviction rather than short-term speculative selling. Staying informed about these crucial movements is essential for anyone navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

Frequently Asked Questions About ETH Whale Withdrawals What is an ETH whale? An ETH whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Ethereum, typically enough to influence market prices with their transactions. Why do whales withdraw ETH from exchanges? Whales withdraw ETH for various reasons, including enhanced security through self-custody, participation in staking, executing over-the-counter (OTC) deals, or simply accumulating for long-term holding. Does withdrawing ETH always mean the price will go up? Not necessarily immediately. While withdrawals can reduce selling pressure and signal bullish sentiment, market prices are influenced by many factors. However, consistent outflows often suggest long-term confidence. How can I track ETH whale withdrawals? On-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain (as mentioned in the article), Glassnode, and CryptoQuant specialize in tracking and reporting such large movements of cryptocurrency. What is the difference between withdrawing and selling ETH? Withdrawing ETH means moving it from an exchange to a personal wallet, retaining ownership. Selling ETH means exchanging it for fiat currency or another cryptocurrency on an exchange. Did you find this analysis of ETH whale withdrawals insightful?

Consider the following steps to get ready: Fund Your Account: Deposit KRW, BTC, or USDT into your Upbit wallet before 1:00 p.m. UTC. Understand Order Types: Familiarize yourself with market orders, limit orders, and stop-limit orders to execute your trades effectively. Monitor Market Conditions: Keep an eye on XPL’s price action on other exchanges (if listed) and general market sentiment.

Recent reports reveal a dramatic decline in South Korean crypto holdings , indicating a notable reallocation of investor capital. This trend comes as traditional equities experience a strong resurgence, prompting a closer look at what’s driving this market movement. What’s Behind the Steep Decline in South Korean Crypto Holdings? Data from the Bank of Korea’s September Financial Stability Report, cited by Newsis, shows a substantial reduction in virtual asset holdings among South Korean investors. By the end of June, these holdings had fallen to 89.2 trillion won (approximately $64.6 billion). This represents a significant 27% decrease from their peak of 121.8 trillion won ($88.3 billion) at the end of January. The decline in South Korean crypto holdings directly correlates with a robust rally in the domestic stock market, including the KOSPI. Virtual asset deposits also dropped sharply, from 10.7 trillion won ($7.8 billion) to 6.2 trillion won ($4.5 billion) in the same period. Why Are Investors Shifting from Crypto to Stocks in South Korea? The primary reason for this pronounced shift appears to be the strong performance of the domestic stock market. As equities rally, they present an attractive alternative for investors seeking returns, often perceived as more stable than the volatile cryptocurrency market. Booming Equity Market: The KOSPI’s strong rally naturally draws capital, as investors chase potentially higher returns in traditional assets. Risk Reassessment: Following periods of significant crypto volatility, some investors may seek assets with lower perceived risk. Macroeconomic Influence: Broader economic conditions and investor sentiment favor established markets over emerging digital ones. This rebalancing of portfolios indicates a change in investor sentiment towards digital assets, as South Korean crypto holdings adjust to the evolving financial landscape. The Impact on South Korean Crypto Holdings and the Market Landscape The substantial reduction in South Korean crypto holdings carries broader implications for the nation’s digital asset ecosystem. A sustained outflow of capital could affect local crypto exchanges, potentially leading to reduced trading volumes and slower innovation. It also raises questions about future regulatory frameworks. For individual investors, this trend highlights the importance of a balanced investment strategy. While cryptocurrencies offer unique opportunities, their inherent volatility means that diversification remains a crucial principle. Understanding broader market cycles is essential for informed decision-making. Navigating Volatility: What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? The experience of South Korean crypto holdings offers valuable lessons for investors globally. It underscores the dynamic nature of financial markets and the constant interplay between different asset classes. Consider these actionable insights: Diversify Wisely: Avoid concentrating all investments in one asset class. A diversified portfolio, including both traditional and digital assets, helps manage risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with both crypto market trends and broader economic news. Assess Risk: Understand your personal comfort level with risk and align your investments accordingly. This dramatic shift in South Korea provides crucial insights into investor behavior and market dynamics. In conclusion, the significant decrease in South Korean crypto holdings , fueled by a thriving stock market, marks a pivotal moment for the country’s financial sector. It highlights the cyclical nature of investment preferences and the enduring appeal of traditional assets during periods of equity market strength. Understanding these shifts is crucial for all investors navigating today’s complex markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused the 27% fall in South Korean crypto holdings? A strong rally in the domestic stock market (KOSPI) attracted funds away from virtual assets. 2. How much did virtual asset deposits decrease? Deposits dropped from 10.7 trillion won ($7.8 billion) to 6.2 trillion won ($4.5 billion). 3. Is this trend unique to South Korea? While specific to South Korea, reallocation of funds between asset classes based on market performance is a common global trend. The scale here is noteworthy. 4. What should investors learn from this shift in South Korean crypto holdings? Prioritize diversification, stay informed about market trends, and regularly assess risk tolerance for informed decisions.

Recent headlines suggest that retail adoption is shifting from niche to mainstream. Russia’s largest online retailer, Wildberries, has introduced crypto payments in Belarus via Whitebird, the nation’s first licensed exchange. Rather than direct transfers, customers buy electronic certificates with BTC, ETH, or USDT, which are then redeemable on Wildberries’ platform. JUST IN: Russia's e-commerce giant Wildberries now accepts #Bitcoin and crypto payments from Belarus. Bullish pic.twitter.com/UlDCjRc3Fq — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 24, 2025 The program remains in pilot mode, but authorities expect Belarus to process as much as $3 billion in crypto payments by the end of 2025. That surge in adoption could underpin long-term demand for Bitcoin. Corporate Bets on Bitcoin Beyond retail, corporate interest is surfacing again. Chinese EV charging firm Jiuzi Holdings shocked market participants with a plan to allocate up to $1 billion into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. The proposal, aimed at hedging against economic volatility, briefly sent Jiuzi’s stock soaring 47% before reality set in.

Still, the announcement highlights a broader trend: more companies are considering crypto as part of their treasury strategies. Meanwhile, Kraken has pledged $2 million to U.S. political groups pushing for clearer regulation. The donation, split between America First Digital and the Freedom Fund PAC, reflects growing industry efforts to secure legal clarity. Technical Outlook for Bitcoin (BTC/USD) From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has slipped into a descending channel after peaking at $117,800 earlier this month. The rejection at $115,185 coincided with a short-term “death cross,” where the 50-period SMA crossed below the 200-period SMA. Momentum has shifted toward sellers, with RSI hovering near 45, suggesting weakness but not capitulation. The immediate resistance stands at $114,025, while $112,000 forms critical short-term support. A break below could expose the $111,095 and $109,771 levels. Traders, however, should remain alert for bullish signals. A rebound from $111,000, confirmed by a bullish engulfing candle or positive RSI divergence, could trigger a breakout from the descending channel. That scenario would open upside targets back toward $115,200 and $116,600, with momentum potentially building into the final quarter of 2025. Key Takeaway: With retail adoption expanding in Belarus, corporates allocating billions to crypto, and regulatory clarity advancing in the U.S., Bitcoin is quietly laying the groundwork for another leg higher. A well-timed rally toward $116,000 remains in play if technical conditions align with these macro tailwinds.

The proposal requires exchanges and other operators to secure an Australian Financial Services Licence. Firms that fail to act honestly and fairly, or that engage in misleading conduct and unfair contract terms, would face the greater of three penalties, A$16.5m (US$10.9m), three times the benefit gained, or 10% of annual turnover. These rules build on existing anti-money laundering obligations overseen by AUSTRAC and complement the Australian Taxation Office’s scrutiny of crypto transactions for capital gains tax. Consultation Period Set To Shape Rules For Industry Heavyweights The ATO can already impose fines worth up to three times the amount evaded or pursue prison terms in cases of serious breaches. The draft law will remain open for consultation until Oct. 24. It marks one of the most significant moves yet to regulate an industry that includes major global players such as Coinbase and Kraken. Australia’s regulators have repeatedly warned about the risks of surging retail crypto investment. The nation’s securities and prudential watchdogs, as well as the central bank, have pressed for tougher standards. In August, financial crimes agency AUSTRAC ordered Binance’s local arm to appoint an external auditor over money laundering and terrorism financing concerns. @binance faces mandatory audit in Australia over serious AML and terror financing concerns amid nationwide enforcement campaign. #Binance #Australia https://t.co/lVsofJm6gC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 22, 2025 New Rules Extend Corporations Act To Digital Asset Platforms Treasury said the new regime will bring digital asset and tokenized custody platforms under the Corporations Act, extending consumer protections and formal licensing requirements. Smaller players will not face the full burden. Platforms that hold less than A$5,000 per customer and process under A$10m in annual transactions will be exempt. The effort reflects a balancing act, with policymakers seeking to protect investors without stifling innovation. Industry feedback over the next month will shape the final framework before it moves toward parliament. Separately, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission last week granted class relief to intermediaries distributing stablecoins issued by licensed AFS providers. The measure, which runs until June 2028, exempts them from separate market, clearing and settlement licences when handling stablecoins from approved issuers. The relief is the first of its kind in Australia, signalling regulators’ willingness to provide flexibility where oversight is already embedded in existing financial licences.

Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a monumental ASTER whale accumulation event. Two distinct whale addresses made headlines by amassing a staggering 118 million ASTER tokens, a haul valued at an incredible $270.8 million. Understanding the Massive ASTER Whale Accumulation This substantial acquisition, initially brought to light by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, represents a considerable portion of ASTER’s total supply. Specifically, these two addresses now control 7.13% of the entire circulating supply of ASTER. Such a concentrated ownership by a few entities can have profound implications for a token’s market dynamics. Magnitude of the Acquisition: 118 million ASTER tokens. Value at Time of Report: Approximately $270.8 million. Circulating Supply Impact: Represents 7.13% of ASTER’s total circulating tokens. Following this news, ASTER’s market performance saw an immediate positive reaction. According to CoinMarketCap, ASTER was trading at $2.25, marking an impressive 8.86% increase. This surge suggests that the market interpreted the significant ASTER whale accumulation as a strong bullish signal, indicating confidence from major investors. Why Does Large ASTER Whale Accumulation Matter to Investors? When whales make such substantial moves, it often captures the attention of the wider crypto market. Their actions can influence sentiment and price trends. Here’s why this particular ASTER whale accumulation is significant: Market Confidence: Large purchases by whales often signal their belief in the token’s future potential, which can inspire smaller investors. Potential for Price Swings: Whales have the capital to significantly move prices. Their buying can drive prices up, while selling could lead to downturns. Liquidity Impact: Removing a large percentage of tokens from the open market can reduce liquidity, potentially making the remaining supply more volatile. However, it is crucial for individual investors to understand that while whale activity can be a powerful indicator, it does not guarantee future price movements. Market dynamics are complex, influenced by numerous factors beyond just large holder actions. Who Are These Crypto Whales Behind the ASTER Accumulation? The identities behind these two whale addresses remain anonymous, a common characteristic in the pseudonymous world of blockchain. While we cannot pinpoint specific individuals or institutions, their actions provide valuable insights. These could be: Early Investors: Long-term holders who are increasing their positions. Institutional Players: Investment funds or large corporations diversifying their portfolios. Strategic Traders: Entities executing a specific trading strategy based on market analysis. Regardless of their identity, the sheer volume of this ASTER whale accumulation underscores a strategic play. It suggests a calculated move rather than impulsive trading, likely based on thorough research and a strong conviction about ASTER’s underlying value or future development. Navigating the Market: What Can You Learn from ASTER Whale Accumulation? For everyday crypto enthusiasts and investors, observing whale movements can offer valuable lessons, but it requires a balanced perspective. Do not blindly follow every large transaction. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Conduct Your Own Research: Always perform due diligence on any cryptocurrency project. Understand its technology, use case, team, and roadmap. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your capital into one asset, even if whales show interest. Diversification helps mitigate risks. Understand Market Cycles: Whale accumulation often happens during periods they perceive as undervalued. Learning to identify these cycles can be beneficial. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Volatility is a constant in the crypto market. The recent ASTER whale accumulation serves as a potent reminder of the significant capital at play in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the powerful influence it can wield. While intriguing, it is one piece of a much larger puzzle that shapes the market. Compelling Summary: The Ripple Effect of Whale Activity The accumulation of $270.8 million in ASTER tokens by two whale addresses, representing over 7% of the circulating supply, is undoubtedly a headline-grabbing event. This substantial move highlights the conviction of major players in ASTER’s potential, contributing to its recent price surge. For investors, understanding such large-scale transactions is key to grasping market sentiment and potential trends, yet it also emphasizes the importance of independent research and prudent risk management in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.

52223487,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=826538,1758769224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52223487.jpeg,The ‘Once A Decade’ Bitcoin Moment No One Sees Coming,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/once-a-decade-bitcoin-moment-no-one-sees/,"A closely watched crypto commentator known as plur daddy (@plur_daddy) has resurfaced with a macro thesis that places Bitcoin and gold at the center of an approaching policy inflection—arguing that President Donald Trump’s push to assert greater control over US monetary policy could catalyze a liquidity wave that undermines the dollar and forces institutional participation in alternative stores of value. The remarks arrive as global policymakers debate the use of Russia’s immobilized reserves to backstop new loans to Ukraine and as gold trades near record highs, sharpening the contours of a market regime in which Bitcoin increasingly trades as a function of liquidity and institutional credibility rather than a halving-linked “four-year cycle.” Trump’s Fed Takeover Could Supercharge Bitcoin “It’s been great being off Twitter… I continue to be long BTC and also significantly sized up my gold position in August. This is driven by my belief that Trump’s efforts to take control of the Fed represent a momentous catalyst, the kind that happens once a decade,” he wrote, adding: “Once he takes control, it is logical that he will not only cut rates, but engage in some form of yield curve control… The USD will get destroyed as a result.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Soak Up Trillions From China And Russia, Billionaire Predicts The post frames Bitcoin and gold as “more pure beneficiaries of an environment where liquidity is increasing and institutional credibility is undermined,” and contends that lingering fears about a halving-style market top are misplaced now that “BTC… has been captured by tradfi and is a more pure expression of liquidity conditions.” The policy backdrop he sketches has moved from hypothetical to contested reality in recent weeks. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell publicly rejected claims that the central bank is acting politically, even as investors parse appointments and public pressure from the White House. “Cheap shots,” he said of accusations about the Fed’s motives, defending the data-dependence of recent decisions. In parallel, global policymakers and market strategists have openly debated whether ongoing political intervention could force the Fed toward explicit yield-curve control to contain long-term borrowing costs—an approach not used in the US since the 1940s. In a follow-up thread, “plur daddy” outlined a pathway to lower mortgage rates via government-sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) buying more mortgage bonds, with capital requirement tweaks and derivatives used to manage duration. That proposal distinguishes itself from QE by shifting spreads through asset mix rather than expanding central-bank balance sheets directly. The argument aligns with the broader political incentives ahead of US midterms: “Markets are forward looking… They have a strong incentive to juice the economy and markets,” he wrote, while cautioning that direct stimulus would carry inflation risks. The liquidity lens extends to the Treasury General Account (TGA), which has been rebuilt rapidly into late Q3. Research desks had warned that an aggressive TGA refill into September could briefly drain market liquidity before easing, a pattern that crypto traders have long monitored given Bitcoin’s outsized sensitivity to changes in dollar system reserves and bills-versus-reserves mix. “BTC is hypersensitive to any shift in liquidity conditions, much more so than equities,” the post asserts, echoing analysis that mapped TGA dynamics to risk-asset performance. Another pillar of the thesis is Europe’s evolving stance on Russia’s frozen sovereign assets—roughly $300 billion immobilized after the 2022 invasion. Brussels is weighing a structure in which new loans to Kyiv are backed by those assets and only repaid if Russia pays reparations—an outcome the author argues “will never happen,” calling the mechanism a de facto seizure that “massively bolsters the raison d’être for crypto.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Dip-Buy Calls Spike: Why This Could Actually Be Bearish Market context has been sympathetic to the store-of-value leg of the argument. Gold has pierced new highs this month, with multiple banks projecting scenarios toward $3,700–$4,000 over the next several quarters if central-bank buying remains strong—and potentially higher if private investors accelerate hedging flows away from US dollar assets amid policy and geopolitical uncertainty. “It makes sense that BTC start moving [when] gold’s momentum slows down,” “plur daddy” added, positing a rotation once bullion’s advance stalls. The post has drawn quick agreement from notable traders. “Agree, I am trying to time this, I think 90k,” wrote Ansem (blknoiz06), sketching a timeline that implies a Q1 2026 window for a new Bitcoin leg higher. Macro strategist Alex Krüger called it a “great post.” Forward Guidance podcast host Felix Jauvin added: “So very well said. Good to see you man.” The policy backdrop the expert sketches now features a Fed Board with a freshly confirmed Governor, Stephen I. Miran, who immediately dissented at the September FOMC for a larger cut and has been publicly arguing for materially faster easing in the dot plot. In parallel, the administration’s attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook via lawsuit has put an unprecedented spotlight on the legal protections around Federal Reserve independence. Those developments—together with Europe’s evolving plan to leverage frozen Russian assets—are the concrete signposts of the “once-a-decade” moment described above. At press time, BTC traded at $113,121.

Trading at $43.37, HYPE has fallen more than 12% in the past 24 hours and is down 20.8% this week, raising alarm across the crypto market. The scheduled unlock on November 29 will see team tokens representing 23.8% of the total supply released over 24 months, with analysts warning of $500 million in monthly selling pressure. Research group Maelstrom described the upcoming vesting as a “Sword of Damocles” moment, noting that only 17% of the supply may be absorbed by buybacks. This overhang has already caused major whales to trim their positions, with one investor withdrawing $122 million worth of HYPE while holding onto $90 million in unrealized profits. Arthur Hayes’ Ferrari Sale Sparks Hyperliquid (HYPE) Selloff Adding fuel to the bearish sentiment, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes recently exited his entire HYPE position, cashing out over 96,000 tokens for approximately $4.8 million. Hayes revealed on social media that the sale was to cover a deposit for his new Ferrari 849 Testarossa, generating nearly $823,000 in profit. The move stunned the market, especially given Hayes’ bold prediction just weeks earlier at the WebX 2025 conference, where he forecasted a 126x surge in HYPE over three years. His abrupt selloff, paired with mounting unlock concerns, has shaken investor confidence in Hyperliquid’s long-term trajectory. Tokenomics Reform Proposal: Can It Restore Trust? In response to growing concerns, DBA Asset Management’s Jon Charbonneau and researcher Hasu have introduced a comprehensive proposal to overhaul HYPE’s tokenomics. The plan recommends: Burning 45% of HYPE’s supply , including unminted tokens allocated for emissions and assistance funds. Eliminating Hyperliquid’s fixed 1 billion supply cap , aligning with flexible issuance models seen in Ethereum and Solana. Supporters argue the proposal could remove distortions in fully diluted valuation (FDV) metrics and create a fairer assessment of Hyperliquid’s fundamentals . However, critics warn that cutting emissions may weaken growth incentives and reduce flexibility in responding to future challenges. Despite its current price struggles, Hyperliquid remains one of the fastest-growing decentralized derivatives exchanges, recently hitting $3.4 billion in daily trading volumes. Whether the proposed reforms can stabilize HYPE ahead of November’s unlock will be a decisive test for the project’s resilience.

Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate total inflows. However, the latest figures show a striking performance by XRP, which secured significant capital at a time when several other assets struggled to attract or even retain investment. According to CoinShares data shared on X by crypto commentator and analyst X Finance Bull, XRP recorded $69.4 million in weekly inflows, placing it firmly among the best-performing assets of the week. By comparison, multi-asset investment products recorded $38 million in outflows, while other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) attracted only marginal sums. BOOM! $XRP pulled $69M in weekly inflows while others leaked capital. Money doesn’t lie, institutions are loading into clarity, not confusion. The market is already telling you where the next wave of adoption is headed. When will you realize where liquidity flows? pic.twitter.com/HUzmr5qVdO — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) September 23, 2025 Analyst Reaction to XRP’s Performance X Finance Bull addressed the shift in flows with a direct focus on XRP’s ability to capture institutional capital. He remarked that “XRP pulled $69M in weekly inflows while others leaked capital” and added that “money doesn’t lie.” His assessment describes a conviction among large investors that regulatory clarity surrounding XRP has given the asset a unique advantage compared to competitors facing uncertainty. The analyst’s comments highlight the notion that capital allocation often reflects institutional perception of stability and opportunity. He suggested that the market already signals where adoption is heading. This sentiment aligns with the data, which show XRP’s cumulative year-to-date inflows at $1.5 billion, an amount that reflects steady accumulation throughout 2025. Why This Matters for XRP The consistent inflows provide a more comprehensive view than a weekly snapshot. They represent a trend of institutional validation. While Bitcoin remains the dominant digital asset with over $24.7 billion in inflows year-to-date, and Ethereum follows with $12.6 billion, XRP’s ability to sustain inflows despite a smaller total market size stands out. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This positions XRP in a competitive landscape where survival depends not only on speculation but also on institutional adoption. A key driver of this development is the increasing perception that XRP benefits from a clearer regulatory standing in the U.S. compared to other assets. For institutions that prioritize compliance, this clarity reduces perceived risk and encourages long-term positioning. With $3 billion in assets under management tied to XRP investment products, the scale of participation now exceeds that of many established altcoins. XRP Outlook for the Coming Months If current momentum persists, XRP could solidify its position as one of the most institutionally supported digital assets in the market. The inflow data suggests that capital managers view it as more than a speculative token, instead recognizing its role in payment systems and cross-border settlement.

ETH is now struggling and might decline further if it breaks the $4,050 support zone. Ethereum failed to extend gains and declined below the $4,150 zone. The price is trading below $4,150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,360 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $4,050 and $4,000. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price remained in a bearish zone after it settled below $4,450, like Bitcoin . ETH price declined below the $4,320 and $4,300 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below $4,120. A low was formed at $4,000 and the price recently started a minor recovery wave. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $4,635 swing high to the $4,000 low. However, the bears remained active near the $4,250 resistance zone and pushed the price lower again. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,360 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,150 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,220 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,250 level. A clear move above the $4,250 resistance might send the price toward the $4,350 resistance and the trend line. An upside break above the $4,360 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,450 resistance zone or even $4,550 in the near term. Downside Extension In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,220 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,050 level. The first major support sits near the $4,000 zone. A clear move below the $4,000 support might push the price toward the $3,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,820 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,750.

U.S. investment bank Benchmark has just reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating for the Japanese company, signaling strong confidence in its bold Metaplanet Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This move has set an ambitious price target of 2,400 yen for Metaplanet’s stock by the end of 2026, a significant leap from its current trading price of 540 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Why is Benchmark So Confident in Metaplanet Bitcoin? Benchmark’s decision to reaffirm its positive outlook isn’t just a casual endorsement; it comes with a strong rebuttal to market skepticism. The investment bank directly addressed claims suggesting that Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy is collapsing or that its stock momentum is fading. Benchmark firmly stated that such assertions are premature and lack sufficient evidence, highlighting their belief in the company’s long-term vision. It is true that Metaplanet’s stock has recently faced headwinds, largely due to the activities of short sellers. These investors bet on a stock’s price falling, and their actions can sometimes create temporary downward pressure. However, Benchmark encourages a broader perspective: Past Performance: Metaplanet was Japan’s best-performing listed company last year, a remarkable achievement that underscores its potential. Current Standing: Despite recent fluctuations, its shares remain up an impressive 56% year-to-date, demonstrating considerable resilience and growth. This sustained performance suggests that the underlying value and strategic direction of Metaplanet Bitcoin remain strong, defying short-term market noise. Understanding Metaplanet’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation Metaplanet’s approach to Bitcoin isn’t merely speculative; it is a deliberate corporate strategy to integrate the digital asset into its treasury. This move aligns the company with a growing trend of publicly traded entities, particularly in the U.S., adopting Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset to hedge against inflation and preserve capital. For a Japanese company to embrace such a strategy is particularly noteworthy, given the traditional conservatism often associated with Japanese corporate finance. This bold step positions Metaplanet as a pioneer in its region, potentially paving the way for other Asian companies to consider similar moves. The goal is to leverage Bitcoin’s properties as a decentralized, scarce asset to enhance shareholder value over the long term. By consistently accumulating Bitcoin, Metaplanet aims to: Strengthen its balance sheet: Utilizing Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation. Attract a new investor base: Appealing to those interested in digital asset exposure within traditional markets. Innovate corporate finance: Demonstrating leadership in adopting new financial technologies. The strategic clarity behind Metaplanet Bitcoin is a key factor in Benchmark’s unwavering confidence. Navigating the Market: Metaplanet Bitcoin Amidst Volatility While the overall narrative for Metaplanet remains positive, investors must always consider market dynamics. The recent faltering of the stock, though attributed to short sellers, serves as a reminder that even strong strategies can face temporary pressures. Bitcoin itself is known for its volatility, and companies that tie their fortunes to it will naturally experience some of this ebb and flow. However, Benchmark’s 2026 price target indicates a belief in the long-term trajectory of both Metaplanet’s operational strategy and the broader Bitcoin market. For investors, this suggests that looking beyond immediate price movements and focusing on the fundamental shift in corporate treasury management could be crucial. The ability of Metaplanet Bitcoin to navigate these waters will be a key indicator of its success. This situation highlights the difference between short-term trading sentiment and long-term investment conviction. Benchmark’s reiteration is a strong signal for those who believe in the enduring value proposition of Bitcoin and its role in modern corporate strategy. A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Benchmark’s reiterated ‘Buy’ rating for Metaplanet is more than just a stock recommendation; it is a powerful validation of a forward-thinking corporate strategy. It underscores the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable treasury asset, even in traditional financial markets like Japan. Metaplanet’s journey serves as an important case study for how companies can strategically integrate digital assets to create long-term value. Despite the challenges posed by short-term market dynamics, the underlying strength of Metaplanet’s performance and the strategic rationale behind its Metaplanet Bitcoin accumulation strategy appear robust. The 2,400 yen price target by 2026 reflects significant growth potential, suggesting that the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Benchmark’s current rating for Metaplanet? Benchmark has reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating for Metaplanet. Q2: What is Metaplanet’s price target according to Benchmark? Benchmark has set a price target of 2,400 yen for Metaplanet’s stock by the end of 2026. Q3: Why did Metaplanet’s stock recently falter?

The latest trend shows a clear rotation away from hype-driven assets toward platforms with practical value. At the forefront of this shift is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale-stage DeFi platform that blends secure lending, borrowing, and staking with Layer-2 technology for faster, lower-cost transactions. From market rotation to DeFi dominance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out by offering dual lending options, where users will access peer-to-contract pools for mainstream assets alongside peer-to-peer channels for higher-risk tokens. mtTokens earned through deposits can be staked for MUTM rewards, while a future $1 stablecoin will power borrowing and repayment activity. This multi-layered design is not built for speculation alone—it is engineered to drive continuous activity, revenue generation, and long-term token demand. With a roadmap that prioritizes utility, exchange listings, and community engagement, MUTM is being highlighted by analysts as the best crypto investing opportunity in today’s market rotation. Investors are beginning to realize that lasting returns come from tokens backed by active use cases rather than quick hype cycles. Dogecoin (DOGE) once captured headlines on community momentum, but it lacks the structural mechanics to keep attracting serious capital. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned differently, as it is designed to launch with a working beta platform where users will experience loans, staking, and stablecoin functions firsthand. This hands-on exposure is expected to generate trust and draw in both retail participants and institutional players. Layer-2 optimization will be another driver. Transactions will be faster and cheaper, solving one of the most common frustrations with decentralized finance. By lowering barriers for participation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will encourage frequent lending and borrowing, amplifying liquidity in the system. On top of this, the buy-and-distribute revenue model will recycle platform earnings into MUTM buybacks, distributing them to mtToken stakers. This self-reinforcing cycle ensures that activity on the platform translates directly into demand pressure on the token. Market rotation is also steering whales toward assets with transparent growth metrics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates a dashboard where investors will track their holdings and returns, alongside a Top 50 leaderboard that highlights leading participants. This gamified environment not only keeps users engaged but also incentivizes large-scale players to lock in capital for long-term benefits. Together, these features provide a strong foundation for MUTM to outpace speculative crypto coins and rise toward the $3.5 target analysts are projecting. Presale momentum and future exchange listings Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with the token priced at $0.035. The presale has already raised around $16.23 million, attracting more than 16,600 holders, and 50% of the Phase 6 allocation of 170 million tokens has been sold. Security has been validated through a CertiK audit, with scores of 90 on Token Scan and 79 on Skynet, and the revised audit timeline is set for May 20, 2025. The project also enjoys a strong social following with over 12,000 Twitter supporters. When the presale advances to Phase 7, the token price will increase by 15% to $0.040. Exchange listings are expected to unlock the next wave of demand. With plans to bring MUTM onto top-tier platforms such as Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, MEXC, and Kraken, the project will gain exposure to a global audience of investors seeking tokens with real utility. Unlike many presale projects that rely only on promises, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer a live ecosystem, where stablecoin borrowing, Layer-2 efficiency, and staking rewards converge to keep liquidity circulating. This model is the best place for market rotation capital to move about. Investors who are tired of the instability that comes with meme-driven assets are switching to platforms where growth is built into the service. An increase from $0.035 to $3.5 isn’t just a guess; it’s a path backed by growing acceptance, more exchanges, and built-in demand via buybacks and staking rewards. Investors need to act fast to get MUTM for $0.035 because half of Phase 6 has already been sold. The price will go up to $0.040 in Phase 7, which will make the admission cost 15% higher. This makes early access even more attractive. If you’re keeping an eye on the crypto market and trying to figure out where to put your money, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most interesting new coins. The move toward platforms that are useful is already happening, and MUTM is already taking advantage of it.

Recently, the spotlight has been firmly on ETH liquidations , which have soared to a staggering $76.51 million within just 24 hours. This massive wave of forced selling has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, particularly impacting traders who held long positions. Understanding these events is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of crypto. Understanding the Surge in ETH Liquidations In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency perpetual futures, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin, or collateral, falls below a certain threshold, typically due to adverse price movements. Essentially, it’s a safety mechanism designed to prevent traders from losing more money than they have in their account. Perpetual futures contracts are popular derivative instruments in crypto, allowing traders to speculate on asset prices without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, but they rely heavily on a mechanism called ‘funding rates’ to keep their price close to the spot price. Traders often use leverage, borrowing funds to amplify their potential returns. While this can lead to significant profits, it also magnifies losses. When the market moves against a leveraged position, and the value of the collateral falls below a certain maintenance level, the exchange automatically closes the position. This prevents further losses and maintains market integrity. These events are crucial because they can amplify market volatility; when a large number of positions are liquidated simultaneously, it can trigger further price drops, creating a cascade effect known as a ‘liquidation spiral’. The Staggering Numbers: ETH, BTC, and SOL Take a Hit The recent data paints a clear picture of significant market activity and the immense pressure felt by traders. Over the past 24 hours, ETH liquidations led the pack, totaling an astonishing $76.51 million. What’s particularly noteworthy is that long positions accounted for a dominant 74.24% of this figure, indicating that the vast majority of liquidated traders were betting on rising prices. Bitcoin (BTC) also saw substantial liquidations, reaching $53.88 million, with long positions making up 64.2% of the total. Not to be outdone, Solana (SOL) experienced $30.72 million in liquidations, and an even higher percentage of long positions, 83.62%, were wiped out. These figures collectively highlight a period of considerable downside pressure, especially for those betting on an upward trajectory. The sheer volume of these liquidations, particularly for Ethereum, suggests a rapid and perhaps unexpected shift in market momentum. For many traders, this meant a sudden and forced exit from their positions, often at a loss. This cascade of closures can create a challenging environment for even experienced traders to navigate, as market movements can accelerate rapidly. Why Were Long Positions Dominant in Recent Crypto Liquidations ? It is interesting to observe the prevalence of long positions in these recent liquidations. This suggests that a significant portion of traders were optimistic about upward price movements for these assets. However, when market sentiment shifted or unexpected price drops occurred, these leveraged long positions quickly became vulnerable. Several factors can contribute to such a scenario. Perhaps there was an overleveraged market, where many traders were using high leverage, making their positions more susceptible to even small price corrections. Additionally, macro-economic news, regulatory concerns, or specific project developments could have triggered selling pressure, leading to a swift downturn that caught many off guard. The dominance of long positions in these recent crypto liquidations points to a prevailing bullish sentiment that was abruptly challenged. Prior to these events, many traders might have been confident in the continued growth of these assets, perhaps influenced by positive news, technical indicators, or broader market optimism. The rapid closure of these long positions likely exacerbated the price declines, as exchanges sold off assets to cover margin calls, adding to the overall market supply. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights to Mitigate Liquidations Understanding the dynamics of forced liquidations is vital for any crypto trader. Here are some actionable insights to consider, helping you protect your capital during volatile periods: Manage Leverage Wisely: Using leverage can be a double-edged sword. While 10x or 20x leverage might seem appealing for quick gains, it means a mere 10% or 5% price drop can wipe out your entire capital. Consider starting with lower leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) until you gain more experience and confidence in your strategy. Set Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order is your best friend in volatile markets. For instance, if you enter a long position at $3,000 for ETH, you might set a stop-loss at $2,900. If ETH drops to that level, your position is automatically closed, limiting your loss to a predefined amount, rather than risking a full liquidation. Monitor Funding Rates: Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders. Positive funding rates mean longs pay shorts, indicating more demand for long positions. Consistently high positive funding rates can signal an overbought market and a potential correction, making it a red flag for new long entries. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading your investments across different assets can help mitigate risk. If one asset performs poorly, others might still do well. Stay Informed: Market sentiment can turn on a dime. Follow reputable crypto news sources, analyze on-chain data for insights into whale movements, and understand the broader economic landscape. Knowledge is power in predicting potential shifts that could lead to widespread liquidations. The recent surge in ETH liquidations , alongside significant figures for BTC and SOL, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks in leveraged trading within the cryptocurrency market. The dominance of long positions among the liquidated indicates a market that was perhaps overly optimistic, facing swift corrections. While liquidations can be painful for individual traders, they are a fundamental part of how perpetual futures markets maintain stability. For participants, learning from these events and implementing robust risk management strategies is paramount to long-term success in this exciting yet unpredictable space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin (collateral) falls below a required level, usually due to adverse price movements. 2. Why do long positions get liquidated more often during a market downturn? Long positions profit when prices rise. During a market downturn, prices fall, causing long positions to lose value. If these positions are leveraged, even small drops can deplete their margin, leading to forced closure. 3. How can traders avoid being liquidated? Traders can avoid liquidations by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and staying informed about market conditions to anticipate potential shifts. 4. Do liquidations impact the overall crypto market price? Yes, large-scale liquidations can significantly impact market prices. The forced selling of assets by exchanges to cover liquidated positions adds to selling pressure, potentially accelerating price declines and increasing volatility. 5. What is the difference between a spot trade and a perpetual futures trade in relation to liquidations? Spot trading involves buying and selling the actual cryptocurrency, so liquidations do not occur. Perpetual futures trading, however, involves leveraged contracts that track the asset’s price. These leveraged positions are subject to liquidation if the market moves against the trader’s bet and their margin runs out.

But since crypto values are still changing a lot nowadays, investors are not only keeping an eye on ETH; they are also looking for the next big cryptocurrency that might make them a lot of money. As it moves through its presale Phase 6 at under $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting a lot of attention. Analysts say it might be the greatest crypto coin to keep an eye on before the year’s most anticipated ETH rise. Ethereum (ETH) forecast Ethereum (ETH) is forecasted to hit $6,000 by the end of 2025, trading at ~$4,203 as of September 23, 2025, with a 24-hour trading volume of $37.07 billion. This projection, supported by analysts like Gov Capital and DigitalCoinPrice, stems from robust ETF inflows exceeding $11 billion since July, led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust holding 3.49 million ETH. Institutional adoption, including corporate treasuries like SharpLink Gaming adding $400 million, and Layer-2 scaling driving 1.74 million daily transactions, bolsters the outlook. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) unlocks a new era in DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a dual-model DeFi platform that will serve both traditional and risk-tolerant users. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending will allow investors to supply assets like BTC, ETH, or stablecoins into liquidity pools to earn predictable interest, while Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending will provide flexibility for riskier tokens such as SHIB, PEPE, or DOGE through individually negotiated terms. This design is intended to combine scalability, security, and versatility in ways few lending protocols have managed. Beyond the lending foundation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1, minted only against collateral and burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will oversee interest rates to keep the peg stable, while arbitrage will strengthen the $1 balance over time. This stability framework is further supported by Chainlink-powered oracles, backed up with fallback feeds and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages (TWAPs), ensuring liquidation events remain safe and transparent even during volatile swings in crypto prices. Another innovation in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem is its approach to borrowing interest and liquidity management. The platform will adopt a utilization-based system, meaning that when liquidity is abundant, borrowing costs stay low, while during periods of high demand, interest rates rise to attract more deposits. For lenders, this design increases yield potential without compromising borrower access. To complement lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces mtToken staking and MUTM buybacks. Users staking mtTokens will earn MUTM rewards, while protocol-generated revenue will be used for open-market buybacks of MUTM tokens. Those repurchased tokens will then be redistributed to stakers, creating an ongoing incentive loop that links platform usage directly to staker rewards. Presale momentum and investor examples The presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already proven to be one of the most closely tracked token sales in 2025. Out of its 4 billion total supply, Phase 6 offers 170 million tokens at $0.035, and over 50% of this allocation is already sold. The presale has raised more than $16.23 million so far, supported by a growing community of more than 16,600 holders. Importantly, Phase 7 is scheduled to increase the token price to $0.040, marking a 15% jump from current levels. Early participants are already seeing transformative growth. For instance, an investor who swapped $10,000 worth of BTC or SOL during Phase 1 at $0.01 now holds MUTM valued at $35,000 at Phase 6, locking in a +250% paper gain even before the token lists. Once the listing price of $0.06 is reached, the same allocation will be valued at $60,000, representing a +500% unrealized gain. Analysts further project that once the beta platform launches and expected listings on exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, Kraken, or MEXC go live, MUTM will be positioned to climb multiples higher as adoption accelerates. This trajectory becomes even more compelling as ETH approaches $6,000. Investors who are weighing whether crypto is a good investment during a time of rising valuations are increasingly studying crypto charts and realizing that diversifying into utility-driven tokens under $1 like MUTM offers greater upside than holding only large caps. Instead of risking exposure to the next crypto crash, many are hedging by entering early-stage projects with practical use cases that drive organic demand. Roadmap and security anchors build confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has made a clear plan for the next four phases. The framework is already in place, with presale start, marketing campaigns, and token auditing. The next steps are to develop smart contracts, finish the front-end and back-end, do beta testing, and do security audits. All of these steps will lead to the introduction of a live platform with support for many chains and partnerships with institutions. Security is also a major part of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal. The project has undergone review by CertiK, recording a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has committed to a $50,000 bug bounty program to reward ethical hackers who identify vulnerabilities, alongside an ongoing $100,000 giveaway to expand its community and reward early supporters. It’s evident that now is the time to buy, since presale Phase 6 is nearly 50% sold and Phase 7 is about to start at $0.040. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new type of lending that uses stablecoins, powerful oracle integration, and a staking buyback scheme to reward people who take part. As crypto prices keep going up and ETH gets closer to $6,000, analysts are focusing on MUTM at $0.035 as a rare chance among crypto coins that offers more than just speculation; it also has real use, growth, and security.

Right now, the limit sits at 49%, but that could change before the end of 2025, according to Abdulaziz Abdulmohsen Bin Hassan, a CMA board member who said the proposal is already under review and may be implemented “before the end of the year.” That news alone was enough to add $123 billion in market value to the Tadawul All Share Index, which hadn’t seen a boost like this since 2020. The entire market responded. Every industry group traded up, and Saudi banks took the lead with 9% gains. This comes after months of underperformance. As of now, the index is still down 9.6% in 2025, lagging behind Dubai, which is up 13.8%, and Kuwait, up 20%, a trend largely tied to weaker oil prices. Foreign cap rumors drive massive stock inflows The potential rule change would open Saudi’s doors wider to foreign capital, especially from index-tracking funds like MSCI and FTSE. If foreign ownership hits 100%, UBS projects that the market could attract between $9.5 billion and $10 billion in passive inflows. Victor Martin, UBS’s head of portfolio trading in EMEA, said those inflows would hit fast once the rules change. Big names like Saudi Aramco, despite being a symbol of the country’s market power, haven’t been able to hold ground. Its stock is down around 10% year-to-date, part of the broader weakness in large caps. Mohammed Ali Yasin, the CEO at Ghaf Benefits (under Lunate), pointed out that “even with the 49% cap, foreigners never really cross 15% ownership in most large caps.” But he said expectations are shifting fast. The momentum is now driven by hopes that foreigners will pour more money into these listed firms once the caps are gone, and not just small stakes. These flows could raise Saudi’s weight in global indices, pushing prices higher, and making the exchange more appealing to big international funds. This isn’t the first step either. Saudi has already tried to attract foreign investors by launching exchange-traded funds in partnership with Japan and Hong Kong. Another major shift came in January, when regulators gave foreigners the green light to buy listed firms that hold real estate in Mecca and Medina, though the law still blocks direct ownership of land in those two holy cities. Saudi momentum lifts emerging stocks as Powell pressures currencies As Saudi’s stocks ripped higher, global markets noticed. The MSCI benchmark for emerging market equities rose 0.4%, extending its winning streak to three days, now sitting at its highest level since July 2021. It wasn’t just Saudi fueling that push. Alibaba surged to a four-year high after boosting its AI investments, and Tencent followed suit. But the real weight came from the Saudi banks, which dominated Wednesday’s performance. On the currency side, it was the opposite story. Most emerging market currencies lost ground, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck a cautious tone in his comments. The Bloomberg dollar index rose 0.4%, as Powell said the Fed faces a “challenging situation” balancing inflation and labor market risks. That tone crushed bets for a rate cut next month, and investors backed off risk trades. In eastern Europe, the Polish zloty and neighboring currencies took a hit, dragged down by increased Russia-NATO tensions over reported airspace violations. At the same time, the Thai baht fell after new data showed the country’s export growth hit its slowest pace in almost a year, pressured by U.S. tariffs. Investors in Czech Republic kept their eyes on the central bank, which was widely expected to hold interest rates steady. A hawkish signal from the board could offer support to the koruna, one of the region’s strongest currencies against both the euro and the dollar so far this year.

Recently, a significant announcement from South Korean exchange Bithumb has caught the attention of IQ token holders. Bithumb is temporarily suspending IQ deposits and withdrawals, a move that directly impacts users of the platform. What’s Behind the Bithumb IQ Suspension? Bithumb has officially stated that the temporary suspension of IQ deposits and withdrawals will commence at 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 25. This isn’t an arbitrary decision; it’s a necessary step due to an impending IQ network transition. Network transitions are vital for blockchain projects, often involving upgrades or migrations to enhance security, scalability, or functionality. For users, this means that during the specified period, any attempts to deposit IQ tokens into their Bithumb accounts or withdraw them will be unsuccessful. It’s essential to plan any transactions accordingly to avoid inconvenience or potential loss of funds. Why Are Network Transitions Necessary for IQ? Blockchain networks, like any software, require updates and maintenance. An IQ network transition typically involves moving the token from one blockchain protocol to another, or implementing significant upgrades to its existing infrastructure. These transitions aim to improve the underlying technology, making the network more robust, efficient, and future-proof. Enhanced Security: Upgrades can patch vulnerabilities and strengthen the network’s defenses. Improved Scalability: A new network might handle more transactions faster, reducing fees and congestion. New Features: Transitions can enable new functionalities or integrations for the IQ token. While a temporary Bithumb IQ suspension might seem disruptive, it’s ultimately for the long-term health and development of the IQ ecosystem. How Does This Bithumb IQ Suspension Affect You? If you hold IQ tokens on Bithumb, or were planning to trade them around the suspension time, this announcement is particularly relevant. The primary impact is the inability to move your IQ tokens in or out of the exchange during the suspension period. This could affect your trading strategies or your ability to manage your portfolio. It’s important to understand that this is a temporary measure. Bithumb is facilitating a necessary technical process. Once the IQ network transition is complete and verified, deposits and withdrawals are expected to resume. Users should monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for updates on the resumption of services. Taking Action: What Should IQ Holders Do? Given the upcoming Bithumb IQ suspension, proactive steps can help you navigate this period smoothly: Review Your Holdings: Check your IQ balance on Bithumb. Plan Transactions: If you need to deposit or withdraw IQ, do so well before the September 25 deadline. Stay Informed: Regularly check Bithumb’s official website and announcement channels for the latest information regarding the IQ network transition and the lifting of the suspension. Consider Alternatives (Temporarily): If immediate trading or transfer is critical, you might explore other exchanges that support IQ, though this comes with its own set of considerations and risks. The goal is to avoid any last-minute rushes or surprises that could lead to missed opportunities or operational issues during the suspension. The Bigger Picture: Network Upgrades in Crypto Temporary suspensions for network upgrades are not uncommon in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Major blockchains like Ethereum have undergone significant transitions, such as “The Merge,” which required extensive preparation and temporary adjustments from exchanges and users. These events highlight the dynamic nature of crypto assets and the continuous efforts by projects to innovate and improve. A Bithumb IQ suspension for a network transition underscores the commitment to technological advancement within the IQ project. While inconvenient in the short term, such transitions are foundational for long-term growth and stability in the decentralized world. Conclusion: Navigating the Bithumb IQ Suspension with Confidence The temporary Bithumb IQ suspension for deposits and withdrawals is a direct consequence of an essential IQ network transition. This move, while requiring users to adjust their immediate plans, is a testament to the ongoing development and improvement of the IQ blockchain. By staying informed, planning ahead, and following official announcements from Bithumb, users can navigate this period effectively. Ultimately, these technical adjustments contribute to a more robust and efficient cryptocurrency ecosystem for everyone. Keep an eye on Bithumb’s official channels for the announcement of service resumption.

With the market moving into a phase where innovation and utility matter more than hype alone, three names have emerged at the top: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP. Among them, MUTM has quickly become the standout, combining real-world lending utility with strong tokenomics that are expected to drive exponential growth. For anyone focused on crypto investment with high upside in 2026, MUTM is commanding attention. Solana (SOL): A strong platform but missing direct lending utility Solana (SOL) continues to be one of the most powerful smart contract platforms, delivering fast transaction speeds and strong ecosystem development. It remains an attractive long-term hold for those investing in crypto, but its scope is focused largely on serving developers rather than individual users seeking capital efficiency. Unlike Mutuum Finance (MUTM), Solana (SOL) does not natively tie token demand to lending fees, staking rewards, or buyback mechanisms. This gap means that while Solana (SOL) will continue to grow as an infrastructure blockchain, it is less aligned with the lending-driven DeFi sector that is forecasted to expand aggressively by 2026. Dogecoin (DOGE): Hype still moves it forward Dogecoin (DOGE) has built a reputation as the original memecoin, capturing viral attention and community-driven price surges. Analysts expect DOGE to secure up to 3x growth in the near future, supported largely by its enthusiastic fanbase. However, DOGE’s long-term position is limited by its lack of utility. It does not generate lending fees, staking returns, or reinvested revenue streams. For serious investors looking beyond hype cycles, DOGE remains speculative compared to the structured growth model of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Still, DOGE’s strong cultural relevance ensures it will remain part of the conversation when discussing 2026’s crypto predictions. XRP: A payments specialist, not a lending leader XRP has carved out its niche in the world of cross-border payments, making transactions faster and cheaper for institutions and banks. Currently trading around $2.9, XRP offers stability and global partnerships that strengthen its appeal. Yet, XRP’s role is specialized and limited. It does not provide DeFi lending mechanics or staking-based incentives, meaning it lacks the organic token demand that will drive projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). For those interested in crypto investment focused on utility and direct user rewards, XRP’s ceiling is much lower compared to a full-stack DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A full-stack DeFi protocol designed for growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem rather than just another token. At its foundation is a dual lending model. Through peer-to-contract (P2C) lending, investors will be able to supply blue-chip tokens such as BTC, ETH, and stablecoins into liquidity pools that automatically serve borrowers. At the same time, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending will cater to higher-risk assets like memecoins, where lenders negotiate directly with borrowers. This dual approach balances safety and yield, appealing to both cautious lenders and those seeking aggressive returns. Beyond lending, the platform integrates mtToken staking, giving users the ability to earn rewards by locking in their tokenized claims. The revenue collected will later drive a buy-and-distribute model, ensuring consistent buy pressure on MUTM in secondary markets. Combined with a Layer-2 optimized design, which reduces costs and boosts transaction speeds, the project will be prepared for rapid scaling once it lists. Users have access to a detailed dashboard where they can track their portfolios, estimate future returns, and check the Top 50 leaderboard. Those who rank among the biggest investors receive additional MUTM token rewards as part of their bonus incentives. The upcoming beta launch will allow early adopters to test live features, including lending, borrowing, staking, and stablecoin mechanics. With these innovations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to offer a hands-on experience that will directly reinforce demand. Presale and ROI potential of MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. The round has already generated $16.23 million, with 50% of the allocation sold and more than 16,600 holders participating. Phase 7 is scheduled to raise the price to $0.040, ensuring a 15% automatic gain for new buyers entering before the transition. Security confidence is reinforced by a CertiK audit, where MUTM has achieved a Token Scan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. The final report is set for release in 2025, adding transparency for investors. An early investor who joined in Phase 1 at $0.01 by swapping into MUTM has already gained 3.5x on paper at $0.035. Once the presale token lists at $0.06, that same position is projected to increase another 70% by value from current pricing, supported by lending revenues, staking demand, and exchange listings. Why MUTM leads into 2026 The roadmap indicates strong demand drivers: a beta platform for hands-on use, and a buy-and-distribute method that keeps demand high. Layer-2 optimization makes transactions faster and cheaper, while external incentives like a $100,000 community giveaway and a $50,000 bug bounty program will get more people involved. Then, expected listings on major exchanges will give you liquidity and visibility. By 2026, SOL will still be focused on developers, DOGE and XRP will still serve their own niches, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is predicted to be the most innovative choice for anyone who wants to invest in crypto with an emphasis on exponential growth. MUTM is not simply catching up with the other two; it is already laying the groundwork to pass them.

The company, which manufactures chips for Nvidia and other tech giants, says this change is necessary as current systems burn too much electricity. At full load, Nvidia’s AI servers can use up to 1,200 watts, the same as keeping 1,000 U.S. homes running non-stop. That kind of energy drain isn’t sustainable, and TSMC is reportedly trying to fix it with smarter design. The approach revolves around building chips with smaller pieces called chiplets, each made with different tech, all packaged into one. But it’s not just about throwing pieces together. These new packages are being designed by AI software from firms like Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys, not by engineers alone. Cadence and Synopsys beat engineers on speed and accuracy Jim Chang, deputy director at TSMC’s 3DIC Methodology Group, showed off the results. Using Cadence and Synopsys software, chip designs that once took two days of human effort were finished by AI in five minutes. “That helps to max out TSMC technology’s capability, and we find this is very useful,” Jim said during his talk. The company sees this speed boost as key to getting more efficient chips to market faster. But not every problem can be solved with smarter code.Kaushik Veeraraghavan, an engineer at Meta’s infrastructure division, said during his keynote that the current chip manufacturing model is hitting physical walls.Moving data in and out of chips with traditional wires is slowing things down. Switching to optical connections could fix that, but right now, they’re still too unreliable for large data centers. “Really, this is not an engineering problem,” Kaushik said . “It’s a fundamental physical problem.” At the same event, Qualcomm launched a new set of chips, including one aimed squarely at business computers. The flagship, Snapdragon X2 Elite, is expected to ship next year with a new security feature called Guardian. Qualcomm pushes Guardian to compete in the business PC market Kedar Kondap, senior vice president of gaming and compute at Qualcomm, explained how Guardian works.The feature lets IT teams remotely connect to a laptop, even if it’s off, to push updates or give support.This kind of remote access has existed before, but Qualcomm plans to pair it with their 5G modem chips. That means companies could locate and manage laptops as long as they have a mobile signal. “Nobody else can offer something like that,” said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of Creative Strategies. “I can actually see that being attractive for a portion of the workforce and something that will get stronger interest in Qualcomm for enterprise fleets.” Qualcomm has been trying to grab a piece of the PC market for two years now, competing with Apple and Intel by offering energy-saving chips for Windows laptops. Intel still holds most of the corporate PC share and already had similar remote features, but Qualcomm’s wireless integration might give it an edge with businesses managing devices on the go.

The ETF, listed as NASDAQ:NCIQ, made the change last Thursday after updating its trust structure to meet the new criteria. The revised setup, filed under Form 8-K on Wednesday, includes a “Third Amended and Restated Trust Agreement” signed by Hashdex Asset Management Ltd. and CSC Delaware Trust Company, replacing the previous second agreement. The ETF, built in Delaware, is tagged as an “emerging growth company.” The filing didn’t show any changes to its fiscal year or include any new financial documents. The updated trust agreement was attached as an exhibit to the filing , confirming compliance with Nasdaq’s current listing demands. ETF issuers prepare for October launch Following the SEC’s vote to adopt the updated listing standards last week, several asset managers have kicked into gear. These new rules let qualified crypto ETFs skip the case-by-case review process, something that used to drag on for months. Under the old rules, approval could take as long as 270 days. Now, with the new setup, products can be cleared in as little as 75 days. “We’ve got about a dozen filings with the SEC now, and more coming,” said Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital Group. He confirmed that asset managers are already lining up, ready to take advantage of the rule change. “We’re all getting ready for a wave of launches,” he said. That wave is expected to hit hard in Q4 2025, according to Jonathan Groth at DGIM Law, who called this period a likely “boom time” for crypto ETFs. The rush began in July, when the SEC first proposed the changes. Since then, firms have scrambled to rewrite filings, address SEC feedback, and meet the updated standards. Sources familiar with the process say the final updates could be submitted by the end of the week. “These are the rules we had been anticipating,” said Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise. Fusaro says most filings are nearing the end of the review phase and could hit the market shortly. Analysts expect ETFs tracking SOL and XRP to debut in early October. New SEC rules speed up crypto ETF approvals To qualify for the new approval process, ETFs must meet at least one of three main requirements. One, the coin involved must trade on a regulated exchange, or have CFTC-regulated futures contracts that’ve been active for at least six months. Two, another ETF must already hold that coin with 40% of its assets directly invested in it, not via swaps or options. If any of those conditions are met, the ETF skips the red tape. But not every firm is ready to roll. “Not all of our existing filings qualify,” said Kyle DaCruz, head of digital assets at VanEck. “The next step is to talk to our lawyers to see which products can move forward and how rapidly will they get onto the market.” That said, Grayscale Investments didn’t wait around. Less than 48 hours after the SEC’s announcement, it converted its private fund into a public product: the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF (GDLC.P). This new ETF holds BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and cardano. According to Peter Mintzberg, CEO of Grayscale, their quick launch reflects their push for “public market access, regulatory clarity and product innovation.” The bigger question now is whether investors will actually care about ETFs tied to lesser-known coins. “There will be a flood of tokens that many folks have never heard of,” DaCruz warned. Unlike BTC, which took years to build trust, some of these coins may get only weeks or months of investor education before hitting the market.

The new cases cover personal protective equipment (PPE), medical instruments, advanced robotics, and industrial machinery, with department officials saying they will face higher tariffs if the investigations prove that they are a national security threat. The administration is asking companies for detailed breakdowns on expected demand, their ability to meet it with U.S. production, and how much of that demand depends on foreign suppliers, especially China. Commerce demands full breakdowns from companies on foreign reliance In documents reviewed by the press, Commerce officials requested that manufacturers explain “the extent to which domestic production of robotics and industrial machinery, and their parts and components can meet domestic demand,” and outline the role of foreign supply chains in meeting U.S. needs. This applies to everything from welding robots and machine tools to industrial ovens, laser cutters, and autoclaves. These probes also extend deep into the medical sector. Items under investigation include surgical masks, N95 respirators, gloves, gowns, and critical hospital supplies like IV bags, bandages, sutures, crutches, wheelchairs, and beds. The Commerce dept said that it is also requesting data on high-tech medical devices: pacemakers, coronary stents, insulin pumps, heart valves, orthopedic appliances, MRI machines, CT scanners, blood glucose monitors, hearing aids, and prosthetics are all listed. Companies must also report on how foreign subsidies and what officials call “predatory trade practices” are affecting U.S. supply chains. Gina Raimondo, the Secretary of Commerce, said the government is particularly focused on how countries like China are allegedly manipulating global trade in these critical sectors. In Gina’s words:- “We are looking at how foreign government actions impact the availability and reliability of these goods in the U.S.” While these investigations focus on medical and industrial goods, other probes are running separately. Prescription drugs and drones are being reviewed under different Section 232 tracks. But all are part of a broader strategy under President Trump to tighten U.S. control over strategic imports. The Commerce Department is not new to this approach. Similar probes are already underway on wind turbines, airplanes, semiconductors, heavy-duty trucks, polysilicon, copper, timber, lumber, and critical minerals. Officials say these industries are essential to both national defense and long-term economic security. Get seen where it counts.

The whole deal with Nvidia is built on spreading costs over time, and not dropping billions upfront. The artificial intelligence company wants to access Nvidia’s top-tier GPUs, but instead of buying them outright, it’s locking into long-term lease agreements. That way, the money goes out slowly, and the risk shifts to Nvidia.The arrangement is simple. As each new AI data center goes live, OpenAI gets access to more GPUs.The first center, being built in Abilene, Texas, is expected to go online in the second half of 2026. That’s when the cash starts flowing. The exact price of each center is still unknown, but OpenAI isn’t taking ownership of the hardware. It’s renting the compute. Every GPU deployed will be leased, with payments spread across their useful life, around five years. OpenAI delays costs by leasing Nvidia chips instead of buying Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, described the deal as “monumental in size.” He said building a single gigawatt AI data center could cost about $50 billion. Out of that, around $35 billion goes straight to Nvidia for its chips. The remaining is for everything else. But OpenAI isn’t paying that up front. By leasing the GPUs instead, the company avoids taking a financial hit all at once. OpenAI will get an initial $10 billion from the deal soon. That money helps kick off the first wave of deployment. And while some of the funds will be used for hiring, operations, and other expenses, the majority of it will go straight to compute. More specifically, to Nvidia’s processors. These GPUs are the engines behind AI training, powering models like ChatGPT and everything that runs on them. Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s chief financial officer, said in Abilene that the plan wouldn’t be possible without partners. She pointed to Oracle, which is leasing the Abilene data center, and Nvidia , which is providing equity up front in return for long-term payments. “Folks like Oracle are putting their balance sheets to work to create these incredible data centers you see behind us,” Sarah said. “In Nvidia’s case, they’re putting together some equity to get it jumpstarted, but importantly, they will get paid for all those chips as those chips get deployed.” Debt talks begin while Nvidia chips eat most of OpenAI’s cash OpenAI is not profitable. It doesn’t have positive cash flow, and it doesn’t hold investment-grade credit. That’s why financing data centers through equity is costly. Executives inside the company said they’re preparing to take on debt to handle the rest of the expansion. And thanks to the lease structure with Nvidia, banks are more comfortable lending. The terms look better when a company isn’t trying to buy everything outright. Sarah said the compute shortage is the bigger issue. “What I think we should all be focused on today is the fact that there’s not enough compute,” she said. “As the business grows, we will be more than capable of paying for what is in our future — more compute, more revenue.” But not everyone is thrilled about the way this is structured. Nvidia’s $4.3 trillion market cap has been built on selling chips to OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. At the same time, OpenAI’s $500 billion private valuation is only possible because of cash injections from Microsoft and others. That money doesn’t sit around. It goes right back to Nvidia. Jamie Zakalik, an analyst at Neuberger Berman, told CNBC the deal shows OpenAI raising capital and pouring it straight into the same company providing the tech. “It’s goosing up everyone’s earnings and everyone’s numbers,” Jamie said. “But it’s not actually creating anything.” When asked about those concerns, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman didn’t push back. “We need to keep selling services to consumers and businesses — and building these great new products that people pay us a lot of money for,” Sam said. “As long as that keeps happening, that pays for a lot of these data centers, a lot of chips.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Reports suggested a significant shake-up in the digital finance landscape. However, Dunamu, the operator of South Korea’s leading crypto exchange Upbit, has now stepped forward to clarify the situation. Unpacking the Dunamu Naver Acquisition Rumors Recent media reports created a stir, indicating that Dunamu could be acquired by Naver Group. Specifically, these rumors suggested a comprehensive stock swap between Dunamu and Naver Financial, the entity behind Naver Pay. The proposed deal would reportedly make Dunamu a wholly-owned subsidiary of Naver Financial. This move would effectively integrate Dunamu into the broader Naver Group. It’s important to remember that Naver is the largest shareholder in Naver Financial, giving it significant influence. Despite these detailed reports, Dunamu has officially stated that nothing has been confirmed regarding a definitive Dunamu Naver acquisition . This provides a crucial counterpoint to the swirling speculation. Beyond Acquisition: What About Cooperation? While an outright acquisition remains unconfirmed, Dunamu did acknowledge ongoing discussions with Naver Pay. These talks are focused on various potential collaborations, extending beyond their existing partnerships. Currently, Dunamu and Naver Pay are already working together on several initiatives, including: Stablecoin development: Exploring the potential of digital currencies pegged to traditional assets. Unlisted stock trading: Facilitating transactions for shares not yet available on public exchanges. The company emphasized that while discussions are indeed happening, no specific details or agreements have been finalized. Therefore, the scope and nature of future cooperation are still taking shape. Why Does a Dunamu Naver Acquisition Matter? The mere rumor of a Dunamu Naver acquisition highlights the significant influence both companies wield in their respective sectors. Dunamu is a powerhouse in the South Korean crypto market, primarily through its Upbit exchange. On the other hand, Naver is a dominant tech giant, with Naver Pay being a leading digital payment service. A closer integration or acquisition could: Create Synergies: Combine Dunamu’s blockchain expertise with Naver’s vast user base and payment infrastructure. Expand Market Reach: Potentially introduce cryptocurrency services to a broader mainstream audience through Naver’s ecosystem. Impact Competition: Reshape the competitive landscape in both fintech and crypto industries in South Korea. However, such a deal would also face considerable challenges, including regulatory hurdles and complex integration processes. The market watches closely for any definitive announcements. The Future of Dunamu and Naver’s Relationship As of now, the narrative is clear: a Dunamu Naver acquisition is not confirmed. Dunamu has directly addressed the rumors, asserting that while cooperation talks are ongoing, no definitive deal is in place. The focus appears to be on expanding their existing collaborative efforts rather than a full merger. This situation underscores the dynamic nature of corporate partnerships in the fast-evolving digital economy. Investors and users alike will need to stay tuned for official updates from both Dunamu and Naver regarding their future plans. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is Dunamu being acquired by Naver?

While Binance traders are exhibiting a bullish stance, traders from other exchanges are still showing a degree of hesitation. Binance Traders Expecting Bitcoin Price Surge According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, fresh derivatives data from Binance is signaling shifting market dynamics – specifically, the recent BTC funding rate on Binance points toward traders taking a bullish stance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Above Mid-Term Holder Breakeven – Is A Fresh Rally Brewing? On the contrary, the BTC funding rate from other exchanges, such as OKX, Bybit, and Deribit, suggests that traders on these platforms are still uncertain about taking any directional bet. As of September 23, the BTC perpetual funding rate on Binance climbed to +0.0084%, suggesting that the long positions are dominant and traders are willing to pay a premium to maintain their bullish bets. It is worth highlighting that the increase in funding rate is not an isolated event, as it suggests a positive seven-day change, indicating strengthening conviction among Binance traders. For comparison, the BTC funding rate on OKX is currently hovering at -0.0001%, while on Bybit it sits at 0.0015%. Finally, Deribit shows a funding rate of 0.0019%. The analyst added: This isn’t just a difference in numbers; it’s a difference in narrative. While funding rates on OKX and Bybit have actually decreased over the last seven days, Binance’s rate has climbed. For the uninitiated, funding rates can be viewed as a real-time gauge of trader sentiment in the perpetual swaps market. A strong positive rate like that of Binance, which diverges from the rest of the market, points toward aggressive bullish speculation. Is BTC About To Make A Move? In a separate CryptoQuant post, contributor XWIN Research Japan noted that Bitcoin’s implied volatility has dropped to its lowest level since 2023. Back then, the lull in the market was followed by an explosive rally of 325%, which propelled BTC from $29,000 to $124,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Bearish Pressure As Exchange Inflows Stay Elevated – Will BTC Lose $112,000 Support? The analyst added that the total Bitcoin exchange reserves continue to deplete at a rapid pace, hitting new multi-year lows. Historically, such a fall in BTC exchange reserves has preceded supply squeezes, leading to a dramatic rise in demand. That said, the overall sentiment toward BTC appears to be cold at present. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index suggests that investors are fearful of entering the market, which may offer a good opportunity to accumulate BTC at current market prices. However, fresh data from BTC wallets confirms that new wallets – those that are less than a month old – are starting to buy the top digital asset. At press time, BTC trades at $113,796, up 1% in the past 24 hours.

52225563,588339,1758772837,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52225563.jpeg,"Ripple Powers New Offramp For BlackRock, VanEck Tokenized Fund",https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-new-offramp-blackrock-vaneck-tokenized-fund/,"Ripple has added another institutional rail to its stablecoin strategy: through an integration with Securitize, holders of BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized US Treasuries can now redeem fund shares for Ripple USD (RLUSD) around the clock—initially on Ethereum, with support for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in the pipeline. BlackRock And VanEck Turn To Ripple’s RLUSD In a press release dated September 23, Ripple and Securitize said a new smart-contract flow “would allow holders of BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL to exchange their shares … for Ripple USD (RLUSD),” describing the mechanism as “an additional stablecoin off ramp for BUIDL and VBILL tokenized short term treasury funds.” The companies emphasized continuous availability—“24/7”—and framed the upgrade as programmable liquidity for compliant, on-chain investment products. Securitize also confirmed it is integrating with the XRP Ledger “to expand access and bring new utility to the XRPL ecosystem.” Jack McDonald, Ripple’s SVP of Stablecoins, positioned the move as a bridge between tokenized funds and transactional money: “RLUSD is for institutional use, offering regulatory clarity, stability, and real utility. As adoption grows, partnerships with trusted platforms like Securitize are key to unlocking new liquidity and enterprise-grade use cases.” On X, McDonald distilled the news for market participants: “RLUSD is now a key stablecoin offramp for BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized fund holders. The integration is starting with ETH, though Securitize is planning to integrate with the XRP Ledger.” Ripple President Monica Long linked the Securitize integration to a broader RLUSD tokenization push announced the prior week with DBS and Franklin Templeton, where RLUSD serves as a “liquid, stable and compliant exchange mechanism for tokenized assets in lending and trading use cases.” “This week, Securitize added RLUSD as a new offramp for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized funds,” she noted. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse underscored the 24/7 redemption promise and the XRPL roadmap: “Very excited to share that BlackRock’s BUIDL and @VanEck_US’s VBILL tokenized fund holders can redeem shares for RLUSD/ETH 24/7 365 through Securitize, and soon to come RLUSD/XRPL. Enterprise-grade instant onchain liquidity at your fingertips. That’s real utility.” The companies framed the design as explicitly regulatory-first. Ripple said RLUSD is issued under a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) trust charter, with “1:1 USD backing by high-quality liquid assets, strict reserve management and asset segregation, third-party attestations and clear redemption rights.” Ripple added that since launch in late 2024, RLUSD has integrated into DeFi and cross-border payment flows and surpassed $700 million in market capitalization. For tokenized funds, the off-ramp matters because it stitches together yield-bearing on-chain treasuries with settlement-grade stablecoin liquidity. BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL are tokenized short-term US Treasury strategies issued through Securitize on public blockchains; the new workflow lets qualified holders convert fund shares into RLUSD without banking hours friction, potentially improving collateral mobility for trading, lending, repo and treasury operations. Ripple Puts New Focus On Tokenization The development also follows Ripple’s tie-up with DBS and Franklin Templeton , which is listing Franklin’s sgBENJI token on the DBS Digital Exchange alongside RLUSD to enable swapping between the tokenized fund and the stablecoin, and to explore using tokenized fund units as repo collateral—an example of how banks envisage tokenization rails meeting institutional liquidity needs. While the initial redemption path is live on Ethereum via Securitize, both firms signaled that XRPL integration is next, aligning with Ripple’s push to make RLUSD natively useful across multiple venues. If executed, XRPL support would extend the same institutional redemption mechanics to a different settlement environment—one that Ripple and parts of the treasury-tokenization market already touch via custody, payments, and prior Franklin Templeton XRPL issuance plans. Notably, BlackRock will be represented at Ripple Swell 2025 in New York on November 4–5 at Convene Hudson Yards. Maxwell Stein, BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, is slated to speak in a session titled “The Impact of Tokenized Financial Assets on Capital Markets,” alongside Rory Callagy of Moody’s.

52225667,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84336,1758772929,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: XRP Price Breakout Is Coming. Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-price-breakout-is-coming-heres-the-signal/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a well-known analyst, has shared his latest view on XRP using a chart projecting a major breakout. He shared a chart showing a technical formation that suggests price movement may soon accelerate. The chart highlights a descending triangle pattern that has formed over the past several weeks, with XRP trading between steadily lower highs and consistent support levels. It emphasizes price compression, a condition often associated with an eventual breakout. In this case, the descending trendline from above converges with horizontal support near $2.7. Steph’s chart projects a scenario where XRP could touch this level once more before rallying sharply to higher targets. #XRP BREAKOUT INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/T7FRBjUCcQ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 23, 2025 Current Pattern and Market Context The descending triangle displayed in the post reflects a period of consolidation . The digital asset began forming this structure in July, following a sharp rise to its all-time high . The asset moved into this contracting structure, with sellers consistently pressuring the price at lower points while buyers defended a defined support line. This has led to sideways action for several months. Such a pattern typically indicates that a decisive move is nearing. Traders often monitor these levels to identify when momentum is about to shift. The chart suggests that XRP may soon break out of this tightening range, either confirming continued strength or revealing further weakness. Steph’s projection leans toward an upward resolution. XRP’s Next Target The chart provides a clear upward trajectory for XRP once it breaks out of this consolidation phase. Steph’s chart suggests the asset could surpass $4.5, potentially reaching $5, a level other experts have recently predicted . XRP is currently trading at $2.84, and a climb to $5 represents a 76.06% surge for the digital asset. Traders considering these targets will likely watch closely for confirmation of strength above the descending trendline, as that would serve as a signal that the projected path may be underway. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the Structure Matters Periods of consolidation following strong rallies can act as staging grounds for the next leg of a move. The extended sideways action has kept XRP trading in a narrow range, allowing the market to digest earlier gains. For analysts such as Steph, the pattern forming now represents a point of interest because it suggests an imminent resolution. Many analysts share Steph’s bullish outlook for XRP. The structure provides traders with reference points for risk management and opportunity. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The price is now struggling to clear $3.00 and might decline again below the $2.80 zone. XRP price is moving lower below the $2.920 support zone. The price is now trading near $2.90 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it dips below $2.850. XRP Price Faces Hurdles XRP price found support near $2.680 and recently started a recovery wave, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to surpass the $2.80 and $2.85 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the main decline from the $3.138 swing high to the $2.678 low. However, the bears are active near the $3.00 resistance. The price faced rejection near $3.00 and reacted to the downside. The price is now trading near $2.90 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.95 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.9620 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the main decline from the $3.138 swing high to the $2.678 low. A clear move above the $2.9620 resistance might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.050 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.120. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.9620 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.880 level. The next major support is near the $2.850 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.850 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.780. The next major support sits near the $2.70 zone, below which the price could gain bearish momentum. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.

After a brief pause, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have roared back with a substantial $241 million in net inflows. This impressive turnaround marks the end of a two-day streak of outflows, signaling renewed investor confidence and a significant positive shift in the market. It’s a moment that has many in the crypto community buzzing about what this fresh capital infusion means for the future of digital assets. Why are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attracting Fresh Capital? The recent surge in capital flowing into US spot Bitcoin ETFs is a clear indicator of strong demand and a bullish sentiment returning to the market. On September 24, these exchange-traded funds collectively welcomed $241 million, showcasing a robust appetite from investors. This influx is particularly noteworthy as it halts a period of net withdrawals, suggesting that many see current prices as an attractive entry point or a reaffirmation of Bitcoin’s long-term value. Leading the charge among these funds was BlackRock’s IBIT, which alone captured an impressive $130 million in net inflows. This dominant performance highlights the strong brand recognition and trust that institutional giants bring to the crypto space. Following closely, Fidelity’s FBTC secured $29.7 million, demonstrating its significant role in attracting retail and institutional capital. Grayscale’s Mini BTC also made a notable contribution with $13.6 million in inflows, further diversifying the sources of new investment. BlackRock’s IBIT: Led with $130 million, underscoring institutional confidence. Fidelity’s FBTC: Attracted $29.7 million, showing broad investor appeal. Grayscale’s Mini BTC: Added $13.6 million, contributing to overall positive momentum. Understanding the Dynamics of Bitcoin ETF Inflows The return to positive inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs is more than just a number; it reflects evolving market dynamics and growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. When funds like these experience significant inflows, it typically suggests that investors, both individual and institutional, are actively seeking exposure to Bitcoin through regulated and easily accessible investment vehicles. This trend is crucial for the overall maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Historically, market sentiment can shift rapidly. The previous two days of outflows might have caused some concern, but the swift reversal with such a substantial inflow demonstrates resilience. This pattern often indicates that dips are being viewed as buying opportunities rather than reasons for prolonged withdrawal. Moreover, the increasing availability and liquidity of US spot Bitcoin ETFs are making it easier for a wider range of investors to participate in the Bitcoin market without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. What truly drives these movements? It’s a combination of factors: Macroeconomic trends influencing investor appetite for alternative assets. Regulatory clarity, which provides a safer environment for traditional finance players. Growing awareness and education about Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. What Do These US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Trends Mean for Investors? For current and prospective investors, the robust inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs offer several key insights. Firstly, it reaffirms the increasing institutional validation of Bitcoin. When major players like BlackRock and Fidelity see consistent demand for their Bitcoin-backed products, it lends significant credibility to the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This validation can pave the way for even greater mainstream adoption. Secondly, these inflows often act as a barometer for broader market sentiment. A sustained period of positive inflows could indicate a strengthening belief in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, potentially leading to increased price stability and growth. However, it is essential for investors to remember that the crypto market can still be volatile. While ETFs offer a regulated entry point, the underlying asset, Bitcoin, remains subject to market fluctuations. Actionable insights for those considering investment: Do Your Research: Understand the specific ETF you are investing in and its underlying mechanics. Consider Diversification: While promising, Bitcoin should be part of a diversified investment portfolio. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, regulatory updates, and global economic indicators that can impact Bitcoin’s value.

What began as a speculative asset for individual investors is now increasingly finding a home on corporate balance sheets, marking a pivotal moment for the digital currency. Why Are Public Companies Holding Bitcoin? The latest data highlights this significant move: over 50 publicly listed companies have now accumulated more than 1,000 BTC each. Furthermore, the top 100 firms involved in Bitcoin investment each hold over 100 BTC. This isn’t just a handful of early adopters anymore; it’s a broad and accelerating trend among major corporations. But what’s driving this institutional embrace? Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a strong hedge against inflation, especially in an era of quantitative easing and rising fiat currency concerns. It’s seen as a store of value, similar to digital gold. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to traditional portfolios offers diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall risk and enhancing returns. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Investing in Bitcoin aligns companies with technological innovation and positions them at the forefront of the digital economy. It signals a forward-thinking approach. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, attracting companies seeking substantial returns on their treasury assets. The Growing Wave of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption This increasing commitment from public companies hold Bitcoin is a testament to the digital asset’s maturing ecosystem. Pioneering firms have led the charge, demonstrating that it is feasible and potentially profitable to integrate Bitcoin into corporate treasury strategies. This growing adoption by institutional players provides a layer of legitimacy and stability to the cryptocurrency market. The fact that so many significant entities are now involved means that Bitcoin is no longer solely a retail phenomenon. Instead, it is becoming an integral part of the global financial landscape. This institutional validation can help to reduce perceived risks and encourage even more conservative companies to consider similar moves in the future. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Public Companies Holding Bitcoin While the benefits are clear, public companies hold Bitcoin also face unique challenges. Volatility remains a primary concern, as large price swings can impact quarterly earnings and balance sheet valuations. Regulatory uncertainty is another factor, with different jurisdictions adopting varying stances on cryptocurrency assets. However, the opportunities often outweigh these challenges. For instance, the potential for significant capital appreciation can boost shareholder value. Furthermore, being an early mover in this space can enhance a company’s brand image as innovative and adaptable. Companies are increasingly developing sophisticated strategies to manage these holdings, including custodial solutions and risk management frameworks. Risk Management: Companies are implementing robust strategies to mitigate volatility, such as dollar-cost averaging and secure cold storage solutions. Regulatory Compliance: Staying abreast of evolving regulations is crucial, requiring dedicated legal and compliance teams. Public Perception: Communicating the rationale behind Bitcoin investments transparently helps manage stakeholder expectations and public perception. What Does This Mean for the Broader Market? The increasing number of public companies hold Bitcoin sends a powerful signal to the global financial markets. It suggests a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition and its role in the future economy. This institutional interest contributes to deeper liquidity, greater market efficiency, and potentially less susceptibility to extreme price manipulations. For individual investors, this trend can be seen as a strong vote of confidence, potentially fostering greater trust and encouraging broader adoption. It highlights Bitcoin’s transition from a niche digital asset to a recognized, albeit still volatile, financial instrument with significant institutional backing. Conclusion: A New Era of Corporate Finance The remarkable surge in the number of public companies holding significant amounts of Bitcoin underscores a profound shift in corporate financial strategy. From inflation hedging to diversification and embracing innovation, the motivations are clear. While challenges exist, the opportunities presented by Bitcoin are compelling enough for a growing number of firms to integrate it into their treasury operations.

While many of the industry’s titans are busy striking multi-billion-dollar deals to solidify their positions, Google Cloud is charting a remarkably different, yet equally ambitious, course. It’s not just about securing today’s giants; it’s about brilliantly capturing tomorrow’s innovators – the burgeoning AI Startups that will define the next era of technology. This strategic pivot has profound implications for the entire Cloud Market and the future of Generative AI , signaling a bold wager on the power of emerging talent. The Shifting Tides: Why Google Cloud is Targeting AI Startups The AI revolution is here, and it’s reshaping industries at an unprecedented pace. The colossal partnerships dominating headlines, such as the recent $100 billion alliance between Nvidia and OpenAI for massive chip purchases, demonstrate a trend towards consolidation among established players. These deals, while impressive in scale, often involve non-exclusive agreements, creating a complex web of dependencies. However, Google Cloud, under the strategic guidance of COO Francis deSouza, sees a different path to leadership. DeSouza, with a rich background spanning genomics (Illumina) and AI safety (Synth Labs), understands the transformative power of machine learning from multiple vantage points. Now, at Google Cloud, he’s orchestrating a massive wager on what he calls AI’s “second wave” – focusing intently on the next generation of AI Startups . DeSouza’s conviction is backed by compelling data: Nine out of the top 10 AI labs currently leverage Google’s infrastructure. Nearly all Generative AI unicorns run on Google Cloud. A staggering 60% of all generative AI startups worldwide have chosen Google as their cloud provider. Google Cloud has secured an impressive $58 billion in new revenue commitments over the next two years, more than double its current annual run rate. “AI is resetting the cloud market, and Google Cloud is leading the way, especially with startups,” deSouza notes. This understated delivery masks an ambitious strategy: to home in on upstarts while the biggest players are busy striking lucrative but non-exclusive partnerships. This approach acknowledges that in today’s dynamic tech environment, a startup can evolve into a multi-billion-dollar enterprise in a remarkably short period. Capturing these future unicorns early could prove far more valuable than vying for today’s established giants. The Competitive Landscape: Mega-Deals Reshaping the Cloud Market To truly appreciate Google Cloud’s distinctive strategy, it’s essential to understand the scale of consolidation sweeping across the AI Infrastructure and Cloud Market . Major players are making enormous bets, cementing partnerships that redefine industry dynamics. Here’s a snapshot of the current high-stakes environment: Partnership Key Players Value / Commitment Impact on Cloud Market AI Chip Alliance Nvidia, OpenAI $100 Billion Deepens mutual dependence, secures massive chip purchases for advanced AI. Cloud & AI Power Microsoft, OpenAI ~$14 Billion Fundamentally reshaped the cloud market, integrating AI deeply into Microsoft’s offerings. Customized AI Amazon, Anthropic $8 Billion Secured deep hardware customizations, tailoring AI training to Amazon’s infrastructure. Enterprise AI Oracle, OpenAI $30 Billion (initial), $300 Billion (5-year from 2027) Emerged as a surprise winner, securing massive long-term commitments for AI workloads. Hybrid Cloud AI Meta, Google Cloud $10 Billion Meta leverages Google Cloud despite building its own infrastructure, highlighting hybrid strategies. “Stargate” Project Trump Admin, SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle $500 Billion Adds another layer to these interlocking partnerships, potentially shaping future infrastructure. These gigantic deals might initially appear threatening for Google Cloud, suggesting it’s being cut out of some frenzied dealmaking. However, Google’s strategy indicates a clear understanding that while these partnerships are lucrative, they are often non-exclusive and focused on existing giants. This leaves a significant opening for Google to cultivate the next wave of innovators. How Google Cloud Empowers the Next Wave of AI Startups Instead of battling for established titans, Google Cloud is signing smaller, yet highly promising, companies like Loveable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners.” This approach requires no major upfront investments from the startups, making it an attractive proposition for lean, agile teams. It’s a pragmatic reflection of the market: capturing future unicorns before they mature could prove to be a superior long-term strategy. The support for AI Startups extends far beyond simple customer acquisition. Google offers a comprehensive ecosystem designed to foster growth and innovation: Generous Cloud Credits: Startups receive $350,000 in cloud credits, significantly reducing their initial operational costs and allowing them to focus resources on development. Access to Technical Teams: Direct access to Google’s world-class technical experts helps startups navigate complex challenges and optimize their AI models. Go-to-Market Support: Integration into Google’s marketplace provides crucial visibility and pathways to potential customers, accelerating growth. “No Compromise” AI Stack: Google Cloud provides a complete AI stack – from custom chips (TPUs) to models (Gemini) and applications – with an “open ethos.” This ensures customers have choice and flexibility at every layer, a critical factor for innovative Generative AI development. “Companies love the fact that they can get access to our AI stack, they can get access to our teams to understand where our technologies are going,” deSouza emphasizes. “They also love that they’re getting access to enterprise grade Google class infrastructure.” This combination of robust technology and dedicated support creates a powerful incentive for emerging AI companies. The “Open Ethos” and Google’s Unique AI Infrastructure Google Cloud’s commitment to an “open ethos” is a cornerstone of its strategy. This is particularly evident in its approach to AI Infrastructure . While Google develops its own cutting-edge AI models like Gemini, it also hosts competitors like Anthropic’s Claude model through its Vertex AI platform. This seemingly paradoxical stance – competing while enabling – is a deliberate choice. Google’s infrastructure advantage became even clearer with recent reports revealing its behind-the-scenes efforts to expand its custom AI chip business. Google has begun placing its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in other cloud providers’ data centers, including a significant agreement with Fluidstack for a New York facility, backed by up to $3.2 billion in financial support. This move positions Google’s custom hardware as a foundational component across the broader Cloud Market , even for its rivals. The company’s history of open-source contributions, from Kubernetes to the foundational “Attention is All You Need” paper that enabled the transformer architecture underlying most modern AI, further underscores this philosophy. More recently, Google published an open-source protocol called Agent-to-Agent (A2A) for inter-agent communication, demonstrating its continued commitment to openness even in highly competitive areas like Generative AI development. “We have made the explicit choice over the years to be open at every layer of the stack, and we know that this means companies can absolutely take our technology and use it to build a competitor at the next layer,” deSouza acknowledges. “That’s been happening for decades. That’s something we are okay with.” This willingness to foster an ecosystem, even at the risk of enabling future competitors, is a defining characteristic of Google Cloud’s long-term vision. Navigating Regulatory Scrutiny and Future Prospects for the Cloud Market Google Cloud’s aggressive courtship of AI Startups comes at a critical juncture, particularly with ongoing regulatory scrutiny. A recent federal court ruling in the government’s search monopoly case highlighted concerns about Google leveraging its search dominance to stifle competition in AI. Critics worry that Google’s vast data trove provides an unfair advantage and that the company might replicate monopolistic tactics. However, by positioning itself as an open platform that empowers rather than controls the next generation of AI companies, Google Cloud may be subtly demonstrating to regulators that it fosters competition. Its strategy of supporting a diverse range of Generative AI startups, providing them with essential AI Infrastructure and resources, can be seen as a powerful counter-narrative to claims of anti-competitive behavior. This strategic move not only secures future revenue streams but also strengthens Google’s defense in the face of regulatory pressure. DeSouza, for his part, remains focused on the positive, transformative outcomes that Google Cloud can enable. He envisions a future where Google Cloud powers groundbreaking research into major diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and accelerates climate technologies. “We want to work very hard to make sure that we are pioneering the technologies that will enable that work,” he affirms. This long-term vision, coupled with a robust strategy for capturing emerging talent, positions Google Cloud as a formidable force in shaping the future of the Cloud Market . Actionable Insights for Innovators and Businesses For innovators and businesses, especially those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space looking to leverage AI, Google Cloud’s strategy presents a compelling proposition: For AI Startups: Google Cloud offers a unique blend of financial support, technical expertise, and a flexible, open AI Infrastructure that can accelerate development and market entry. The focus on early-stage companies means tailored support for rapid growth. For Established Enterprises: The competition fostered by Google’s approach ensures a dynamic and innovative Cloud Market , offering more choice and advanced services for integrating Generative AI into existing operations. For Investors: Google Cloud’s aggressive pursuit of promising AI Startups indicates where the next wave of innovation is likely to emerge, offering insights into potential investment opportunities within the broader AI ecosystem. Google Cloud is not merely participating in the AI race; it’s strategically redefining its role within the Cloud Market . By focusing on nurturing the next generation of AI Startups and providing an unparalleled AI Infrastructure , it’s making a profound statement about the future of technology. This isn’t just about market share; it’s about shaping the very fabric of innovation for decades to come, especially in the burgeoning field of Generative AI .

At the time of writing, XLM trades around $0.36, down 0.56% on the daily charts and 4.2% weekly. Related Reading: XRP Gets A Retirement Twist: Expert Calls It A 401(k) Despite the short-term weakness, analysts suggest that the altcoin’s recent bounce could set the stage for a move toward $0.50 and beyond. The $0.37 level has historically acted as both resistance and support, making it a decisive zone for future price action. A reclaim above this mark could push XLM toward the long-standing descending resistance near $0.48, with a breakout potentially triggering a stronger rally. Technical Indicators Signal Mixed Outlook Market data highlights both caution and opportunity for Stellar traders. Momentum indicators remain balanced, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) close to neutral at 50 and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) slightly above zero. While these readings suggest indecision, the broader technical setup indicates a potential bullish reversal. Analysts also observe a developing wedge pattern on the daily chart, which often signals a possible upside breakout. If bulls can sustain momentum and push the price above $0.41, the next targets are between $0.58 and $0.80. Conversely, failing to hold above $0.35 could expose the token to declines toward $0.30 or even $0.21. XLM's price moving sideways on the daily chart.

The fund, created by 21Shares, has appeared on a key U.S. financial platform that prepares for market trading. The Dogecoin ETF is still awaiting approval, and the final decision rests with U.S. regulators as they continue their review. 21Shares Dogecoin ETF TDOG Appears On DTCC Platform Swiss asset management company 21Shares has placed its new Dogecoin ETF , trading under the ticker TDOG, on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) platform. By appearing on the DTCC’s “Active and Pre-Launch” list, the Dogecoin ETF is now visible to broker-dealers, who can begin operational checks, such as setting up the ticker and completing clearing procedures. The listing mirrors what happened in the past with spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, where DTCC listings came before official trading. However, it is essential to note that this listing itself does not mean the SEC has approved the Dogecoin ETF . It is part of the standard process that sets the stage but does not guarantee the outcome. Seeing TDOG appear on the DTCC website also highlights the rising level of institutional attention around Dogecoin. Grayscale filed a spot Dogecoin ETF shortly after the SEC delayed 21Shares’ filing. Meanwhile, Rex-Osprey launched a hybrid Dogecoin ETF last week, which saw higher-than-expected trading on its first day. A listing like this helps confirm that investor demand is strong enough to support such a product; however, the actual launch still depends on the subsequent regulatory step. If approval comes and trading begins, TDOG ETF could increase confidence in Dogecoin as a legitimate asset and expand its role in the cryptocurrency market. SEC Approval Remains The Final Step Before Trading Although the Dogecoin ETF now appears on the DTCC platform, it cannot trade without approval from the SEC. The regulator is carefully reviewing the filing from 21Shares to ensure it meets all requirements. Even with the DTCC listing, the ETF’s legal status remains unchanged. The DTCC step is progressing, but trading will only commence once the SEC gives its official approval. The process at the SEC usually involves public comment periods, agency feedback, and detailed compliance checks. It can take time, and approval timelines are often unpredictable . The SEC has already pushed back its decision once, noting it needed more time to review the fund’s compliance with Nasdaq’s rules. If the SEC grants approval, the Dogecoin ETF would be listed on U.S. exchanges, providing investors with direct exposure to Dogecoin in a regulated product . The 21Shares Dogecoin ETF (TDOG) is now available on the DTCC platform. For now, the TDOG ETF is still under review. Its future depends entirely on the SEC’s decision, which is the final step before it can trade.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-25 05:00:58

BTC is now lagging behind money supply growth by around 70 days, whereas gold has maintained an almost perfect correlation. It is a tale of “cross-asset correlations amid secular dollar weakness and geopolitical risk,” said Consorti, who added, “gold is high beta risk-off, BTC is high beta risk-on.” Bitcoin has been trading more like a high-risk tech stock rather than a safe haven inflation hedge. More Liquidity Not Benefitting Bitcoin Global money supply increases when central banks print more fiat for monetary easing policies. This increases liquidity in the financial system, which enables more money for allocation to riskier assets such as crypto. Bitcoin has not tracked global M2 with a ~70-day lag since early May.

It has reached an all-time high in the United States this week of around $22.2 trillion, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve. M2 expansion started in early 2024 and has increased by more than 7% since then. It has been described as “relentless debasement baked into the system,” as every new dollar printed dilutes the old ones. Additionally, the US dollar has weakened significantly this year. The dollar index (DXY) – a measure of the greenback against a basket of currencies – has slumped 12% since the beginning of this year to its lowest level since early 2022 this month. This should all be gravy for Bitcoin, but the asset has remained sideways for the past three months and is 9% down from its all-time high. Goldbug Peter Schiff claimed it was already in a bear market, stating that it has dropped 20% against gold since its August peak. What the crypto critic failed to mention is that BTC has gained 78% over the past 12 months, whereas gold is up 42%. Whether you like it or not, bitcoin’s value is very much linked to its scarcity.

Its efficiency, speed, and cost advantages position it as a practical tool for financial institutions seeking to move away from legacy systems. With XRP’s growing prominence in the cross-border payment market, SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a prominent crypto researcher, has shared an excerpt from the Review of Banking & Financial Law highlighting Ripple’s potential role in international payments. The excerpt included Morgan Stanley’s analysis of Ripple’s distributed ledger and its capacity to act as an alternative to existing systems such as SWIFT. By sharing this, SMQKE presented how traditional financial research and institutional perspectives view Ripple’s technology. “Morgan Stanley considers Ripple to be a leading international payment alternative to SWIFT.” Documented. https://t.co/FEi7axe5pk pic.twitter.com/oVtaT3WwHY — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 23, 2025 Key Insights from the Document The highlighted text reveals that “Morgan Stanley has stated that adopting a Ripple-like payment system could ‘shorten settlement periods, speed up transactions and reduce the risk of fraud.’” The same section also noted that “Morgan Stanley considers Ripple to be a leading international payment alternative to Swift .” This evaluation places Ripple and XRP, which powers its payment network, in a unique position within the financial sector because it is being recognized not just as another blockchain project but as a direct challenger to one of the most established payment networks in the world. Morgan Stanley’s analysis suggests that Ripple’s efficiency provides a practical solution for banks . The ability to reduce settlement times and lower risks could encourage adoption among institutions seeking faster, more secure transactions. Such statements carry weight when they come from a leading investment bank, as they suggest that XRP is not only being studied but is also being considered as a realistic option for global payment infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Matters for XRP Recognition from a major financial institution provides validation of XRP’s utility. If banks adopt Ripple’s system more widely, XRP could benefit directly from higher usage in settlement processes. The cost savings highlighted in the document, such as lowering remittance fees and increasing the funds received by end users, also illustrate practical value that could encourage growth in adoption. This acknowledgment also demonstrates that XRP is being compared to existing global solutions rather than just other digital assets. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have their strengths, Morgan Stanley’s reference to XRP as a leading international payment alternative places it as a strong competitor in a space traditionally dominated by centralized systems. That positioning strengthens the case for XRP’s relevance in future financial infrastructure . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo asking agencies to prepare plans for staff reductions and furloughs if a spending bill is not passed next week. The government is reportedly expected to run out of money by the end of September. To prevent the resulting shutdown, Congress must either approve a short-term funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, or pass 12 full-year funding bills. Since lawmakers won’t finish the full-year bills before the deadline, a temporary funding stopgap is needed. More importantly, to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to pass funding bills, support from both parties is usually necessary. BTC, ETH under pressure Ether fell over 3% in Asia, almost testing $4,000 for the first time Aug. 8, with bitcoin (BTC) falling over 1% to under $112,000. Other major tokens such as XRP (XRP), solana (SOL) and dogecoin (DOGE) fell by 2.6% to 3%. Solana's SOL appeared set to break below $200. The CoinDesk 20 Index was down 2% at 3,940 points. Meanwhile, futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, traded flat to positive. Although the exact cause of the cautious crypto market sentiment was not clear at the time of writing, growing concerns about a potential government shutdown may have contributed to the risk-averse mood among investors. Furthermore, overnight comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly reiterated her support for further rate cuts, but declined to provide a timeline, instead stressing data dependence, which may have hurt sentiment. The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points on Sept. 17 while hinting at two more rate cuts by the year's end. Since then, policymakers, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have signaled a cautious approach to future rate cuts. Seven Fed officials, including the New York Fed's Williams, are scheduled to speak on Thursday. Meanwhile, traders are awaiting Friday's PCE data, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. ""If inflation pressures appear contained, markets may interpret this as room for further Fed cuts, providing liquidity tailwinds into Q4. That could be the catalyst for BTC to attempt a long-anticipated breakout,"" the market insights team at Singapore-based QCP Capital said.",Markets|Ether|Bitcoin|Markets|XRP|Solana|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-25 05:06:59

This significant shift has caught the attention of investors worldwide, sparking discussions about market stability and future trends. On platforms like Binance, ETH was recently observed trading at $3,995, reflecting a notable 3.66% decline. This movement is more than just a number; it signals a potential shift in momentum for the second-largest cryptocurrency. What Triggered This Urgent Ethereum Price Drop? The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic environment, and an Ethereum price drop often results from a confluence of factors. While no single event can be definitively pinpointed for this recent dip below $4,000, several influences are typically at play: Broader Market Sentiment: A general downturn in the wider crypto market, often led by Bitcoin’s performance, can drag ETH prices down. Macroeconomic Concerns: Global economic indicators, such as inflation reports or central bank policy decisions, frequently impact investor appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, some investors may choose to sell off their holdings to realize profits, leading to temporary price corrections. Technical Resistance: For many traders, $4,000 represented a psychological and technical support level. Breaking below it can trigger further sell-offs as stop-loss orders are activated. This complex interplay of forces means that understanding market movements requires a holistic view, looking beyond just the immediate price action. How Does an ETH Price Dip Impact Your Portfolio? For many investors, seeing an Ethereum price drop can naturally cause concern. However, it’s important to approach such market movements with a strategic mindset. A dip can present both challenges and opportunities. Challenges: Portfolio Value Reduction: The most immediate impact is a decrease in the fiat value of your ETH holdings. Emotional Stress: Market volatility can be stressful, potentially leading to impulsive decisions. Opportunities: “Buy the Dip”: For those with capital, a lower price point can be an attractive entry or accumulation opportunity. Rebalancing: It might be a good time to reassess your portfolio allocation and adjust your positions. Understanding your personal risk tolerance and investment goals is paramount during these times. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Consider After an Ethereum Price Drop? When facing market volatility, especially an unexpected Ethereum price drop , making informed decisions is key. Instead of reacting emotionally, consider these actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum. What are its long-term prospects? Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term market fluctuations and Ethereum’s long-term potential as a foundational blockchain technology. Many seasoned investors advocate for a “HODL” strategy during dips, focusing on the asset’s future utility and adoption. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of volatility over time. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of major crypto news, technological developments, and broader economic trends. However, avoid letting constant news cycles dictate your strategy. Remember, market corrections are a natural part of any asset class, and crypto is no exception. They often precede periods of recovery and growth. The recent Ethereum price drop below $4,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency market. While such movements can be unsettling, they also underscore the importance of informed decision-making, strategic planning, and a long-term perspective. Ethereum continues to be a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems, with ongoing developments and upgrades promising future innovation. By understanding the dynamics at play and adopting a resilient approach, investors can better navigate these challenging yet opportunity-rich periods. Frequently Asked Questions About the Ethereum Price Drop Q1: What does it mean when ETH falls below a key psychological level like $4,000? A1: When ETH falls below a significant level like $4,000, it can trigger increased selling pressure as some traders might have stop-loss orders set at or around that price. It also often signals a shift in market sentiment, moving from bullish to more cautious or bearish in the short term, as investors re-evaluate their positions. Q2: Is an Ethereum price drop a sign of a market crash? A2: Not necessarily. An Ethereum price drop , even a significant one, is often a market correction rather than a full-blown crash. Market corrections are natural and healthy, allowing prices to consolidate before potentially resuming an upward trend. A “crash” typically implies a much larger, rapid, and sustained decline across the entire market, usually triggered by systemic issues. Q3: Should I sell my ETH holdings if the price drops further? A3: The decision to sell or hold depends entirely on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. It’s crucial to avoid emotional decisions. Many long-term investors choose to “HODL” (hold on for dear life) during dips, or even “buy the dip” to average down their cost basis. Consult a financial advisor if you are unsure. Q4: What role does Bitcoin play in an Ethereum price drop? A4: Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the broader cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin experiences significant price movements, either up or down, other altcoins like Ethereum tend to follow suit. This is due to Bitcoin’s dominant market capitalization and its influence on overall market sentiment and liquidity. A dip in BTC often leads to an Ethereum price drop as well.

With its innovative technology and higher transaction speed, Layer Brett will provide additional advantages to investors. ADA’s Path to Recovery Cardano (ADA) has been resilient in the cryptocurrency market, with its price currently at $0.81. Recent predictions estimate that ADA is likely to hit a high of $1.20 by the end of 2025, which means that the coin will recover. The interest of the institutions and the recent development of technology drive this optimistic prediction. The introduction of the Hydra scaling solution has greatly enhanced the transaction throughput of Cardano, making it a formidable competitor in the blockchain industry. Moreover, the fact that Cardano was incorporated in the U.S. strategic crypto reserve has contributed to investor confidence. However, challenges remain. Whale activity has brought volatility and major sell-offs, which are affecting the stability of the ADA price. These fluctuations notwithstanding, the fundamental underpinnings are promising for the recovery path of ADA. Short-term volatility is still to happen, but the long-term outlook of the Cardano recovery is optimistic due to the technology and strategic prospects. LBRETT: Where the Smart Money Is Headed Next While Cardano predictions point to a potential recovery, the conversation seems to be shifting elsewhere, towards Layer Brett. Unlike many meme coins that rely on nostalgia or viral moments, Layer Brett is driven by purpose. It’s not a token waiting for utility; it’s already operational. As an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Layer Brett processes transactions at a fraction of the cost and with significantly faster speeds than the typical meme coins. Gas fees? Just pennies. Transaction speeds? Practically instant. However, the real attraction lies in staking. Early investors are securing rewards exceeding 630% APY, and with the presale still ongoing, entry points are low, offering substantial upside potential. This is why so many traders are shifting their attention. While Cardano remains a major market player, it struggles to meet current demands: real utility, returns, and robust infrastructure. Layer Brett delivers on all these fronts, while still embracing the fun, meme-driven culture that many in the space enjoy. The project’s community is also growing rapidly. The social interaction is good, and the ecosystem is steadying even before launching itself officially. This is not a temporary fad but an actual ecosystem that is in the process of development. To investors who spent their money on the first wave of meme coins or are disappointed in the slow recovery of Cardano, Layer Brett offers a new product with a great chance. Though it’s still early, that’s exactly why it’s worth considering now. Conclusion While Cardano price predictions remain hopeful, investors seeking the next big opportunity are already eyeing the future. Layer Brett isn’t relying on past trends; it’s delivering real-time infrastructure, rewards, and substantial growth potential. This shift in focus speaks volumes about where savvy investors are placing their bets for 2025. Don’t wait until the presale ends. Layer Brett is moving fast, and the opportunity to buy in early at record speed won’t last long.

International Business Settlement, a prominent Hong Kong-listed firm, has made a substantial Hong Kong Bitcoin purchase , acquiring 106 BTC for an impressive $12 million. This move is more than just a transaction; it represents a powerful statement about the growing confidence of traditional financial entities in the digital asset space. What Does This Bold Hong Kong Bitcoin Purchase Signify? This strategic investment by International Business Settlement (IBS) underscores a noticeable shift in corporate treasury strategies. For many years, Bitcoin was primarily the domain of individual investors and tech enthusiasts. However, we are now witnessing a robust trend of institutional adoption. IBS, a company known for its financial services and fintech solutions, is clearly positioning itself for the future. Their decision to execute this Hong Kong Bitcoin purchase suggests a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its potential as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. This kind of corporate endorsement adds immense credibility to the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Why Are Hong Kong Firms Leading the Charge in Crypto? Hong Kong has been proactively fostering an environment conducive to digital asset innovation. The region’s regulators have been working towards creating a clear and robust framework for cryptocurrencies, aiming to become a global hub for virtual assets. This progressive stance encourages local firms like IBS to explore and integrate digital assets into their operations. The clear regulatory landscape provides a sense of security and legitimacy that traditional businesses require before making such significant investments. Therefore, this Hong Kong Bitcoin purchase is not an isolated event but rather a reflection of a broader, supportive ecosystem. The Growing Global Wave of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption International Business Settlement is joining a growing list of public companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Pioneers like MicroStrategy and Tesla paved the way, demonstrating that corporate Bitcoin holdings can be a viable strategy for asset diversification and potential growth. These companies view Bitcoin as a strategic asset, aligning with the narrative of ‘digital gold’. Key benefits driving this trend include: Diversification: Bitcoin offers an alternative asset class, reducing reliance on traditional financial instruments. Inflation Hedge: Its fixed supply makes it attractive during periods of economic uncertainty. Technological Alignment: Investing in Bitcoin demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to financial technology. Potential Returns: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown strong long-term growth potential. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Crypto While the benefits are clear, corporate crypto adoption is not without its challenges. Volatility remains a primary concern for many businesses. The price of Bitcoin can fluctuate significantly, impacting the value of a company’s holdings. Furthermore, the regulatory environment, while improving in places like Hong Kong, can still be complex and varies across different jurisdictions. Companies also need robust solutions for custody and security of their digital assets. Managing these risks effectively is crucial for any firm contemplating a similar Hong Kong Bitcoin purchase . However, the increasing availability of institutional-grade services is making these challenges more manageable. In conclusion, International Business Settlement’s Hong Kong Bitcoin purchase is a significant development. It not only highlights the firm’s strategic vision but also reinforces the accelerating trend of institutional adoption within the cryptocurrency market. As more companies follow suit, Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape will undoubtedly continue to expand, cementing its position as a crucial asset for the modern era.

While many legacy crypto coins are losing momentum, analysts are pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a protocol that could set the pace heading into the 2026 altseason. With a presale price of $0.035 and a roadmap built around real utility, projections of a run toward $2 are being taken seriously by those looking for long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a different vision for decentralized finance by blending secure dual lending, borrowing, and staking into one platform. The models are based on P2C and P2P lending, where users will be able to earn on set and negotiated terms. The design features a buy-and-distribute system, where platform revenues are recycled into open-market token buybacks and redistributed to mtToken stakers. On top of that, a stablecoin pegged to $1 will soon play a key role in borrowing, repayment, and liquidity management, adding another layer of recurring demand. With Layer-2 integration, the protocol will deliver fast and low-cost transactions, while its upcoming beta launch will give users a live environment to test collateralized loans, mtToken staking, and rewards. Features like the dashboard and Top 50 leaderboard will gamify participation, encouraging users to track ROI and compete for recognition, locking in long-term engagement. Momentum around the presale is already proving that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has strong community backing. The project is now in Phase 6, with the token priced at $0.035. Around $16.23 million has been raised so far, supported by more than 16,600 holders, and half of the $170 million allocation for this stage has already been sold. The total supply of MUTM is capped at 4 billion, and the project has undergone security checks with CertiK, scoring 90 on Token Scan and 79 on Skynet. The revised audit timeline is set for May 20, 2025, further underlining the commitment to transparency and safety. Phase 7 will increase the token price to $0.040, a 15% jump from the current level. For investors, the presale traction signals two important things: liquidity is flowing into the project, and there is confidence in the design. Those who secure tokens now are locking in exposure at discounted levels ahead of key milestones such as the beta launch, stablecoin deployment, and expected global exchange listings. The ability for users to experience live loans, mtToken staking mechanics, and automated buybacks during beta will strengthen trust and encourage broader participation, making Phase 6 one of the most strategic entry points before listings push visibility to new heights. Path toward $2 before the 2026 altseason The case for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaching $2 is built on multiple demand drivers working in sync. The beta launch will introduce early adoption, giving investors and institutions alike the confidence of seeing real functionality in action. Layer-2 integration will ensure that this activity is fast and affordable, removing the friction that often keeps new users away from decentralized platforms. At the same time, the stablecoin and buy-and-distribute mechanism will create recurring demand for MUTM, ensuring that every transaction and fee cycle translates into buying pressure. Once exchange listings arrive on top-tier platforms expected on Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, MEXC, and Kraken, global visibility will expand dramatically. That exposure, paired with the already engaged presale community, sets the stage for a strong rally into and beyond the 2026 altseason. Investment math shows why analysts are confident. A Phase 6 investor who allocates $3,500 at $0.035 secures 100,000 MUTM. At the projected $2 target, that holding would be valued $200,000, a staggering value gain in under a year of market cycles. Early participants in Phase 1 who entered at $0.01 are even more strategically positioned, with $8,000 invested translating to 800,000 MUTM—worth $1.6 million at the same $2 projection. These confident figures demonstrate why the token is being highlighted as one of the best crypto investing opportunities in the current rotation. Final words There is less and less time to get MUTM at $0.035 because Phase 6 is already 50% sold. When the price goes up by 15% in Phase 7, the admission fee goes higher, which means that latecomers have less room to make money. More and more investors are looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next token to do well before the 2026 altseason. This is a project where loan mechanics, staking rewards, and sustainable buybacks all come together to make lasting value. If you’re keeping an eye on what’s going on with crypto right now, you might want to look into Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It’s the presale that has a lot of community support and a clear road to $2.

Analysts and ordinary investors are paying more and more attention to new protocols that could give them big returns in the next market cycle, even though ETH’s infrastructure adoption story is interesting. One of these lesser-known projects is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which provides a whole decentralized finance ecosystem that can be used in the real world. MUTM is a next-generation crypto investment that offers both growth and predictability. It does this by integrating new ways to lend and borrow money, a decentralized stablecoin, and a buy-and-distribute token strategy. As crypto investment gets more complicated, investors are looking for alternatives beyond the most popular coins. They are focusing on platforms that combine DeFi innovation with strong risk management. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is meant to be used for a long time. It draws users in with overcollateralized loans, stable-rate borrowing, and predictable treasury growth. These elements make a protocol that can run on its own and allows staking incentives and token buybacks. This makes sure that the ecosystem expands along with user engagement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): What is driving value Phase 6 of the MUTM presale has raised approximately $16.2 million, with 47% of the 170 million token allocation already sold. The current price of $0.035 represents a prime entry point for investors, while the next phase price of $0.040 reflects a 15% immediate gain. Over 16,550 holders have already joined the presale, signaling growing community trust and interest. For retail traders and institutional participants alike, this phase represents the final opportunity to secure discounted MUTM tokens before the beta launch amplifies demand and adoption. The upcoming beta launch will allow users to experience the platform’s lending, staking, and stablecoin features firsthand. This interactive exposure is expected to build confidence in the protocol’s reliability and scalability. Layer-2 integration will further enhance the user experience by reducing transaction costs and increasing speed, enabling higher-volume borrowing and staking activity. The resulting growth in on-chain activity will strengthen the treasury, fueling buy-and-distribute mechanisms that support token value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leverages several key demand drivers that make it attractive for investors seeking a high-utility crypto with predictable revenue. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency allows users to maximize borrowing against collateral safely, increasing platform activity and generating higher fees. Liquidity-aware liquidation incentives ensure smooth, efficient execution of liquidations, protecting user capital and maintaining systemic stability. Additionally, the reserve factor collects a portion of borrower interest, creating a treasury that can be deployed for staking rewards, governance incentives, and additional liquidity, reinforcing MUTM’s long-term demand. Investment examples highlight the protocol’s growth potential. Phase 1 investors purchased MUTM at $0.01 and have already realized a 250% value gain on paper at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035. Current Phase 6 participants can secure a 15% near-term upside before the next phase, with long-term projections targeting $2 per token. This represents an approximate 57× return from the current Phase 6 price, underscoring MUTM’s position as a standout crypto investment. The roadmap includes listings on major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, MEXC, and Kraken, which will increase visibility, liquidity, and adoption. Early access to the beta will allow users to test the platform’s full functionality, creating a network effect that drives sustained engagement and reinforces token demand. The combination of live feature experience, Layer-2 efficiency, and planned exchange integration ensures MUTM’s ecosystem will attract active users and continuous capital flow. Final words Security remains a cornerstone of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s design. The protocol has undergone a CertiK audit, receiving a TokenScan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. A $50,000 bug bounty incentivizes security reporting, while a $100,000 ongoing giveaway rewards ten participants with $10,000 each. Over 12,000 followers on Twitter form a vibrant community supporting early adoption and network effects. Phase 6 is already 47% sold. Retail investors are urged to lock in MUTM at $0.035 before the next-phase price increase to $0.040. With overcollateralized lending, dual lending pools, a decentralized stablecoin, and Layer-2 speed enhancements, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a rare combination of DeFi innovation, predictable revenue, and explosive upside. Its robust demand drivers, strategic presale positioning, and upcoming beta launch make it a compelling candidate for investors looking to capture significant returns ahead of ETH’s continued institutional adoption.

Among the sea of crypto coins, analysts are increasingly pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the standout project to watch. With its mix of utility, innovation, and presale momentum, MUTM is being positioned as the best cryptocurrency coin to buy ahead of the expected recovery, with projections pointing toward an 80x ROI. Presale traction signals investor confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale and is designed as a comprehensive DeFi protocol that blends dual lending mechanics, staking, and a sustainable buy-and-distribute system. Users will be able to lend and borrow directly, receive mtTokens that represent their holdings, and stake these for MUTM rewards. Revenue generated by the platform will later be used for open-market buybacks, which are then distributed to stakers, creating recurring demand. The project also integrates Layer-2 scaling for speed and low-cost transactions, alongside an upcoming stablecoin pegged to the dollar, which will play a central role in borrowing and repayment. The platform also features an ROI-tracking dashboard and a Top 50 leaderboard, designed to uplift user experience, drawing in both retail and larger investors. Unlike many speculative assets, MUTM positions itself as a utility-first token, engineered to attract both institutional and retail flows. The presale numbers already show strong momentum for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The token is in Phase 6 with a price of $0.035, having raised approximately $16.23 million so far. More than 16,600 investors are already on board, and half of the 170 million tokens available for this phase have been sold. The project’s total supply is set at 4 billion MUTM. Security and credibility are reinforced by a CertiK audit, where it scored 90 on Token Scan and 79 on Skynet, with a revised audit timeline scheduled for May 20, 2025. With 12,000+ Twitter followers and growing community engagement, momentum is building steadily. Importantly, Phase 7 will push the price up by 15% to $0.040, making the current stage an attractive entry point for those seeking discounted exposure. One of the strongest catalysts for MUTM is its upcoming beta launch at the token listing. This milestone will allow users to test key features directly, including borrowing, staking, and stablecoin minting. Having these tools live from the start provides investors with confidence in both the technology and the revenue model. Path to 80x ROI with real demand drivers The investment case for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rests on multiple, reinforcing drivers that create a clear path toward an 80x ROI. Expected exchange listings on top platforms such as Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, MEXC, and Kraken will deliver unmatched visibility and liquidity, exposing MUTM to a global audience. Every new listing is expected to accelerate adoption, increase trading activity, and attract institutional capital. At the same time, the buy-and-distribute revenue system ensures continuous buying pressure, as revenue will be recycled into MUTM token buybacks for redistribution to stakers. Layer-2 scaling will improve efficiency, making lending and borrowing smoother and cheaper, which in turn drives higher usage of the platform. The stablecoin introduces another dimension of growth, creating constant borrowing and repayment activity that ties directly back to MUTM’s demand. Finally, the beta launch gives users a first-hand experience with these features, reinforcing confidence and adoption early in the lifecycle. The math behind the projections shows why analysts are bullish. A Phase 6 investor who allocates $5,000 at $0.035 secures 142,900 MUTM tokens. At an $2.80 valuation—representing 80x from presale—this would be valued at $400,000. Meanwhile, a Phase 1 participant who committed $10,000 at $0.01 received 1,000,000 tokens. At the same $2.80 target, their holding would reach at the value of $2.8 million, highlighting the exponential upside created through early positioning. Such confident arithmetic demonstrates why the token is being labeled one of the most promising opportunities in crypto investing ahead of the market rebound. The time is also important. With Phase 6 nearly 50% sold, buyers don’t have much time to buy MUTM at $0.035 before the price goes up by 15% in Phase 7. Because of this urgency and the fact that beta access, Layer-2 efficiency, exchange listings, and the launch of the stablecoin are all coming up, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most interesting cryptocurrencies to buy before the rebound momentum picks up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is giving a presale window that combines low prices with good fundamentals as investors try to figure out what’s going on with crypto today. MUTM is not simply another token trying to ride the hype wave. It has a way to be used in the real world, ongoing buybacks, and integrations that are good enough for institutions. Analysts say it’s the best cryptocurrency coin to buy for an 80x return, and the fact that recovery signals are growing shows that people are becoming more confident in its long-term potential. But as Phase 6 comes to a finish, the window of opportunity is closing quickly.

Naver Financial, the company’s fintech arm, is in advanced talks with Upbit operator Dunamu, to carry out a comprehensive stock swap. Under this plan, the structure would see Naver issue new shares to acquire stakes from Dunamu’s existing shareholders. Both sides are now finalizing the swap ratio for the unlisted stock, Chosun Daily reported Thursday. In practice, a stock swap allows two companies to exchange shares instead of cash, creating a parent-subsidiary type governance structure. Ultimately, the move is seen as a way for Naver to cement its entry into digital finance and crypto markets. Naver Financial, the fintech arm of South Korea’s largest portal Naver, has agreed to a share-swap deal with Dunamu, operator of Upbit. The move effectively gives Naver control of Korea’s No.1 crypto exchange and marks its entry into the digital finance and won-pegged stablecoin… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 25, 2025 Overseas Expansion Plans Add Global Dimension To Merger Talks Naver Financial processes annual payment volumes worth 80 trillion Korean won ($58b). In contrast, pairing that scale with Dunamu’s Upbit platform, ranked the No. 1 exchange in Korea and No. 4 globally, could create one of the strongest alliances yet between South Korea’s tech and crypto sectors. Already, the two companies work together on a won-pegged stablecoin initiative and plan to use the deal as a springboard for overseas expansion. The move is seen as a stepping stone for Naver to become a global fintech player. If successful, the tie-up would reshape the financial services landscape in South Korea. Currently, Naver Pay is one of the country’s most widely used digital wallets, competing with Kakao Pay, Toss and established banks. With Upbit’s crypto dominance added, Naver could link payments, shopping, finance and digital assets under one ecosystem. Market Share Battle Intensifies As Naver Weighs Deal The timing of the news is notable. Korea Blockchain Week is underway in Seoul, drawing global attention to the nation’s fast-growing crypto sector. At the same time, earlier this week, Upbit’s rival Bithumb struck a partnership with World Liberty Financial , a crypto venture linked to US President Donald Trump. For years, Upbit has enjoyed a dominant position in South Korea, holding above 80% of market share in some months since 2022. That dominance has triggered criticism from lawmakers , who argue that Dunamu’s grip on the exchange market risks creating a monopoly. More recently, market dynamics have shifted. On Sept. 9, Bithumb’s domestic share climbed to 46%. Upbit held 50.6%. As a result, competition has tightened. This raises the stakes for Naver as it seeks control of Dunamu. Looking ahead, a deeper alliance between Naver and Dunamu would stand out. If completed, it would rank among the most significant M&A deals in South Korea’s fintech space.

This vision is rapidly becoming a reality in South Korea, thanks to a groundbreaking partnership. Sui, a leading Layer 1 blockchain, has joined forces with t’order, a prominent South Korean table ordering platform, to introduce a Korean won-based stablecoin payment system. This move marks a significant leap for Sui stablecoin payments , bringing digital currency closer to everyday transactions. What Are Sui Stablecoin Payments and Why Do They Matter? At its core, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or, in this case, the Korean Won (KRW). This stability makes them ideal for everyday transactions, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The introduction of Sui stablecoin payments means that consumers in South Korea can now use a digital representation of the KRW, backed 1:1 by actual Korean Won, for their purchases. This system leverages Sui’s high-throughput and low-latency blockchain, promising faster and potentially more cost-effective transactions compared to traditional methods. For a country as technologically advanced as South Korea, integrating blockchain into retail payments represents a natural evolution. It offers a glimpse into a future where digital assets seamlessly integrate into our financial lives, making payments more efficient and accessible. Bridging Blockchain and Everyday Commerce: The t’order Integration The partnership between Sui and t’order is not just about technology; it’s about practical application. T’order is a major player in South Korea’s hospitality sector, boasting an impressive network of over 300,000 point-of-sale (POS) terminals. This extensive reach provides a massive springboard for the adoption of Sui stablecoin payments . Here’s how this collaboration is set to unfold: Widespread Access: Over 300,000 POS terminals will be connected to Sui’s blockchain payment network. This means a vast number of restaurants, cafes, and retail outlets could soon accept stablecoin payments. Seamless Integration: The goal is to make the payment process intuitive and user-friendly, mirroring the ease of existing digital payment methods. Real-World Utility: This isn’t just a pilot project; it’s a direct integration into an established payment ecosystem, offering genuine utility for digital assets. This initiative directly addresses one of blockchain’s biggest challenges: bridging the gap between innovative technology and practical, everyday use cases. By partnering with an established platform like t’order, Sui is ensuring that its stablecoin solution has immediate and widespread relevance. Unlocking Benefits: Why This Partnership is a Game Changer The launch of KRW stablecoin payments via Sui and t’order brings a host of potential benefits for various stakeholders. This collaboration is set to revolutionize how businesses and consumers interact with digital currency. Consider the advantages: For Consumers: Enjoy faster transaction speeds and potentially lower fees. The stability of KRW stablecoins removes the volatility risk associated with other cryptocurrencies, making them a reliable payment method. For Businesses: Experience streamlined payment processing and potentially reduced operational costs. The transparency of blockchain transactions can also offer enhanced security and easier reconciliation. For the Sui Ecosystem: This partnership significantly boosts the utility and adoption of the Sui blockchain. It demonstrates a powerful real-world use case for Sui stablecoin payments , attracting more users and developers to the platform. For the Wider Economy: It promotes financial innovation and could pave the way for broader acceptance of digital currencies in traditional commerce. Moreover, this initiative positions South Korea at the forefront of digital payment innovation, showcasing how blockchain technology can enhance national payment infrastructure. Navigating the Future: Potential Challenges and Opportunities for Sui Stablecoin Payments While the prospects are exciting, the path to widespread adoption for Sui stablecoin payments will naturally involve challenges. However, these challenges also present significant opportunities for growth and refinement. Key considerations include: User Education: Many consumers may still be unfamiliar with stablecoins. Educating the public on their benefits and ease of use will be crucial for adoption. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for stablecoins is continuously evolving. Adhering to current and future regulations will be vital for long-term success. Scalability and Security: As transaction volumes increase, Sui’s blockchain must demonstrate its ability to scale efficiently while maintaining robust security measures. Integration with Existing Systems: Ensuring seamless integration with diverse POS systems and accounting software will be key for merchant acceptance. Despite these hurdles, the opportunity to transform a significant portion of South Korea’s retail payments is immense. Successful implementation could set a precedent for other nations looking to integrate blockchain into their national payment infrastructures. The collaboration between Sui and t’order represents a pivotal moment for digital payments in South Korea. By integrating KRW stablecoin payments into over 300,000 POS terminals, Sui is not just launching a new payment option; it is laying the groundwork for a more efficient, secure, and technologically advanced financial future. This initiative showcases the immense potential of blockchain to move beyond niche applications and into the mainstream of everyday commerce. As this partnership unfolds, it will undoubtedly offer valuable insights into the future of global digital payments, solidifying Sui’s role as an innovator in the blockchain space.

Dogecoin dominated the spotlight after the first United States spot DOGE ETF went live on September 18, with talk of more approvals priming Q4 for fresh inflows. At the same time, a PayFi upstart that bridges crypto to real bank accounts ( Remittix ) is drawing serious attention, with major centralized exchanges already lined up. With Q3 closing, many early-stage crypto investment hunters see this payments play as a high-growth crypto that complements Dogecoin rather than competes with it. Dogecoin holding range as ETF catalysts build Dogecoin trades near $0.24 today, holding a tight band between support around $0.236 and resistance near $0.244 as traders weigh the next impulse. Analysts note that Dogecoin momentum followed the spot ETF debut, while on chain and whale flows suggest selective accumulation on dips. A decisive break above $0.244 may open a run toward $0.26 to $0.28, while losing $0.236 risks a slide into the mid $0.23s. The ETF narrative and friendlier approval pipeline can keep Dogecoin in focus, but confirmation still depends on volume expansion and trend strength. For active participants, Dogecoin remains a levels-driven market with improving institutional access, which is why Dogecoin continues to command attention on every pump or pullback. Remittix: PayFi rails built for real world spend Here is where the rotation gets urgent. Remittix addresses the everyday challenge of transferring value from crypto to bank accounts with speed and transparent foreign exchange. It is positioned as more than just a story; it is a tool for spending. Recent reports indicate that more than $26.4 million has been raised and over 669 million RTX tokens have been sold, with the token priced at around $0.1130. Security and execution signals are stacking up. The team has completed top-tier verification with CertiK and currently holds the leading pre-launch ranking. The mobile wallet beta is live with community testers, showing progress that aligns with the best crypto to buy now thesis. For investors who want utility plus distribution on day one, this cross-chain, low gas fee crypto angle is why eyes are moving fast. Why Remittix is gaining traction Users can send crypto to real bank accounts in over 30 countries for practical, everyday payouts. The wallet is scheduled for a Q3 go-live with real-time FX conversion to remove friction at the point of spend. Independent security verification by CertiK provides a clear trust signal from day one. Broad asset support and fiat pair coverage are designed for real-world usage, not just speculation. The product focuses on freelancers, remitters, and payments users who value speed and clarity. Compared to Dogecoin, Remittix’s approach prioritizes adoption over hype. Dogecoin can remain a strong momentum vehicle, but Remittix, with verified security, visible listings, and an accessible starting price around $0.1130, stacks the deck for a breakout. If Q4 flows accelerate, missing this window could be the decision that traders regret.

For a long time, many analysts observed a fascinating pattern with Bitcoin: its price often mirrored movements in the global M2 money supply, typically with about a 70-day lag. But what if that predictable dance has suddenly stopped? According to Joe Consorti, head of growth at the Bitcoin custody firm Theya, we are now witnessing a significant shift. He points out that the historical correlation between Bitcoin’s price and the global M2 money supply has ceased since May. This development, which we can call the Bitcoin decoupling , marks a new chapter in understanding how the leading cryptocurrency behaves. What’s Behind the Remarkable Bitcoin Decoupling? Joe Consorti’s analysis reveals a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. For years, the 70-day lag between Bitcoin’s price and the global M2 money supply was a key indicator for many. This meant that changes in the amount of money circulating globally would eventually influence Bitcoin’s value. However, that pattern is no longer holding true. Since May, Bitcoin has embarked on a new, independent path. This Bitcoin decoupling suggests that its price movements are now being driven by different factors, moving away from the direct influence of broader monetary aggregates. It’s a noteworthy change because it challenges long-held assumptions about Bitcoin’s market drivers. While gold continues to show a near one-to-one correlation with the M2 metric, Bitcoin is charting its own course, signaling a potential maturation of the asset. Understanding Global M2: Why Does It Matter for Asset Prices? To fully grasp the significance of this Bitcoin decoupling , it’s helpful to understand what global M2 money supply actually is. Simply put, M2 represents a broad measure of the total money circulating in an economy. This includes: Cash Checking deposits Savings deposits Money market accounts Historically, an increase in M2 often indicates more money chasing a relatively fixed supply of assets, which can lead to inflation and higher asset prices. This is why many traditional assets, like gold, tend to move in tandem with M2, acting as a hedge against currency devaluation. The fact that gold maintains this strong correlation while Bitcoin breaks away highlights a fundamental shift in their respective market roles and investor perceptions. Navigating New Market Waters: Implications of Bitcoin Decoupling Consorti suggests that this significant shift is unfolding amid a complex global economic landscape, characterized by a weaker U.S. dollar and heightened geopolitical risks. These broader macroeconomic factors are likely contributing to the changing asset correlations we are observing. The implications of this Bitcoin decoupling are substantial for investors and market watchers alike: Changing Asset Perceptions: Gold is traditionally seen as the ultimate safe-haven asset, attracting capital during times of crisis and uncertainty. Bitcoin, however, is increasingly viewed differently. Bitcoin as ‘Risk-On’: Consorti explains that Bitcoin is now perceived as an asset that moves more significantly in a ‘risk-on’ environment. This means that when investors feel confident and are willing to take on more risk for higher potential returns, Bitcoin tends to perform strongly. Independent Drivers: This new behavior suggests that Bitcoin’s price might be influenced more by crypto-specific adoption, technological advancements, regulatory clarity, or unique supply-demand dynamics within the digital asset space, rather than just broad monetary policy. This evolving narrative requires a fresh perspective on how Bitcoin fits into a diversified investment portfolio. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Strategy? The observation of a Bitcoin decoupling from global M2 money supply presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. It means that relying solely on past correlations might no longer be an effective strategy. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Re-evaluate Investment Theses: It’s crucial to reassess why you hold Bitcoin. Is it purely an inflation hedge, or are you recognizing its potential as a growth asset in a ‘risk-on’ environment? Broaden Your Analysis: Look beyond just M2. Pay attention to other macroeconomic indicators, geopolitical events, and, critically, developments within the cryptocurrency ecosystem itself. Diversification Remains Key: As correlations shift, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes and within the crypto space can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Continuously learning about new analyses and market shifts, like this Bitcoin decoupling , is essential for making informed decisions. This period of shifting correlations could define Bitcoin’s role for years to come. The Bitcoin decoupling from global M2 money supply is a truly remarkable development. It signifies a potential maturation of Bitcoin as an asset, with its movements now seemingly less tethered to traditional monetary metrics and more influenced by a complex interplay of risk sentiment and unique crypto-market dynamics. While gold continues its traditional role, Bitcoin is forging its own path, offering investors a new lens through which to view its value and potential. Understanding these evolving correlations is paramount for navigating the exciting, yet ever-changing, landscape of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the global M2 money supply? A1: The global M2 money supply is a broad measure of the total amount of money circulating in an economy, including physical currency, checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market funds. It’s often used as an indicator of liquidity and potential inflationary pressures. Q2: How did Bitcoin’s price previously correlate with M2? A2: Historically, Bitcoin’s price often showed a correlation with the global M2 money supply, typically with a lag of about 70 days. This meant that increases or decreases in M2 would often precede similar movements in Bitcoin’s price. Q3: Why is Bitcoin decoupling from M2 now? A3: According to analyst Joe Consorti, this Bitcoin decoupling has occurred since May. He suggests it’s happening amidst a weaker U.S. dollar and heightened geopolitical risks, leading to a re-evaluation of asset correlations and Bitcoin’s role as a ‘risk-on’ asset. Q4: Does this make Bitcoin more or less risky? A4: The decoupling doesn’t inherently make Bitcoin more or less risky, but it changes the nature of its risk. It suggests Bitcoin’s price movements may be driven by different factors, potentially increasing its volatility in ‘risk-on’ environments and requiring investors to adapt their risk assessment strategies. Q5: How does gold’s correlation with M2 compare to Bitcoin’s? A5: While Bitcoin is decoupling, gold continues to show a near one-to-one correlation with the global M2 money supply. This reinforces gold’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, contrasting with Bitcoin’s evolving ‘risk-on’ perception. Q6: What should investors do in light of this Bitcoin decoupling? A6: Investors should re-evaluate their investment theses, broaden their market analysis beyond traditional correlations, and consider how Bitcoin fits into a diversified portfolio as a dynamic asset influenced by both macro and crypto-specific factors.

Flare Launches First FAssets for XRP on Mainnet,https://cryptopotato.com/good-news-for-ripple-flare-launches-first-fassets-for-xrp-on-mainnet/,"The layer-1 decentralized finance (DeFi) interoperability network, Flare, has launched the first FAsset on its mainnet. This product, called FXRP v1.2, is designed for XRP holders, enabling them to leverage their assets across the DeFi ecosystem. According to a press release shared with CryptoPotato , FXRP minting will be capped at 5 million tokens for the first week, while Flare rolls out incentives to ensure sustainable growth. The team behind the interoperability network says the launch of FXRP marks the start of the XRP DeFi awakening. FXRP Goes Live on Flare FAssets are representations of non-smart contract-enabled cryptocurrencies that are used in the Flare DeFi ecosystem and beyond. They are pegged to the original asset and secured through an overcollateralized system. This system is run by independent agents and Flare’s data oracles. With FAssets, users can earn yield and engage in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading, lending, stablecoin minting, and liquid staking. Flare recently partnered with the Web3 software development entity Enosys to offer XRP-backed stablecoin loans. The loans will be powered by Enosys’ Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol and Flare-native tokens, such as FXRP. Flare says other protocols can integrate FAssets directly in their native building blocks, eliminating the need for special technicalities. As for security, Flare claims its protocols have undergone bug bounties, community-led reviews, and four independent audits. Since security for FAssets is considered an ongoing commitment, the system is monitored 24/7 with rapid response mechanisms in place. “Institutional stakeholders in particular demand not only initial assurance, but ongoing verification that the system remains resilient to new threats. The Flare Foundation will continue to invest in robust, scalable security measures to ensure FAssets uphold the highest standards of safety, trust, and reliability for both institutions and the XRP community,” the platform stated. Incentives for Sustainable Growth Henceforth, users can acquire FXRP by minting the token via self-custody wallets that support Flare and XRPL. Alternatively, they can swap any token on Flare for the FAsset using DEXs like Enosys, BlazeSwap, and SparkDEX. Additionally, they can acquire FXRP through crypto wallets like Luminite and Oxen Flow, which will offer built-in swap functionality. As Flare onboards more users, it will gradually increase the number of minted FXRP. Meanwhile, Flare intends to distribute FAssets incentives to DeFi pools that make substantial contributions to on-chain activity. The rewards will initially come in the form of rFLR; Flare will stop them as FXRP becomes more widely integrated across the ecosystem. The post Good News for Ripple?

This rapid downturn sent shockwaves through the trading community, contributing to an even larger sum of $401 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours across major exchanges. Such events are not uncommon in the fast-paced world of digital assets, but they always underscore the significant risks involved in leveraged trading. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? For those new to the derivatives market, understanding crypto futures liquidation is crucial. Essentially, a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a specific future date. Many traders use leverage, which means they borrow funds to amplify their potential returns. While leverage can boost profits, it also dramatically increases risk. Liquidation occurs when a trader’s position is automatically closed by an exchange because they no longer have enough margin (collateral) to cover potential losses. If the market moves significantly against a leveraged position, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses for both the trader and the platform. This ensures that the borrowed funds can be repaid. Why Such Massive Liquidations Occur: The Domino Effect The recent crypto futures liquidation of $105 million within an hour is a stark example of what happens during periods of extreme market volatility. Several factors typically contribute to such a rapid cascade: Sudden Price Swings: A sharp, unexpected price drop (or rise, depending on the position) can quickly push many leveraged positions below their maintenance margin level. High Leverage: Traders using high leverage (e.g., 50x or 100x) are particularly vulnerable. Even a small price movement can lead to a complete loss of their collateral. Cascading Liquidations: When one large position is liquidated, the forced selling can further depress prices, triggering more liquidations in a chain reaction. This creates a domino effect that accelerates market downturns. In this instance, the rapid movement suggests a significant market event or a coordinated sell-off that caught many traders off guard, highlighting the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets. Navigating the Storm: How Does Crypto Futures Liquidation Impact Traders? The immediate impact of a crypto futures liquidation on individual traders is, understandably, financial loss. Traders lose their initial margin, and sometimes even more if the market moves too quickly for the exchange to close the position precisely. Moreover, these events can foster a sense of fear and uncertainty across the broader market, influencing investor sentiment and potentially leading to further price corrections. However, liquidations also serve as a harsh but effective lesson for many traders, emphasizing the importance of robust risk management strategies. They remind us that while the allure of quick gains is strong, the potential for significant losses is equally real. Strategies to Mitigate Crypto Futures Liquidation Risks While the market will always have its unpredictable moments, traders can adopt several strategies to protect themselves from the severe consequences of crypto futures liquidation : Understand Leverage: Use leverage cautiously. Higher leverage means higher risk. Beginners should start with minimal or no leverage. Set Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order automatically closes your position if the price reaches a certain level, limiting your potential losses. Manage Your Margin: Keep an eye on your margin level. Adding more collateral to your position can prevent liquidation during a temporary market dip. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into highly leveraged futures contracts. Balance your portfolio with less risky assets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and macroeconomic factors that could influence crypto prices. The recent $105 million liquidation event is a powerful testament to the volatile and high-stakes environment of crypto futures trading. While the potential for substantial gains exists, the risks, particularly with leveraged positions, are equally significant. Understanding the mechanics of liquidation and implementing sound risk management practices are not just recommendations; they are essential for long-term survival in this dynamic market. Traders must prioritize capital preservation and informed decision-making over the pursuit of immediate, high-risk returns. Always trade responsibly and within your financial means. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the difference between spot trading and futures trading? A1: Spot trading involves buying or selling cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery at the current market price. Futures trading, on the other hand, involves contracts to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date, often with leverage. Q2: How does leverage contribute to crypto futures liquidation? A2: Leverage allows traders to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. While this can amplify profits, it also magnifies losses. If the market moves against a highly leveraged position, the trader’s margin can quickly deplete, leading to liquidation. Q3: Can I lose more than my initial investment in futures trading? A3: In some extreme cases, particularly with very high leverage and rapid market movements, it is theoretically possible for losses to exceed initial margin. However, most reputable exchanges have mechanisms like auto-deleveraging (ADL) or insurance funds to try and prevent this, though it remains a significant risk. Q4: Are crypto futures liquidations common? A4: Yes, crypto futures liquidation events are quite common, especially during periods of high market volatility. Large liquidations often occur when there are significant price swings, impacting many leveraged positions simultaneously. Q5: What is a margin call in futures trading? A5: A margin call is a demand from an exchange or broker for a trader to deposit additional funds into their margin account to bring it back up to the required maintenance margin level. If the trader fails to meet the margin call, their position may be liquidated. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your trading community on social media.

Bitcoin HODLer Whales Have Shown Profit-Taking Spree Recently As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, long-term holder whales have participated in some profit-taking recently. “Long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Sell 147,000 BTC Since August, Fastest Selloff Of Cycle This cohort is considered to represent the HODLers of the market, who rarely sell even in the face of volatility. That said, there are times when these investors do participate in selloffs, and one such instance seems to have occurred just recently. In the context of the current topic, the everyday LTHs aren’t of focus, but rather the LTH whales, diamond hands who carry more than 1,000 BTC (about $113.7 million) in their balance. Below is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Profit for the LTH whales over the last few weeks. The Realized Profit here is naturally an on-chain indicator that measures the total amount of profit that the Bitcoin LTH whales are locking in through their transactions. From the graph, it’s visible that this metric observed a notable spike on September 21st. This was the day BTC started a price drawdown that took it to the $112,000 level. Thus, it would appear possible that the profit-taking from the HODLers may have in part been to blame for the bearish action. In total, LTH whales harvested over $120 million in profits during this distribution spree. Meanwhile, the short-term holders (STHs), representing investors who entered the market during the past five months, participated in loss-taking instead, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post. As displayed in the above chart, Bitcoin STHs sent 15,700 BTC at a loss to exchanges during the price crash. Investors generally use these platforms when they want to sell, so these loss transactions could have been a sign of capitulation from the cohort. The STHs have a relatively short holding time, so they are assumed to include the weak hands of the sector. In that view, the latest capitulation would be on-brand for the group. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dip-Buy Calls Spike: Why This Could Actually Be Bearish Coming back to the LTHs, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared a chart that puts into perspective the total amount of profit that the LTHs as a whole have realized in the current cycle so far.

This marks a significant uptick in capital entering the XRP market, signaling optimism among institutional and retail investors alike. XRP’s recent $69M inflows reflect broader cryptocurrency bullishness, fueled by strong on-chain metrics, undervaluation, and optimism over crypto regulatory clarity, signals that historically precede accumulation and upward price moves. Therefore, CoinShares data shows that XRP is gaining from a shift toward assets with strong transactional utility. Its highly active network boosts appeal for both traders and long-term holders, while a low NVT ratio signals potential undervaluation relative to on-chain activity. ”Investor behavior reinforces this trend since short-term holders are consolidating, while long-term holders retain strong positions, stabilizing the market. Historically, such dynamics, especially in high-activity networks like XRP, follow major inflows with price recoveries and renewed accumulation, setting the stage for sustainable growth. Therefore, the $69 million weekly inflow into XRP underscores growing market confidence and highlights the cryptocurrency’s attractiveness amid evolving investor strategies. XRP Eyes $5 Breakout Target Amid Bullish Flag Pole Formation XRP is capturing the attention of traders and investors after technical analyst ChartNerd highlighted a potential breakout target of $5, citing a classic bullish flag pole formation. This pattern, widely recognized in technical analysis, often signals a continuation of an existing uptrend following a period of consolidation. Notably, a flag pole formation appears when a sharp price rally is followed by a brief sideways consolidation, forming a ‘flag’ on the chart. When the price breaks out, it often mirrors the initial surge, signaling strong upside potential. For XRP, ChartNerd denotes the current consolidation as the flag, with the preceding rally as the pole, if the pattern holds, XRP could climb toward $5, marking a significant milestone. XRP gains bullish momentum as rising on-chain activity and institutional interest boost investor confidence. Favorable technicals and a flag pole formation suggest recent consolidation may be a pause before the next breakout with the present dip seemingly being over after flipping $2.86. Conclusion XRP’s $69 million weekly inflows highlight growing investor confidence and underscore its potential undervaluation. With strong network activity, supportive on-chain metrics, and evolving regulatory clarity, XRP appears well-positioned for accumulation and possible upward momentum in the near term. Meanwhile, XRP’s flag pole formation signals a strong bullish setup, with $5 within reach if momentum holds.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-25 06:00:24

On June 22, this year the #XRP price was $1.92. Twenty one days later the price was $3.64 (July 13). Yesterday the price of XRP was $2.69. In three weeks from now price will be $5. — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) September 23, 2025 Path Toward a New High The post comes as traders assess whether XRP can repeat its past patterns and build on momentum toward a new all-time high. The trend from June to July represented a near doubling in value over a short period, and the analyst expects similar trajectory to emerge again. A climb to $5 would represent not only recovery from recent pullbacks but also a level beyond its previous peak. Other analysts have echoed similar expectations, suggesting that XRP may be positioned for stronger performance in the coming weeks. The argument rests on its history of sharp uptrends once certain support zones hold, and recent trading activity has drawn comparisons to previous rallies that preceded significant breakouts. Market observers note that institutional flows and improved liquidity corridors could support such an outcome, and other analysts believe the $5 target is within reach . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Catalysts for Growth Two potential catalysts are emerging that could influence XRP’s path toward the projected $5 mark. The first is the recent rate cuts introduced by the Federal Reserve , which have injected liquidity into financial markets and supported risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Historically, lower interest rates reduce the appeal of holding cash, often prompting investors to allocate more into digital assets. The second factor is anticipation surrounding XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, with approval expected between mid- and late October . Such a development would open the door for broader institutional access and create new demand channels. Together, these events provide conditions that could reinforce the bullish outlook and accelerate XRP’s momentum if they unfold as expected. Community Responses Reactions from the XRP community have been mixed. Some supporters welcomed the $5 projection, as the recent trend resembles earlier periods that led to major breakouts. They pointed to the strength of past rallies and argued that the current setup supports optimism. On the other hand, skeptics dismissed the forecast. Some noted that the asset has failed to maintain momentum after reaching higher levels in the past. For them, the $5 target appears ambitious without stronger evidence of sustained buying pressure.

Analysts Warn Layer Brett May Deliver Bigger Multiples,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-price-set-to-break-5-analysts-warn-layer-brett-may-deliver-bigger-multiples/,"While analysts eye the potential for a major breakout by XRP to $5, some caution that the true potential may lie in Layer Brett ’s innovations. With Layer Brett’s emerging technology promising bigger multiples, the spotlight could shift from XRP’s price movements to the broader impact of these developments on the cryptocurrency market’s future. XRP Price at a Crossroads The subject of the question whether the XRP price can break $5 has brought a lot of attention to the crypto world. XRP price is currently trading at around $2.8, but the latest XRP price prediction has expectations of a bullish price target of $5. This optimistic prediction is based on the introduction of the first U.S. spot XRP ETF which has seen a lot of institutional involvement. Also, the XRP charts exhibit a symmetrical triangle on the technical indicator, which may turn out to be a breakout. Assuming that the XRP price will overcome the resistance points at about $3.10 and have a good volume, it can approach the mark of $5. Nonetheless, the XRP price has a major support at $2.75 and a fall below this point may be an indication of further losses. The wider market forces, including Federal Reserve policies and the development of ETFs will also have a strong influence on the XRP price. A target of $5 is possible, but investors must be vigilant and watch important support areas and the market environment. Layer Brett (LBRETT): The Ethereum Layer 2 That Could Overtake XRP A significant portion of discussions around the XRP revolve around its potential to hit $5. However, Layer Brett is quickly attracting the attention of leading market analysts due to its potential for much larger returns. Currently in presale at just $0.0058, it has already raised over $4 million and is gaining momentum rapidly. Layer Brett’s appeal goes beyond its meme-driven popularity as it is designed as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, offering ultra-fast transactions, low fees, and inherent scalability. The platform’s staking dApp is already live, with rewards exceeding 630%, a feature that XRP didn’t offer in its early stages. For investors, the opportunity to stake immediately and earn rewards gives Layer Brett a sense of stability, making it feel more like a functional ecosystem than a speculative bet. Analysts believe that Layer Brett’s combination of meme branding and strong blockchain infrastructure positions it to reach $10 well before XRP hits $5. The initiative is also getting better because more investors are getting involved. There are a lot of memes on social media, Telegram groups are getting bigger every day, and crypto Twitter is full of talks about LBRETT. For traders hesitant about the bullish outlook of XRP, Layer Brett is being seen as a low-risk, high-reward investment, bolstered by solid technology. The key differentiator lies in the potential for bigger multiples. While XRP price predictions suggest moderate gains, Layer Brett’s incredibly low starting price offers significantly more upside. This is why many believe this Ethereum Layer 2 solution has the potential to outperform XRP in the long run. Conclusion Most of the XRP price predictions say that the price might go up to $5, but it won’t give customers as much as it used to. Layer Brett, on the other hand, is looking for bigger multiples in Ethereum Layer 2 performance, live staking, and viral energy. The current Layer Brett presale might be the fastest way for traders who are seeking the next breakout to move forward. Don’t wait until the presale ends. Layer Brett is moving fast, and the opportunity to buy in early at record speed won’t last long.

That possibility puts the economy under new pressure eight months into President Donald Trump's second term. The Trump administration's tariffs imposed as part of its global trade war have driven up prices, while widespread public sector layoffs and mass deportations have squeezed the labor market. Now, a looming budget crisis could bring federal agencies to a standstill. “The economy is quite fragile right now. In a more resilient era, even a prolonged lockdown wouldn't be a major blow. But under current conditions, it could be the factor that could drag the economy down,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. In the event of a federal shutdown, millions of public employees will lose their salaries, and some will be forced to continue working without pay. While Social Security and Medicare payments will continue, citizens' access to many public services will be disrupted. It has also been reported that the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which provides food assistance to low-income families, will no longer be accepting new applications. Past lockdowns have shuttered national parks and museums, halted loans and permits for small businesses, and disrupted food safety inspections. Experts estimate that each week the federal government is closed represents a loss of about 0.1 percentage points of the country's quarterly economic growth. Related News: BREAKING NEWS: Critical Hearing on Taxation of Cryptocurrencies to Be Held in the US on This Date The 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted five weeks during Trump's first term, caused a significant decline in GDP. Ryan Sweet, Chief Economist at Oxford Economics, stated that such prolonged shutdowns negatively impact not only public spending but also private sector investment and consumer spending. This year's lockdown risk comes at a time when the economy is already under pressure due to high tariffs, a slowing labor market, and mass deportation policies. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has described the economy as “challenging,” and experts warn that a prolonged lockdown could also erode confidence in financial markets. *This is not investment advice.

Companies that breach these requirements could face penalties of up to 10% of their annual revenue. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre’s data shows roughly 400 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian watchdog, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, but only a fraction are actively operating. Mulino says the licensing framework will support the growth of the crypto industry In a consultation , the Treasury said the draft legislation would change the Corporations Act 2001 to “capture digital asset platforms and tokenized custody platforms by introducing each as a new financial product.” This would classify digital asset platforms (DAPs) and tokenized custody platforms (TCPs) as financial products, thereby bringing them under the full scope of licensing requirements and consumer protections, according to a Treasury fact sheet. “The focus of the framework is businesses that hold assets on behalf of clients, rather than on the digital assets themselves,” said the Treasury, noting that digital assets already fall under the state’s existing frameworks and are treated in the same way as other assets. Presently, anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules are the only requirements for crypto platforms in Australia. However, the new proposed laws will extend oversight by requiring AFSL registration. The penalties for violations, including dishonest or deceptive conduct, would also be set at whichever is greater: A$16.5 million, three times the advantage gained, or 10% of yearly sales. Nonetheless, the rules can still be altered, with industry participants allowed to comment on the draft until October 24. In the past few months, the nation’s key regulators, including financial regulators, the tax authority, and the central bank, have cautioned against Australians’ rising exposure to crypto assets. In August, AUSTRAC even ordered Binance Australia to appoint an external auditor over compliance concerns. So far, the Treasury has claimed that the planned rules will enhance the protection of crypto consumers. Federal Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino stated that the reforms are meant to nurture the sector while shielding Australians from potential losses, stressing that regulation will give investors more confidence in digital assets. He noted, “It is about legitimising the good actors and shutting out the bad.” John O’Loghlen, Australian Country Director and APAC Managing Director of Coinbase also commented: “Clear, fit-for-purpose regulation will support economic growth, increase choice for consumers, and ensure Australia remains competitive globally.We look forward to working constructively with government and industry as the legislation progresses.” Moreover, Jonathon Miller, general manager at Kraken, noted that he was pleased to see the draft finally published after a thorough collaboration period between industry players and regulators. The Australian government is planning on instituting stablecoin licensing rules According to the federal government, the legislation excludes digital asset creators and firms using crypto for non-financial activities. That means tokens used in video games and artistic NFTs remain outside the scope of regulation. It also noted that tokens that function as financial products will fall under current regulations, and ASIC is set to clarify in November which tokens will need an AFSL. Moreover, smaller platforms that process under $10 million in transactions yearly and hold under $5,000 per client will be exempt. Meanwhile, the country’s authorities are also working on a comprehensive payments licensing regime to cover digital assets such as stablecoins . The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) may oversee stablecoin issuers once the new “stored-value facilities” framework is implemented. The ASIC has also recently licensed two Australian dollar–backed stablecoins, AUDM from Macropod and AUDF from Forte, classifying them as non-cash payment facilities. Adding to the momentum, Coinbase announced Wednesday that it will add support for a third Australian dollar stablecoin, AUDD, enabling local users to buy, sell, convert, and transfer it.
