Total market capitalization now stands at $294 billion, The majority of these tokens continue to circulate on Ethereum, cementing its place as the backbone of the stablecoin ecosystem. But this growth isn’t just about the old giants like USDT and USDC. New entrants are making waves with innovative models and fresh incentives for users. Let’s take a closer look at the latest developments. Total Stablecoin Market Cap just hit a new ATH of $294 BILLION Guess where most of those stablecoins live? You guessed it: Ethereum pic.twitter.com/0QQBqS4Y26 — Crypto-Gucci.eth ᵍᵐ (@CryptoGucci) September 24, 2025 USDH Launches on Hyperliquid Native Markets has officially rolled out USDH, a fully backed stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. The token is now live on Hyperliquid with a USDH/USDC trading pair already seeing more than $2.2 million in early trading volume. The reserves behind USDH are managed through a hybrid structure. Backing comes from cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, while transparency is maintained through oracle feeds. An initial mix of off-chain and on-chain allocation ensures liquidity and stability. HYPERLIQUID RA MẮT STABLECOIN USDH USDH đã ghi nhận hơn 2 triệu USD khối lượng giao dịch ngay trong giai đoạn đầu Được bảo chứng bằng tiền mặt và trái phiếu kho bạc Mỹ ngắn hạn, USDH nhằm giảm sự phụ thuộc vào các stablecoin bên ngoài như USDC,… pic.twitter.com/4IRnySisKX — ThuanCapital (@ThuanCapital) September 24, 2025 The issuer has also mapped out a yield-sharing model: 50% of reserve yields will be used to buy back HYPE tokens. The remaining 50% will support Hyperliquid’s ecosystem growth. For Hyperliquid, this launch is a step toward reducing reliance on USDC, which still represents over 90% of total deposits. USDH could help diversify liquidity on the platform and create new demand for the HYPE token. Key stat: USDH has already generated over $2 million in trading activity since launch. 1/ USDF is @Aster_DEX 's native stablecoin. Holders earn airdrop points for holding the token. Lets dive into the metrics of this token. pic.twitter.com/TrxC3mfQg8 — Pine Analytics (@PineAnalytics) September 24, 2025 USDF Supply Explodes on Aster DEX Another stablecoin gaining attention is USDF, the native token of Aster DEX. Unlike USDH, USDF is directly tied to user incentives,holders earn airdrop points simply for holding the token. The supply growth has been nothing short of aggressive. Just nine days ago, total supply hovered around 34 million USDF. Today, it has surged to nearly 250 million, marking an increase of more than 220 million in under two weeks. But the distribution tells a different story. According to data: 83% of USDF remains in the project treasury. 8.7% is staked as auUSDF. 6.8% is held by other protocol addresses. Staking plays a key role in USDF’s tokenomics. Users can convert their USDF into auUSDF, which not only earns extra points but also provides yield. At present, auUSDF is trading at 1.042, translating to an implied 7.5% APY over the last five months. Most recent activity shows wallets buying USDF primarily to farm Aster DEX points, before depositing them directly on the platform. This mix of incentives has fueled rapid supply expansion while anchoring liquidity within the ecosystem. Key stat: USDF supply jumped 7x in just over a week, from 34M to 250M. Kazakhstan Enters the Stablecoin Race with KZTE It’s not just DeFi protocols experimenting with stablecoins. Nation-states are beginning to make their mark too. The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) has launched a pilot program for KZTE, a tenge-backed stablecoin. Developed inside NBK’s regulatory sandbox, KZTE is being issued on Solana by licensed exchange Intebix, with support from Mastercard and Eurasian Bank. This marks the first national tenge stablecoin to hit a blockchain. Kazakhstan launches Stablecoin $KZTE pegged to the Tenge! The National Bank of Kazakhstan @Nationalbank_KZ has kicked off a pilot program to issue the tenge-backed KZTE stablecoin on Solana, developed within its regulatory sandbox for digital assets. Issued by licensed… pic.twitter.com/1iHhTgC9BP — Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) September 24, 2025 The pilot introduces a few key benefits: Seamless fiat-to-crypto exchange with KZTE integration. Direct crypto card settlement via Mastercard rails. Expanded digital asset access for Kazakhstan’s retail and institutional market. A significant step toward NBK’s goal of modernizing payment infrastructure. By choosing Solana, the initiative gains access to high-speed, low-cost transactions, which makes sense for a retail-friendly stablecoin. With Mastercard in the mix, KZTE is positioned for real-world payments and cross-border settlement. This move also signals Kazakhstan’s intent to carve out a role in the global stablecoin race,not just as a miner-friendly hub, but now as a player in blockchain-based finance. Key stat: KZTE is the first stablecoin pegged to the Kazakh tenge issued under a national pilot program. Why These Launches Matter Stablecoins remain the backbone of crypto markets, accounting for nearly every on-chain dollar transaction, lending protocol, and DeFi yield farm. The rise to $294 billion market cap shows they are not slowing down. But the entry of new players like USDH, USDF, and KZTE highlights the evolution of this space: USDH is focused on decentralizing liquidity within trading venues while tying yields back to governance tokens like HYPE. USDF reflects how DeFi projects gamify liquidity through airdrops and staking incentives, driving rapid supply growth. KZTE represents a government’s attempt to merge fiat and crypto payments under a regulated framework. The mix of private issuers, DeFi-native tokens, and state-backed experiments suggests stablecoins are becoming more diverse in purpose and design. Ethereum still hosts the lion’s share of stablecoin activity, but ecosystems like Solana, Hyperliquid, and Aster DEX are carving out niches. Whether it’s new collateral models, reward mechanisms, or direct fiat integration, the stablecoin market is moving beyond its USDT/USDC duopoly. As the market cap pushes into new record territory, expect even more issuers,both private and state-linked,to step in. Each new launch tests how stablecoins can evolve from just a crypto dollar to something that underpins financial systems at scale. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The goal is to boost liquidity across both ecosystems by letting investors redeem their fund shares for RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin that already boasts a $700 million market cap . While redemptions will begin on Ethereum , Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that they’ll soon transition to the XRP Ledger , bringing even more real-world utility to the network. This unlocks a key catalyst for a bullish XRP price prediction , potentially accelerating transaction volumes and supporting the case for long-term targets as high as $1,000 . XRP Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch As Consolidation Continues XRP has been consolidating for a while after it hit its latest swing high at $3.65. The token is still on an uptrend and the key area of support to watch is the $2.60 level. Hence, while XRP may see short-term pullbacks in the coming days, its long-term trajectory remains bullish thanks to major project developments and improving market conditions. A strong rebound from the $2.60 level could set the stage for a breakout to a new all-time high, with $10 firmly in sight this cycle – representing a 230% upside. And while the $1,000 mark may sound ambitious, the rapid pace of institutional adoption and integration of Ripple’s technology points to a long-term trajectory where such a valuation becomes increasingly plausible over time. In the meantime, high-potential crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are attracting serious attention. With altseason heating up fast, this could be the best chance to get in before the next 10x explosion . Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Turns High-Leverage Trading Into a Meme-Powered Movement Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is more than just another Shiba in the meme pack; it’s a token wired on 1,000x leverage and built for retail traders who want to play the same game as whales. Backed by one of crypto’s most recognizable memes, $MAXI has already pulled in over $2.4 million just a few weeks after its presale kicked off. Through the MAXI Fund, the project will invest up to 25% of the presale proceeds in the most promising tokens of the cycle with 1000X leverage to amplify results. Add in gamified challenges like Max Gains and Max Ripped, and the token becomes a trading club for degens who thrive on risk. To buy $MAXI, visit the official Maxi Doge website and connect a compatible wallet (such as the Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card at checkout.

His call is bold: slash gas from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei, cutting average transaction costs nearly in half. That would make BNB one of the cheapest major blockchains in 2025,on par with Solana and Base,while maintaining performance for traders and builders. Gas fees matter.

For high-frequency traders and market makers, even small fee differences shape where liquidity flows. Lower fees also attract new apps and retail users who may otherwise avoid costly networks like Ethereum. BNB Chain validators are proposing to cut gas from 0.1 to 0.05 Gwei and shorten block intervals from 750ms to 450ms, dropping fees to about $0.005 per tx and keeping BSC competitive with Solana and Base. Past cuts from 3→1 Gwei and 1→0.1 Gwei lowered fees 75% and boosted daily… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 24, 2025 BNB Chain validators are now proposing two big changes: Cut minimum gas from 0.1 Gwei → 0.05 Gwei Shorten block intervals from 750ms → 450ms If approved, this would push median fees down to ~$0.005 per tx. That cements BSC’s role as a low-cost chain for trading, swaps, and onchain experimentation. A Track Record of Bold Cuts This isn’t new territory. BNB Chain has repeatedly slashed gas, and each time activity soared: April 2024: Gas fell 3 Gwei → 1 Gwei (–67%) May 2025: Gas fell 1 Gwei → 0.1 Gwei (–90%) The results: median fees dropped from $0.04 → $0.01 (–75%). Daily transactions jumped 140%, breaking 12M+ per day. October 2025 now brings the next chapter: 0.05 Gwei as the new floor. Trading Drives the Network The shift in activity is clear. At the start of 2025, swap-related activity made up just 20% of BSC transactions. By June, it surged to 67%, making trading the chain’s dominant use case. For these users, every fraction of a cent in fees matters. Low gas doesn’t just help,it decides where trades land. BNB’s staking yield remains above 0.5% APY, meaning validator rewards are stable. Network capacity also sits under 30% utilization, leaving plenty of headroom for volume growth. Risks and Safeguards Critics often point to three risks: failed transactions, validator incentives, and infrastructure strain. But the chain’s data suggests otherwise: Infrastructure has been tested to handle 3x today’s state load. Higher transaction counts offset lower per-tx fees, keeping validator APY healthy. Gas remains dynamic if congestion spikes. The system is designed to flex with demand while prioritizing accessibility. A New Principle for Growth The community is discussing a guiding principle for BNB Chain: “As long as staking APY stays above 0.5%, the network should aim for the lowest gas possible.” This ensures validators remain rewarded while users enjoy ultra-low costs. The long-term target is even more ambitious: ~$0.001 per tx, which would put BSC among the cheapest large chains globally. ATHs Back the Case Momentum is already on BNB Chain’s side. Last week, the chain hit fresh records: 17.4M active addresses $3.32B perpetuals volume 100M+ weekly transactions $1M+ daily fees Much of this surge is powered by @Aster_DEX, which has reignited the perpetuals trading narrative on BSC. These milestones strengthen the argument that lowering fees further won’t hurt sustainability,it may instead accelerate adoption. BNB Chain hits new weekly ATHs with 17.4M active addresses and $3.32B in perps volume. The growth is driven by @Aster_DEX , which attracted traders to @BNBCHAIN and reignited the perps narrative. Other metrics are climbing too: weekly trxns сrossed 100M, and daily fees hit $1M. pic.twitter.com/f7tFPcTNEK — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) September 24, 2025 BNB’s Market Position BNB is consolidating after recently breaking $1,000 for the first time. The rally reflects growing confidence in Binance’s ecosystem, even as competitors like Solana, Ethereum, and Base push for liquidity dominance. Cutting fees at this moment isn’t just tactical,it’s strategic. It signals BNB Chain intends to lead the next wave of onchain trading by staying the cheapest, fastest option. The proposal is now in community hands. Validators and users will weigh the pros and cons before voting. If approved, fees would halve within weeks, further positioning BNB Chain as the backbone for high-frequency onchain activity. The message from leadership is clear: performance and accessibility will drive the next stage of growth. BNB Chain has always moved forward with validator consensus and user support. This proposal continues that path. Community feedback will shape whether the chain pursues 0.05 Gwei now and $0.001 per tx long term. With adoption climbing and trading now dominant, the fee debate is more than numbers,it’s about securing BSC’s place in the future of DeFi. BNB trades at $1,014, with 24h volume at $3.8B and circulating supply of 139M BNB, per CoinMarketCap. The road ahead will be decided by the same principle that has guided past success: build fast, keep fees low, and grow together. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Yet the one-word message went viral, drawing over 8.6 million views within hours. The response was immediate. $FTT, the native token of the defunct FTX exchange, erupted in trading volume and price. According to Coingecko, $FTT jumped 30.2% in early trading, later peaking near a 60% gain on the day. $FTT is up 30.2% following a 'gm' tweet from Sam Bankman-Fried's X account. pic.twitter.com/9Zqk33Y01b — CoinGecko (@coingecko) September 24, 2025 Who’s Posting From Prison? The sudden appearance of SBF online fueled speculation. How does someone behind bars manage to post on X? Shortly after the “gm,” a follow-up clarification appeared. The account explained that Sam himself is not directly posting, but that “a friend” has access and is sharing updates on his behalf. The clarification did little to calm the chatter. Screenshots, reposts, and memes flooded crypto Twitter. Reactions split between disbelief, anger, and amusement at the idea of a casual “good morning” shaking up a dead token. The Market Impact The effect was undeniable. Traders rushed back into $FTT, a token once written off after FTX’s collapse in 2022. At press time, $FTT trades around $0.97, up 18% in 24 hours, with a market cap of $319 million, according to CoinMarketCap. Daily volume surged past $79 million. Timing Ahead of Repayment Round The surge also coincides with a crucial date for FTX creditors. On September 30, the exchange is scheduled for its third repayment round, distributing $1.6 billion back to creditors. Speculators may be linking the renewed activity around SBF’s account to renewed hopes for the FTX estate. While there’s no official connection between the tweet and the repayment, markets often react emotionally to symbolic signals. Digital Resurrection of #SBF Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced genius serving 25 years for massive fraud, has just broken his silence on X after months of digital silence.

A… pic.twitter.com/QkPzrpSn1f — Ismeidy (@ismeidyfinanzas) September 24, 2025 A Community Divided The broader crypto community remains torn. Some view the $FTT move as a cynical pump, with little substance behind it. Others frame it as proof of the token’s resilience, even years after its parent exchange collapsed. Crypto commentator @g13m noted that “the fact a single ‘gm’ can do this says more about trader psychology than fundamentals.” GieM The unexpected awakening of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in X, where he is serving a 25-year sentence in an American prison, led to a nearly 60% increase in the price of the FTT exchange token. After the ""Good Morning"" message, another post was published, clarifying that… pic.twitter.com/4iOyJ4FOqu — Captain GM (@g13m) September 24, 2025 Memes also poured in, with “gm from prison” trending across X. Some joked about Sam tweeting workout updates or prison cafeteria reviews next. Others criticized the ethical implications of humanizing someone convicted of one of the largest frauds in financial history. The SBF Factor Sam Bankman-Fried has been largely absent from public conversation since his conviction earlier this year. Legal experts had predicted a quiet disappearance from headlines as the FTX bankruptcy played out. Instead, his digital ghost just sent shockwaves through crypto markets. Even from behind bars, the mere suggestion of SBF’s presence still moves money. That fact alone raises questions about how much influence individuals continue to hold over crypto sentiment, even after disgrace. Whether today’s surge sustains is uncertain. $FTT remains a speculative asset tied to a collapsed exchange, with little utility outside creditor speculation. Still, today’s price action shows that narratives,especially unexpected ones,can reignite interest. As the September 30 repayment round approaches, all eyes will remain on both $FTT price action and the X account of Sam Bankman-Fried. A casual post already triggered one rally. Traders are now watching closely for the next digital whisper from prison. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While the market shows attempts at recovery, the unclear wave patterns leave traders divided on whether the next move will be a breakout or a deeper correction. Messy Subwaves Keep Bitcoin’s Next Move Clouded TARA, a crypto analyst, recently shared fresh insights on X regarding Bitcoin’s ongoing price action. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is currently in the middle of forming another wave down, but the subwave structure is still messy and unclear. This uncertainty makes it harder to predict the exact short-term direction, though the broader trend signals that further movement is likely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Signals Bullish Edge As Traders Eye Fed Pivot She noted that BTC has already tested the resistance zone around $113,500, but the market still seems drawn toward lower targets. The rejection from that resistance highlights the weakness in immediate bullish momentum, leaving room for bears to reassert control. TARA also emphasized that the $111,000 level remains a critical area to watch. This zone aligns closely with important Fibonacci retracement levels, particularly the .618 support fibs. As long as Bitcoin holds above this threshold, there’s still a chance for the bulls to regain momentum and avoid deeper downside pressure. However, if $111,000 is broken decisively, the analyst warned that Bitcoin would most likely extend its decline toward the next major Fibonacci level near $99,000. Such a move would shake out weak hands before the market establishes a more stable foundation for recovery. BTC Finds Support As Liquidity Grab Sparks Bounce Crypto VIP Signal, in a fresh update, noted that Bitcoin recently grabbed liquidity at a key support zone before bouncing higher. This liquidity sweep allowed the market to reset after testing lower levels, showing that buyers were quick to step in and defend the area. Such reactions often serve as early signs of strength, suggesting that Bitcoin still holds bullish potential as long as the support remains intact. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Drops To $115K After Rate-Cut Rally — But BTC Far From Capitulation Attention now turns to the $113,000–$113,300 resistance zone, which stands as the next major hurdle for price action. This level has acted as a tough ceiling in previous attempts, making it a critical zone to watch. According to the analyst, a decisive close above $113,300 could pave the way for BTC to target the $115,000 level in the short term. Such a breakout would not only reinforce bullish momentum but also strengthen the case for a continuation of the broader upward trend. In the meantime, speculations are whether Bitcoin can hold onto its rebound or if resistance will once again prove too strong to overcome.

52215414,588435,1758754842,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52215414.jpeg,XRP And DeFi: The Roadmap That Tells It All,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-and-defi-the-roadmap/,"Ripple has unveiled the next phase of its roadmap for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in relation to institutional DeFi. The roadmap focuses on tokenization, privacy, and native lending, and plans to introduce more stablecoins on the network, which is a positive for XRP’s utility. Ripple Reveals Latest Roadmap For Institutional DeFi On The Ledger In a blog post , Ripple noted that tokenization remains the central enabler of the XRP Ledger’s institutional strategy. Therefore, plans are in place to introduce the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard by October on the network. The crypto firm explained that these MPTs are a flexible token standard that can carry essential metadata without relying on complex smart contracts. In relation to institutional DeFi on the XRP Ledger, Ripple noted that the MPT enables assets of bond issuers, money market funds , and structured products to be represented faithfully and traded natively on the network. The crypto firm further revealed that the next phase will enable the integration of MPTs into the DEX for easy trading, AMM liquidity pools, and cross-token payments. Furthermore, Ripple also plans to introduce a native lending protocol on the Ledger, which it described as the “most significant near-term milestone.” The lending protocol is set to go live in XRPL Version 3.0.0 later this year. The crypto firm said that the protocol introduces pooled lending and underwritten credit directly at the ledger level. Ripple remarked that the appeal of a native lending protocol on the Ledger is clear for institutions. The firm claimed that no financial institution will turn down low-cost capital if it can be sourced within KYC/AML standards . The protocol will pool liquidity from a global base of smaller investors into institutional-sized loans while maintaining compliance. For loan managers, this will be an opportunity to meet the rising demand for liquidity from TradFi by tapping into the growing crypto liquidity, specifically on the XRP Ledger. The Push For Programmable Privacy Ripple revealed that one of the XRP Ledger’s next major upgrades is programmable privacy . The firm noted that for financial institutions, full transparency doesn’t always work, but that privacy features must still meet compliance and auditability standards. The first privacy-focused application, confidential MPTs, is said to already be in development and is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of next year. These confidential MPTs will support privacy-preserving collateral management, which Ripple noted is a critical requirement for institutional adoption of tokenized finance . As a whole, the crypto firm indicated that the goal is to introduce more stablecoins, RWAs, lending, compliance tooling, and privacy directly at the protocol level at a global scale. Meanwhile, Ripple stated that over the last year, the Ledger has broken into the top 10 chains for RWAs and has reached its first $1 billion month in stablecoin volume. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.84, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Ripple|AMM Liquidity Pools|DeFi|DEX|KYC/AML Standards|MPTs|Multi-Purpose Token|ripple|ripple news|stablecoin|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|WALLET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-24 23:00:42

AML Software has filed a lawsuit against Athena Bitcoin, claiming that Athena conspired with Taproot Acquisition Enterprises and its CEO, Jordan Mirch, in a scheme to wrongfully obtain AML’s proprietary source code. Athena Bitcoin faces lawsuit over alleged source code theft Athena Bitcoin Global Inc., a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator , has run into legal trouble with the Illinois firm AML Software. AML Software filed a lawsuit accusing Athena Bitcoin of engaging in a scheme to steal its proprietary source code. The complaint was lodged on Tuesday in federal court and contains allegations of copyright infringement, trade secret theft, and other unlawful conduct. AML Software claims that its code is copyrighted and was never licensed for sale to Athena despite the company’s attempt to directly purchase AML’s code. The 16-page filing made allegations of collusion between Athena and Jordan Mirch, the CEO of Taproot Acquisition Enterprises. Mirch was implicated as the “motivating force” behind the alleged misappropriation and accused him of using fraudulent tactics to gain access to more than 3,000 ATMs still running AML’s software that Athena sought to acquire starting in 2023. The legal case involves SandP Solutions, which is a company that once operated 2,800 Bitcoin ATMs. After regulators barred SandP from operating in Ohio, the company faced mounting financial strain. The complaint alleges that Mirch seized the opportunity, securing SandP’s ATMs through “fraudulent misrepresentations and other unlawful conduct.” Once in possession of the machines, Mirch allegedly reached out to Athena to negotiate a transfer of both hardware and software. The lawsuit further claims that Mirch hired an AML developer as a consultant in an effort to wrongfully obtain AML’s existing copyrighted platform. Athena faces different customer protection lawsuit AML’s lawsuit also references a recent $9M settlement agreement involving Athena, Taproot, and associated entities. Under the terms, Athena announced earlier this month that it was gaining “immediate ownership of ATMs and source code,” while terminating a revenue-sharing deal with Taproot. AML, however, argues that the source code transferred under the agreement did not legally belong to Taproot or Athena, but to AML alone. Earlier this month, Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb filed a separate lawsuit accusing Athena of exploiting elderly customers through predatory practices . Schwalb alleged Athena profited from scams, charging up to 26% in hidden fees. Progressive Democrats have called for tougher consumer protections in the crypto sector.Senator Cynthia Lummis said Tuesday that she plans to address issues like those raised in the Athena case through forthcoming market structure legislation, co-sponsored with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.

On Wednesday in New York, nearly 500,000 fed funds futures contracts for September were traded, breaking a record set in April 2023 when Trump’s tariff news hit markets. The surge is happening while the effective fed funds rate quietly crept up to 4.09% on Monday. That single basis point move outside of a policy change was enough to rattle the futures market and raise red flags over overnight borrowing stress. Traders are responding to a tightening repo market, where firms borrow cash overnight in exchange for Treasuries, as month-end and quarter-end always bring more pressure, with shrinking bank reserves and more Treasury bills flooding the market. Traders expect spike in repo rates before month-end Scrutiny on the rate has jumped since July. That’s when Treasury started pumping out more bills, while the Fed kept slashing its balance sheet. Bank reserves are now falling. Some traders are warning this combo could lead to serious funding pressure at quarter-end. Dealers slow their repo activity to clean up their books, and that usually pushes up borrowing costs. Everyone’s trying to front-run that pressure. The bulk of the action in September futures happened during Asia hours, with two blocks of 50,000 contracts traded. That frenzy picked up again once U.S. markets opened, especially as traders eyed the effective rate possibly hitting 4.10% before the month wraps. For almost 20 years, U.S. funding markets were soaked in cheap cash. Not anymore. Now, rates on very short-term borrowing, used by banks and asset managers, are climbing. That’s because the Treasury is rebuilding its cash pile while the Fed keeps tightening. Meanwhile, use of the Fed’s overnight reverse repo tool, a barometer for excess cash, just fell to its lowest in four years. “We are seeing a level shift in funding,” said Mark Cabana of Bank of America. “Money funds no longer have excess cash to deploy to the RRP.” As more T-bills get sold, investors move money out of repo and into those bills, which is dragging demand down while pushing rates up.Interest-rate benchmarks tied to overnight repos are now sitting near the Fed’s interest on reserve balances rate, showing the strain. The spread between repo and the fed funds rate has widened to about 11.5 basis points, the biggest gap since April. That spread was under 10 basis points for most of July and August, before the new wave of T-bills hit. Fed weighs tools as collateral and reserves drop together Things may get worse fast. Corporate tax payments and new auctions are about to pull even more money from the system next week. That could upset the balance between cash and collateral — and banks already hold fewer reserves at the Fed. Those balances have fallen to around $3.15 trillion, and Fed Governor Christopher Waller has warned that $2.7 trillion is probably the floor for what counts as “ample.” Meanwhile, rates tied to overnight financing keep climbing, which creates a headache for the Fed’s quantitative tightening strategy, the balance sheet reduction started in June 2022 and is supposed to finish by year-end. But it’s getting harder to manage with rates rising and reserves shrinking. Roberto Perli, who runs the Fed’s securities portfolio, said the central bank’s short-term interest rate tools will become even more critical in times like this. The more efficiently they work, the less damage markets take. To avoid another 2019-style repo panic, the Fed now uses the Standing Repo Facility (SRF), letting eligible firms borrow cash by pledging Treasuries or agency debt. That facility charges a rate aligned with the top of the Fed’s target range, now at 4.5%. It saw its biggest usage at the end of June since being made permanent in 2021. But it hasn’t been tested under real stress yet. JPMorgan’s team said the SRF could contain spikes in repo rates, reducing the need to cut QT short. But others aren’t so sure. September is already looking shaky, and more volatility could force that debate to the front. Some Fed officials, including Waller and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, admit funding stress is building. But they’re not pushing for an early end to QT.

Senators Push For Probe According to the Wednesday letter , Slotkin and Warren want a probe launched into David Sacks and Steve Witkoff for allegedly “advocating for the United States to sell sensitive national security technology to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).” The Senate duo allege Sacks and Witkoff “played key roles” over the White House’s choice to ease AI system security restrictions in shipments sent to the UAE. However, the senators claim the two had not “disclosed their financial ties to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan,” UAE’s national security advisor. Trump Administration Ties Questioned By U.S. Lawmakers Slotkin and Warren say that Witkoff’s son, World Liberty Financial CEO Zach Witkoff, failed to recuse himself from U.S. decisions involving the UAE despite MGX – a state-owned investment firm controlled by Sheikh Tahnoon – investing $2 billion worth of WLF’s issued stablecoin , USD1, into Binance. The senators allege that Sacks and Witkoff “were in positions to control government decisions to personally enrich themselves – even as they created significant national security concerns.” “In the history of our country’s foreign policy, one is hard-pressed to find two senior officials with such significant conflicts of interest involved in decisions regarding national security,” Slotkin and Warren said. “Such unbridled conflicts of interest have no place in the U.S. government, and we urge you to undertake a swift and thorough evaluation of these allegations,” they added. “This information is also critical as Congress considers legislation for digital asset market structure and attempts to ensure that crypto corruption does not undermine our national security.” The post Senators Call For Probe Into Top Trump Administration Officials, appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Elizabeth Warren|Trump|World Liberty Financial,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BNB|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-24 23:28:45

Per the South Korean media outlet Electronic Times , the ruling party said the task force would “create policies that spur future growth.” South Korean Crypto Policy: Task Force Set to Meet Biz Leaders At a press event at the National Assembly on September 24, task force members said they plan to pass pro-business legislation before the end of the year. Han Jeong-ae, the Chair of the DP’s policy committee, said: “We need to establish a system that keeps pace with evolving trends in the new financial market.

(Source: @jongmun.lee.1/Facebook) The new unit will initially focus its efforts on stablecoin legislation, with lawmakers still to finalize their token issuance and distribution plans. But the DP’s plans will likely bring much cheer to South Korean crypto firms. The media outlet wrote that the lawmakers are “expected to focus on streamlining the system to foster industries.” It added that it would move away from existing crypto laws, which focus primarily “on operator regulation and user protection measures.” The lawmaker Lee Jeong-moon will head the task force. Members include the likes of Min Byoung-dug, the chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee and a vocal proponent of stablecoin-powered growth . The lawmaker Min Byoung-dug (center), ahead of legislative elections last year. (Source: @anyangminbest/Facebook) Task Force to Speak to Regulators, Central Bank The task force has already asked ministries and the top financial regulators (the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service) to come forward with policy proposals. The lawmakers have also asked the Bank of Korea to do likewise. They also plan to hold talks with companies in the sector, such as crypto exchanges and fintech companies. The task force said it would form an advisory group comprised of private sector experts. Lee said that the force’s goal was to roll out crypto-related legislation during the National Assembly’s final session of the calendar year. He explained: “We will treat the digital asset market as a new paradigm for the financial markets. Our goal is to develop policies that will foster future growth.” Han, meanwhile, lauded the government for its recent move to lift a ban on venture capital funding for crypto firms. She said the move would help revitalize the industry, and added: “We will communicate closely with the government and listen to and reflect diverse opinions from experts, financial institutions, crypto exchanges, and fintech companies.” The lawmaker Ahn Do-geol, another DP MP with a pro-business stance on crypto policy, stated: “The government must lead the way in financial innovation. We have already fallen a long way behind. We could miss out on the innovation and growth potential of the digital asset sector, including stablecoins .” Ahn concluded that lawmakers have “formed a consensus” on many crypto-related matters, with a general “bipartisan agreement” on stablecoins now in place.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/13-of-xrp-supply-could-be-taken-off-the-market-heres-why/,"Concerns are growing within the XRP community about a possible reduction in available supply, as new projects target large allocations of the token for staking and yield-bearing products. Digital Asset Investor (DAI), a well-known voice in the community, recently highlighted figures from both Axelar Network and Flare that, if realized, could remove billions of XRP from circulation. Ambitious Targets from Axelar and Flare Axelar Network recently introduced mXRP, a yield-generating asset that runs on both the XRP Ledger and its EVM Sidechain. In an interview with Crypto in America , Axelar Foundation co-founder Georgios Vlachos explained that the team measures success primarily by assets under management. So @axelar 's goal is to lock up 5% of the XRP circulating supply and @FlareNetworks 's goal is to lock up 5 Billion XRP. That's just two companies. Can you say supply shock?? pic.twitter.com/KBDahqMxfx — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) September 23, 2025 According to Vlachos, their goal is to reach $10 billion in XRP locked within the system. This figure translates to about 5% of the circulating supply. Similarly, Flare’s co-founder, Hugo Philion, set out his vision during an appearance on the Paul Barron Show. When asked about the expected growth of FXRP, Philion stated that he hopes to see 5 billion XRP secured on the Flare network by mid-2026. Combined, the objectives from both projects amount to roughly 8 billion tokens, which equate to approximately 13% of the current circulating supply. Current Progress Toward the Targets While the long-term goals are substantial, the actual progress so far is modest. Data shows that the mXRP product, which was formally launched at XRP Seoul 2025, currently holds about 3.851 million XRP. Of this amount, 2.786 million resides on the EVM Sidechain and the remainder on the XRP Ledger. When compared with the $10 billion target, this represents only about 0.006% of the total circulating supply. Nonetheless, since mXRP has only recently gone live, advocates argue that the project still has significant time to expand. Shrinking Exchange Reserves DAI’s warning about a possible supply crunch comes at a time when XRP balances on major exchanges appear to be decreasing sharply. Coinbase provides one example. In June, the exchange held around 970 million XRP spread across 52 cold wallets. By September 20, this figure had dropped dramatically to just 32 million XRP in two wallets. The sudden reduction has raised questions within the community, though Coinbase has not offered any public explanation for the shift. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Concentration of XRP Holdings Beyond exchange balances, a large proportion of XRP is already locked or controlled by key entities. Ripple retains control over 37.3 billion XRP in escrow and an additional 3.5 billion in liquid form. Co-founder Chris Larsen holds 2.3 billion, while Arthur Britto is estimated to control about 1.3 billion. Altogether, these allocations account for nearly 44.4% of the total token supply. Institutional interest is also beginning to emerge. For instance, Purpose ETF has disclosed holdings of 29.6 million XRP, while Canadian firm 3iQ manages approximately 45 million. Analyst 24HrsCrypto recently estimated that retail investors may collectively own no more than 15% of the circulating supply. According to 24HrsCrypto , the market could see even greater supply reductions once large financial institutions enter the space. Banks such as JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs are frequently mentioned as potential future participants. In addition, speculation continues about the possible approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds later this year, which could result in further tokens being moved into long-term storage. Although Axelar’s and Flare’s current holdings remain small relative to their ambitious goals, their stated objectives combined with declining exchange balances and institutional accumulation have intensified community discussions about a potential supply squeeze. If the projects achieve their targets, as much as 13% of circulating XRP could be removed from open markets, significantly reshaping the asset’s liquidity profile.

Now it says batteries have to follow. On Wednesday, during an auto industry event in Milan, Alfredo, the company’s European adviser, made it clear: if BYD is serious about making EVs locally, it can’t keep flying batteries in from China. The company’s factory in Hungary is almost ready and should start running by the end of this year. A second plant in Turkey is set for 2026. These two alone will give BYD the capacity to build about 500,000 cars a year in Europe. That’s a huge change from where the company started, which is with selling only electric cars in Europe. Now it’s adding plug-in hybrids to the mix, because European buyers seem to like the flexibility. BYD lays out the options for its next big move Alfredo said the company hasn’t decided what comes next. It’s weighing two options: a third car plant or its first battery facility in the region. Either way, BYD is not slowing down. “It does not make sense to invest in car assembly but bring batteries from China,” he told the audience in Milan. “Several factors come into play when choosing a new location,” Alfredo said , pointing to things like energy prices. “Energy cost is objectively one of the most important competitiveness factors,” he added, since both types of factories use a ton of electricity. Right now, the focus is on getting Hungary’s plant running at full speed. But BYD is already talking to governments across Europe about where it might set up its next base. The company says it wants all the EVs it sells in Europe to be built in Europe by 2027. That goal is meant to help the company avoid EU import tariffs. And for now, plug-in hybrids will likely dominate sales, according to Stella, the company’s EVP. Fully electric models are still part of the plan, but BYD sees hybrids as the near-term money maker. On top of all that, Alfredo had something to say about Warren Buffett. Last month, Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, finished selling its full stake in BYD after 17 years. Some thought that move meant he was losing trust in the company. Alfredo wasn’t having it. “Buffett made a profit of 20 times the capital he invested. He did very well to do what he did,” he said. “We’ve been extremely glad to have had Buffett, but the fact that he monetised his position is exactly what Berkshire Hathaway does for a living: buying, earning and selling.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|BYD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-24 23:41:57

However, the crypto community pushed back against his remarks, with many arguing that his analysis relied too heavily on short-term data. BTC Down 20% against Gold The economist dismissed Bitcoin in a September 24 post on X, stating it is “not living up to its hype.” He pointed out that the cryptocurrency has dropped 20% against gold since its August peak, a fall that he said means it’s in bear market territory. Schiff added that since the crypto asset is promoted as “digital gold,” the 20% drop terms is comparatively more than the 10% decline in dollar terms. Bitcoin recently experienced a sharp correction that dragged it more than 8% down from its all-time high of $123,800 on August 13 to a recent 13-day low of $112,200 on September 22. On the other hand, gold has continued setting fresh highs this year, climbing more than 11% over the past month. This isn’t the first time Schiff has made such claims. A few days ago, he predicted that the metal’s steady strength could set the stage for a breakout while it’s counterpart continues to slip. His view is supported by analyst Stockmoney Lizards, who pointed to a bearish rising wedge in the leading cryptocurrency’s pattern. The latter’s chart shows $112,000 as the immediate support level, with $110,000 identified as the critical threshold, which means that a break below that point could signal a deeper decline. Crypto Community Fires Back Crypto supporters have rejected Schiff’s bearish outlook, with people accusing him of not factoring in the digital asset’s long-term dominance. Some claimed he is “moving the goalposts” by measuring Bitcoin in gold, pointing out that the cryptocurrency is still up triple digits against the metal over the past five years. Others dismissed his argument that a 20% decline constituted a bear market, saying that “in crypto, calling a 20% dip a ‘bear market’ is like calling a drizzle a flood.” Another X user highlighted the leading digital asset’s long-term dominance, noting that over the past decade, gold priced in Bitcoin has collapsed by 99.3%, dropping from about 4.84 BTC per ounce in 2015 to just 0.033 BTC today. The 62-year-old has remained relentless in his bearish stance. According to the artificial intelligence platform Grok, he has made 237 separate predictions since 2011 forecasting Bitcoin’s crash, collapse, or eventual worthlessness.

Recently, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin underscored a critical point: safety is the absolute top priority for this pivotal network enhancement. This isn’t just about speed; it’s about building a robust and secure foundation for the decentralized world. Understanding the significance of the Fusaka upgrade helps us appreciate the meticulous planning behind Ethereum’s evolution. Why is the Fusaka Upgrade So Important for Ethereum? The Ethereum network is constantly evolving to meet the demands of a growing ecosystem. The Fusaka upgrade represents a significant step forward, primarily focusing on enhancing scalability and security. Buterin’s emphasis on safety highlights the careful approach core developers are taking to ensure the network remains resilient. At the core of this upgrade is a feature called PeerDAS. This technical innovation is designed to revolutionize how nodes interact with blockchain data. It’s not just a minor tweak; it’s essential infrastructure for the long-term health of Ethereum. Enhanced Scalability: PeerDAS will enable the network to handle more transactions efficiently. Improved Security: Nodes can verify and reconstruct blocks without needing to store all data, reducing the burden on individual participants. Future-Proofing: This feature is crucial for both Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling solutions, paving the way for broader adoption. Understanding PeerDAS: A Glimpse into Scalability What exactly is PeerDAS, and why is it so vital? PeerDAS, short for “Peer Data Availability Sampling,” allows Ethereum nodes to check if all data for a block is available, even if they don’t download the entire block themselves. Think of it like a smart sampling method. Traditionally, nodes would need to store every piece of data to ensure the network’s integrity. However, as Ethereum scales, this becomes increasingly impractical. PeerDAS addresses this by: Enabling light clients to participate more effectively. Reducing the hardware requirements for running a node. Ultimately supporting a more decentralized and robust network. This mechanism is a game-changer for how Ethereum manages its ever-increasing data load, directly contributing to the success of the Fusaka upgrade . Navigating the Blob Expansion: A Conservative Approach Another key aspect of the Fusaka upgrade involves increasing the number of “blobs.” Blobs are essentially temporary data packets designed to hold transaction data for Layer 2 rollups. They are crucial for improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these scaling solutions. Buterin stated that the number of blobs will be increased “conservatively at first.” This cautious approach underscores the commitment to safety. Rushing to expand blob capacity could introduce unforeseen risks, potentially compromising network stability. The gradual increase allows developers to: Monitor network performance in real-time. Address any potential bottlenecks or vulnerabilities. Ensure a smooth and secure transition for the entire ecosystem. This careful expansion is a testament to the development team’s dedication to making the Fusaka upgrade a success without compromising Ethereum’s foundational security. What Challenges Does the Fusaka Upgrade Address? The Fusaka upgrade is designed to tackle some of Ethereum’s most pressing challenges head-on. As the network grows, issues like transaction costs, processing speed, and data storage become more pronounced. This upgrade directly targets these areas. By implementing PeerDAS and carefully expanding blob capacity, Ethereum aims to: Reduce Transaction Fees: More efficient data handling can lead to lower gas costs for users. Increase Throughput: The network will be able to process a higher volume of transactions per second. Enhance Decentralization: Lower hardware requirements for nodes make it easier for more individuals to participate, strengthening the network’s decentralized nature. These improvements are not just technical advancements; they translate directly into a better user experience and a more accessible blockchain for everyone. The Road Ahead: Fusaka Upgrade Timeline and Impact Ethereum core developers have set a tentative date of December 3 for the Fusaka upgrade . While dates in blockchain development can sometimes shift, this target provides a clear indication of the project’s momentum. The successful deployment of the Fusaka upgrade will have far-reaching implications: It will solidify Ethereum’s position as a leading blockchain for decentralized applications. It will accelerate the adoption of Layer 2 solutions, making Ethereum more practical for everyday use. It reinforces the network’s commitment to continuous improvement and robust security. This upgrade isn’t just another technical milestone; it’s a foundational step towards a more scalable, secure, and user-friendly Ethereum ecosystem. In conclusion, Vitalik Buterin’s unwavering focus on safety for the Fusaka upgrade underscores Ethereum’s commitment to building a resilient and future-proof blockchain. With innovations like PeerDAS and a conservative approach to blob expansion, the upgrade promises to significantly enhance scalability, security, and decentralization. As the tentative December 3rd date approaches, the crypto community eagerly anticipates the positive impact this pivotal upgrade will have on Ethereum’s journey towards mass adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Fusaka upgrade? The Fusaka upgrade is an upcoming enhancement to the Ethereum network, primarily focused on improving scalability and security through features like PeerDAS and an increase in data blobs. Who is Vitalik Buterin, and what is his role in the Fusaka upgrade? Vitalik Buterin is the co-founder of Ethereum. He has emphasized that safety is the top priority for the Fusaka upgrade, guiding its development philosophy. What is PeerDAS, and how does it relate to the Fusaka upgrade?

This dramatic shakeout has left investors searching for opportunities amid the chaos, with many turning to best crypto presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as potential havens from mainstream market volatility. Market analysts suggest this liquidation event could mark a crucial reset point for the broader crypto ecosystem. Liquidation Tsunami Rocks Bitcoin Markets The September 2025 crypto market downturn began when more than $1.7 billion worth of leveraged positions were closed during a single 24-hour period. Bitcoin price reached $111,800 during the liquidation period, but it now trades at $112,863. Major exchanges experienced their largest-ever market collapse due to massive leverage liquidations, which reached unprecedented levels. The crypto market experienced its fourth-largest long liquidation in 2025 on Monday when Bitcoin prices reached their lowest point and $1.6 billion worth of leveraged positions got wiped out. The system accumulated dangerous speculative amounts which this data demonstrates. The exchange data shows that $1.6 billion worth of liquidated positions were long bets which indicates most traders held optimistic views about price increases. The market became exposed to massive liquidation waves because traders maintained excessive bullish positions until essential support levels failed. Major market cycles follow this specific pattern. Market euphoria leads to excessive leverage which creates conditions for price drops to trigger massive liquidation waves that exceed their initial causes. Technical Analysis Points to Critical Juncture Bitcoin price has reached its support zone between $110K and $112K while liquidation spikes indicate intense market volatility. Technical experts monitor these specific price points because they could serve as triggers for upcoming market trends. The 30-day volatility of BTC decreased to 1.33% which approaches its yearly minimum value just like the August beginning. The current market situation holds essential value for traders because this compression pattern typically leads to explosive price movements in any direction. The liquidation data shows that excessive leveraged positions have been removed from the market which might establish better technical market conditions. Market structure experts believe this type of market reset creates essential moments for crypto market cycles to shift direction. The liquidation event showed institutional-grade selling activity while professional investors started buying at lower price points. Major market bottoms show themselves through the distinct behavior of retail investors who panic while professional traders seek opportunities. Best Crypto Presale Projects Gain Attention As mainstream cryptocurrency markets face turbulence, investor interest in best crypto presale opportunities has surged. The cryptocurrency market in 2025 finds itself at a pivotal juncture, with investors increasingly focused on finding the best crypto presales. MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as a standout opportunity during this market reset. While Bitcoin and major altcoins face liquidation pressure, presale projects offer insulation from margin trading volatility that has plagued established markets. The appeal of presale investments during market shakeouts is straightforward. These projects aren’t subject to the leverage-driven volatility affecting exchange-traded assets. Additionally, early-stage pricing often provides better risk-reward profiles than buying established coins at elevated levels. Professional investors increasingly view presale opportunities as portfolio diversification tools. During periods of mainstream market stress, these alternative investments can provide uncorrelated returns that smooth overall portfolio performance. Hidden Gems Emerge from Market Chaos Investors seeking to uncover hidden gems should examine market disruptions, as they often generate the most promising investment opportunities. The market currently supports projects that integrate new technology with dedicated communities and established listing strategies. The current market situation favors projects with solid fundamentals over those based solely on speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE presents itself as a hidden investment opportunity that matches the criteria of emerging projects. The current market instability allows smart investors to identify new breakthrough projects which traders overlook while monitoring Bitcoin technical indicators and liquidation events. The project launch date matches the current market conditions. The market shift toward stable assets attracts institutional investors who support community-based projects that demonstrate practical uses. The market transition toward fundamental value discovery benefits MAGACOIN FINANCE because it moves away from speculative price movements. Quality projects find their best entry points during major market downturns which early-stage investors understand. The current market volatility presents an excellent chance for investors who want to move past surface-level price movements. Market Reset Creates Strategic Opportunities The $1.8 billion liquidation event demonstrates both the dangers and the resilience of the crypto market in the face of challenges. The event serves as a warning to investors about the risks of excessive leverage in their trading activities. The market will enter a new expansion period after this final period of market adjustment, according to some market participants. The professional investment community views this liquidation event as a necessary step to clean up the market. The removal of excessive speculation has created a more favorable environment for sustained market growth. The current market conditions support projects which deliver practical value and maintain active community involvement. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the best crypto presale investment because it allows users to access explosive market potential without facing the leverage-related dangers that have destroyed overleveraged positions. The fundamental elements of crypto adoption continue to advance despite short-term market price swings. The development of institutional infrastructure, alongside improved global regulatory frameworks and practical blockchain solutions in real-world applications, continues to advance. The fundamental growth factors operate independently of market price movements to drive long-term expansion. Investment Strategy During Market Uncertainty Experienced crypto investors capitalize on market shakeouts as an entry point, rather than rushing to sell their holdings. The current market situation favors investors who plan their moves instead of making impulsive trades. The strategic exposure of MAGACOIN FINANCE as a best crypto presale project enables investors to participate in the market. Strategic portfolio management through diversified investments in various project types and market capitalizations enables better navigation of market volatility. The technical challenges faced by Bitcoin and major altcoins create presale investment opportunities that provide distinct risk and reward dynamics for portfolio growth. Professional traders understand that liquidation events require them to stay patient, as markets tend to swing excessively in both positive and negative directions. The market tends to make excessive movements in both positive and negative directions which professional traders use to their advantage when others lose control. Conclusion The $1.8 billion liquidation event marks a significant reset point for cryptocurrency markets. While short-term volatility creates challenges, it also generates opportunities for strategic investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE and similar best crypto presale projects offer compelling alternatives to mainstream market exposure during uncertain times. Market cycles consistently reward those who position early in quality projects rather than chasing momentum in overvalued assets. The current shakeout creates exactly these types of opportunities for discerning investors willing to look beyond immediate headline volatility.

The Numbers Behind the Price Target,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-to-1-the-numbers-behind-the-price-target/,"The idea of Shiba Inu (SHIB) reaching a value of $1 continues to circulate within the crypto community, but closer examination of the numbers reveals that the target is largely unrealistic under current conditions. While some community leaders and market commentators maintain optimism, the scale of SHIB’s supply and current burn rates present significant obstacles. Community Sentiment and Predictions Price projections for SHIB vary widely, ranging from modest targets of $0.0001 to more ambitious levels such as $0.001 . The most extreme prediction, $1 per token, remains the most controversial. Supporters argue that strong utility growth combined with aggressive token reduction strategies could make the goal achievable. Lucie, Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, previously referenced external analysis suggesting that expanded adoption and accelerated burns could, in theory, support such a valuation. Why the $1 Target Is Unlikely The primary challenge is SHIB’s vast supply. Current data places the circulating supply at approximately 589.24 trillion tokens. With SHIB trading at $0.00001227, the token’s market capitalization sits around $7.14 billion. To reach $1, the price would need to climb more than 8 million percent, creating a market capitalization of roughly $589 trillion. For perspective, that figure is several times larger than the global economy and far beyond the entire cryptocurrency sector’s combined valuation, which is estimated at about $4 trillion. This mathematical reality underscores why analysts remain skeptical that SHIB can achieve a $1 price point without extreme changes in supply dynamics. Token Burn Efforts Shiba Inu has attempted to address the supply issue through token burns. Soon after its launch, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin removed approximately 410 trillion SHIB from circulation, reducing the total supply from one quadrillion to roughly 590 trillion. Since then, the community has continued to push for ongoing burns as a price support mechanism. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In practice, however, the burn rate has slowed. Monthly reductions have ranged between 13 million and 2.31 billion tokens, with daily activity often registering in the hundreds of thousands. At the current pace, it would take decades to bring the supply down to the estimated 7 billion tokens needed to support a $1 price with today’s market capitalization. Additional supply control efforts have come through Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain. The network converts part of its gas fees into SHIB and directs them to a burn wallet. Since its introduction in August 2023 , Shibarium has removed billions of tokens from circulation. However, Shibarium’s impact depends on the level of activity on the network. Transaction volumes have recently fallen to around 20,460 per day, a sharp drop compared to peaks of over 4 million daily transactions earlier in the year. This decline limits the scale of SHIB reductions that can be achieved through the mechanism. The $1 dream remains a central talking point for many SHIB enthusiasts, but the mathematics demonstrate that such a price level is not feasible without extraordinary supply cuts and broader adoption of Shibarium or other burn mechanisms. While community-driven burns and utility expansion efforts provide long-term potential, the gap between current realities and the $1 target is significant.

Drawing on historical price patterns and critical support levels, the analyst suggests that XRP could be on track for either a slightly conservative surge toward $9.6 or an explosive rally to $33. XRP Price Retest Signals Path Toward $9.6 In his post released on X social media, Egrag Crypto highlights XRP’s market behavior during the 2021 cycle, particularly the cryptocurrency’s interaction with the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and how it has played a role in fueling massive gains. At the time, XRP faced one of its most turbulent periods in its history. Related Reading: 8-Year Accumulation Phase Could Catapult XRP Price To $6 The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple had triggered a sharp drop, pushing the XRP price below the 21 EMA. This move disrupted the bullish structure that had supported XRP in earlier rallies, spreading uncertainty and fear across the market. However, XRP eventually managed to reclaim the 21 EMA and hold it as a critical support level. The chart analysis shows that after the cryptocurrency executed a successful retest, it staged a powerful rebound, driving its price up by approximately 414%. Applying this same percentage gain to XRP’s current market structure, the analyst presents his first bull rally scenario, projecting targets that point to a peak around $ 9.60. His chart analysis reveals that the current market setup resembles the key conditions observed in 2021, particularly with XRP’s recent retest of the 21 EMA on June 9 this year. The Altcoin Faces Potential Moonshot To $33 Egrag Crypto’s second scenario for the XRP price outlook is modeled after its explosive rally during the 2017 cycle, when the 21 EMA acted as a powerful launchpad for growth. At the time, XRP bounced off this key support level twice, paving the way for a remarkable 1,610% rally. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Major XRP Warning: Last Chance To Get In As Accumulation Balloons This breakout marked one of the most defining moments in XRP’s history, propelling the asset from sub-dollar levels to a fresh ATH around $3.84 at the peak of that bull cycle. If XRP repeats the 2021 cycle dynamics in 2025, Egrag Crypto forecasts that the measured move points to another 1,610% increase, potentially pushing the price to a more ambitious target of $33. Such a rally would represent one of the strongest performances in XRP’s history, firmly establishing it as a standout asset in the market. With the US SEC lawsuit finally concluded and XRP completing its third retest of the 21 EMA this year, the conditions are aligning for a potential surge toward $9.6 or $33. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.87, having declined in the past week by approximately 5%.

Recent proposals suggest that digital asset platforms operating in the country will soon face mandatory Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing requirements. This move signals a growing global trend towards establishing clear rules for the rapidly evolving digital finance sector. Why is Australia Embracing Mandatory Digital Asset Licensing? The Australian government’s draft regulation, as reported by Yahoo Finance, aims to bring much-needed clarity and protection to the digital asset space. The primary goal is to safeguard consumers and foster market integrity. Without proper oversight, the risks of fraud, scams, and market manipulation can be higher, eroding public trust in digital assets. This initiative seeks to level the playing field, ensuring that all platforms adhere to a baseline of operational excellence and accountability. It’s about creating a secure environment where innovation can still thrive, but not at the expense of user safety. Key Requirements for Digital Asset Platforms The proposed framework outlines several crucial obligations for platforms dealing with digital assets. These are designed to ensure transparency, security, and consumer recourse: Financial Services License: Platforms will need to obtain a specific financial services license, aligning them with traditional financial institutions. This ensures they meet stringent regulatory standards. Dispute Resolution System: A robust system for resolving customer complaints and disputes will be mandatory. This gives users a clear path to address issues, enhancing consumer protection. Minimum Standards for Custody: Platforms holding customer digital assets must meet specific standards for secure custody. This protects users’ funds from hacks, theft, and mismanagement. Payment Standards: Requirements for payment processes will be introduced, aiming to ensure efficient and secure transactions. This builds confidence in the operational reliability of these platforms. What are the Benefits of Robust Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing? While some in the crypto community might view regulation with skepticism, there are significant advantages to a well-structured regulatory framework. Firstly, it can dramatically boost investor confidence. Knowing that platforms are licensed and subject to oversight can encourage more mainstream adoption and institutional investment. Moreover, it helps in combating illicit activities. By requiring platforms to identify their clients and monitor transactions, the new rules can make it harder for bad actors to use digital assets for money laundering or terrorist financing. This ultimately strengthens the reputation of the entire digital asset industry. Navigating the Challenges of Digital Asset Licensing Of course, implementing such comprehensive regulations is not without its challenges. Smaller platforms and startups might face increased compliance costs, potentially hindering their ability to compete. There’s also the delicate balance of fostering innovation versus imposing overly restrictive rules. Regulators must work closely with the industry to ensure the framework is practical and forward-looking. Another challenge is the dynamic nature of digital assets themselves. The technology evolves rapidly, and regulations must be flexible enough to adapt without becoming outdated too quickly. The success of Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing will depend on its ability to strike this balance. What Does This Mean for You, the Crypto User? For individuals trading or holding digital assets in Australia, these proposed changes are generally positive. They promise a safer and more transparent environment. You can expect platforms to be more accountable, with clearer avenues for support and dispute resolution. This shift could lead to a more stable and trustworthy market, encouraging broader participation. It’s an exciting time as Australia moves to solidify its position in the global digital economy, demonstrating a commitment to responsible growth in the crypto space. The framework for Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing is a pivotal step. Conclusion: Australia’s proposal for mandatory digital asset licensing marks a pivotal moment for its crypto industry. By introducing clear regulatory standards, the nation aims to enhance consumer protection, foster market integrity, and build greater trust in digital assets. While challenges in implementation will exist, this proactive approach positions Australia as a leader in creating a secure and responsible environment for the future of finance. It’s a move that promises a more mature and reliable ecosystem for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of Australia’s proposed digital asset licensing? A1: The primary goal is to enhance consumer protection, ensure market integrity, and prevent illicit activities within the digital asset sector by requiring platforms to meet specific regulatory standards. Q2: Which platforms will be affected by these new regulations? A2: The regulations will primarily affect digital asset platforms operating in Australia that facilitate the exchange, custody, or payment services involving cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Q3: What are some key requirements for platforms under the new licensing? A3: Key requirements include obtaining a financial services license, establishing a robust dispute resolution system, and meeting minimum standards for the custody and payment processing of digital assets. Q4: How will these changes benefit crypto users in Australia? A4: Crypto users can expect a safer, more transparent, and trustworthy environment. Platforms will be more accountable, with clearer processes for dispute resolution and enhanced security for their digital assets. Q5: When are these new regulations expected to come into effect? A5: The proposal is currently in a draft stage. After public consultation and parliamentary processes, a final timeline for implementation will be announced.

To help investors navigate these emotional tides, we have the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This vital sentiment indicator currently stands at 44, signaling that “Fear” continues to hold sway among market participants. This reading, unchanged from the previous day, highlights ongoing caution. But what exactly does this specific number mean, and how can understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index empower your investment journey? What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Really Tell Us? Developed by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a clear snapshot of the market’s emotional temperature. It uses a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Intense anxiety, often leading to panic selling. 25-49: Fear – A cautious market, characterized by investor hesitation. 50-74: Greed – Growing optimism, typically fueled by rising prices. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoric sentiment, potentially indicating an overheated market. A score of 44 places us firmly in the “Fear” zone. This suggests that investors are generally wary, possibly holding back on new purchases or even considering selling due to concerns about potential losses. Recognizing this collective sentiment is crucial for making more objective investment decisions, rather than being swept away by market emotions. Unpacking the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: The Factors at Play The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s a sophisticated calculation combining six distinct market factors, each contributing to the final score: Volatility (25%): Measures Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. High volatility often signals an uncertain market, driving the index towards “Fear.” Market Momentum/Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volume and momentum. Strong buying volume indicates greed; low volume during a downturn suggests fear. Social Media (15%): Scans crypto-related posts for sentiment. Negative chatter can push the index towards fear. Surveys (15%): Historically, these polls captured direct investor sentiment. (Currently paused but a key factor in its design). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s market cap share. Rising dominance often implies investors are seeking safety in BTC, reflecting broader market fear. Google Search Trends (10%): Examines search queries like “Bitcoin crash.” Spikes in such terms indicate growing retail investor fear. These components collectively paint a comprehensive picture of market psychology, informing the daily reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . Navigating the ‘Fear’ Territory: Investor Strategies and Challenges When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals “Fear,” it presents both challenges and potential opportunities. Many seasoned investors recall the wisdom: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” This suggests that periods of market fear could be prime moments for strategic accumulation. Potential Opportunities: For long-term investors, “Fear” territory can offer chances to acquire assets at reduced prices. Historically, significant value has been found when market sentiment is low, provided the underlying projects have strong fundamentals. Key Challenges: Investing during fearful times demands strong conviction. The emotional pressure to sell or avoid buying can be intense, especially if prices continue to decline. It’s vital to differentiate between short-term market noise and genuine shifts in fundamentals. Actionable Insight: Employing Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is a smart strategy during periods of fear. By investing a consistent amount at regular intervals, you average out your purchase price over time. This mitigates the impact of short-term volatility, allowing you to build positions steadily even when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests caution. Remember, emotional decisions rarely lead to optimal outcomes. The index serves as a guide, not a definitive trading command. Beyond the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Balanced Perspective While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers valuable insight into market sentiment, it is just one tool in your analytical arsenal. Relying solely on any single indicator can lead to incomplete conclusions. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by numerous factors, necessitating a holistic approach. Consider these additional elements when evaluating the market: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global inflation, interest rate policies, and geopolitical events profoundly affect investor risk appetite across all asset classes, including crypto. Regulatory Developments: New legislation or government stances on digital assets can significantly alter market sentiment and price trajectories. Technological Advancements: Innovations in blockchain technology, new project launches, or major network upgrades can generate positive sentiment and drive adoption. Fundamental Analysis: Thorough research into a crypto project’s utility, development team, tokenomics, and community remains critical for long-term investment success. By combining the sentiment from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with a broader understanding of market fundamentals and external influences, you can forge a more robust and resilient investment strategy. In conclusion, the current 44 reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals a period of caution and uncertainty in the crypto market. While “Fear” can be a challenging environment, it has historically presented opportunities for disciplined investors who look beyond short-term volatility. Use this index as a valuable guide, but always complement it with thorough research and a comprehensive understanding of the market’s diverse dynamics. Staying informed and making rational, rather than impulsive, decisions are your best assets in navigating the exciting, yet unpredictable, world of cryptocurrency.

For those of us tracking economic trends and their ripple effects on the cryptocurrency landscape, this movement is particularly noteworthy. It signals potential shifts that could influence everything from trade to digital asset valuations. What’s Behind the South Korean Won’s Recent Dip? On September 25, the South Korean won experienced a notable weakening, trading past 1,400 against the U.S. dollar. This marks the first time since August 1 that the currency has crossed this threshold, with the exchange rate settling around 1,401.98, according to data from TradingView. This movement isn’t just a number; it reflects underlying economic pressures that are impacting a major Asian economy. Such a shift often indicates a complex interplay of global and domestic factors. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone looking to make informed decisions in the current economic climate. Why is the South Korean Won Under Such Pressure? The recent depreciation of the South Korean won is not an isolated event. Several key factors are contributing to this trend: Aggressive U.S. Interest Rate Hikes: The U.S. Federal Reserve’s continued efforts to combat inflation by raising interest rates have significantly strengthened the U.S. dollar. This makes other currencies, including the won, relatively weaker. Global Economic Slowdown Fears: Concerns about a potential global recession are dampening demand for exports. As an export-driven economy, South Korea is particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in international trade. High Energy Import Costs: South Korea is a net importer of energy. Elevated global oil and gas prices mean the country needs more U.S. dollars to pay for these essential imports, increasing demand for USD and weakening the won. Domestic Economic Concerns: Local factors, such as persistent inflation and rising household debt, also contribute to economic uncertainty, which can put downward pressure on the national currency. These combined forces create a challenging environment for the South Korean won , making it susceptible to further volatility. How Does a Weaker South Korean Won Affect Crypto Investors? South Korea boasts one of the most active cryptocurrency markets globally. Therefore, a weakening South Korean won has direct implications for crypto investors in the region: Increased Cost of Stablecoins: For investors holding won, buying U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT or USDC becomes more expensive. This can affect trading strategies and hedging costs. Potential for Capital Flight: If local economic confidence erodes significantly, some investors might seek to move their assets out of the won into perceived safer havens, potentially including cryptocurrencies. However, this also carries risks. Reduced Purchasing Power: A weaker won means that Korean investors have less purchasing power when acquiring international crypto assets priced in USD or other stronger currencies. While a weaker currency can sometimes spur interest in alternative assets like crypto as a hedge, it also introduces additional layers of risk and complexity for investors. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the market. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for South Korean Won Holders In times of currency volatility, thoughtful planning and risk management become paramount. Here are some actionable insights for both traditional and crypto investors impacted by the movement of the South Korean won : Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider diversifying across different asset classes and geographies to mitigate risks associated with single-currency exposure. Monitor Global Indicators: Keep a close eye on global economic data, particularly U.S. inflation and interest rate decisions, as these significantly influence currency markets. Understand Stablecoin Mechanics: If you are a crypto investor, comprehend how stablecoins maintain their peg and the potential risks involved, especially during periods of high fiat currency volatility. Practice Prudent Risk Management: Avoid making impulsive decisions. Implement stop-loss orders, manage your position sizes, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Regularly consume reliable economic news and analysis. Knowledge is your best defense against market surprises. The financial landscape is always evolving, and being prepared helps investors adapt to changing conditions. Conclusion: Vigilance in a Volatile World The recent weakening of the South Korean won past 1,400 against the U.S. dollar serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of global financial markets. From aggressive central bank policies to geopolitical tensions and energy prices, numerous factors influence currency valuations and, by extension, the broader investment landscape, including cryptocurrencies. For investors, particularly those in South Korea and those trading with the won, vigilance and a clear understanding of these economic forces are essential. While challenges exist, informed decision-making and a well-thought-out strategy can help navigate these turbulent waters. Staying updated on economic trends and their potential impact on both traditional and digital assets remains a top priority. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when a currency ‘weakens’ against another? When a currency weakens, it means you need more units of that currency to buy one unit of another currency. For example, if the South Korean won weakens against the U.S. dollar, it takes more won to buy one dollar. Q2: How do U.S. interest rate hikes affect the South Korean won? Higher U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors seeking higher returns. This increases demand for the U.S. dollar, causing it to strengthen and other currencies, like the won, to weaken. Q3: Is a weaker South Korean won always bad for the economy? Not necessarily. While it makes imports more expensive, a weaker won can make a country’s exports more competitive on the global market, potentially boosting export-oriented industries. Q4: Should crypto investors in South Korea be concerned about the won’s depreciation? They should be aware. A weaker won increases the cost of acquiring U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and international crypto assets. It also adds a layer of currency risk to their portfolio, making careful risk management even more important. Q5: What is TradingView and why is it mentioned? TradingView is a popular charting platform and social network for traders and investors. It’s mentioned as the source of the exchange rate data, lending credibility and transparency to the reported figures. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

While SOL has potential for growth, its upside is quite modest when compared to some of the newer projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is now presale for $0.035, is making headlines for its lending-and-borrowing protocol with DeFi emphasis, set to provide real-world adoption and scale-fit utility. Mutuum Finance is available for $0.035 at presale level 6. The protocol has exceeded more than $16.2 million in funds raised from more than 16,550 holders. With significantly lower price, the majority of investors believe that MUTM can return up to 25x, and this would be one of the top choices for investors seeking more solid returns in the year 2025. Solana Price Prediction Solana (SOL) is fluctuating around $231.50, holding ground below the critical $245–$250 resistance point. Analysts note that SOL will need a clear break above this level to build momentum towards its $270–$300 level that has been projected for Q4. Failure to break through resistance could have the asset stuck in the between $220 and $250 range, and overall market sentiment will be the determiner of whether higher levels are an achievable target. On the other hand, new project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being heralded as having improved growth opportunities. Strong Presale Performance Mutuum Finance has hit Stage Six of presale, with tokens selling at $0.035 after experiencing a 16.17% price increase from the previous round. Investor demand remains strong, with more than 16,550 participants and more than $16.2 million raised in capital. To strengthen platform security, Mutuum Finance is introducing a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The vulnerabilities are categorized into four types, critical, major, minor, and low, in order to ensure proper detection and fixing. The protocol uses strict control on collateralized assets to safeguard the system and participants. Controls take the shape of definite collateral ratios, caps on lending, and limits on deposits. Positions that are undercollateralized are rapidly closed, and call penalties and remediation fees are charged to ensure systemic stability. Building an Efficient Platform Efficiency is ensured through the optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, especially in cases of overcollateralized credit. Reserve requirements offer a buffer to dampen market shocks, while additional reserves may be employed for risk-absorbing purposes with risky assets. Mutuum Finance’s overall goal is to fundamentally transform the DeFi model on the premises of long-term sustainability, reliability, and inclusiveness. The project is not only building a secure lending and borrowing platform but also opening up a new era where decentralized finance becomes more accessible to retail and institutional investors. To encourage early adoption as well as community building, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway contest in which 10 winners will get $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. This initiative highlights the project’s commitment to rewarding its supporters while driving awareness and participation across the ecosystem. A key pillar of its capital model, Mutuum Finance employs a dynamic, liquidity-driven interest rate mechanism. This system ensures lending and borrowing are always in balance with shifting market conditions. When there is plentiful capital on the platform, borrowing rates are kept deliberately low, encouraging more use of funds available and driving market activity. By contrast, if liquidity is constricted, the cost of borrowing increases, and that incentivizes existing borrowers to repay existing loans and draws in fresh deposits as well. This self-reinforcing process creates a better, more sustainable climate that protects user interests, moderates liquidity streams, and weakens the overall protocol’s exposure during both periods of calm and turmoil in the markets. MUTM’s Early-Stage Upside vs. SOL’s Consolidation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction as investors look beyond Solana’s (SOL) price surge to $300. At $0.035 in Stage 6, MUTM has raised $16.2M from 16,550+ holders, with analysts predicting up to 25x returns based on its lower market cap and strong DeFi utility. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, strong collateral governance, and a $100K giveaway, the project combines security, efficiency, and adoption-fueled growth. Whereas SOL builds strength around $231.50 for a breakout, MUTM offers early investors better upside. Lock-in Stage 6 tokens now before the price rises in the next phase.

This movement signals a potentially exciting shift in the market dynamics, drawing attention to altcoins and their performance against Bitcoin. For many crypto enthusiasts, this rise in the Altcoin Season Index is a compelling indicator worth watching closely. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Mean? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for anyone tracking the broader crypto market. Developed by CoinMarketCap, this index serves as a barometer for altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. It helps us gauge whether the market sentiment favors altcoins or if Bitcoin continues to dominate. Here’s how the Altcoin Season Index is calculated: It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Stablecoins and wrapped coins are intentionally excluded from this calculation to provide a clearer picture of genuine market movements. The performance of these top 100 coins is measured against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. An altcoin season is officially declared when 75% of these top coins outperform Bitcoin within that 90-day window. Conversely, if Bitcoin is the dominant performer, it’s considered a Bitcoin season. A reading closer to 100 on the Altcoin Season Index indicates a stronger, more pronounced altcoin season. Is a Full-Blown Altcoin Season on the Horizon? With the Altcoin Season Index now standing at 72, many are wondering if we are on the cusp of a full-fledged altcoin season. While 72 is an impressive figure and a strong indicator of growing altcoin strength, it’s just shy of the 75-point threshold required for an official declaration. However, this upward trend is undeniably positive for altcoin investors. This recent four-point increase suggests a noticeable shift in capital flows and investor interest. People are actively exploring opportunities beyond Bitcoin, indicating a broadening of the market. This momentum could easily push the index past the 75-mark, potentially ushering in a period where many altcoins see significant gains. Therefore, staying informed about the Altcoin Season Index becomes even more vital. Navigating the Potential Altcoin Season: Benefits and Challenges A rising Altcoin Season Index brings both exciting opportunities and inherent risks for investors. Understanding these aspects is key to making informed decisions in a dynamic market. Potential Benefits: Higher Returns: Altcoins often exhibit higher volatility and, consequently, can offer greater percentage gains compared to Bitcoin during an altcoin season. Diversification: Investing in a variety of altcoins can help diversify a crypto portfolio, reducing reliance on a single asset. Innovation Exposure: Many altcoins represent groundbreaking technologies and use cases, offering investors a chance to support and profit from future innovations. Potential Challenges: Increased Volatility: While offering higher returns, altcoins are also prone to more significant price swings, leading to higher risk. Research Intensive: Identifying promising altcoins requires extensive research into their utility, team, tokenomics, and community support. Liquidity Issues: Some smaller altcoins might have lower liquidity, making it harder to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. The current movement of the Altcoin Season Index highlights the need for a balanced approach. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts As the Altcoin Season Index climbs, here are some actionable insights for navigating the evolving crypto landscape: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on hype. Thoroughly research any altcoin before committing capital. Understand its whitepaper, development team, and community. Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your funds into one altcoin, consider spreading your investments across several promising projects. This strategy helps mitigate risk. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear entry and exit strategies, and consider using stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, technical analysis, and, of course, the Altcoin Season Index itself. Market conditions can change rapidly. Even with a positive trend in the index, a disciplined approach remains paramount for long-term success in the crypto space. The recent rise in the Altcoin Season Index to 72 is undoubtedly a thrilling development for the cryptocurrency market. It suggests a potential shift towards altcoin outperformance, offering exciting prospects for investors willing to explore beyond Bitcoin. While the 75% threshold for an official altcoin season is within reach, it’s crucial to approach this period with both enthusiasm and caution. Diligent research, strategic diversification, and robust risk management are your best allies in harnessing the potential of a burgeoning altcoin market. The journey ahead promises to be dynamic, and the Altcoin Season Index will continue to be a key guide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric created by CoinMarketCap that measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. How is an Altcoin Season officially declared? An Altcoin Season is declared if 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) outperform Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. What does a high Altcoin Season Index reading, like 72, imply? A high reading, such as 72, indicates that a significant majority of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. While not yet an official Altcoin Season (which requires 75), it suggests strong momentum and growing interest in altcoins. What’s the difference between an Altcoin Season and a Bitcoin Season? An Altcoin Season occurs when altcoins largely outperform Bitcoin. Conversely, a Bitcoin Season happens when Bitcoin’s performance surpasses that of most altcoins within the top 100. Should I invest in altcoins if the Altcoin Season Index is high? A high Altcoin Season Index can signal favorable conditions for altcoins, but it’s essential to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and manage risks effectively. Market conditions can change rapidly, so informed decisions are crucial. Did you find this article insightful?

52219401,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84318,1758762018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Repeats Technical Cycle, Analyst Sets Bullish Price Target",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-repeats-technical-cycle-analyst-sets-bullish-price-target/,"XRP has recently declined below the $3 threshold, now trading near $2.8 in line with the broader weakness across the cryptocurrency market. Despite this pullback, several analysts remain optimistic about its long-term trajectory. Among them, EGRAG Crypto has highlighted recurring historical price structures that could guide XRP’s next major movement. Based on past cycles, he projects two potential targets: $9.6 or $33, depending on how current conditions unfold. Historical Performance and Key Levels EGRAG’s assessment is based on the two-week chart, which tracks XRP’s performance from 2014 to date. His analysis focuses on the 21-period exponential moving average (EMA), which has repeatedly acted as a pivotal support level. #XRP – 2 Scenarios Based on Historical Price Action ($9.6 – $33): If you're not yet familiar with the most likely outcomes, it might be time to catch up! Here’s a closer look at two pivotal cycles in #XRP 's history. 21 EMA Historical Support Levels 2017 Cycle: #XRP … pic.twitter.com/oE1MAMhsXA — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 23, 2025 In the 2017 cycle, XRP tested the 21 EMA twice before launching into a rapid upward trend. That sequence culminated in a gain of approximately 1,610%, bringing the token to around $3.31 by January 2018. By contrast, the 2021 cycle unfolded differently due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple . In December 2020, XRP briefly lost support at the 21 EMA, but once the price reclaimed and retested the level, it advanced by about 414%, reaching close to $1.96 in April 2021. Current Setup and Possible Long-Term Scenarios EGRAG points out that June 2025 marked another retest of the 21 EMA, when XRP fell to roughly $1.9. He argues that this event could be the start of a major upward move similar to those seen in previous cycles. From this point, two outcomes appear likely. If conditions mirror the 2017 pattern, XRP could record another 1,610% increase, driving prices toward $33 . Alternatively, if market behavior resembles the 2021 cycle, the token could rise by about 414%, leading to a price near $9.6. In either case, the assumption is that the rally would begin from the $1.9 level observed during the June retest. At present, XRP is trading around $2.95, still facing resistance at $3.31, which coincides with its 2017 peak. Volume data during these retests suggests that investor participation is strong, reinforcing the importance of these price zones for determining the next trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short-Term Market Outlook While EGRAG emphasizes long-term potential, other analysts are monitoring near-term behavior. Market commentator DustyBC has described XRP’s four-hour chart as stagnant, suggesting that sideways trading may continue until the asset breaks above a defined buying zone. He recommends patience, noting that this strategy helps avoid premature entries. Conversely, Casi Trades holds a more bullish short-term view. She recently identified a double-bottom formation near $2.70 following a sharp drop that she attributes to excessive leverage rather than sustained selling. Since that decline, XRP has reclaimed the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement at $2.79, which is now serving as support. Casi anticipates a potential retest of $2.79, combined with a bullish divergence on the relative strength index. If confirmed, this could trigger a Wave 3 rally with projected targets at $4.00 and $4.40, aligning with the 2.618 and 3.618 Fibonacci extension levels. However, she cautions that a breakdown below $2.70 would undermine this setup and could redirect the price toward $2.58, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. XRP’s price action remains closely tied to historical patterns and key support levels. While long-term projections suggest potential targets of $9.6 or $33, short-term movement will depend on whether the token maintains critical support zones and overcomes near-term resistance.

However, it remains above the 200-day moving average at $0.735, signaling that while sellers dominate in the short and medium term, the longer trend is still supported. ADA's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Daily charts show oversold signals with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 36.6, a negative Commodity Channel Index (CCI), and near-zero Stochastic RSI levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Soak Up Trillions From China And Russia, Billionaire Predicts Despite this, downside pressure persists, with ADA likely consolidating between $0.768 and $0.790 in the coming sessions. Momentum indicators remain neutral, suggesting that any rebound could be limited unless buying volume strengthens. Cardano ETF Optimism and Roadmap Fuel Longer-Term Outlook While ADA struggles in the near term, longer-term fundamentals look stronger. Odds for a Cardano-based ETF approval have surged to 9%, a development that could lift market sentiment and drive institutional adoption. The Cardano Foundation’s new roadmap also supports a bullish case, with significant funding allocated to decentralized finance (DeFi), governance, and ecosystem growth. Whale transactions have increased, and major firms like Reliance Global have added ADA to their treasuries, signaling growing institutional confidence. These developments could help ADA break above critical resistance at $0.868, the Ichimoku Kijun level, which analysts view as the threshold for confirming a rebound. Until then, traders may see sideways consolidation or slight downside risk. Short-Term Consolidation, Long-Term Potential According to market expert Anton Kharitonov of Traders Union, ADA remains technically vulnerable. “As long as Cardano trades below major resistance, the upside case lacks credibility,” he noted, adding that reclaiming $0.868 is essential for any sustainable rebound. For now, ADA’s immediate price corridor remains narrow, with a low probability of a breakout in the next five days. However, the long-term picture is brighter, with forecasts suggesting a potential climb toward $1.20–$1.38 within the next 6–12 months, supported by ETF optimism and institutional demand.

Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a prominent crypto analyst, drew attention to this, stating that $2.8 is now the most important support level for the digital asset. He attached a chart from Glassnode highlighting how XRP holders are distributed across various realized price ranges, with a particular concentration at the $2.80 level. $2.80 is the most important support level for $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/6sCz11GR91 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 23, 2025 Understanding the Chart Data The chart shared by Martinez displays XRP’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), partitioned at its all-time high . It illustrates how large portions of XRP holdings are associated with different historical price levels. The data reveals that more than 2.1 billion XRP, representing approximately 3.32% of the supply, is tied to $2.8. This makes that level a key zone of support where significant buying interest has been established. Considering the overall structure, the chart shows multiple points where XRP has notable concentrations of realized prices. These include areas around $0.33, $0.6, $1.64, $1.93, and other levels closer to $3. However, the $2.8 level stands out as one of the largest concentrations near the higher range, which indicates that many investors entered at this point. What the Analysis Suggests for XRP XRP is trading at $2.85 after bouncing off the $2.80 support. Holding above this level would signal strong support from existing holders and create a foundation for further advances . On the other hand, failure to defend this level could expose XRP to renewed selling pressure and potentially trigger a test of lower realized price zones. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The focus on realized price distribution offers a unique perspective because it measures actual positions taken by market participants rather than just speculative chart patterns. This allows for a clearer understanding of where major groups of investors may act, whether through buying to defend their entry levels or selling to limit losses. Possible Next Steps for XRP Should XRP sustain momentum above $2.8, attention may shift to the next significant resistance areas identified on the chart. These levels cluster around $2.95 and above $3, where another wave of historical entries exists. A move toward these prices would likely test the conviction of holders who entered near XRP’s prior peaks. Analysts have also drawn attention to XRP’s peak of $3.65, predicting double-digit targets if the asset can surpass this level . How the market reacts at these levels will provide further clarity on whether XRP can establish a stronger base for growth.

52219421,588172,1758762051,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52219421.jpeg,Stablecoins Recognized As Future Collateral: CFTC Opens Public Consultation,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoins-recognized-future-collateral-cftc/,"The US CFTC has launched an initiative to explore the use of stablecoins as collateral in derivatives markets, with public input open until Oct. 20th. CFTC Launches Initiative For Tokenized Collateral & Stablecoins In Derivatives As revealed in a press release , Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham has enacted an initiative for the use of tokenized collateral in derivatives markets. Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency, are set to play a role in the effort. “The public has spoken: tokenized markets are here, and they are the future,” said Pham. “For years I have said that collateral management is the ‘killer app’ for stablecoins in markets.” The initiative is part of CFTC’s “ Crypto Sprint ” announced at the start of August. Pham introduced it to implement recommendations from the President’s Working Group report on digital assets. The push mirrors the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) “ Project Crypto .” The President’s Working Group report asked the CFTC to “provide guidance on the adoption of tokenized non-cash collateral as regulatory margin.” The latest move comes in response to this recommendation and also builds on the regulator’s Crypto CEO Forum held back in February 2025. The Acting Chairman noted: At our historic Crypto CEO Forum, we discussed how innovation and blockchain technology will drive progress in derivatives markets, especially for modernization of collateral management and greater capital efficiency. The regulator has invited interested stakeholders to provide written feedback and suggestions on its website regarding the use of stablecoins as collateral in derivatives markets by October 20th. “The CFTC continues to move full speed ahead at the cutting edge of responsible innovation, and I appreciate the support of our industry partners,” added Pham. Stablecoins have been enjoying capital inflows recently, with their combined market cap sitting at the $294 billion mark today, a new all-time high (ATH). Below is a chart from DeFiLlama that shows how the market cap of these cryptocurrencies has changed during the last few years. From the graph, it’s visible that stablecoins have been in a phase of growth since 2024, with inflows only accelerating recently. During the past week alone, the market cap of these fiat-tied tokens has increased by over $4 billion.

The task force will foster growth in the crypto and blockchain sector by developing friendly policies. Its leaders unveiled the task force on September 24 in the National Assembly. They promised much quicker action, even suggesting that the country might pass its first pro-crypto regulations by the end of 2025. Han Jeong-ae, the policy committee chair, said South Korea needed a system to keep pace with global financial transformations. She added that they expected stable and sustainable innovation, noting that the first major focus would be stablecoin regulation. The token issuance and dissemination laws might be enacted even before the end of the year. One of the main arguments favoring this amendment is that it is required to spur investor interest and establish new business models. Representative Lee Jeong-moon will guide the task force’s work. He will work with Min Byoung-dug, the party’s Digital Asset Committee Chair, who has always insisted that stablecoins drive the next phase of financial innovation. The Democratic Party has offered a significant contrast to the previous laws, which focused on the exchanges’ activity and ensured that no user funds would be lost to hacking. This time, the party says it would instead like to see the industry grow while keeping a clear foundation for investor activity. Task force engages regulators and industry The lawmakers have reportedly cooperated with the most significant institutions, asking the ministries, the Financial Services Commission, and the Financial Supervisory Service to submit their proposals on what the new law should specifically contain. A representative of the Bank of Korea has also been invited to share his outlook on the matter. The task force seeks to involve the private sector, not just regulators. Organizers are also expected to seek guidance from crypto exchanges, fintech startups, and venture capital firms. There will also be a panel of advisors comprised of industry experts. Lee Jeong-moon said they were seeking to consider the digital asset market as a new way for people to carry out transactions. He added that the focus was on policies that would generate future growth. The DP has also expressed support for a ruling by the government to end the proscription of venture capital investments to crypto companies. Legislators say new funding could come soon to startups hamstrung by tight banking restrictions. Lee Jeong-moon said they were seeking to consider the digital asset market as a new way for people to carry out transactions. He added that the focus was on policies that would generate future growth. Lawmakers balance innovation with caution South Korea’s push for pro-crypto laws comes as debate over stablecoins heats up, with lawmakers eyeing won-based tokens to rival dollar-backed assets. In July, a similar bill allowing non-financial firms to issue won-denominated stablecoins was introduced in parliament. It was a huge step in opening Korea’s financial world. But the Bank of Korea has been cautious. This month, Deputy Governor Kim Woong-seok said regulated banks should be allowed to issue stablecoins gradually. He maintained that a more measured rollout would safeguard financial stability. The central bank has subsequently established a crypto oversight unit to help coordinate regulation. Analysts say the DP’s push for swift innovation could collide with the central bank’s conservative approach. The months ahead may determine whether South Korea can reconcile growth and safety. South Korea is one of the world’s most active crypto markets. Already among Asia’s top performers, South Korea boasts millions of retail investors who trade daily. The government has frequently been repressive, but new measures indicate a move from simply policing and supporting the industry. If the DP manages to push through new legislation by year-end, South Korea could be among the earliest major economies to enact a full-fledged stablecoin regime. Not only would this protect domestic firms, but it could also work to reinforce the country in the global digital economy. Get seen where it counts.

This substantial transaction, executed approximately six hours ago, according to astute on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, suggests a strategic maneuver by the prominent crypto investment firm. Such large-scale withdrawals from exchanges are often interpreted as a strong signal of accumulation, indicating a potential long-term bullish outlook or a specific strategic intent. What Does This Galaxy Digital ASTER Withdrawal Signify? The recent Galaxy Digital ASTER withdrawal isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a noteworthy event in the digital asset space. When an entity like Galaxy Digital moves a substantial amount of tokens off an exchange, it typically means they intend to hold these assets rather than trade them in the short term. This action reduces the immediate supply available on exchanges, which can influence market dynamics. Accumulation: The address associated with Galaxy Digital now holds a staggering 114 million ASTER tokens. This substantial holding points towards a deliberate strategy to build a significant position in ASTER. Long-Term Vision: Institutional players often withdraw assets for long-term holding, staking, or to utilize them within their own ecosystem for various financial products. Reduced Selling Pressure: Assets held off-exchange are less likely to be immediately sold, potentially easing short-term selling pressure on the token. This pattern is a common indicator that a major player sees considerable value or future potential in the asset. It’s a powerful signal that warrants closer examination by market observers. Understanding ASTER Token and Galaxy Digital’s Interest While the focus is on the withdrawal, it’s crucial to understand what ASTER token represents. ASTER, or Astar Network, is a dApp hub on Polkadot that supports EVM and WebAssembly. It aims to be a multi-chain smart contract platform, enabling developers to build various applications. Galaxy Digital’s consistent interest, as evidenced by this latest Galaxy Digital ASTER withdrawal , suggests they see significant promise in Astar’s technology and ecosystem. What might be driving this continued interest from a major institutional investor like Galaxy Digital? Ecosystem Growth: Astar Network’s development and increasing adoption within the Polkadot ecosystem could be a key factor. Technological Innovation: Its support for multiple virtual machines and focus on interoperability might appeal to institutional investors looking for scalable and versatile platforms. Strategic Partnerships: Galaxy Digital may have insights into upcoming developments or partnerships within the Astar ecosystem that are not yet public. These large-scale movements by institutional giants often precede periods of increased attention and potential growth for the underlying asset. Is This a Strategic Move by Galaxy Digital? Absolutely, it is highly probable that this Galaxy Digital ASTER withdrawal is part of a carefully considered strategy. Institutional investors like Galaxy Digital don’t make multi-million dollar moves without extensive research and a clear objective. Their actions can often serve as a bellwether for broader market sentiment and future trends. They might be: Preparing for Staking: Locking up ASTER tokens to earn staking rewards and participate in network governance. Integrating ASTER into Products: Potentially using ASTER in new investment products, funds, or services offered to their clients. Long-Term Bet: Viewing ASTER as a fundamental building block for the future of decentralized applications and Web3 infrastructure. The scale of their holdings, now at 114 million ASTER, underscores the depth of their conviction in the asset’s long-term value proposition. This is not a speculative day trade; it’s an investment in the future. What’s Next for ASTER and Crypto Enthusiasts? For individuals interested in the crypto market, Galaxy Digital’s actions provide valuable insights. While not financial advice, observing such institutional accumulation can be a catalyst for further personal research.

Recently, a significant development in the stablecoin space caught attention, involving Chinese fintech firm AnchorX and its much-anticipated yuan stablecoin , AxCNH. This clarification is not just a minor detail; it’s a crucial piece of information shaping how we understand the future of digital currencies and their global adoption. Clarifying the Yuan Stablecoin ‘s True Home: Kazakhstan, Not Hong Kong There was a ripple of confusion across the crypto landscape regarding the operational base of AnchorX’s AxCNH. Initially, various media outlets reported that this new yuan stablecoin was being issued out of Hong Kong. However, AnchorX has stepped forward to set the record straight and provide essential clarity. The company officially clarified that AxCNH, which is pegged to the Chinese yuan, operates under a license granted by Kazakhstan’s Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA). This statement directly addresses and corrects earlier misinformation, which had also led the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to deny any involvement. Initial Reports: Claimed Hong Kong issuance, leading to market uncertainty. AnchorX’s Clarification: Officially licensed by AFSA in Kazakhstan, ensuring transparent operations. HKMA’s Stance: Denied any connection to AxCNH’s issuance, reinforcing the need for accurate reporting. AnchorX secured the necessary approval to issue this innovative yuan stablecoin from Kazakhstan back in February. This move highlights a strategic choice in jurisdiction, underscoring the importance of a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in an increasingly complex global financial environment. Why Does the Yuan Stablecoin ‘s Jurisdiction Matter So Much? You might wonder, why is the exact licensing location for a yuan stablecoin such a big deal? The answer lies in trust, regulation, and the stability of the digital asset itself. The jurisdiction dictates the legal and operational environment in which the stablecoin functions, directly impacting its reliability and acceptance. Robust regulatory oversight provides several key benefits: Investor Protection: Clear rules and frameworks safeguard users from potential risks and fraudulent activities. Operational Transparency: Licensed entities often face stricter reporting requirements, ensuring accountability. Market Integrity: A well-regulated environment fosters confidence among users and institutions, promoting long-term stability. For a stablecoin like AxCNH, which aims to maintain a stable value against a major fiat currency like the yuan, robust regulatory backing is absolutely essential. It assures users that the asset is properly collateralized and that its operations are subject to scrutiny by a recognized financial authority, thereby building crucial trust. Kazakhstan’s AFSA: A Hub for Yuan Stablecoin Innovation? Kazakhstan, through its Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA), has been actively positioning itself as a forward-thinking jurisdiction for fintech and digital assets. AFSA operates within the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), which boasts an independent legal system based on English common law, providing a familiar and reliable framework for international businesses. This environment offers a distinct advantage for companies looking to innovate in the crypto space with regulatory certainty. AnchorX’s decision to seek approval for its yuan stablecoin here is a testament to AFSA’s progressive approach to digital asset licensing, signaling its commitment to fostering innovation within a regulated ecosystem. The February approval for AxCNH signifies AFSA’s commitment to fostering a regulated yet innovative ecosystem for digital currencies. This move could potentially attract other fintech firms seeking clear guidelines for launching similar financial products, establishing Kazakhstan as a key player in the global digital finance landscape. The Broader Implications of a Licensed Yuan Stablecoin The emergence of a properly licensed yuan stablecoin like AxCNH carries significant implications beyond just AnchorX. Stablecoins are crucial bridges between traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies, offering much-needed price stability in a volatile market. A yuan-pegged stablecoin can facilitate easier cross-border transactions involving the Chinese currency, potentially reducing friction and costs for businesses and individuals alike. It also opens new avenues for liquidity and financial innovation within the digital asset ecosystem, enhancing global connectivity. Potential impacts of AxCNH and similar stablecoins include: Enhanced efficiency for international trade and remittances, making global payments faster and cheaper. Increased adoption of digital currencies for everyday transactions, bridging the gap between crypto and mainstream commerce. Greater integration of the Chinese yuan into the global digital economy, reflecting its growing international importance. As the digital finance landscape matures, the demand for stable, regulated digital assets will only grow. AnchorX’s strategic licensing in Kazakhstan sets a precedent for how other global currencies might find their digital counterparts within clear, regulated frameworks, paving the way for a more integrated financial future. AnchorX’s clear statement regarding the licensing of its AxCNH yuan stablecoin in Kazakhstan is a pivotal moment for regulatory clarity in the crypto world. It underscores the critical importance of accurate information and proper jurisdictional backing for stablecoins. This development not only provides a stable digital asset pegged to the yuan but also highlights Kazakhstan’s growing role as a significant player in the regulated digital finance sector. As the industry continues to evolve, such transparent and compliant initiatives will be key to fostering trust and widespread adoption, ensuring a more secure and predictable digital financial ecosystem for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is AxCNH? AxCNH is a yuan stablecoin launched by the Chinese fintech firm AnchorX, meaning its value is pegged to the Chinese yuan (CNH). Q2: Where is AnchorX’s yuan stablecoin officially licensed? AnchorX’s yuan stablecoin , AxCNH, is officially licensed and issued under the regulatory oversight of Kazakhstan’s Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA). Q3: Why was there confusion about AxCNH’s licensing? Initial media reports incorrectly stated that the yuan stablecoin was issued in Hong Kong, a claim later denied by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and clarified by AnchorX. Q4: What is the significance of AFSA’s licensing for AxCNH? AFSA’s licensing provides regulatory clarity, investor protection, and operational transparency for AxCNH, establishing a trusted framework for the yuan stablecoin ‘s operations within a recognized financial center. Q5: How does a yuan-pegged stablecoin benefit the crypto market? A yuan stablecoin can facilitate more efficient cross-border transactions involving the Chinese currency, enhance liquidity in the digital asset ecosystem, and further integrate the yuan into the global digital economy.

Following a challenging security incident, UXLINK has delivered some urgent news: a dedicated UXLINK token swap portal is set to open its doors for on-chain users within the next five business days. This is a crucial step towards restoring stability and confidence for all involved. What Exactly Happened with UXLINK, and Why the Swap? Recently, UXLINK faced a significant hacking incident that impacted its token ecosystem. Such events can be unsettling for any project and its community, raising immediate concerns about asset security. In response, UXLINK moved swiftly. The team announced on X that they have successfully deployed a new UXLINK smart contract. Furthermore, they submitted a detailed incident report and a comprehensive migration plan to key regulatory bodies, including South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) and other major exchanges. The core reason for this rapid action and the upcoming UXLINK token swap is to isolate the compromised tokens and transition users to a secure, new contract. This ensures that the integrity of the UXLINK ecosystem is maintained. How Will the UXLINK Token Swap Portal Work for You? Understanding the process of the UXLINK token swap is key for all legitimate token holders. UXLINK has outlined a clear and straightforward plan to facilitate this transition: One-to-One Exchange: All existing, legitimate circulating UXLINK tokens will be swapped for new tokens on a direct one-to-one basis. This means your holdings will maintain their value relative to the new tokens. Exclusion of Illicit Tokens: A critical aspect of this recovery is that tokens illicitly issued by the hacker will be specifically excluded from the swap process. This prevents the attacker from profiting from their actions and protects the legitimate supply. Official Portal: The swap will occur through a dedicated portal. It is absolutely vital that users only engage with this official platform to perform their token swap. Always verify the source to avoid phishing attempts. This systematic approach aims to ensure a fair and secure migration for the entire community, paving the way for a more robust UXLINK going forward. Beyond the Swap: Addressing Stolen Assets and Future Compensation While the UXLINK token swap addresses the immediate need for a secure token, the incident also involved stolen assets. UXLINK has been proactive in tackling this challenge: Frozen Assets: The project confirmed that most of the stolen tokens have been successfully frozen. This is a significant achievement in limiting the hacker’s ability to liquidate or further distribute the illicitly obtained assets. Ongoing Monitoring: Despite freezing efforts, UXLINK acknowledged that some stolen tokens are still being traded. This highlights the persistent challenges in tracking and recovering digital assets post-hack. Compensation Plan: For victims who have suffered losses due to the hack, UXLINK has committed to arranging a separate compensation plan. Details on this plan will be provided in due course, demonstrating the project’s dedication to its community members affected by the incident. These measures collectively form UXLINK’s strategy for comprehensive recovery and support for its user base. Securing Your Assets: Your Role in the UXLINK Token Swap As UXLINK prepares for this crucial recovery phase, user vigilance is paramount. To ensure a smooth and secure UXLINK token swap , consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow UXLINK’s official channels (like their X account) for the exact date and link to the token swap portal. Do not rely on unofficial sources. Verify Links: Before clicking any links related to the swap, double-check that they are from UXLINK’s verified official sources. Scammers often create fake portals. Be Patient: The swap process will be clearly communicated. There is no need to rush or panic. Take your time to understand the instructions before proceeding. Never Share Private Keys: Legitimate platforms will never ask for your private keys or seed phrases. Be extremely cautious of any request for this information. By taking these precautions, you can help protect your assets during this critical period. The opening of the UXLINK token swap portal marks a pivotal moment for the project and its community. It signifies a robust response to a challenging incident, demonstrating UXLINK’s commitment to security and user trust. While the path to full recovery can be complex, this proactive step provides a clear direction forward. Users are encouraged to stay informed through official channels and participate in the swap to secure their assets and support UXLINK’s journey towards a stronger, more resilient future.

The trial, done with IBM’s Heron quantum processor, ran real, anonymized European bond trading data through the system, not fake models or simulations, and resulted in a major accuracy jump. That’s the first time any bank has used quantum to process real trading data at full scale. The test didn’t involve live trades, but it wasn’t theoretical. HSBC confirmed it was a production-scale demonstration. That means this wasn’t just another one of those tech tests that sit in a sandbox forever. This was finance in the wild, just without actual money moving. The bank believes this step sets the tone for how quantum will start creeping into daily financial systems worldwide. Banks build teams to extract real-world results The quantum test focused on over-the-counter bond markets, where trades happen privately between two firms, no exchange involved. These are harder to predict due to low transparency and fragmented data. That’s exactly why HSBC picked this use case. IBM’s Heron processor, the latest in its quantum lineup, handled the task by running calculations in parallel, unlike classical chips that go line by line. Philip Intallura, HSBC’s head of quantum tech, said , “Is this a ‘Sputnik moment’ for quantum? My instinct is yes.” He pointed to how this milestone could trigger a wave of fast-moving adoption. “It will create a flurry of activity,” Philip added, hinting that rivals will rush to close the gap. Josh Freeland, HSBC’s global head of algo credit trading, gave a glimpse into what was happening behind the scenes. He said the trial involved 16 experts (physicists, machine learning engineers, AI specialists) who were “working around the clock” to replicate what the chip had done. “If you could get something like this result every day, that would be quite something,” Josh said. He explained that in trading, even a single-digit gain, when repeated thousands of times, can move the needle in a big way. This tech push isn’t limited to HSBC. Other big names like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup are also pouring resources into quantum. In March, JPMorgan said it created and validated truly random numbers with a quantum computer built by Quantinuum. The bank claims this tech will help improve encryption, security, and maybe even trading systems. That work was later published in Nature, a top science journal. Meanwhile, Google’s Willow quantum chip, separate from the HSBC effort, solved a specific mathematical task in five minutes that classical supercomputers couldn’t solve in the entire age of the universe. That kind of speed is what has the financial sector throwing billions into quantum development, even if widespread rollout still seems distant. McKinsey expects banks to chase quantum profits Quantum revenue is expected to skyrocket to $72 billion in the next ten years, up from just $4 billion last year, according to consulting firm McKinsey. The report, published in June, lists finance alongside industries like life sciences and chemicals as key drivers. Henning Soller, who leads McKinsey’s quantum research in Frankfurt, said the tech’s value is clearest when it’s applied to pricing predictions. In finance, every percentage counts. “If one bank is able to start using quantum computing to develop a program, then the others will be developing it the next day and people will not sleep until they have it,” said Miklos Dietz, McKinsey’s senior partner in Vancouver. He didn’t hold back on what’s coming next. “When it comes, it will be explosive.” HSBC isn’t pretending the tech is perfect yet. But it believes it’s on the edge of something real. Philip said the work is proof that banks don’t have to wait five or ten years to see results. “We have great confidence we are on the cusp of a new frontier of computing in financial services, rather than something that is far away in the future.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

According to Bloomberg calculations, central and local authorities have only 16% — some 2.2 trillion yuan ($309 billion) — of their annual quota remaining, paving the way for the slackest fourth-quarter net supply since 2022. Bond supply shrinks as Beijing front-loads issuance The decline in issuance may help bring some balance and confidence to the bond markets, whose investors have become skittish with a proposal on the table to tax investment income and raise redemption fees for short-term funds. Yields betray the warning: The 10-year benchmark rate has risen 23 basis points this quarter, to roughly 1.88% as of Tuesday. “The significant supply shrinkage ahead will benefit market sentiment and help curb the ascent in bond yields,” said Zhou Guannan, analyst at Huachuang Securities, who expects the 10-year yield to fall to 1.7% by year-end. Beijing front-loaded much of its 2025 bond issuance to cushion a faltering economy, persistent property troubles, and escalating trade frictions following US tariff hikes. Bloomberg data show that bond sales in the first half of the year outpaced levels seen in the same period over the past three years. Easing pressure offers relief to skittish investors Officials say they favor a strategy of acting early, Finance Minister Lan Fo’an said this month, and wanted to seize the critical window,” and issue their policies decisively in one single action. Bloomberg compiled data that show that local governments have already issued almost all of their 2 trillion yuan quotas for special refinancing bonds to replace off-balance-sheet debt. Several pending deals are about to be completed, as the central government is scheduled to release its final tranche of 1.3 trillion yuan in ultra-long special sovereign bonds on Oct. 10, according to its published schedule. As the “predictable supply from the special bonds concludes, the market is better able to absorb the remaining, more regular issuance,” said Wei Li, head of multi-asset investments at BNP Paribas Securities (China). With supply expected to ease, Beijing may be able to expand debt programs and increase the bond quota — as it had done in recent years — if growth lags its target of about 5%. However, economists are expecting only modest steps, as China has already pushed up its annual budget deficit to a decade high in response to lingering economic problems. China’s fiscal strategy stands apart from global peers Some investors are adjusting allocations. U-Shine Private Equity FD Mgt Co., which holds one of the biggest caches of 30-year sovereign notes, is gradually adding to its position as yields will slide on better supply dynamics and a potential rate cut, said Xu Yongbin, co-chief investment officer. Market expectations for reduced bond supply stand in contrast to those of developed economies. In the US, Japan, and Europe, longer-dated bond yields have soared as investor concerns mount over fiscal sustainability and widening budget deficits. According to BNP’s Li, China’s fiscal and supply outlook looks stronger than that of many developed markets, with the government taking a cautious approach that prioritizes optimizing existing funds instead of further expanding debt.

Recently, the GAIN token community experienced a **devastating token exploit** that saw an attacker make off with a significant sum, leaving investors reeling. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the ever-present security challenges within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. What Exactly Happened in This GAIN Token Exploit? Approximately two hours before the news broke, an attacker successfully executed an unauthorized mint of five billion GAIN tokens. This wasn’t just a small transaction; it was a massive injection of new tokens into the market without proper authorization. Following this illicit mint, the attacker promptly sold these newly created tokens, triggering a dramatic chain of events. Massive Price Plunge: The sudden influx and sale of five billion GAIN tokens caused the token’s price to plummet by an alarming 95%. This rapid depreciation wiped out significant value for legitimate holders. Significant Profit: On-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa confirmed that the attacker secured a staggering $3.01 million in profit from this dump. Funds Transfer: To obscure their tracks and move the illicit gains, the attacker is reportedly transferring these funds to other major networks, including Solana and Ethereum, utilizing deBridge for cross-chain transactions. It’s worth noting that Binance Alpha had only recently added GAIN to its listings on September 24, making the timing of this **token exploit** particularly unfortunate for new investors. Understanding the Mechanics: How Does an Unauthorized Token Exploit Occur? An unauthorized mint is a critical vulnerability, often stemming from flaws in a smart contract’s code. In essence, the attacker found a way to bypass the intended minting controls, allowing them to create new tokens out of thin air. This is akin to a counterfeiter printing money without the central bank’s approval, severely devaluing the legitimate currency. The core issue typically lies in: Access Control Weaknesses: The smart contract might have insufficient checks to prevent unauthorized accounts from calling the minting function. Re-entrancy or Logic Bugs: Complex interactions within the contract could be exploited to trick it into minting more tokens than allowed. Owner Key Compromise: Though less common for minting exploits, a compromised private key of the contract owner could also grant minting privileges. Such a **token exploit** highlights the absolute necessity of rigorous smart contract audits and continuous security monitoring for any DeFi project. Safeguarding Your Assets: Lessons from the GAIN Token Exploit While project developers bear the primary responsibility for securing their protocols, individual investors also have a role to play in protecting their assets. The GAIN incident offers valuable lessons: Perform Thorough Due Diligence: Before investing in any new token, especially in the volatile DeFi space, research the project’s team, its smart contract audit reports, and its community. Look for transparency and a track record of security. Understand the Risks: DeFi is an innovative but high-risk environment. Be aware that even audited projects can have undiscovered vulnerabilities. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Monitor On-Chain Activity: Tools and analysts like ai_9684xtpa provide crucial insights. Following reputable on-chain monitors can offer early warnings of suspicious activities. The Broader Impact of a Token Exploit on DeFi Trust Every **token exploit** like the one affecting GAIN chips away at investor confidence in the broader DeFi ecosystem. These incidents can deter new users and capital, slowing down innovation and adoption. Projects must prioritize security, implementing multi-layered defenses and robust incident response plans. Moreover, the ease with which funds can be transferred across networks via bridges like deBridge, while a benefit for liquidity, also presents a challenge for tracking and recovering stolen assets. Collaboration between exchanges, blockchain analytics firms, and law enforcement becomes paramount in such scenarios. The GAIN token incident is a somber reminder that the promise of decentralization comes with significant security responsibilities. As the crypto space matures, the industry must collectively work towards creating more resilient and secure protocols to prevent future **token exploit** events and protect investor interests.

What exactly happened to the GAIN token? An attacker performed an unauthorized mint of 5 billion GAIN tokens, then immediately sold them. This caused the token’s price to crash by 95%. 2. How much profit did the attacker make from this token exploit? The attacker secured approximately $3.01 million in profit from selling the illicitly minted GAIN tokens. 3. What does “unauthorized mint” mean in the context of a token exploit? An unauthorized mint occurs when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in a smart contract to create new tokens without proper permission or beyond the intended supply limits, effectively printing money out of thin air. 4. How can I protect my crypto assets from similar token exploits? Always conduct thorough due diligence on projects, check for reputable smart contract audits, understand the inherent risks of DeFi, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay informed by following on-chain analytics and security alerts. 5. Are the stolen GAIN funds recoverable? While blockchain transactions are public, recovering stolen funds is often challenging due to the attacker’s use of cross-chain bridges (like deBridge to Solana and Ethereum) and various obfuscation techniques. Recovery efforts typically require collaboration between affected projects, exchanges, and law enforcement. Did you find this article informative?

The committee confirmed the date in a notice first reported by Eleanor Terrett, and witnesses lined up include Jason Somensatto, Policy Director at Coin Center; Andrea S. Kramer, founding member of ASKramer Law; Lawrence Zlatkin, Vice President of Taxation at Coinbase; and Annette Nellen, Chair of the Digital Asset Taxation Working Group under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. This hearing is meant to address a problem that’s pissed off crypto users for years, which is why every small crypto transaction, even a few dollars, triggers a tax headache. The Senate is being pushed to finally look at de minimis exemptions, which would let people use crypto for daily stuff (like grabbing a coffee) without reporting every damn thing to the IRS. Trump administration backs small crypto tax relief Cryptopolitan reported back in July that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt had said that the Trump administration still wants to push through the de minimis exemption in upcoming laws. “The president did signal his support for de minimis exemption for crypto and the administration continues to be in support of that,” Karoline said. She explained that right now, using crypto for basic purchases is too complicated because of tax rules, but a change could make everyday payments smoother. “We are definitely receptive to it to make crypto payments easier and more efficient for those who seek to use crypto as simple as buying a cup of coffee — of course, right now, that cannot happen, but with the de minimis exemption perhaps it could in the future.” Karoline also revealed that President Trump plans to host a signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-focused bill expected to pass soon. That bill is part of his administration’s broader goal to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the world.” The Senate has already tried and failed to deal with this issue before. In 2020, two Democratic lawmakers proposed the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act, which aimed to ignore tax on crypto gains below $200. It didn’t even make it to a vote. A similar version in 2022 also died on the floor. Then came a broader bill in 2025 called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which covered everything from taxes to border control. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming, tried to get a crypto exemption added in for gains under $300, but that proposal got scrapped before the final bill passed. President Trump signed it into law on July 4 without the crypto language attached. Right now, the IRS says every single crypto transaction must be reported, even if there’s no gain or the amount is tiny. If you spend $5 of bitcoin, that’s a taxable event. The idea behind the de minimis exemption is to cut through that nonsense and give users room to breathe. But it hasn’t been easy. Lawmakers face real obstacles. First, the federal government depends on tax income. If it suddenly lets millions of small crypto transactions go untaxed, that means less money coming in. And there’s no sign yet of how they’ll offset that shortfall. Even with strong voices like Cynthia and Jason in the room, the Senate still hasn’t landed on a solution. October 1 might give them a chance to do something useful. Or it might be another meeting where everyone talks and nothing happens. Get seen where it counts.

The agreement , known as the Canada-Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), was signed in Ottawa on Wednesday by Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. It is Canada’s first bilateral trade agreement with an ASEAN country, so it is a historic milestone for both countries. The agreement comes as both countries try diversifying trade in light of global uncertainty. Skyrocketing US tariffs and friction with China have made new economic alliances more urgent than ever. Under the agreement, more than 95% of Canada’s exports to Indonesia will be duty-free when the deal is fully implemented. It will provide Canadian businesses, from farmers to clean energy developers, with new access to one of the fastest-growing markets in Asia. The agricultural sector will be the first beneficiary, according to Canada’s Trade Minister Maninder Sidhu. Canadian wheat, soybeans, and potash are already going to Indonesia, but the agreement will clear more room for processed foods, high-tech agri-products, and value-added goods. Sidhu told reporters that the opportunities created by the deal cut across sectors, ranging from agriculture to energy. He explained that Indonesia’s population of 280 million makes it a massive market that Canadian companies are eager to serve. And the deal opens the door to investment in nuclear power. Canada’s technology in small modular reactors could even be used to help Indonesia expand its power and, at the same time, keep a lid on emissions. Indonesia secures access and investment growth Beyond goods, the CEPA establishes rules for digital trade and intellectual property. Officials say it will provide an easier and more predictable environment for Canadian technology multinationals to do business in Southeast Asia. Canada’s Global Affairs department reported last year that Indonesia was the country’s largest export market in Southeast Asia and its second-biggest destination for known direct investment in the region. Export Development Canada is now preparing to provide up to CAD 825 million in financing to the Indonesia Investment Authority. This is expected to assist in financing large-scale projects in infrastructure, energy, and digital industries, EDC vice-president Franco Sciannamblo said. The business community is also pleased to note that a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the Business Council of Canada and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to help companies from both countries to benefit from trade initiatives. Canada pursues broader strategy in Asia This CEPA agreement is part of a larger Canadian strategy for Asia. Ottawa, which takes three-quarters of Canada’s exports, has taken steps to conclude trade agreements with Asian countries outside of China to diminish US dependence. In addition to Indonesia, Canada is considering a partnership with ASEAN to launch a regional agreement over time. Canadian officials emphasized that ASEAN’s closer ties can help strengthen Canada’s position in one of the globe’s fastest-expanding areas. Meanwhile, Indonesia is carving out its place in the world. Just this week, Jakarta announced that a nearly decade-long trade negotiation with the European Union had been completed . The EU and Canada deals represent a dramatic shift in Indonesia’s trade strategy as it seeks to assert itself as a linchpin of global supply chains. The CEPA and similar ones will not become effective immediately. The deal requires domestic ratification in both countries for it to take effect. The official hopes to complete this process by 2026. Once it does, trade between the two nations, valued at some $4 billion last year, is anticipated to increase sharply. Analysts said the deal could catalyze a new wave of Canadian businesses in Asia and increase market access for Indonesian goods in North America.

This milestone marks the beginning of a broader expansion for the XRP Ledger, positioning it as a serious player in the race to blend global liquidity with everyday usability. Why A Native Stablecoin Matters For XRP The recent launch of the first native stablecoin for XRP on the Flare Network marks a significant development for the XRP ecosystem. Onur, a trader and ambassador to NEARProtocol and Somnia_Network, has mentioned on X that the new stablecoin is designed to provide extra utility for XRP and create new liquidity rails for holders. It is worth noting that this initiative is part of Flare Network’s broader strategy to expand the utility of FAssets adoption. Related Reading: XRP Price Stability Signals Opportunity – Is a Fresh Breakout on the Horizon? Onur also drew attention to the stablecoin design, which is based on a battle-tested collateralized Debt position (CDP) and stability pool model. He also sees this as a first step toward a more self-sustaining DeFi layer on Flare, where liquidity is generated natively rather than depending solely on external assets. Onur concludes by expressing his curiosity about the level of demand from XRP holders for liquidity without selling for this new product. Based on a new report highlighted by a technical analyst, ALLINCRYPTO, Ripple is positioning the XRP Ledger as a top-tier platform for institutional DeFi. In addition, the report reveals significant milestones, including securing over $1 billion in monthly stablecoin volume and ranking among the top real-world asset tokenization activities. Meanwhile, the report also confirms that zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are currently being developed for the XRPL to strike a balance between user privacy, regulatory compliance, and scalability. Major Analysts Are Now Targeting XRP An Italian crypto expert, Fabio Zuccara, has drawn attention to a shift in the market’s perception of XRP, referencing bold price predictions from major market voices on Wall Street. These forecasts, which place XRP’s potential value between $10,000 and $35,000, are not mere random speculation. Related Reading: $480 Million In 2 Weeks? XRP Whale Movements Could Reveal The Next Price Direction Zuccara’s core argument is that the adoption of XRPL for RWAs is poised for an explosion. He points to the $653.39 trillion global real estate market, which is preparing to migrate onto the XRPL through Real token. The token was launched with a phase one supply of just 100 million tokens, with a remarkable 80% already burned. Specifically, this extreme scarcity creates the foundation for a massive supply squeeze. Zuccara illustrates this with a compelling calculation that if a mere 1% of the $650 trillion market flows through the XRPL, the value of the Real token could surge from its current price of $0.023 to $64,500. However, this kind of supply shock could unfold overnight, positioning the REAL Token as the premier RWA and DeFi asset on the XRP Ledger.

52221425,588490,1758765633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52221425.jpeg,Strategist Publishes Bitcoin ‘Cheat Code’ As Factors That Led To Previous ATHs Return,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-cheat-code-published/,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price action is once again under scrutiny as historical indicators that preceded past All-Time Highs (ATHs) have reappeared. A recently published Bitcoin “cheat code,” by a crypto strategist, points to cyclical markers that have perfectly aligned with every major rally in the past. With BTC currently trading above $112,500, traders are watching closely as the same setup that triggered explosive runs in previous bull markets comes back into play. A Closer Look At The Bitcoin “Cheat Code” Crypto strategist, CrypFlow, shared a new technical analysis of Bitcoin in an X social media post on Monday. The analysis focuses on the Bitcoin (2M) SNAB Relative Strength Index (RSI) chart, which he describes as the core “cheat code” for identifying cycle tops and bottoms. He explained that the 73 level on this indicator has been the heartbeat of every major Bitcoin bull market move since 2013. When the RSI is below 73, it has historically acted as resistance, preventing BTC from moving higher. But once Bitcoin reclaimed that level, the RSI transformed into powerful support, triggering massive rallies that culminated in new all-time highs . Every cycle from 2013, 2017, and 2021 followed the same rhythm: a reclaim of the 73 level, a sustained rally to fresh highs, and eventually a breakdown from the extreme purple line near the 98 level that signaled the ultimate cycle top . CrypFlow stated that the current market cycle appears to be repeating this pattern, with the same SNAB RSI indicator flashing for Bitcoin. After previously forming a double bottom , the cryptocurrency surged to reclaim the critical level, mirroring setups from past bull market cycles. Looking ahead, the crypto strategist confirms that BTC is yet to reach its final cycle top, despite its record-breaking run and new ATH this year . As with past bull cycles, the final exhaustion point is expected only when RSI loses strength from its overheated levels near 98. Until then, the analyst’s confidence in his Bitcoin cheat code remains high, with signals still pointing to significant upside potential. Bollinger Band Squeeze And RSI Cross Spark Momentum Setup In a follow-up analysis, CrypFlow highlighted another recurring chart signal—the Bitcoin (1W) Bollinger Bands squeeze combined with a bullish stochastic RSI cross. This pairing has reportedly been a reliable trigger point for Bitcoin’s upward momentum throughout the current cycle. Historically, the pattern begins when the Bollinger Bands tighten around the price, indicating reduced volatility and an increased likelihood of a breakout. Each time this squeeze has coincided with a bullish stochastic RSI cross , CryptoFlow notes that Bitcoin has launched into a fresh upward swing. This was the case during previous surges from mid-2023 through 2025, with each squeeze setting the stage for significant price rallies. Right now, the setup is flashing once again. CrypFlow highlights that Bollinger Bands have compressed, and the stochastic RSI has just confirmed another bullish cross.

From late 2023 through mid 2025, the region’s on-chain value received rose sharply, climbing from about $81b a month in mid 2022 to a peak near $244b in Dec. 2024, and holding above $185b per month this year, according to a Chainalysis report published Wednesday. Japan is now the standout. On-chain value received rose 120% in the 12 months to June 2025, outpacing South Korea , India and Vietnam . Growth follows rule changes that treat more tokens as investment instruments, planned updates to crypto taxation, and the licensing of the first yen-backed stablecoin issuer. With stablecoin listings beginning to loosen, traders channeled heavy volumes into XRP, then BTC and ETH, while markets watch how USDC and JPYC gain traction. In our next preview chapter of the 2025 Geography of Crypto Report, we explore APAC's acceleration as the world's fastest-growing crypto region.

It leads APAC in total on-chain value at about $338b dollars, supported by UPI rails, a large diaspora that uses crypto for remittances, and young investors who trade for supplementary income. Industry groups are helping normalize usage, while authorities build clearer oversight without stifling fintech growth. South Korea’s market looks distinctly professional. Nearly half of on-chain activity sits in the $10,000 to $1m band. The 2024 Virtual Asset User Protection Act is reshaping exchange practices, and growing USDT and KRW stablecoin pairs have lifted volumes. Image Source: Chainalysis Policymakers are debating KRW-backed stablecoins, with rules expected to address issuance, distribution and secondary trading. Tighter Supervision In Australia Sets The Stage For Institutional Entry Vietnam shows everyday utility. Crypto supports remittances, gaming and savings, reflecting wide grassroots adoption. Activity has matured, which explains slower percentage growth compared with Japan, yet usage remains deeply embedded in daily flows. Australia is laying foundations. Steps to modernize AML and CFT rules and to clean up inactive exchange licences point to tighter supervision and a more durable market structure. That groundwork matters as institutions seek clearer counterparties. Hong Kong and Singapore continue to shape policy in different ways. Hong Kong’s Policy Statement 2.0 accelerated local activity by signalling a path for regulated trading. Singapore’s measured stance has shifted flows toward stablecoins, which now surpass bitcoin pairs as institutions use them for payments, liquidity and hedging. Across APAC, monthly on-chain value received climbed from about $81b in July 2022 to that Dec. 2024 peak. Volumes eased afterward but stayed high through mid-2025. The region frequently ranks second to Europe and at times outpaces North America, underscoring its growing influence on global flows. Beyond Trading, New Use Cases Keep Volumes Elevated Into 2025 Market triggers were clear. Late 2023 and early 2024 produced the first months above $100b as prices recovered. Q4 2024 delivered the top prints, helped by a global risk rally. The trend persisted into 2025 even as prices cooled, pointing to broader use cases beyond trading alone. APAC’s diversity is the driver. Japan’s reform cycle, India’s digital public infrastructure, Korea’s trader centric market, Vietnam’s everyday use, Australia’s compliance push, and the twin hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore together create multiple paths to adoption. That mix also buffers the region. When trading slows in one market, remittances, payments or treasury activity sustain volumes elsewhere. As rules continue to harden, APAC’s role as a bellwether for how crypto will be used at scale looks set to grow.

As of this week, it hit its most overbought level in 45 years, with a monthly RSI of 89.72. That’s the highest RSI for gold since 1980. Anyone who follows charts knows that anything above 70 usually signals overbought territory. So, near 90? That’s insane. And this is happening on a monthly chart, which means the trend’s been cooking for a while. The rally’s been brutal and steady. This year alone, gold has surged 43%, driven by falling real yields, global instability, and central banks shoveling gold into reserves like it’s running out. Traders are glued to the charts right now. This level of RSI doesn’t pop up often, and when it does, a correction usually follows. Some are already bracing for a short-term pullback. But for now, this metal isn’t cooling off. Traders rush into ETFs as gold keeps climbing On Friday, gold-backed ETFs added 27 tonnes in a single day. That’s the biggest spike since January 2022 and more than double the daily average this year. It triggered a 0.9% surge in ETF holdings, the biggest one-day jump in over two years. Bloomberg says those holdings have grown almost every month in 2025, except May, adding close to 400 tonnes total. Traders are going all in. This push has lined gold up for its sixth straight weekly gain, the longest winning streak since February. It’s turning into a historic run. At the same time, silver’s moving too. The largest silver ETF, $SLV, saw daily options volume jump to 1.2 million shares on Friday. That’s the highest since April 2024. On Tuesday, silver touched $44 an ounce, while spot gold held steady at $3,760.70 as of 8:16 a.m. in Singapore. Platinum barely moved. Palladium ticked lower. But the real action’s all on the yellow metal. Fed rate cuts and Trump’s NATO comments heat up the gold trade The Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points a week ago, dragging real yields down even further, as Cryptopolitan previously reported. Naturally, that has pushed even more investors into non-yielding assets like gold. Inflation’s still sticking around, fiscal deficits are rising, and tensions across Europe and the Middle East haven’t let up. Central banks haven’t missed the party either. They’ve been stacking gold this year like their lives depend on it. That demand hasn’t let up, and it’s kept support under prices. Now, there’s even talk that gold could hit $5,000 by the end of the year. Traders are watching the U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index this week. That’s the Fed’s favorite inflation metric. If it slows down again, that could mean more cuts are coming, and more support for gold. On the political front, President Donald Trump, speaking during a UN General Assembly meeting in New York, said NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace. When asked whether Ukraine can still win the war, Trump said, “Yes, I do.” Those comments dropped straight into the middle of already tense global markets. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index stayed flat, giving no help to the greenback. That’s just one more reason traders are clinging to gold.

In a move that has caught the attention of analysts, ten major whale addresses collectively pulled an astounding 210,452 ETH, valued at approximately $860 million, from prominent exchanges like Kraken, Galaxy Digital OTC, BitGo, and FalconX. This substantial outflow, reported by Lookonchain, suggests a potentially crucial shift in market dynamics. Such large-scale movements by powerful market players often provide valuable insights into upcoming trends and investor sentiment. Understanding these actions is key for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. What Do These Significant ETH Whale Withdrawals Mean? When large holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ move substantial amounts of cryptocurrency off exchanges, it typically indicates a change in their strategy. These particular ETH whale withdrawals represent a significant portion of Ethereum’s circulating supply being taken out of immediate trading environments. Historically, such movements can signal several things, from increased confidence in the asset’s long-term value to preparation for specific off-exchange activities. Moreover, these withdrawals are not merely transactions; they are strategic decisions with potential ripple effects across the entire market. They offer a glimpse into the mindset of those who hold substantial influence. Reduced Selling Pressure: By removing ETH from exchanges, these whales are effectively reducing the supply available for immediate sale, which can alleviate short-term selling pressure. Accumulation Phase: It could indicate that these large investors are accumulating ETH, believing its price will appreciate significantly in the future. Self-Custody Preference: A growing trend among savvy investors is to move assets to personal wallets for enhanced security, away from potential exchange risks. Why Are Investors Opting for ETH Whale Withdrawals Now? Several factors might be influencing these large-scale ETH whale withdrawals . One primary reason could be the desire for greater security. Holding assets on an exchange always carries inherent risks, including potential hacks or regulatory uncertainties. Moving ETH to cold storage or self-custody wallets provides investors with full control over their funds, mitigating these concerns. Furthermore, these withdrawals could be linked to participation in Ethereum’s staking ecosystem. By withdrawing their ETH, whales might be preparing to stake their assets to earn rewards, thereby contributing to the network’s security and decentralization. Another possibility involves over-the-counter (OTC) deals, where large transactions are executed directly between parties, bypassing public exchanges to minimize market impact and price slippage. What Are the Potential Market Implications of These ETH Whale Withdrawals? The implications of such substantial ETH whale withdrawals are far-reaching for the broader crypto market. Firstly, a decrease in exchange supply often leads to a perception of scarcity, which can contribute to bullish sentiment. If demand remains constant or increases while supply on exchanges diminishes, upward price pressure may build over time. Secondly, these actions can serve as a strong signal to smaller investors. When major players demonstrate conviction by holding assets off-exchange, it can inspire others to follow suit, further strengthening market confidence. However, it is also crucial to consider that these movements do not guarantee immediate price appreciation. Market sentiment and broader economic factors always play a significant role. Short-term Volatility: While often bullish long-term, large movements can sometimes precede short-term volatility as the market digests the news and speculators react. Indicator of Health: Consistent outflows, especially during market dips, can be seen as a sign of underlying strength and growing institutional interest in Ethereum. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Landscape of ETH Whale Withdrawals The recent ETH whale withdrawals of $860 million from major exchanges are undoubtedly a significant event in the Ethereum ecosystem. They highlight a strategic decision by powerful market participants, potentially signaling a move towards greater self-custody, increased staking, or the execution of large private deals. For investors, monitoring such on-chain metrics provides valuable insights into the intentions of institutional and high-net-worth individuals, helping to inform personal investment strategies. While the immediate impact is always subject to broader market forces, these withdrawals generally paint a picture of long-term conviction rather than short-term speculative selling. Staying informed about these crucial movements is essential for anyone navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

Frequently Asked Questions About ETH Whale Withdrawals What is an ETH whale? An ETH whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Ethereum, typically enough to influence market prices with their transactions. Why do whales withdraw ETH from exchanges? Whales withdraw ETH for various reasons, including enhanced security through self-custody, participation in staking, executing over-the-counter (OTC) deals, or simply accumulating for long-term holding. Does withdrawing ETH always mean the price will go up? Not necessarily immediately. While withdrawals can reduce selling pressure and signal bullish sentiment, market prices are influenced by many factors. However, consistent outflows often suggest long-term confidence. How can I track ETH whale withdrawals? On-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain (as mentioned in the article), Glassnode, and CryptoQuant specialize in tracking and reporting such large movements of cryptocurrency. What is the difference between withdrawing and selling ETH? Withdrawing ETH means moving it from an exchange to a personal wallet, retaining ownership. Selling ETH means exchanging it for fiat currency or another cryptocurrency on an exchange. Did you find this analysis of ETH whale withdrawals insightful?

Consider the following steps to get ready: Fund Your Account: Deposit KRW, BTC, or USDT into your Upbit wallet before 1:00 p.m. UTC. Understand Order Types: Familiarize yourself with market orders, limit orders, and stop-limit orders to execute your trades effectively. Monitor Market Conditions: Keep an eye on XPL’s price action on other exchanges (if listed) and general market sentiment.

Recent reports reveal a dramatic decline in South Korean crypto holdings , indicating a notable reallocation of investor capital. This trend comes as traditional equities experience a strong resurgence, prompting a closer look at what’s driving this market movement. What’s Behind the Steep Decline in South Korean Crypto Holdings? Data from the Bank of Korea’s September Financial Stability Report, cited by Newsis, shows a substantial reduction in virtual asset holdings among South Korean investors. By the end of June, these holdings had fallen to 89.2 trillion won (approximately $64.6 billion). This represents a significant 27% decrease from their peak of 121.8 trillion won ($88.3 billion) at the end of January. The decline in South Korean crypto holdings directly correlates with a robust rally in the domestic stock market, including the KOSPI. Virtual asset deposits also dropped sharply, from 10.7 trillion won ($7.8 billion) to 6.2 trillion won ($4.5 billion) in the same period. Why Are Investors Shifting from Crypto to Stocks in South Korea? The primary reason for this pronounced shift appears to be the strong performance of the domestic stock market. As equities rally, they present an attractive alternative for investors seeking returns, often perceived as more stable than the volatile cryptocurrency market. Booming Equity Market: The KOSPI’s strong rally naturally draws capital, as investors chase potentially higher returns in traditional assets. Risk Reassessment: Following periods of significant crypto volatility, some investors may seek assets with lower perceived risk. Macroeconomic Influence: Broader economic conditions and investor sentiment favor established markets over emerging digital ones. This rebalancing of portfolios indicates a change in investor sentiment towards digital assets, as South Korean crypto holdings adjust to the evolving financial landscape. The Impact on South Korean Crypto Holdings and the Market Landscape The substantial reduction in South Korean crypto holdings carries broader implications for the nation’s digital asset ecosystem. A sustained outflow of capital could affect local crypto exchanges, potentially leading to reduced trading volumes and slower innovation. It also raises questions about future regulatory frameworks. For individual investors, this trend highlights the importance of a balanced investment strategy. While cryptocurrencies offer unique opportunities, their inherent volatility means that diversification remains a crucial principle. Understanding broader market cycles is essential for informed decision-making. Navigating Volatility: What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? The experience of South Korean crypto holdings offers valuable lessons for investors globally. It underscores the dynamic nature of financial markets and the constant interplay between different asset classes. Consider these actionable insights: Diversify Wisely: Avoid concentrating all investments in one asset class. A diversified portfolio, including both traditional and digital assets, helps manage risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with both crypto market trends and broader economic news. Assess Risk: Understand your personal comfort level with risk and align your investments accordingly. This dramatic shift in South Korea provides crucial insights into investor behavior and market dynamics. In conclusion, the significant decrease in South Korean crypto holdings , fueled by a thriving stock market, marks a pivotal moment for the country’s financial sector. It highlights the cyclical nature of investment preferences and the enduring appeal of traditional assets during periods of equity market strength. Understanding these shifts is crucial for all investors navigating today’s complex markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused the 27% fall in South Korean crypto holdings? A strong rally in the domestic stock market (KOSPI) attracted funds away from virtual assets. 2. How much did virtual asset deposits decrease? Deposits dropped from 10.7 trillion won ($7.8 billion) to 6.2 trillion won ($4.5 billion). 3. Is this trend unique to South Korea? While specific to South Korea, reallocation of funds between asset classes based on market performance is a common global trend. The scale here is noteworthy. 4. What should investors learn from this shift in South Korean crypto holdings? Prioritize diversification, stay informed about market trends, and regularly assess risk tolerance for informed decisions.

Recent headlines suggest that retail adoption is shifting from niche to mainstream. Russia’s largest online retailer, Wildberries, has introduced crypto payments in Belarus via Whitebird, the nation’s first licensed exchange. Rather than direct transfers, customers buy electronic certificates with BTC, ETH, or USDT, which are then redeemable on Wildberries’ platform.

Bullish pic.twitter.com/UlDCjRc3Fq — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 24, 2025 The program remains in pilot mode, but authorities expect Belarus to process as much as $3 billion in crypto payments by the end of 2025. That surge in adoption could underpin long-term demand for Bitcoin. Corporate Bets on Bitcoin Beyond retail, corporate interest is surfacing again. Chinese EV charging firm Jiuzi Holdings shocked market participants with a plan to allocate up to $1 billion into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. The proposal, aimed at hedging against economic volatility, briefly sent Jiuzi’s stock soaring 47% before reality set in.

Still, the announcement highlights a broader trend: more companies are considering crypto as part of their treasury strategies. Meanwhile, Kraken has pledged $2 million to U.S. political groups pushing for clearer regulation. The donation, split between America First Digital and the Freedom Fund PAC, reflects growing industry efforts to secure legal clarity. Technical Outlook for Bitcoin (BTC/USD) From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has slipped into a descending channel after peaking at $117,800 earlier this month. The rejection at $115,185 coincided with a short-term “death cross,” where the 50-period SMA crossed below the 200-period SMA. Momentum has shifted toward sellers, with RSI hovering near 45, suggesting weakness but not capitulation. The immediate resistance stands at $114,025, while $112,000 forms critical short-term support. A break below could expose the $111,095 and $109,771 levels. Traders, however, should remain alert for bullish signals. A rebound from $111,000, confirmed by a bullish engulfing candle or positive RSI divergence, could trigger a breakout from the descending channel. That scenario would open upside targets back toward $115,200 and $116,600, with momentum potentially building into the final quarter of 2025. Key Takeaway: With retail adoption expanding in Belarus, corporates allocating billions to crypto, and regulatory clarity advancing in the U.S., Bitcoin is quietly laying the groundwork for another leg higher. A well-timed rally toward $116,000 remains in play if technical conditions align with these macro tailwinds.
