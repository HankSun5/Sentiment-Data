Total market capitalization now stands at $294 billion, The majority of these tokens continue to circulate on Ethereum, cementing its place as the backbone of the stablecoin ecosystem. But this growth isn’t just about the old giants like USDT and USDC. New entrants are making waves with innovative models and fresh incentives for users. Let’s take a closer look at the latest developments. Total Stablecoin Market Cap just hit a new ATH of $294 BILLION Guess where most of those stablecoins live? You guessed it: Ethereum pic.twitter.com/0QQBqS4Y26 — Crypto-Gucci.eth ᵍᵐ (@CryptoGucci) September 24, 2025 USDH Launches on Hyperliquid Native Markets has officially rolled out USDH, a fully backed stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. The token is now live on Hyperliquid with a USDH/USDC trading pair already seeing more than $2.2 million in early trading volume. The reserves behind USDH are managed through a hybrid structure. Backing comes from cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, while transparency is maintained through oracle feeds. An initial mix of off-chain and on-chain allocation ensures liquidity and stability. HYPERLIQUID RA MẮT STABLECOIN USDH USDH đã ghi nhận hơn 2 triệu USD khối lượng giao dịch ngay trong giai đoạn đầu Được bảo chứng bằng tiền mặt và trái phiếu kho bạc Mỹ ngắn hạn, USDH nhằm giảm sự phụ thuộc vào các stablecoin bên ngoài như USDC,… pic.twitter.com/4IRnySisKX — ThuanCapital (@ThuanCapital) September 24, 2025 The issuer has also mapped out a yield-sharing model: 50% of reserve yields will be used to buy back HYPE tokens. The remaining 50% will support Hyperliquid’s ecosystem growth. For Hyperliquid, this launch is a step toward reducing reliance on USDC, which still represents over 90% of total deposits. USDH could help diversify liquidity on the platform and create new demand for the HYPE token. Key stat: USDH has already generated over $2 million in trading activity since launch. 1/ USDF is @Aster_DEX 's native stablecoin. Holders earn airdrop points for holding the token. Lets dive into the metrics of this token. pic.twitter.com/TrxC3mfQg8 — Pine Analytics (@PineAnalytics) September 24, 2025 USDF Supply Explodes on Aster DEX Another stablecoin gaining attention is USDF, the native token of Aster DEX. Unlike USDH, USDF is directly tied to user incentives,holders earn airdrop points simply for holding the token. The supply growth has been nothing short of aggressive. Just nine days ago, total supply hovered around 34 million USDF. Today, it has surged to nearly 250 million, marking an increase of more than 220 million in under two weeks. But the distribution tells a different story. According to data: 83% of USDF remains in the project treasury. 8.7% is staked as auUSDF. 6.8% is held by other protocol addresses. Staking plays a key role in USDF’s tokenomics. Users can convert their USDF into auUSDF, which not only earns extra points but also provides yield. At present, auUSDF is trading at 1.042, translating to an implied 7.5% APY over the last five months. Most recent activity shows wallets buying USDF primarily to farm Aster DEX points, before depositing them directly on the platform. This mix of incentives has fueled rapid supply expansion while anchoring liquidity within the ecosystem. Key stat: USDF supply jumped 7x in just over a week, from 34M to 250M. Kazakhstan Enters the Stablecoin Race with KZTE It’s not just DeFi protocols experimenting with stablecoins. Nation-states are beginning to make their mark too. The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) has launched a pilot program for KZTE, a tenge-backed stablecoin. Developed inside NBK’s regulatory sandbox, KZTE is being issued on Solana by licensed exchange Intebix, with support from Mastercard and Eurasian Bank. This marks the first national tenge stablecoin to hit a blockchain. Kazakhstan launches Stablecoin $KZTE pegged to the Tenge! The National Bank of Kazakhstan @Nationalbank_KZ has kicked off a pilot program to issue the tenge-backed KZTE stablecoin on Solana, developed within its regulatory sandbox for digital assets. Issued by licensed… pic.twitter.com/1iHhTgC9BP — Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) September 24, 2025 The pilot introduces a few key benefits: Seamless fiat-to-crypto exchange with KZTE integration. Direct crypto card settlement via Mastercard rails. Expanded digital asset access for Kazakhstan’s retail and institutional market. A significant step toward NBK’s goal of modernizing payment infrastructure. By choosing Solana, the initiative gains access to high-speed, low-cost transactions, which makes sense for a retail-friendly stablecoin. With Mastercard in the mix, KZTE is positioned for real-world payments and cross-border settlement. This move also signals Kazakhstan’s intent to carve out a role in the global stablecoin race,not just as a miner-friendly hub, but now as a player in blockchain-based finance. Key stat: KZTE is the first stablecoin pegged to the Kazakh tenge issued under a national pilot program. Why These Launches Matter Stablecoins remain the backbone of crypto markets, accounting for nearly every on-chain dollar transaction, lending protocol, and DeFi yield farm. The rise to $294 billion market cap shows they are not slowing down. But the entry of new players like USDH, USDF, and KZTE highlights the evolution of this space: USDH is focused on decentralizing liquidity within trading venues while tying yields back to governance tokens like HYPE. USDF reflects how DeFi projects gamify liquidity through airdrops and staking incentives, driving rapid supply growth. KZTE represents a government’s attempt to merge fiat and crypto payments under a regulated framework. The mix of private issuers, DeFi-native tokens, and state-backed experiments suggests stablecoins are becoming more diverse in purpose and design. Ethereum still hosts the lion’s share of stablecoin activity, but ecosystems like Solana, Hyperliquid, and Aster DEX are carving out niches. Whether it’s new collateral models, reward mechanisms, or direct fiat integration, the stablecoin market is moving beyond its USDT/USDC duopoly. As the market cap pushes into new record territory, expect even more issuers,both private and state-linked,to step in. Each new launch tests how stablecoins can evolve from just a crypto dollar to something that underpins financial systems at scale. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The goal is to boost liquidity across both ecosystems by letting investors redeem their fund shares for RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin that already boasts a $700 million market cap . While redemptions will begin on Ethereum , Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that they’ll soon transition to the XRP Ledger , bringing even more real-world utility to the network. This unlocks a key catalyst for a bullish XRP price prediction , potentially accelerating transaction volumes and supporting the case for long-term targets as high as $1,000 . XRP Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch As Consolidation Continues XRP has been consolidating for a while after it hit its latest swing high at $3.65. The token is still on an uptrend and the key area of support to watch is the $2.60 level. Hence, while XRP may see short-term pullbacks in the coming days, its long-term trajectory remains bullish thanks to major project developments and improving market conditions. A strong rebound from the $2.60 level could set the stage for a breakout to a new all-time high, with $10 firmly in sight this cycle – representing a 230% upside. And while the $1,000 mark may sound ambitious, the rapid pace of institutional adoption and integration of Ripple’s technology points to a long-term trajectory where such a valuation becomes increasingly plausible over time. In the meantime, high-potential crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are attracting serious attention. With altseason heating up fast, this could be the best chance to get in before the next 10x explosion . Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Turns High-Leverage Trading Into a Meme-Powered Movement Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is more than just another Shiba in the meme pack; it’s a token wired on 1,000x leverage and built for retail traders who want to play the same game as whales. Backed by one of crypto’s most recognizable memes, $MAXI has already pulled in over $2.4 million just a few weeks after its presale kicked off. Through the MAXI Fund, the project will invest up to 25% of the presale proceeds in the most promising tokens of the cycle with 1000X leverage to amplify results. Add in gamified challenges like Max Gains and Max Ripped, and the token becomes a trading club for degens who thrive on risk. To buy $MAXI, visit the official Maxi Doge website and connect a compatible wallet (such as the Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card at checkout.

His call is bold: slash gas from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei, cutting average transaction costs nearly in half. That would make BNB one of the cheapest major blockchains in 2025,on par with Solana and Base,while maintaining performance for traders and builders. Gas fees matter.

For high-frequency traders and market makers, even small fee differences shape where liquidity flows. Lower fees also attract new apps and retail users who may otherwise avoid costly networks like Ethereum. BNB Chain validators are proposing to cut gas from 0.1 to 0.05 Gwei and shorten block intervals from 750ms to 450ms, dropping fees to about $0.005 per tx and keeping BSC competitive with Solana and Base. Past cuts from 3→1 Gwei and 1→0.1 Gwei lowered fees 75% and boosted daily… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 24, 2025 BNB Chain validators are now proposing two big changes: Cut minimum gas from 0.1 Gwei → 0.05 Gwei Shorten block intervals from 750ms → 450ms If approved, this would push median fees down to ~$0.005 per tx. That cements BSC’s role as a low-cost chain for trading, swaps, and onchain experimentation. A Track Record of Bold Cuts This isn’t new territory. BNB Chain has repeatedly slashed gas, and each time activity soared: April 2024: Gas fell 3 Gwei → 1 Gwei (–67%) May 2025: Gas fell 1 Gwei → 0.1 Gwei (–90%) The results: median fees dropped from $0.04 → $0.01 (–75%). Daily transactions jumped 140%, breaking 12M+ per day. October 2025 now brings the next chapter: 0.05 Gwei as the new floor. Trading Drives the Network The shift in activity is clear. At the start of 2025, swap-related activity made up just 20% of BSC transactions. By June, it surged to 67%, making trading the chain’s dominant use case. For these users, every fraction of a cent in fees matters. Low gas doesn’t just help,it decides where trades land. BNB’s staking yield remains above 0.5% APY, meaning validator rewards are stable. Network capacity also sits under 30% utilization, leaving plenty of headroom for volume growth. Risks and Safeguards Critics often point to three risks: failed transactions, validator incentives, and infrastructure strain. But the chain’s data suggests otherwise: Infrastructure has been tested to handle 3x today’s state load. Higher transaction counts offset lower per-tx fees, keeping validator APY healthy. Gas remains dynamic if congestion spikes. The system is designed to flex with demand while prioritizing accessibility. A New Principle for Growth The community is discussing a guiding principle for BNB Chain: “As long as staking APY stays above 0.5%, the network should aim for the lowest gas possible.” This ensures validators remain rewarded while users enjoy ultra-low costs. The long-term target is even more ambitious: ~$0.001 per tx, which would put BSC among the cheapest large chains globally. ATHs Back the Case Momentum is already on BNB Chain’s side. Last week, the chain hit fresh records: 17.4M active addresses $3.32B perpetuals volume 100M+ weekly transactions $1M+ daily fees Much of this surge is powered by @Aster_DEX, which has reignited the perpetuals trading narrative on BSC. These milestones strengthen the argument that lowering fees further won’t hurt sustainability,it may instead accelerate adoption. BNB Chain hits new weekly ATHs with 17.4M active addresses and $3.32B in perps volume. The growth is driven by @Aster_DEX , which attracted traders to @BNBCHAIN and reignited the perps narrative. Other metrics are climbing too: weekly trxns сrossed 100M, and daily fees hit $1M. pic.twitter.com/f7tFPcTNEK — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) September 24, 2025 BNB’s Market Position BNB is consolidating after recently breaking $1,000 for the first time. The rally reflects growing confidence in Binance’s ecosystem, even as competitors like Solana, Ethereum, and Base push for liquidity dominance. Cutting fees at this moment isn’t just tactical,it’s strategic. It signals BNB Chain intends to lead the next wave of onchain trading by staying the cheapest, fastest option. The proposal is now in community hands. Validators and users will weigh the pros and cons before voting. If approved, fees would halve within weeks, further positioning BNB Chain as the backbone for high-frequency onchain activity. The message from leadership is clear: performance and accessibility will drive the next stage of growth. BNB Chain has always moved forward with validator consensus and user support. This proposal continues that path. Community feedback will shape whether the chain pursues 0.05 Gwei now and $0.001 per tx long term. With adoption climbing and trading now dominant, the fee debate is more than numbers,it’s about securing BSC’s place in the future of DeFi. BNB trades at $1,014, with 24h volume at $3.8B and circulating supply of 139M BNB, per CoinMarketCap. The road ahead will be decided by the same principle that has guided past success: build fast, keep fees low, and grow together. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Yet the one-word message went viral, drawing over 8.6 million views within hours. The response was immediate. $FTT, the native token of the defunct FTX exchange, erupted in trading volume and price. According to Coingecko, $FTT jumped 30.2% in early trading, later peaking near a 60% gain on the day. $FTT is up 30.2% following a 'gm' tweet from Sam Bankman-Fried's X account. pic.twitter.com/9Zqk33Y01b — CoinGecko (@coingecko) September 24, 2025 Who’s Posting From Prison? The sudden appearance of SBF online fueled speculation. How does someone behind bars manage to post on X? Shortly after the “gm,” a follow-up clarification appeared. The account explained that Sam himself is not directly posting, but that “a friend” has access and is sharing updates on his behalf. The clarification did little to calm the chatter. Screenshots, reposts, and memes flooded crypto Twitter. Reactions split between disbelief, anger, and amusement at the idea of a casual “good morning” shaking up a dead token. The Market Impact The effect was undeniable. Traders rushed back into $FTT, a token once written off after FTX’s collapse in 2022. At press time, $FTT trades around $0.97, up 18% in 24 hours, with a market cap of $319 million, according to CoinMarketCap. Daily volume surged past $79 million. Timing Ahead of Repayment Round The surge also coincides with a crucial date for FTX creditors. On September 30, the exchange is scheduled for its third repayment round, distributing $1.6 billion back to creditors. Speculators may be linking the renewed activity around SBF’s account to renewed hopes for the FTX estate. While there’s no official connection between the tweet and the repayment, markets often react emotionally to symbolic signals. Digital Resurrection of #SBF Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced genius serving 25 years for massive fraud, has just broken his silence on X after months of digital silence.

A… pic.twitter.com/QkPzrpSn1f — Ismeidy (@ismeidyfinanzas) September 24, 2025 A Community Divided The broader crypto community remains torn. Some view the $FTT move as a cynical pump, with little substance behind it. Others frame it as proof of the token’s resilience, even years after its parent exchange collapsed. Crypto commentator @g13m noted that “the fact a single ‘gm’ can do this says more about trader psychology than fundamentals.” GieM The unexpected awakening of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in X, where he is serving a 25-year sentence in an American prison, led to a nearly 60% increase in the price of the FTT exchange token. After the ""Good Morning"" message, another post was published, clarifying that… pic.twitter.com/4iOyJ4FOqu — Captain GM (@g13m) September 24, 2025 Memes also poured in, with “gm from prison” trending across X. Some joked about Sam tweeting workout updates or prison cafeteria reviews next. Others criticized the ethical implications of humanizing someone convicted of one of the largest frauds in financial history. The SBF Factor Sam Bankman-Fried has been largely absent from public conversation since his conviction earlier this year. Legal experts had predicted a quiet disappearance from headlines as the FTX bankruptcy played out. Instead, his digital ghost just sent shockwaves through crypto markets. Even from behind bars, the mere suggestion of SBF’s presence still moves money. That fact alone raises questions about how much influence individuals continue to hold over crypto sentiment, even after disgrace. Whether today’s surge sustains is uncertain. $FTT remains a speculative asset tied to a collapsed exchange, with little utility outside creditor speculation. Still, today’s price action shows that narratives,especially unexpected ones,can reignite interest. As the September 30 repayment round approaches, all eyes will remain on both $FTT price action and the X account of Sam Bankman-Fried. A casual post already triggered one rally. Traders are now watching closely for the next digital whisper from prison. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While the market shows attempts at recovery, the unclear wave patterns leave traders divided on whether the next move will be a breakout or a deeper correction. Messy Subwaves Keep Bitcoin’s Next Move Clouded TARA, a crypto analyst, recently shared fresh insights on X regarding Bitcoin’s ongoing price action. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is currently in the middle of forming another wave down, but the subwave structure is still messy and unclear. This uncertainty makes it harder to predict the exact short-term direction, though the broader trend signals that further movement is likely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Signals Bullish Edge As Traders Eye Fed Pivot She noted that BTC has already tested the resistance zone around $113,500, but the market still seems drawn toward lower targets. The rejection from that resistance highlights the weakness in immediate bullish momentum, leaving room for bears to reassert control. TARA also emphasized that the $111,000 level remains a critical area to watch. This zone aligns closely with important Fibonacci retracement levels, particularly the .618 support fibs. As long as Bitcoin holds above this threshold, there’s still a chance for the bulls to regain momentum and avoid deeper downside pressure. However, if $111,000 is broken decisively, the analyst warned that Bitcoin would most likely extend its decline toward the next major Fibonacci level near $99,000. Such a move would shake out weak hands before the market establishes a more stable foundation for recovery. BTC Finds Support As Liquidity Grab Sparks Bounce Crypto VIP Signal, in a fresh update, noted that Bitcoin recently grabbed liquidity at a key support zone before bouncing higher. This liquidity sweep allowed the market to reset after testing lower levels, showing that buyers were quick to step in and defend the area. Such reactions often serve as early signs of strength, suggesting that Bitcoin still holds bullish potential as long as the support remains intact. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Drops To $115K After Rate-Cut Rally — But BTC Far From Capitulation Attention now turns to the $113,000–$113,300 resistance zone, which stands as the next major hurdle for price action. This level has acted as a tough ceiling in previous attempts, making it a critical zone to watch. According to the analyst, a decisive close above $113,300 could pave the way for BTC to target the $115,000 level in the short term. Such a breakout would not only reinforce bullish momentum but also strengthen the case for a continuation of the broader upward trend. In the meantime, speculations are whether Bitcoin can hold onto its rebound or if resistance will once again prove too strong to overcome.

52215414,588435,1758754842,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52215414.jpeg,XRP And DeFi: The Roadmap That Tells It All,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-and-defi-the-roadmap/,"Ripple has unveiled the next phase of its roadmap for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in relation to institutional DeFi. The roadmap focuses on tokenization, privacy, and native lending, and plans to introduce more stablecoins on the network, which is a positive for XRP’s utility. Ripple Reveals Latest Roadmap For Institutional DeFi On The Ledger In a blog post , Ripple noted that tokenization remains the central enabler of the XRP Ledger’s institutional strategy. Therefore, plans are in place to introduce the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard by October on the network. The crypto firm explained that these MPTs are a flexible token standard that can carry essential metadata without relying on complex smart contracts. In relation to institutional DeFi on the XRP Ledger, Ripple noted that the MPT enables assets of bond issuers, money market funds , and structured products to be represented faithfully and traded natively on the network. The crypto firm further revealed that the next phase will enable the integration of MPTs into the DEX for easy trading, AMM liquidity pools, and cross-token payments. Furthermore, Ripple also plans to introduce a native lending protocol on the Ledger, which it described as the “most significant near-term milestone.” The lending protocol is set to go live in XRPL Version 3.0.0 later this year. The crypto firm said that the protocol introduces pooled lending and underwritten credit directly at the ledger level. Ripple remarked that the appeal of a native lending protocol on the Ledger is clear for institutions. The firm claimed that no financial institution will turn down low-cost capital if it can be sourced within KYC/AML standards . The protocol will pool liquidity from a global base of smaller investors into institutional-sized loans while maintaining compliance. For loan managers, this will be an opportunity to meet the rising demand for liquidity from TradFi by tapping into the growing crypto liquidity, specifically on the XRP Ledger. The Push For Programmable Privacy Ripple revealed that one of the XRP Ledger’s next major upgrades is programmable privacy . The firm noted that for financial institutions, full transparency doesn’t always work, but that privacy features must still meet compliance and auditability standards. The first privacy-focused application, confidential MPTs, is said to already be in development and is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of next year. These confidential MPTs will support privacy-preserving collateral management, which Ripple noted is a critical requirement for institutional adoption of tokenized finance . As a whole, the crypto firm indicated that the goal is to introduce more stablecoins, RWAs, lending, compliance tooling, and privacy directly at the protocol level at a global scale. Meanwhile, Ripple stated that over the last year, the Ledger has broken into the top 10 chains for RWAs and has reached its first $1 billion month in stablecoin volume. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.84, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Ripple|AMM Liquidity Pools|DeFi|DEX|KYC/AML Standards|MPTs|Multi-Purpose Token|ripple|ripple news|stablecoin|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|WALLET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-24 23:00:42

AML Software has filed a lawsuit against Athena Bitcoin, claiming that Athena conspired with Taproot Acquisition Enterprises and its CEO, Jordan Mirch, in a scheme to wrongfully obtain AML’s proprietary source code. Athena Bitcoin faces lawsuit over alleged source code theft Athena Bitcoin Global Inc., a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator , has run into legal trouble with the Illinois firm AML Software. AML Software filed a lawsuit accusing Athena Bitcoin of engaging in a scheme to steal its proprietary source code. The complaint was lodged on Tuesday in federal court and contains allegations of copyright infringement, trade secret theft, and other unlawful conduct. AML Software claims that its code is copyrighted and was never licensed for sale to Athena despite the company’s attempt to directly purchase AML’s code. The 16-page filing made allegations of collusion between Athena and Jordan Mirch, the CEO of Taproot Acquisition Enterprises. Mirch was implicated as the “motivating force” behind the alleged misappropriation and accused him of using fraudulent tactics to gain access to more than 3,000 ATMs still running AML’s software that Athena sought to acquire starting in 2023. The legal case involves SandP Solutions, which is a company that once operated 2,800 Bitcoin ATMs. After regulators barred SandP from operating in Ohio, the company faced mounting financial strain. The complaint alleges that Mirch seized the opportunity, securing SandP’s ATMs through “fraudulent misrepresentations and other unlawful conduct.” Once in possession of the machines, Mirch allegedly reached out to Athena to negotiate a transfer of both hardware and software. The lawsuit further claims that Mirch hired an AML developer as a consultant in an effort to wrongfully obtain AML’s existing copyrighted platform. Athena faces different customer protection lawsuit AML’s lawsuit also references a recent $9M settlement agreement involving Athena, Taproot, and associated entities. Under the terms, Athena announced earlier this month that it was gaining “immediate ownership of ATMs and source code,” while terminating a revenue-sharing deal with Taproot. AML, however, argues that the source code transferred under the agreement did not legally belong to Taproot or Athena, but to AML alone. Earlier this month, Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb filed a separate lawsuit accusing Athena of exploiting elderly customers through predatory practices . Schwalb alleged Athena profited from scams, charging up to 26% in hidden fees. Progressive Democrats have called for tougher consumer protections in the crypto sector.Senator Cynthia Lummis said Tuesday that she plans to address issues like those raised in the Athena case through forthcoming market structure legislation, co-sponsored with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.

On Wednesday in New York, nearly 500,000 fed funds futures contracts for September were traded, breaking a record set in April 2023 when Trump’s tariff news hit markets. The surge is happening while the effective fed funds rate quietly crept up to 4.09% on Monday. That single basis point move outside of a policy change was enough to rattle the futures market and raise red flags over overnight borrowing stress. Traders are responding to a tightening repo market, where firms borrow cash overnight in exchange for Treasuries, as month-end and quarter-end always bring more pressure, with shrinking bank reserves and more Treasury bills flooding the market. Traders expect spike in repo rates before month-end Scrutiny on the rate has jumped since July. That’s when Treasury started pumping out more bills, while the Fed kept slashing its balance sheet. Bank reserves are now falling. Some traders are warning this combo could lead to serious funding pressure at quarter-end. Dealers slow their repo activity to clean up their books, and that usually pushes up borrowing costs. Everyone’s trying to front-run that pressure. The bulk of the action in September futures happened during Asia hours, with two blocks of 50,000 contracts traded. That frenzy picked up again once U.S. markets opened, especially as traders eyed the effective rate possibly hitting 4.10% before the month wraps. For almost 20 years, U.S. funding markets were soaked in cheap cash. Not anymore. Now, rates on very short-term borrowing, used by banks and asset managers, are climbing. That’s because the Treasury is rebuilding its cash pile while the Fed keeps tightening. Meanwhile, use of the Fed’s overnight reverse repo tool, a barometer for excess cash, just fell to its lowest in four years. “We are seeing a level shift in funding,” said Mark Cabana of Bank of America. “Money funds no longer have excess cash to deploy to the RRP.” As more T-bills get sold, investors move money out of repo and into those bills, which is dragging demand down while pushing rates up.Interest-rate benchmarks tied to overnight repos are now sitting near the Fed’s interest on reserve balances rate, showing the strain. The spread between repo and the fed funds rate has widened to about 11.5 basis points, the biggest gap since April. That spread was under 10 basis points for most of July and August, before the new wave of T-bills hit. Fed weighs tools as collateral and reserves drop together Things may get worse fast. Corporate tax payments and new auctions are about to pull even more money from the system next week. That could upset the balance between cash and collateral — and banks already hold fewer reserves at the Fed. Those balances have fallen to around $3.15 trillion, and Fed Governor Christopher Waller has warned that $2.7 trillion is probably the floor for what counts as “ample.” Meanwhile, rates tied to overnight financing keep climbing, which creates a headache for the Fed’s quantitative tightening strategy, the balance sheet reduction started in June 2022 and is supposed to finish by year-end. But it’s getting harder to manage with rates rising and reserves shrinking. Roberto Perli, who runs the Fed’s securities portfolio, said the central bank’s short-term interest rate tools will become even more critical in times like this. The more efficiently they work, the less damage markets take. To avoid another 2019-style repo panic, the Fed now uses the Standing Repo Facility (SRF), letting eligible firms borrow cash by pledging Treasuries or agency debt. That facility charges a rate aligned with the top of the Fed’s target range, now at 4.5%. It saw its biggest usage at the end of June since being made permanent in 2021. But it hasn’t been tested under real stress yet. JPMorgan’s team said the SRF could contain spikes in repo rates, reducing the need to cut QT short. But others aren’t so sure. September is already looking shaky, and more volatility could force that debate to the front. Some Fed officials, including Waller and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, admit funding stress is building. But they’re not pushing for an early end to QT.

Senators Push For Probe According to the Wednesday letter , Slotkin and Warren want a probe launched into David Sacks and Steve Witkoff for allegedly “advocating for the United States to sell sensitive national security technology to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).” The Senate duo allege Sacks and Witkoff “played key roles” over the White House’s choice to ease AI system security restrictions in shipments sent to the UAE. However, the senators claim the two had not “disclosed their financial ties to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan,” UAE’s national security advisor. Trump Administration Ties Questioned By U.S. Lawmakers Slotkin and Warren say that Witkoff’s son, World Liberty Financial CEO Zach Witkoff, failed to recuse himself from U.S. decisions involving the UAE despite MGX – a state-owned investment firm controlled by Sheikh Tahnoon – investing $2 billion worth of WLF’s issued stablecoin , USD1, into Binance. The senators allege that Sacks and Witkoff “were in positions to control government decisions to personally enrich themselves – even as they created significant national security concerns.” “In the history of our country’s foreign policy, one is hard-pressed to find two senior officials with such significant conflicts of interest involved in decisions regarding national security,” Slotkin and Warren said. “Such unbridled conflicts of interest have no place in the U.S. government, and we urge you to undertake a swift and thorough evaluation of these allegations,” they added. “This information is also critical as Congress considers legislation for digital asset market structure and attempts to ensure that crypto corruption does not undermine our national security.” The post Senators Call For Probe Into Top Trump Administration Officials, appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Elizabeth Warren|Trump|World Liberty Financial,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BNB|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-24 23:28:45

Per the South Korean media outlet Electronic Times , the ruling party said the task force would “create policies that spur future growth.” South Korean Crypto Policy: Task Force Set to Meet Biz Leaders At a press event at the National Assembly on September 24, task force members said they plan to pass pro-business legislation before the end of the year. Han Jeong-ae, the Chair of the DP’s policy committee, said: “We need to establish a system that keeps pace with evolving trends in the new financial market.

(Source: @jongmun.lee.1/Facebook) The new unit will initially focus its efforts on stablecoin legislation, with lawmakers still to finalize their token issuance and distribution plans. But the DP’s plans will likely bring much cheer to South Korean crypto firms. The media outlet wrote that the lawmakers are “expected to focus on streamlining the system to foster industries.” It added that it would move away from existing crypto laws, which focus primarily “on operator regulation and user protection measures.” The lawmaker Lee Jeong-moon will head the task force. Members include the likes of Min Byoung-dug, the chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee and a vocal proponent of stablecoin-powered growth . The lawmaker Min Byoung-dug (center), ahead of legislative elections last year. (Source: @anyangminbest/Facebook) Task Force to Speak to Regulators, Central Bank The task force has already asked ministries and the top financial regulators (the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service) to come forward with policy proposals. The lawmakers have also asked the Bank of Korea to do likewise. They also plan to hold talks with companies in the sector, such as crypto exchanges and fintech companies. The task force said it would form an advisory group comprised of private sector experts. Lee said that the force’s goal was to roll out crypto-related legislation during the National Assembly’s final session of the calendar year. He explained: “We will treat the digital asset market as a new paradigm for the financial markets. Our goal is to develop policies that will foster future growth.” Han, meanwhile, lauded the government for its recent move to lift a ban on venture capital funding for crypto firms. She said the move would help revitalize the industry, and added: “We will communicate closely with the government and listen to and reflect diverse opinions from experts, financial institutions, crypto exchanges, and fintech companies.” The lawmaker Ahn Do-geol, another DP MP with a pro-business stance on crypto policy, stated: “The government must lead the way in financial innovation. We have already fallen a long way behind. We could miss out on the innovation and growth potential of the digital asset sector, including stablecoins .” Ahn concluded that lawmakers have “formed a consensus” on many crypto-related matters, with a general “bipartisan agreement” on stablecoins now in place.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/13-of-xrp-supply-could-be-taken-off-the-market-heres-why/,"Concerns are growing within the XRP community about a possible reduction in available supply, as new projects target large allocations of the token for staking and yield-bearing products. Digital Asset Investor (DAI), a well-known voice in the community, recently highlighted figures from both Axelar Network and Flare that, if realized, could remove billions of XRP from circulation. Ambitious Targets from Axelar and Flare Axelar Network recently introduced mXRP, a yield-generating asset that runs on both the XRP Ledger and its EVM Sidechain. In an interview with Crypto in America , Axelar Foundation co-founder Georgios Vlachos explained that the team measures success primarily by assets under management. So @axelar 's goal is to lock up 5% of the XRP circulating supply and @FlareNetworks 's goal is to lock up 5 Billion XRP. That's just two companies. Can you say supply shock?? pic.twitter.com/KBDahqMxfx — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) September 23, 2025 According to Vlachos, their goal is to reach $10 billion in XRP locked within the system. This figure translates to about 5% of the circulating supply. Similarly, Flare’s co-founder, Hugo Philion, set out his vision during an appearance on the Paul Barron Show. When asked about the expected growth of FXRP, Philion stated that he hopes to see 5 billion XRP secured on the Flare network by mid-2026. Combined, the objectives from both projects amount to roughly 8 billion tokens, which equate to approximately 13% of the current circulating supply. Current Progress Toward the Targets While the long-term goals are substantial, the actual progress so far is modest. Data shows that the mXRP product, which was formally launched at XRP Seoul 2025, currently holds about 3.851 million XRP. Of this amount, 2.786 million resides on the EVM Sidechain and the remainder on the XRP Ledger. When compared with the $10 billion target, this represents only about 0.006% of the total circulating supply. Nonetheless, since mXRP has only recently gone live, advocates argue that the project still has significant time to expand. Shrinking Exchange Reserves DAI’s warning about a possible supply crunch comes at a time when XRP balances on major exchanges appear to be decreasing sharply. Coinbase provides one example. In June, the exchange held around 970 million XRP spread across 52 cold wallets. By September 20, this figure had dropped dramatically to just 32 million XRP in two wallets. The sudden reduction has raised questions within the community, though Coinbase has not offered any public explanation for the shift. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Concentration of XRP Holdings Beyond exchange balances, a large proportion of XRP is already locked or controlled by key entities. Ripple retains control over 37.3 billion XRP in escrow and an additional 3.5 billion in liquid form. Co-founder Chris Larsen holds 2.3 billion, while Arthur Britto is estimated to control about 1.3 billion. Altogether, these allocations account for nearly 44.4% of the total token supply. Institutional interest is also beginning to emerge. For instance, Purpose ETF has disclosed holdings of 29.6 million XRP, while Canadian firm 3iQ manages approximately 45 million. Analyst 24HrsCrypto recently estimated that retail investors may collectively own no more than 15% of the circulating supply. According to 24HrsCrypto , the market could see even greater supply reductions once large financial institutions enter the space. Banks such as JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs are frequently mentioned as potential future participants. In addition, speculation continues about the possible approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds later this year, which could result in further tokens being moved into long-term storage. Although Axelar’s and Flare’s current holdings remain small relative to their ambitious goals, their stated objectives combined with declining exchange balances and institutional accumulation have intensified community discussions about a potential supply squeeze. If the projects achieve their targets, as much as 13% of circulating XRP could be removed from open markets, significantly reshaping the asset’s liquidity profile.

Now it says batteries have to follow. On Wednesday, during an auto industry event in Milan, Alfredo, the company’s European adviser, made it clear: if BYD is serious about making EVs locally, it can’t keep flying batteries in from China. The company’s factory in Hungary is almost ready and should start running by the end of this year. A second plant in Turkey is set for 2026. These two alone will give BYD the capacity to build about 500,000 cars a year in Europe. That’s a huge change from where the company started, which is with selling only electric cars in Europe. Now it’s adding plug-in hybrids to the mix, because European buyers seem to like the flexibility. BYD lays out the options for its next big move Alfredo said the company hasn’t decided what comes next. It’s weighing two options: a third car plant or its first battery facility in the region. Either way, BYD is not slowing down. “It does not make sense to invest in car assembly but bring batteries from China,” he told the audience in Milan. “Several factors come into play when choosing a new location,” Alfredo said , pointing to things like energy prices. “Energy cost is objectively one of the most important competitiveness factors,” he added, since both types of factories use a ton of electricity. Right now, the focus is on getting Hungary’s plant running at full speed. But BYD is already talking to governments across Europe about where it might set up its next base. The company says it wants all the EVs it sells in Europe to be built in Europe by 2027. That goal is meant to help the company avoid EU import tariffs. And for now, plug-in hybrids will likely dominate sales, according to Stella, the company’s EVP. Fully electric models are still part of the plan, but BYD sees hybrids as the near-term money maker. On top of all that, Alfredo had something to say about Warren Buffett. Last month, Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, finished selling its full stake in BYD after 17 years. Some thought that move meant he was losing trust in the company. Alfredo wasn’t having it. “Buffett made a profit of 20 times the capital he invested. He did very well to do what he did,” he said. “We’ve been extremely glad to have had Buffett, but the fact that he monetised his position is exactly what Berkshire Hathaway does for a living: buying, earning and selling.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|BYD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-24 23:41:57

However, the crypto community pushed back against his remarks, with many arguing that his analysis relied too heavily on short-term data. BTC Down 20% against Gold The economist dismissed Bitcoin in a September 24 post on X, stating it is “not living up to its hype.” He pointed out that the cryptocurrency has dropped 20% against gold since its August peak, a fall that he said means it’s in bear market territory. Schiff added that since the crypto asset is promoted as “digital gold,” the 20% drop terms is comparatively more than the 10% decline in dollar terms. Bitcoin recently experienced a sharp correction that dragged it more than 8% down from its all-time high of $123,800 on August 13 to a recent 13-day low of $112,200 on September 22. On the other hand, gold has continued setting fresh highs this year, climbing more than 11% over the past month. This isn’t the first time Schiff has made such claims. A few days ago, he predicted that the metal’s steady strength could set the stage for a breakout while it’s counterpart continues to slip. His view is supported by analyst Stockmoney Lizards, who pointed to a bearish rising wedge in the leading cryptocurrency’s pattern. The latter’s chart shows $112,000 as the immediate support level, with $110,000 identified as the critical threshold, which means that a break below that point could signal a deeper decline. Crypto Community Fires Back Crypto supporters have rejected Schiff’s bearish outlook, with people accusing him of not factoring in the digital asset’s long-term dominance. Some claimed he is “moving the goalposts” by measuring Bitcoin in gold, pointing out that the cryptocurrency is still up triple digits against the metal over the past five years. Others dismissed his argument that a 20% decline constituted a bear market, saying that “in crypto, calling a 20% dip a ‘bear market’ is like calling a drizzle a flood.” Another X user highlighted the leading digital asset’s long-term dominance, noting that over the past decade, gold priced in Bitcoin has collapsed by 99.3%, dropping from about 4.84 BTC per ounce in 2015 to just 0.033 BTC today. The 62-year-old has remained relentless in his bearish stance. According to the artificial intelligence platform Grok, he has made 237 separate predictions since 2011 forecasting Bitcoin’s crash, collapse, or eventual worthlessness.

Recently, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin underscored a critical point: safety is the absolute top priority for this pivotal network enhancement. This isn’t just about speed; it’s about building a robust and secure foundation for the decentralized world. Understanding the significance of the Fusaka upgrade helps us appreciate the meticulous planning behind Ethereum’s evolution. Why is the Fusaka Upgrade So Important for Ethereum? The Ethereum network is constantly evolving to meet the demands of a growing ecosystem. The Fusaka upgrade represents a significant step forward, primarily focusing on enhancing scalability and security. Buterin’s emphasis on safety highlights the careful approach core developers are taking to ensure the network remains resilient. At the core of this upgrade is a feature called PeerDAS. This technical innovation is designed to revolutionize how nodes interact with blockchain data. It’s not just a minor tweak; it’s essential infrastructure for the long-term health of Ethereum. Enhanced Scalability: PeerDAS will enable the network to handle more transactions efficiently. Improved Security: Nodes can verify and reconstruct blocks without needing to store all data, reducing the burden on individual participants. Future-Proofing: This feature is crucial for both Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling solutions, paving the way for broader adoption. Understanding PeerDAS: A Glimpse into Scalability What exactly is PeerDAS, and why is it so vital? PeerDAS, short for “Peer Data Availability Sampling,” allows Ethereum nodes to check if all data for a block is available, even if they don’t download the entire block themselves. Think of it like a smart sampling method. Traditionally, nodes would need to store every piece of data to ensure the network’s integrity. However, as Ethereum scales, this becomes increasingly impractical. PeerDAS addresses this by: Enabling light clients to participate more effectively. Reducing the hardware requirements for running a node. Ultimately supporting a more decentralized and robust network. This mechanism is a game-changer for how Ethereum manages its ever-increasing data load, directly contributing to the success of the Fusaka upgrade . Navigating the Blob Expansion: A Conservative Approach Another key aspect of the Fusaka upgrade involves increasing the number of “blobs.” Blobs are essentially temporary data packets designed to hold transaction data for Layer 2 rollups. They are crucial for improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these scaling solutions. Buterin stated that the number of blobs will be increased “conservatively at first.” This cautious approach underscores the commitment to safety. Rushing to expand blob capacity could introduce unforeseen risks, potentially compromising network stability. The gradual increase allows developers to: Monitor network performance in real-time. Address any potential bottlenecks or vulnerabilities. Ensure a smooth and secure transition for the entire ecosystem. This careful expansion is a testament to the development team’s dedication to making the Fusaka upgrade a success without compromising Ethereum’s foundational security. What Challenges Does the Fusaka Upgrade Address? The Fusaka upgrade is designed to tackle some of Ethereum’s most pressing challenges head-on. As the network grows, issues like transaction costs, processing speed, and data storage become more pronounced. This upgrade directly targets these areas. By implementing PeerDAS and carefully expanding blob capacity, Ethereum aims to: Reduce Transaction Fees: More efficient data handling can lead to lower gas costs for users. Increase Throughput: The network will be able to process a higher volume of transactions per second. Enhance Decentralization: Lower hardware requirements for nodes make it easier for more individuals to participate, strengthening the network’s decentralized nature. These improvements are not just technical advancements; they translate directly into a better user experience and a more accessible blockchain for everyone. The Road Ahead: Fusaka Upgrade Timeline and Impact Ethereum core developers have set a tentative date of December 3 for the Fusaka upgrade . While dates in blockchain development can sometimes shift, this target provides a clear indication of the project’s momentum. The successful deployment of the Fusaka upgrade will have far-reaching implications: It will solidify Ethereum’s position as a leading blockchain for decentralized applications. It will accelerate the adoption of Layer 2 solutions, making Ethereum more practical for everyday use. It reinforces the network’s commitment to continuous improvement and robust security. This upgrade isn’t just another technical milestone; it’s a foundational step towards a more scalable, secure, and user-friendly Ethereum ecosystem. In conclusion, Vitalik Buterin’s unwavering focus on safety for the Fusaka upgrade underscores Ethereum’s commitment to building a resilient and future-proof blockchain. With innovations like PeerDAS and a conservative approach to blob expansion, the upgrade promises to significantly enhance scalability, security, and decentralization. As the tentative December 3rd date approaches, the crypto community eagerly anticipates the positive impact this pivotal upgrade will have on Ethereum’s journey towards mass adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Fusaka upgrade? The Fusaka upgrade is an upcoming enhancement to the Ethereum network, primarily focused on improving scalability and security through features like PeerDAS and an increase in data blobs. Who is Vitalik Buterin, and what is his role in the Fusaka upgrade? Vitalik Buterin is the co-founder of Ethereum. He has emphasized that safety is the top priority for the Fusaka upgrade, guiding its development philosophy. What is PeerDAS, and how does it relate to the Fusaka upgrade?

This dramatic shakeout has left investors searching for opportunities amid the chaos, with many turning to best crypto presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as potential havens from mainstream market volatility. Market analysts suggest this liquidation event could mark a crucial reset point for the broader crypto ecosystem. Liquidation Tsunami Rocks Bitcoin Markets The September 2025 crypto market downturn began when more than $1.7 billion worth of leveraged positions were closed during a single 24-hour period. Bitcoin price reached $111,800 during the liquidation period, but it now trades at $112,863. Major exchanges experienced their largest-ever market collapse due to massive leverage liquidations, which reached unprecedented levels. The crypto market experienced its fourth-largest long liquidation in 2025 on Monday when Bitcoin prices reached their lowest point and $1.6 billion worth of leveraged positions got wiped out. The system accumulated dangerous speculative amounts which this data demonstrates. The exchange data shows that $1.6 billion worth of liquidated positions were long bets which indicates most traders held optimistic views about price increases. The market became exposed to massive liquidation waves because traders maintained excessive bullish positions until essential support levels failed. Major market cycles follow this specific pattern. Market euphoria leads to excessive leverage which creates conditions for price drops to trigger massive liquidation waves that exceed their initial causes. Technical Analysis Points to Critical Juncture Bitcoin price has reached its support zone between $110K and $112K while liquidation spikes indicate intense market volatility. Technical experts monitor these specific price points because they could serve as triggers for upcoming market trends. The 30-day volatility of BTC decreased to 1.33% which approaches its yearly minimum value just like the August beginning. The current market situation holds essential value for traders because this compression pattern typically leads to explosive price movements in any direction. The liquidation data shows that excessive leveraged positions have been removed from the market which might establish better technical market conditions. Market structure experts believe this type of market reset creates essential moments for crypto market cycles to shift direction. The liquidation event showed institutional-grade selling activity while professional investors started buying at lower price points. Major market bottoms show themselves through the distinct behavior of retail investors who panic while professional traders seek opportunities. Best Crypto Presale Projects Gain Attention As mainstream cryptocurrency markets face turbulence, investor interest in best crypto presale opportunities has surged. The cryptocurrency market in 2025 finds itself at a pivotal juncture, with investors increasingly focused on finding the best crypto presales. MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as a standout opportunity during this market reset. While Bitcoin and major altcoins face liquidation pressure, presale projects offer insulation from margin trading volatility that has plagued established markets. The appeal of presale investments during market shakeouts is straightforward. These projects aren’t subject to the leverage-driven volatility affecting exchange-traded assets. Additionally, early-stage pricing often provides better risk-reward profiles than buying established coins at elevated levels. Professional investors increasingly view presale opportunities as portfolio diversification tools. During periods of mainstream market stress, these alternative investments can provide uncorrelated returns that smooth overall portfolio performance. Hidden Gems Emerge from Market Chaos Investors seeking to uncover hidden gems should examine market disruptions, as they often generate the most promising investment opportunities. The market currently supports projects that integrate new technology with dedicated communities and established listing strategies. The current market situation favors projects with solid fundamentals over those based solely on speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE presents itself as a hidden investment opportunity that matches the criteria of emerging projects. The current market instability allows smart investors to identify new breakthrough projects which traders overlook while monitoring Bitcoin technical indicators and liquidation events. The project launch date matches the current market conditions. The market shift toward stable assets attracts institutional investors who support community-based projects that demonstrate practical uses. The market transition toward fundamental value discovery benefits MAGACOIN FINANCE because it moves away from speculative price movements. Quality projects find their best entry points during major market downturns which early-stage investors understand. The current market volatility presents an excellent chance for investors who want to move past surface-level price movements. Market Reset Creates Strategic Opportunities The $1.8 billion liquidation event demonstrates both the dangers and the resilience of the crypto market in the face of challenges. The event serves as a warning to investors about the risks of excessive leverage in their trading activities. The market will enter a new expansion period after this final period of market adjustment, according to some market participants. The professional investment community views this liquidation event as a necessary step to clean up the market. The removal of excessive speculation has created a more favorable environment for sustained market growth. The current market conditions support projects which deliver practical value and maintain active community involvement. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the best crypto presale investment because it allows users to access explosive market potential without facing the leverage-related dangers that have destroyed overleveraged positions. The fundamental elements of crypto adoption continue to advance despite short-term market price swings. The development of institutional infrastructure, alongside improved global regulatory frameworks and practical blockchain solutions in real-world applications, continues to advance. The fundamental growth factors operate independently of market price movements to drive long-term expansion. Investment Strategy During Market Uncertainty Experienced crypto investors capitalize on market shakeouts as an entry point, rather than rushing to sell their holdings. The current market situation favors investors who plan their moves instead of making impulsive trades. The strategic exposure of MAGACOIN FINANCE as a best crypto presale project enables investors to participate in the market. Strategic portfolio management through diversified investments in various project types and market capitalizations enables better navigation of market volatility. The technical challenges faced by Bitcoin and major altcoins create presale investment opportunities that provide distinct risk and reward dynamics for portfolio growth. Professional traders understand that liquidation events require them to stay patient, as markets tend to swing excessively in both positive and negative directions. The market tends to make excessive movements in both positive and negative directions which professional traders use to their advantage when others lose control. Conclusion The $1.8 billion liquidation event marks a significant reset point for cryptocurrency markets. While short-term volatility creates challenges, it also generates opportunities for strategic investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE and similar best crypto presale projects offer compelling alternatives to mainstream market exposure during uncertain times. Market cycles consistently reward those who position early in quality projects rather than chasing momentum in overvalued assets. The current shakeout creates exactly these types of opportunities for discerning investors willing to look beyond immediate headline volatility.

The Numbers Behind the Price Target,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-to-1-the-numbers-behind-the-price-target/,"The idea of Shiba Inu (SHIB) reaching a value of $1 continues to circulate within the crypto community, but closer examination of the numbers reveals that the target is largely unrealistic under current conditions. While some community leaders and market commentators maintain optimism, the scale of SHIB’s supply and current burn rates present significant obstacles. Community Sentiment and Predictions Price projections for SHIB vary widely, ranging from modest targets of $0.0001 to more ambitious levels such as $0.001 . The most extreme prediction, $1 per token, remains the most controversial. Supporters argue that strong utility growth combined with aggressive token reduction strategies could make the goal achievable. Lucie, Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, previously referenced external analysis suggesting that expanded adoption and accelerated burns could, in theory, support such a valuation. Why the $1 Target Is Unlikely The primary challenge is SHIB’s vast supply. Current data places the circulating supply at approximately 589.24 trillion tokens. With SHIB trading at $0.00001227, the token’s market capitalization sits around $7.14 billion. To reach $1, the price would need to climb more than 8 million percent, creating a market capitalization of roughly $589 trillion. For perspective, that figure is several times larger than the global economy and far beyond the entire cryptocurrency sector’s combined valuation, which is estimated at about $4 trillion. This mathematical reality underscores why analysts remain skeptical that SHIB can achieve a $1 price point without extreme changes in supply dynamics. Token Burn Efforts Shiba Inu has attempted to address the supply issue through token burns. Soon after its launch, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin removed approximately 410 trillion SHIB from circulation, reducing the total supply from one quadrillion to roughly 590 trillion. Since then, the community has continued to push for ongoing burns as a price support mechanism. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In practice, however, the burn rate has slowed. Monthly reductions have ranged between 13 million and 2.31 billion tokens, with daily activity often registering in the hundreds of thousands. At the current pace, it would take decades to bring the supply down to the estimated 7 billion tokens needed to support a $1 price with today’s market capitalization. Additional supply control efforts have come through Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain. The network converts part of its gas fees into SHIB and directs them to a burn wallet. Since its introduction in August 2023 , Shibarium has removed billions of tokens from circulation. However, Shibarium’s impact depends on the level of activity on the network. Transaction volumes have recently fallen to around 20,460 per day, a sharp drop compared to peaks of over 4 million daily transactions earlier in the year. This decline limits the scale of SHIB reductions that can be achieved through the mechanism. The $1 dream remains a central talking point for many SHIB enthusiasts, but the mathematics demonstrate that such a price level is not feasible without extraordinary supply cuts and broader adoption of Shibarium or other burn mechanisms. While community-driven burns and utility expansion efforts provide long-term potential, the gap between current realities and the $1 target is significant.

Drawing on historical price patterns and critical support levels, the analyst suggests that XRP could be on track for either a slightly conservative surge toward $9.6 or an explosive rally to $33. XRP Price Retest Signals Path Toward $9.6 In his post released on X social media, Egrag Crypto highlights XRP’s market behavior during the 2021 cycle, particularly the cryptocurrency’s interaction with the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and how it has played a role in fueling massive gains. At the time, XRP faced one of its most turbulent periods in its history. Related Reading: 8-Year Accumulation Phase Could Catapult XRP Price To $6 The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple had triggered a sharp drop, pushing the XRP price below the 21 EMA. This move disrupted the bullish structure that had supported XRP in earlier rallies, spreading uncertainty and fear across the market. However, XRP eventually managed to reclaim the 21 EMA and hold it as a critical support level. The chart analysis shows that after the cryptocurrency executed a successful retest, it staged a powerful rebound, driving its price up by approximately 414%. Applying this same percentage gain to XRP’s current market structure, the analyst presents his first bull rally scenario, projecting targets that point to a peak around $ 9.60. His chart analysis reveals that the current market setup resembles the key conditions observed in 2021, particularly with XRP’s recent retest of the 21 EMA on June 9 this year. The Altcoin Faces Potential Moonshot To $33 Egrag Crypto’s second scenario for the XRP price outlook is modeled after its explosive rally during the 2017 cycle, when the 21 EMA acted as a powerful launchpad for growth. At the time, XRP bounced off this key support level twice, paving the way for a remarkable 1,610% rally. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Major XRP Warning: Last Chance To Get In As Accumulation Balloons This breakout marked one of the most defining moments in XRP’s history, propelling the asset from sub-dollar levels to a fresh ATH around $3.84 at the peak of that bull cycle. If XRP repeats the 2021 cycle dynamics in 2025, Egrag Crypto forecasts that the measured move points to another 1,610% increase, potentially pushing the price to a more ambitious target of $33. Such a rally would represent one of the strongest performances in XRP’s history, firmly establishing it as a standout asset in the market. With the US SEC lawsuit finally concluded and XRP completing its third retest of the 21 EMA this year, the conditions are aligning for a potential surge toward $9.6 or $33. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.87, having declined in the past week by approximately 5%.

Recent proposals suggest that digital asset platforms operating in the country will soon face mandatory Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing requirements. This move signals a growing global trend towards establishing clear rules for the rapidly evolving digital finance sector. Why is Australia Embracing Mandatory Digital Asset Licensing? The Australian government’s draft regulation, as reported by Yahoo Finance, aims to bring much-needed clarity and protection to the digital asset space. The primary goal is to safeguard consumers and foster market integrity. Without proper oversight, the risks of fraud, scams, and market manipulation can be higher, eroding public trust in digital assets. This initiative seeks to level the playing field, ensuring that all platforms adhere to a baseline of operational excellence and accountability. It’s about creating a secure environment where innovation can still thrive, but not at the expense of user safety. Key Requirements for Digital Asset Platforms The proposed framework outlines several crucial obligations for platforms dealing with digital assets. These are designed to ensure transparency, security, and consumer recourse: Financial Services License: Platforms will need to obtain a specific financial services license, aligning them with traditional financial institutions. This ensures they meet stringent regulatory standards. Dispute Resolution System: A robust system for resolving customer complaints and disputes will be mandatory. This gives users a clear path to address issues, enhancing consumer protection. Minimum Standards for Custody: Platforms holding customer digital assets must meet specific standards for secure custody. This protects users’ funds from hacks, theft, and mismanagement. Payment Standards: Requirements for payment processes will be introduced, aiming to ensure efficient and secure transactions. This builds confidence in the operational reliability of these platforms. What are the Benefits of Robust Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing? While some in the crypto community might view regulation with skepticism, there are significant advantages to a well-structured regulatory framework. Firstly, it can dramatically boost investor confidence. Knowing that platforms are licensed and subject to oversight can encourage more mainstream adoption and institutional investment. Moreover, it helps in combating illicit activities. By requiring platforms to identify their clients and monitor transactions, the new rules can make it harder for bad actors to use digital assets for money laundering or terrorist financing. This ultimately strengthens the reputation of the entire digital asset industry. Navigating the Challenges of Digital Asset Licensing Of course, implementing such comprehensive regulations is not without its challenges. Smaller platforms and startups might face increased compliance costs, potentially hindering their ability to compete. There’s also the delicate balance of fostering innovation versus imposing overly restrictive rules. Regulators must work closely with the industry to ensure the framework is practical and forward-looking. Another challenge is the dynamic nature of digital assets themselves. The technology evolves rapidly, and regulations must be flexible enough to adapt without becoming outdated too quickly. The success of Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing will depend on its ability to strike this balance. What Does This Mean for You, the Crypto User? For individuals trading or holding digital assets in Australia, these proposed changes are generally positive. They promise a safer and more transparent environment. You can expect platforms to be more accountable, with clearer avenues for support and dispute resolution. This shift could lead to a more stable and trustworthy market, encouraging broader participation. It’s an exciting time as Australia moves to solidify its position in the global digital economy, demonstrating a commitment to responsible growth in the crypto space. The framework for Australia’s Digital Asset Licensing is a pivotal step. Conclusion: Australia’s proposal for mandatory digital asset licensing marks a pivotal moment for its crypto industry. By introducing clear regulatory standards, the nation aims to enhance consumer protection, foster market integrity, and build greater trust in digital assets. While challenges in implementation will exist, this proactive approach positions Australia as a leader in creating a secure and responsible environment for the future of finance. It’s a move that promises a more mature and reliable ecosystem for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of Australia’s proposed digital asset licensing? A1: The primary goal is to enhance consumer protection, ensure market integrity, and prevent illicit activities within the digital asset sector by requiring platforms to meet specific regulatory standards. Q2: Which platforms will be affected by these new regulations? A2: The regulations will primarily affect digital asset platforms operating in Australia that facilitate the exchange, custody, or payment services involving cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Q3: What are some key requirements for platforms under the new licensing? A3: Key requirements include obtaining a financial services license, establishing a robust dispute resolution system, and meeting minimum standards for the custody and payment processing of digital assets. Q4: How will these changes benefit crypto users in Australia? A4: Crypto users can expect a safer, more transparent, and trustworthy environment. Platforms will be more accountable, with clearer processes for dispute resolution and enhanced security for their digital assets. Q5: When are these new regulations expected to come into effect? A5: The proposal is currently in a draft stage. After public consultation and parliamentary processes, a final timeline for implementation will be announced.

To help investors navigate these emotional tides, we have the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This vital sentiment indicator currently stands at 44, signaling that “Fear” continues to hold sway among market participants. This reading, unchanged from the previous day, highlights ongoing caution. But what exactly does this specific number mean, and how can understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index empower your investment journey? What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Really Tell Us? Developed by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a clear snapshot of the market’s emotional temperature. It uses a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Intense anxiety, often leading to panic selling. 25-49: Fear – A cautious market, characterized by investor hesitation. 50-74: Greed – Growing optimism, typically fueled by rising prices. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoric sentiment, potentially indicating an overheated market. A score of 44 places us firmly in the “Fear” zone. This suggests that investors are generally wary, possibly holding back on new purchases or even considering selling due to concerns about potential losses. Recognizing this collective sentiment is crucial for making more objective investment decisions, rather than being swept away by market emotions. Unpacking the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: The Factors at Play The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s a sophisticated calculation combining six distinct market factors, each contributing to the final score: Volatility (25%): Measures Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. High volatility often signals an uncertain market, driving the index towards “Fear.” Market Momentum/Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volume and momentum. Strong buying volume indicates greed; low volume during a downturn suggests fear. Social Media (15%): Scans crypto-related posts for sentiment. Negative chatter can push the index towards fear. Surveys (15%): Historically, these polls captured direct investor sentiment. (Currently paused but a key factor in its design). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s market cap share. Rising dominance often implies investors are seeking safety in BTC, reflecting broader market fear. Google Search Trends (10%): Examines search queries like “Bitcoin crash.” Spikes in such terms indicate growing retail investor fear. These components collectively paint a comprehensive picture of market psychology, informing the daily reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . Navigating the ‘Fear’ Territory: Investor Strategies and Challenges When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals “Fear,” it presents both challenges and potential opportunities. Many seasoned investors recall the wisdom: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” This suggests that periods of market fear could be prime moments for strategic accumulation. Potential Opportunities: For long-term investors, “Fear” territory can offer chances to acquire assets at reduced prices. Historically, significant value has been found when market sentiment is low, provided the underlying projects have strong fundamentals. Key Challenges: Investing during fearful times demands strong conviction. The emotional pressure to sell or avoid buying can be intense, especially if prices continue to decline. It’s vital to differentiate between short-term market noise and genuine shifts in fundamentals. Actionable Insight: Employing Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is a smart strategy during periods of fear. By investing a consistent amount at regular intervals, you average out your purchase price over time. This mitigates the impact of short-term volatility, allowing you to build positions steadily even when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests caution. Remember, emotional decisions rarely lead to optimal outcomes. The index serves as a guide, not a definitive trading command. Beyond the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Balanced Perspective While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers valuable insight into market sentiment, it is just one tool in your analytical arsenal. Relying solely on any single indicator can lead to incomplete conclusions. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by numerous factors, necessitating a holistic approach. Consider these additional elements when evaluating the market: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global inflation, interest rate policies, and geopolitical events profoundly affect investor risk appetite across all asset classes, including crypto. Regulatory Developments: New legislation or government stances on digital assets can significantly alter market sentiment and price trajectories. Technological Advancements: Innovations in blockchain technology, new project launches, or major network upgrades can generate positive sentiment and drive adoption. Fundamental Analysis: Thorough research into a crypto project’s utility, development team, tokenomics, and community remains critical for long-term investment success. By combining the sentiment from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with a broader understanding of market fundamentals and external influences, you can forge a more robust and resilient investment strategy. In conclusion, the current 44 reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals a period of caution and uncertainty in the crypto market. While “Fear” can be a challenging environment, it has historically presented opportunities for disciplined investors who look beyond short-term volatility. Use this index as a valuable guide, but always complement it with thorough research and a comprehensive understanding of the market’s diverse dynamics. Staying informed and making rational, rather than impulsive, decisions are your best assets in navigating the exciting, yet unpredictable, world of cryptocurrency.

For those of us tracking economic trends and their ripple effects on the cryptocurrency landscape, this movement is particularly noteworthy. It signals potential shifts that could influence everything from trade to digital asset valuations. What’s Behind the South Korean Won’s Recent Dip? On September 25, the South Korean won experienced a notable weakening, trading past 1,400 against the U.S. dollar. This marks the first time since August 1 that the currency has crossed this threshold, with the exchange rate settling around 1,401.98, according to data from TradingView. This movement isn’t just a number; it reflects underlying economic pressures that are impacting a major Asian economy. Such a shift often indicates a complex interplay of global and domestic factors. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone looking to make informed decisions in the current economic climate. Why is the South Korean Won Under Such Pressure? The recent depreciation of the South Korean won is not an isolated event. Several key factors are contributing to this trend: Aggressive U.S. Interest Rate Hikes: The U.S. Federal Reserve’s continued efforts to combat inflation by raising interest rates have significantly strengthened the U.S. dollar. This makes other currencies, including the won, relatively weaker. Global Economic Slowdown Fears: Concerns about a potential global recession are dampening demand for exports. As an export-driven economy, South Korea is particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in international trade. High Energy Import Costs: South Korea is a net importer of energy. Elevated global oil and gas prices mean the country needs more U.S. dollars to pay for these essential imports, increasing demand for USD and weakening the won. Domestic Economic Concerns: Local factors, such as persistent inflation and rising household debt, also contribute to economic uncertainty, which can put downward pressure on the national currency. These combined forces create a challenging environment for the South Korean won , making it susceptible to further volatility. How Does a Weaker South Korean Won Affect Crypto Investors? South Korea boasts one of the most active cryptocurrency markets globally. Therefore, a weakening South Korean won has direct implications for crypto investors in the region: Increased Cost of Stablecoins: For investors holding won, buying U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT or USDC becomes more expensive. This can affect trading strategies and hedging costs. Potential for Capital Flight: If local economic confidence erodes significantly, some investors might seek to move their assets out of the won into perceived safer havens, potentially including cryptocurrencies. However, this also carries risks. Reduced Purchasing Power: A weaker won means that Korean investors have less purchasing power when acquiring international crypto assets priced in USD or other stronger currencies. While a weaker currency can sometimes spur interest in alternative assets like crypto as a hedge, it also introduces additional layers of risk and complexity for investors. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the market. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for South Korean Won Holders In times of currency volatility, thoughtful planning and risk management become paramount. Here are some actionable insights for both traditional and crypto investors impacted by the movement of the South Korean won : Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider diversifying across different asset classes and geographies to mitigate risks associated with single-currency exposure. Monitor Global Indicators: Keep a close eye on global economic data, particularly U.S. inflation and interest rate decisions, as these significantly influence currency markets. Understand Stablecoin Mechanics: If you are a crypto investor, comprehend how stablecoins maintain their peg and the potential risks involved, especially during periods of high fiat currency volatility. Practice Prudent Risk Management: Avoid making impulsive decisions. Implement stop-loss orders, manage your position sizes, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Regularly consume reliable economic news and analysis. Knowledge is your best defense against market surprises. The financial landscape is always evolving, and being prepared helps investors adapt to changing conditions. Conclusion: Vigilance in a Volatile World The recent weakening of the South Korean won past 1,400 against the U.S. dollar serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of global financial markets. From aggressive central bank policies to geopolitical tensions and energy prices, numerous factors influence currency valuations and, by extension, the broader investment landscape, including cryptocurrencies. For investors, particularly those in South Korea and those trading with the won, vigilance and a clear understanding of these economic forces are essential. While challenges exist, informed decision-making and a well-thought-out strategy can help navigate these turbulent waters. Staying updated on economic trends and their potential impact on both traditional and digital assets remains a top priority. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when a currency ‘weakens’ against another? When a currency weakens, it means you need more units of that currency to buy one unit of another currency. For example, if the South Korean won weakens against the U.S. dollar, it takes more won to buy one dollar. Q2: How do U.S. interest rate hikes affect the South Korean won? Higher U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors seeking higher returns. This increases demand for the U.S. dollar, causing it to strengthen and other currencies, like the won, to weaken. Q3: Is a weaker South Korean won always bad for the economy? Not necessarily. While it makes imports more expensive, a weaker won can make a country’s exports more competitive on the global market, potentially boosting export-oriented industries. Q4: Should crypto investors in South Korea be concerned about the won’s depreciation? They should be aware. A weaker won increases the cost of acquiring U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and international crypto assets. It also adds a layer of currency risk to their portfolio, making careful risk management even more important. Q5: What is TradingView and why is it mentioned? TradingView is a popular charting platform and social network for traders and investors. It’s mentioned as the source of the exchange rate data, lending credibility and transparency to the reported figures. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

This movement signals a potentially exciting shift in the market dynamics, drawing attention to altcoins and their performance against Bitcoin. For many crypto enthusiasts, this rise in the Altcoin Season Index is a compelling indicator worth watching closely. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Mean? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for anyone tracking the broader crypto market. Developed by CoinMarketCap, this index serves as a barometer for altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. It helps us gauge whether the market sentiment favors altcoins or if Bitcoin continues to dominate. Here’s how the Altcoin Season Index is calculated: It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Stablecoins and wrapped coins are intentionally excluded from this calculation to provide a clearer picture of genuine market movements. The performance of these top 100 coins is measured against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. An altcoin season is officially declared when 75% of these top coins outperform Bitcoin within that 90-day window. Conversely, if Bitcoin is the dominant performer, it’s considered a Bitcoin season. A reading closer to 100 on the Altcoin Season Index indicates a stronger, more pronounced altcoin season. Is a Full-Blown Altcoin Season on the Horizon? With the Altcoin Season Index now standing at 72, many are wondering if we are on the cusp of a full-fledged altcoin season. While 72 is an impressive figure and a strong indicator of growing altcoin strength, it’s just shy of the 75-point threshold required for an official declaration. However, this upward trend is undeniably positive for altcoin investors. This recent four-point increase suggests a noticeable shift in capital flows and investor interest. People are actively exploring opportunities beyond Bitcoin, indicating a broadening of the market. This momentum could easily push the index past the 75-mark, potentially ushering in a period where many altcoins see significant gains. Therefore, staying informed about the Altcoin Season Index becomes even more vital. Navigating the Potential Altcoin Season: Benefits and Challenges A rising Altcoin Season Index brings both exciting opportunities and inherent risks for investors. Understanding these aspects is key to making informed decisions in a dynamic market. Potential Benefits: Higher Returns: Altcoins often exhibit higher volatility and, consequently, can offer greater percentage gains compared to Bitcoin during an altcoin season. Diversification: Investing in a variety of altcoins can help diversify a crypto portfolio, reducing reliance on a single asset. Innovation Exposure: Many altcoins represent groundbreaking technologies and use cases, offering investors a chance to support and profit from future innovations. Potential Challenges: Increased Volatility: While offering higher returns, altcoins are also prone to more significant price swings, leading to higher risk. Research Intensive: Identifying promising altcoins requires extensive research into their utility, team, tokenomics, and community support. Liquidity Issues: Some smaller altcoins might have lower liquidity, making it harder to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. The current movement of the Altcoin Season Index highlights the need for a balanced approach. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts As the Altcoin Season Index climbs, here are some actionable insights for navigating the evolving crypto landscape: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on hype. Thoroughly research any altcoin before committing capital. Understand its whitepaper, development team, and community. Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your funds into one altcoin, consider spreading your investments across several promising projects. This strategy helps mitigate risk. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear entry and exit strategies, and consider using stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, technical analysis, and, of course, the Altcoin Season Index itself. Market conditions can change rapidly. Even with a positive trend in the index, a disciplined approach remains paramount for long-term success in the crypto space. The recent rise in the Altcoin Season Index to 72 is undoubtedly a thrilling development for the cryptocurrency market. It suggests a potential shift towards altcoin outperformance, offering exciting prospects for investors willing to explore beyond Bitcoin. While the 75% threshold for an official altcoin season is within reach, it’s crucial to approach this period with both enthusiasm and caution. Diligent research, strategic diversification, and robust risk management are your best allies in harnessing the potential of a burgeoning altcoin market. The journey ahead promises to be dynamic, and the Altcoin Season Index will continue to be a key guide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric created by CoinMarketCap that measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. How is an Altcoin Season officially declared? An Altcoin Season is declared if 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) outperform Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. What does a high Altcoin Season Index reading, like 72, imply? A high reading, such as 72, indicates that a significant majority of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. While not yet an official Altcoin Season (which requires 75), it suggests strong momentum and growing interest in altcoins. What’s the difference between an Altcoin Season and a Bitcoin Season? An Altcoin Season occurs when altcoins largely outperform Bitcoin. Conversely, a Bitcoin Season happens when Bitcoin’s performance surpasses that of most altcoins within the top 100. Should I invest in altcoins if the Altcoin Season Index is high? A high Altcoin Season Index can signal favorable conditions for altcoins, but it’s essential to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and manage risks effectively. Market conditions can change rapidly, so informed decisions are crucial. Did you find this article insightful?

52219401,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84318,1758762018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Repeats Technical Cycle, Analyst Sets Bullish Price Target",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-repeats-technical-cycle-analyst-sets-bullish-price-target/,"XRP has recently declined below the $3 threshold, now trading near $2.8 in line with the broader weakness across the cryptocurrency market. Despite this pullback, several analysts remain optimistic about its long-term trajectory. Among them, EGRAG Crypto has highlighted recurring historical price structures that could guide XRP’s next major movement. Based on past cycles, he projects two potential targets: $9.6 or $33, depending on how current conditions unfold. Historical Performance and Key Levels EGRAG’s assessment is based on the two-week chart, which tracks XRP’s performance from 2014 to date. His analysis focuses on the 21-period exponential moving average (EMA), which has repeatedly acted as a pivotal support level. #XRP – 2 Scenarios Based on Historical Price Action ($9.6 – $33): If you're not yet familiar with the most likely outcomes, it might be time to catch up! Here’s a closer look at two pivotal cycles in #XRP 's history. 21 EMA Historical Support Levels 2017 Cycle: #XRP … pic.twitter.com/oE1MAMhsXA — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 23, 2025 In the 2017 cycle, XRP tested the 21 EMA twice before launching into a rapid upward trend. That sequence culminated in a gain of approximately 1,610%, bringing the token to around $3.31 by January 2018. By contrast, the 2021 cycle unfolded differently due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple . In December 2020, XRP briefly lost support at the 21 EMA, but once the price reclaimed and retested the level, it advanced by about 414%, reaching close to $1.96 in April 2021. Current Setup and Possible Long-Term Scenarios EGRAG points out that June 2025 marked another retest of the 21 EMA, when XRP fell to roughly $1.9. He argues that this event could be the start of a major upward move similar to those seen in previous cycles. From this point, two outcomes appear likely. If conditions mirror the 2017 pattern, XRP could record another 1,610% increase, driving prices toward $33 . Alternatively, if market behavior resembles the 2021 cycle, the token could rise by about 414%, leading to a price near $9.6. In either case, the assumption is that the rally would begin from the $1.9 level observed during the June retest. At present, XRP is trading around $2.95, still facing resistance at $3.31, which coincides with its 2017 peak. Volume data during these retests suggests that investor participation is strong, reinforcing the importance of these price zones for determining the next trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short-Term Market Outlook While EGRAG emphasizes long-term potential, other analysts are monitoring near-term behavior. Market commentator DustyBC has described XRP’s four-hour chart as stagnant, suggesting that sideways trading may continue until the asset breaks above a defined buying zone. He recommends patience, noting that this strategy helps avoid premature entries. Conversely, Casi Trades holds a more bullish short-term view. She recently identified a double-bottom formation near $2.70 following a sharp drop that she attributes to excessive leverage rather than sustained selling. Since that decline, XRP has reclaimed the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement at $2.79, which is now serving as support. Casi anticipates a potential retest of $2.79, combined with a bullish divergence on the relative strength index. If confirmed, this could trigger a Wave 3 rally with projected targets at $4.00 and $4.40, aligning with the 2.618 and 3.618 Fibonacci extension levels. However, she cautions that a breakdown below $2.70 would undermine this setup and could redirect the price toward $2.58, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. XRP’s price action remains closely tied to historical patterns and key support levels. While long-term projections suggest potential targets of $9.6 or $33, short-term movement will depend on whether the token maintains critical support zones and overcomes near-term resistance.

However, it remains above the 200-day moving average at $0.735, signaling that while sellers dominate in the short and medium term, the longer trend is still supported. ADA's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Daily charts show oversold signals with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 36.6, a negative Commodity Channel Index (CCI), and near-zero Stochastic RSI levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Soak Up Trillions From China And Russia, Billionaire Predicts Despite this, downside pressure persists, with ADA likely consolidating between $0.768 and $0.790 in the coming sessions. Momentum indicators remain neutral, suggesting that any rebound could be limited unless buying volume strengthens. Cardano ETF Optimism and Roadmap Fuel Longer-Term Outlook While ADA struggles in the near term, longer-term fundamentals look stronger. Odds for a Cardano-based ETF approval have surged to 9%, a development that could lift market sentiment and drive institutional adoption. The Cardano Foundation’s new roadmap also supports a bullish case, with significant funding allocated to decentralized finance (DeFi), governance, and ecosystem growth. Whale transactions have increased, and major firms like Reliance Global have added ADA to their treasuries, signaling growing institutional confidence. These developments could help ADA break above critical resistance at $0.868, the Ichimoku Kijun level, which analysts view as the threshold for confirming a rebound. Until then, traders may see sideways consolidation or slight downside risk. Short-Term Consolidation, Long-Term Potential According to market expert Anton Kharitonov of Traders Union, ADA remains technically vulnerable. “As long as Cardano trades below major resistance, the upside case lacks credibility,” he noted, adding that reclaiming $0.868 is essential for any sustainable rebound. For now, ADA’s immediate price corridor remains narrow, with a low probability of a breakout in the next five days. However, the long-term picture is brighter, with forecasts suggesting a potential climb toward $1.20–$1.38 within the next 6–12 months, supported by ETF optimism and institutional demand.

Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a prominent crypto analyst, drew attention to this, stating that $2.8 is now the most important support level for the digital asset. He attached a chart from Glassnode highlighting how XRP holders are distributed across various realized price ranges, with a particular concentration at the $2.80 level. $2.80 is the most important support level for $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/6sCz11GR91 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 23, 2025 Understanding the Chart Data The chart shared by Martinez displays XRP’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), partitioned at its all-time high . It illustrates how large portions of XRP holdings are associated with different historical price levels. The data reveals that more than 2.1 billion XRP, representing approximately 3.32% of the supply, is tied to $2.8. This makes that level a key zone of support where significant buying interest has been established. Considering the overall structure, the chart shows multiple points where XRP has notable concentrations of realized prices. These include areas around $0.33, $0.6, $1.64, $1.93, and other levels closer to $3. However, the $2.8 level stands out as one of the largest concentrations near the higher range, which indicates that many investors entered at this point. What the Analysis Suggests for XRP XRP is trading at $2.85 after bouncing off the $2.80 support. Holding above this level would signal strong support from existing holders and create a foundation for further advances . On the other hand, failure to defend this level could expose XRP to renewed selling pressure and potentially trigger a test of lower realized price zones. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The focus on realized price distribution offers a unique perspective because it measures actual positions taken by market participants rather than just speculative chart patterns. This allows for a clearer understanding of where major groups of investors may act, whether through buying to defend their entry levels or selling to limit losses. Possible Next Steps for XRP Should XRP sustain momentum above $2.8, attention may shift to the next significant resistance areas identified on the chart. These levels cluster around $2.95 and above $3, where another wave of historical entries exists. A move toward these prices would likely test the conviction of holders who entered near XRP’s prior peaks. Analysts have also drawn attention to XRP’s peak of $3.65, predicting double-digit targets if the asset can surpass this level . How the market reacts at these levels will provide further clarity on whether XRP can establish a stronger base for growth.

CFTC Launches Initiative For Tokenized Collateral & Stablecoins In Derivatives As revealed in a press release , Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham has enacted an initiative for the use of tokenized collateral in derivatives markets. Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency, are set to play a role in the effort. “The public has spoken: tokenized markets are here, and they are the future,” said Pham. “For years I have said that collateral management is the ‘killer app’ for stablecoins in markets.” The initiative is part of CFTC’s “ Crypto Sprint ” announced at the start of August. Pham introduced it to implement recommendations from the President’s Working Group report on digital assets. The push mirrors the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) “ Project Crypto .” The President’s Working Group report asked the CFTC to “provide guidance on the adoption of tokenized non-cash collateral as regulatory margin.” The latest move comes in response to this recommendation and also builds on the regulator’s Crypto CEO Forum held back in February 2025. The Acting Chairman noted: At our historic Crypto CEO Forum, we discussed how innovation and blockchain technology will drive progress in derivatives markets, especially for modernization of collateral management and greater capital efficiency. The regulator has invited interested stakeholders to provide written feedback and suggestions on its website regarding the use of stablecoins as collateral in derivatives markets by October 20th. “The CFTC continues to move full speed ahead at the cutting edge of responsible innovation, and I appreciate the support of our industry partners,” added Pham. Stablecoins have been enjoying capital inflows recently, with their combined market cap sitting at the $294 billion mark today, a new all-time high (ATH). Below is a chart from DeFiLlama that shows how the market cap of these cryptocurrencies has changed during the last few years. From the graph, it’s visible that stablecoins have been in a phase of growth since 2024, with inflows only accelerating recently. During the past week alone, the market cap of these fiat-tied tokens has increased by over $4 billion. In terms of the individual coins, Tether’s USDT continues to be the most dominant, with its market cap of $173 billion accounting for almost 59% of the sector. Circle’s USDC ranks second with a market cap of $73 billion, significantly below USDT, but nonetheless dominant in its own right considering its lead over the third largest stablecoin. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $112,800, down more than 3% over the last week.",Stablecoin|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|CFTC|CFTC Stablecoins|Stablecoins|Stables,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-25 01:00:51
