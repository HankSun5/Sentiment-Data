This decision comes just 6 days before Gary Gensler, the commission‚Äôs chairman, leaves the agency. Per the filing from the commission, this delay is not a denial as it requires more time to consider the application. The US SEC Notification According to the notice shared by the market regulator, it chose to delay the approval or denial of this filing considering the key factors it has to consider. From the time the asset manager filed the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, the US SEC had an obligation by law to give its consideration within 45 days. The markets regulator filed the decision to delay this proposed rule change three days before the January 17 deadline. Following this delay, the US SEC said it has now fixed March 3, 2025, as the next tentative date to give its decision on the filing. ‚ÄúThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,‚Äù the SEC statement reads, adding that it is designating ‚ÄúMarch 3, 2025, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.‚Äù Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF Approval is Possible It is worth noting that the asset manager applied to list the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund in late November. After successfully operating a spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US, the asset manager chose to expand its supported crypto assets. Bitwise designed the 10 crypto index ETF to provide exposure to the biggest digital currencies by market capitalization. These assets include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Polkadot (DOT), and Uniswap (UNI). While uncertainty clouded approval prospects under outgoing Chairman Gary Gensler, there is reason to remain optimistic now. President-elect Donald Trump nominated Paul Atkins , a crypto-industry-backed candidate, to replace Gensler. With Atkins calling the shots, many industry proponents believe other crypto ETF products are possible. Other Crypto ETFs To Watch Besides the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF, other crypto ETF products like Solana and XRP ETF are also awaiting feedback from the US SEC. Judging by the emergence of Donald Trump, industry optimists believe other crypto ETF products might also be filed soon. In addition to the Solana and XRP funds, asset manager Canary Capital has also pushed for Litecoin and Hedera ETFs.

His comment comes amid the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Garlinghouse‚Äôs remarks highlight the growing frustration in the crypto industry, with many stakeholders demanding clearer regulations. There is a strong call for a shift away from the enforcement-heavy approach defining Gensler‚Äôs tenure. The Clash Between Ripple and the SEC Ripple and the SEC‚Äôs legal dispute traces back to December 2020, when the SEC accused Ripple of offering XRP as an unregistered security. In a landmark 2023 ruling, the court sided with Ripple, asserting that XRP sales to retail investors did not qualify as securities. However, the SEC is appealing this decision, setting the stage for a high-stakes legal showdown. In a recent post on X, Garlinghouse criticized Gensler‚Äôs approach, accusing him of doubling down on a failed strategy. Ripple‚Äôs legal team also expressed disappointment over the SEC‚Äôs refusal to extend the January 15 deadline for its appeal brief. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, slammed the agency‚Äôs decision as a misuse of taxpayer dollars while expressing confidence in Ripple‚Äôs legal position. Gensler‚Äôs Exit Sparks Hope for Clearer Crypto Regulations Gensler‚Äôs departure comes as concerns grow about the SEC‚Äôs tough approach. Many say the agency has been too harsh and lacks clear rules for crypto. In a recent CNBC interview, Gensler argued that all tokens, except Bitcoin, should be treated as securities. This is due to issues with anti-money laundering and other regulations. He said the crypto industry demands stricter oversight. This has left many in the industry hoping for fairer rules under new leadership as Gensler leaves office on January 20. There is a sense of cautious optimism within Ripple and the wider crypto community. Alderoty looks forward to working with new SEC leadership and is hopeful that the regulatory landscape will shift toward clearer guidelines for digital assets. Industry leaders also speculate that Gensler‚Äôs departure could lead to reforms that clarify token classifications and regulations more clearly. The Ripple Effect: Market Reactions and the Future of XRP Meanwhile, Ripple‚Äôs legal victories in the market have fueled optimism, with experts predicting a potential price surge for XRP. Analysts are even forecasting that the token could reach as high as $8 in the near future. The optimism surrounding XRP grows stronger with a massive $265 million transaction. This has sparked speculation about the token‚Äôs future trajectory. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.6, up by 4.60% in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data. As the legal fight goes on, the crypto industry feels more hopeful. JPMorgan analysts expect more interest in digital assets like XRP and Solana (SOL), with new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) coming soon. These changes, along with clearer rules, are boosting confidence in crypto‚Äôs future .

Earlier this month, the IRS was sued by Blockchain Association over the new reporting rule. Table of Contents New tax system IRS abolition IRS vs the crypto community New tax system The H.R. 25 bill, or The Fair Tax Act of 2025 , was introduced by Rep. Earl ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù Carter (R‚ÄìGA). The bill challenges the existing U.S. tax code and the taxation policy status quo and aims to promote freedom, fairness, and economic opportunity. The Fair Tax Act calls to repeal the income, payroll, estate, and gift taxes. Instead, the act proposes enacting the sales tax. The Fair Tax Act: ‚úÖAbolishes the IRS ‚úÖRepeals the Tax Code ‚úÖPuts American in charge of their tax rate ‚úÖForces illegal immigrants to pay taxes & more ‚Äì read hereüëá https://t.co/SjLO4RRaKR ‚Äî Buddy Carter (@RepBuddyCarter) January 10, 2025 According to the bill, the existing Federal income tax retards the economic growth and international competitiveness of the U.S., discourages small businesses and farms, and downgrades the standard of living of Americans, decreasing the savings and investment rates. On top of that, the bill indicates the harm of the existing unnecessary administrative and compliance cost pressure on individual and corporate taxpayers. Privacy violations and lack of transparency in taxation are other problems associated with the Federal income tax. According to the Fair Tax Act, the Social Security, Medicare payroll taxes, and self-employment taxes hurdles employment rates. The alternative proposed in the bill is a broad-based national sales tax on goods and services purchased for final consumption. The act proposes to tax all consumption of goods and services in the U.S. once, preventing double, multiple, and cascading taxation. According to the bill, it will facilitate savings and investment, improve the standard of living of Americans, help businesses, and undo all other evils associated with the actual tax system. Also, the Fair Tax Act provides notes on how the government should foster the change in the policy. IRS abolition One of the most radical changes proposed in the Fair Tax Act is the Internal Revenue Service abolition. The move is meant to get rid of the bureaucratic burdens on individual and business taxpayers. According to Carter, the tax system introduced in the legislation eliminates the need for the IRS. The taxes should be easy and transparent so that people will not need professional assistance to fill out their taxes. The bill is supported by a number of Republican congressmen, including Barry Loudermilk, Eric Burlison, John Carter, Scott Perry, John Rutherford, Warren Davidson, Andy Biggs, Dale Strong, Rich McCormick, Andy Harris, and Andrew Clyde. The latter noted that the act ‚Äúprovides a commonsense solution to eliminate the need for the weaponized IRS, simplify our tax code, and foster economic prosperity‚Äù. Rep. Strong adds that the proposed taxation system will make illegal immigrants pay taxes fairly. IRS vs the crypto community The IRS was sued over the new reporting rules introduced by the service the day the rules were introduced, i.e., on Dec. 28, 2024. The complaint is signed by several organizations, including Blockchain Association, Texas Blockchain Council, and DeFi Education Fund.

According to the new rules, DeFi platforms will be considered brokers. They will have to provide the transaction info and proceeds to the IRS until 2027. The complaint clears that DeFi platforms are not brokers, and that‚Äôs what makes them unique and innovative. As peer-to-peer systems, they don‚Äôt depend on brokers or any other intermediaries, so the IRS‚Äô new rules should not apply to them, but they do. The plaintiffs find the rules unconstitutional and harmful to American development and leadership in the crypto industry. They note that if the rules get into effect, this may impact many leading industry brands to find better jurisdictions instead of working in America. Considering this, the IRS abolition may be seen as a possibility to end the service‚Äôs attacks on the DeFi ecosystems. However, it is not clear yet if the Fair Tax Act of 2025 will be adopted. The history of the act began back in 1999. Will 2025 be a breakthrough year? We‚Äôll see.

Simultaneously, Filecoin‚Äôs price prediction becomes a hot topic, with debates on whether FIL can break past $10 by 2025. On the flip side, Web3Bay , also known as 3BAY, is transforming the traditional e-commerce arena dominated by platforms like Amazon by offering a decentralized solution that provides sellers with no setup fees, instant payouts, and access to a global market. Moreover, Web3Bay‚Äôs crypto presale has amassed over $660K, spotlighting the 3BAY token as a potentially profitable opportunity for early investors, anticipating a significant value increase at its launch. BNB Price Analysis: Crucial Levels and Market Trends BNB‚Äôs price movements are closely watched by traders, who analyze key Fibonacci levels and their impacts on the market. The $709.61 level acts as a possible support area, suggesting reversal points, while the $733.42 level indicates resistance where bullish momentum might slow. Volume increases near these levels show changes in market sentiment, with rising selling pressure as prices near resistance. BNB‚Äôs price movements near the $607.16 support area are critical, as historical interest here might signal either a rebound or a deeper price drop. Can FIL Reach Over $10 by 2025? Filecoin‚Äôs price prediction is increasingly discussed as the digital currency picks up speed, with predictions for potential highs through 2025. If positive trends continue, FIL might near the $10 mark, supported by innovations like the Filecoin Virtual Machine that enhance decentralized app functionality. Yet, obstacles from established providers and scalability issues might slow its growth. Technical analysis suggests FIL‚Äôs price could see a 35% rise to reach the $8.42 retracement level, with its future price also dependent on adoption rates and broader market conditions. Web3Bay Sets New E-commerce Standards‚Äî Early Backers Can Reap 6,430% ROI Web3Bay is reshaping online selling by offering a decentralized e-commerce platform that simplifies operations for entrepreneurs worldwide. Built on blockchain, it removes traditional barriers like setup fees and delayed payouts that burden platforms like Amazon. Sellers gain global reach through a secure, transparent ecosystem powered by the 3BAY token. This platform revolutionizes seller-buyer connections, providing tools that drive growth in an ever-changing digital economy. The 3BAY token ensures quick, affordable, and seamless transactions. Sellers benefit from its liquidity, instant payouts, and cross-chain capabilities, facilitating smooth international operations.

With over $660K raised in the ongoing presale and a current price of $0.0039675, early adopters stand to gain substantial returns. The launch price of $0.1959 represents a staggering 6,430% ROI. As more sellers join Web3Bay, demand for 3BAY is set to surge, offering significant profit potential for early participants. The Bottom Line In the recent market trends, Traders keep a keen eye on BNB‚Äôs price movements, where Fibonacci levels reveal potential market opportunities. Meanwhile, Filecoin‚Äôs price prediction also shows its potential in decentralized storage, anticipated to rise with technological advancements and increased adoption. However, Web3Bay is pioneering a new era in e-commerce. By enabling global sellers through no fees, immediate payouts, and enhanced blockchain functionality, it sets a new standard in decentralized marketplaces . With the ongoing crypto presale and the promising capabilities of the 3BAY token, early engagement could yield substantial investor gains as the market demand escalates.

A whale liquidated 10,070 ETH, resulting in an approximate loss of $1 million. The sell-off transpired as Ethereum‚Äôs price faltered in sustaining momentum, hovering around $3,280 during the transaction. Related Reading: Rebound Alert: US Bitcoin ETF Interest Picks Up Speed In 2025 A Whale‚Äôs Desperate Maneuver The decision to sell a large amount of ETH is notable. This particular whale knows the market well; it took out 24,029 ETH from Binance a few weeks ago, which is worth about $81 million. Even with this new deal, the whale still has 13,959 ETH, which is worth about $45 million. The speed with which this sell-off has been carried out suggests that there may be underlying factors influencing their strategy. Whales are dumping $ETH at a loss! 9 hours ago, 3 wallets(likely belonging to the same whale) sold 10,070 $ETH for 33M $DAI at $3,280, losing $1M. This whale withdrew 24,029 $ETH($81.3m) from #Binance via 10 new wallets 3 weeks ago and currently holds 13,959 $ETH($45.48M).‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/5lqFegRu3i ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 13, 2025 Bringing Down Market Sentiment The crypto market as a whole is unstable, and Ethereum‚Äôs price is following suit. The value of ETH has dropped by 2.50% in the last 24 hours, and it is now worth about $3,177. This drop is the lowest price level in a week and shows why investors are worried about their assets. The mood in the market is changing from excitement to caution as many traders get ready for more price retreats. The Broader Perspective There are other instances of this sell-off. Other prominent players in the Ethereum ecosystem are also unloading their holdings. As part of a systematic transfer strategy, TRON founder Justin Sun recently sent about $320 million in Ethereum to exchanges. These actions suggest that many whales are responding to market conditions by selling their holdings rather than holding onto them in anticipation of potential future gains. Analysts remain somewhat confident in spite of these sell-offs and the overall negative trend. Some predict that Ethereum might hit all-time highs‚Äîpossibly surpassing $10,000 by the middle of 2025‚Äîif market sentiment improves and selling pressure lessens. This optimistic outlook is contingent upon future developments and innovations within the Ethereum ecosystem.

However, analysts are now highlighting an intriguing forecast for the emerging RCO Finance. They believe that RCOF could jump from $0.05 to $1 soon, delivering impressive gains to investors who buy in now. Let‚Äôs examine the factors driving the new altcoin into the spotlight, which has overshadowed the price prospects for XRP and Cardano. Forget Cardano Price And Let RCO Finnace‚Äôs AI Make Profits For You Despite the Cardano price and XRP crossing a key level, RCO Finance (RCOF) appears primed for a significant rally, driven by increasing demand for its unique features designed to improve investors‚Äô trading experience. One of the features is the robo-advisor, an artificial intelligence-based service that distinguishes the platform from traditional decentralized finance platforms. The main advantage of the robo-advisor is thus its ability to analyze data and, given the obtained results, offer the best investment tips. It also offers automatic trading, adjusting investors‚Äô portfolios in real-time according to their risk preferences and financial goals. This allows investors to relax and be confident that their investments are actively managed without constant monitoring. Moreover, investor trust in RCO Finance has been reinforced by a thorough audit from SolidProof, a leading security firm. This audit confirms that the DeFi trading platform meets high-security standards, establishing it as a reliable option for investing in altcoins. With no KYC requirements, traders can engage with the platform without compromising their personal information. This feature protects your identity and simplifies the trading process, making it easier to get started without the usual bureaucratic hurdles.. Cardano Price RSI Signals Overbought Conditions, Analysts Warn The Cardano price has soared to its highest level in seven months, climbing over 40% in the last seven days. This surge is linked to founder Charles Hoskinson‚Äôs comments about potentially supporting U.S. crypto policies if Donald Trump is re-elected in 2025. Currently, the Cardano price is trading around $0.53. However, some analysts warn the market may be overheating, with a potential price drop on the horizon. The RSI for Cardano price is at 78.79 , its highest since December 2023, suggesting it may be overbought. This could lead to selling pressure as investors take profits, driving the Cardano price down and ultimately making RCOF surpass it in the DeFi market. XRP Poised To Hit $0.665 But Lawsuit Might Slows Its Growth Down Analysts still maintain an optimistic tone regarding the XRP price outlook, with some convinced it could pierce through the $0.7655 level. However, there is a significant concern regarding the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. SEC. The SEC has accused Ripple of raising over $1.3 billion without proper registration. An appeal of a 2023 ruling filed last month could delay a final decision and hinder the XRP price momentum. As a result, RCOF may be a more promising option in the current market rally. RCOF Presale Poised To Shatter Market Expectations With Cardano and XRP at a pivotal moment, major investors reportedly hedge their bets with RCO Finance (RCOF) . This trend is evident in the ongoing token presale, which has already raised over $4.5 million. As of November 3, RCOF is in its third presale stage, with a token price of $0.0559 . Those purchasing RCOF could now see up to 900% returns when the token is listed at an anticipated price of between $0.40 and $0.60. Even more compelling, RCOF‚Äôs potential rise to $1 suggests a remarkable 19-fold increase from its current price, surpassing the impressive growth that the Cardano price experienced in 2021. And the exciting part? You can get 50% off the token value using the promo code RCOF50. So, why not join the presale now?

Here‚Äôs What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-recovers-above-key-support-level-heres-what-it-means/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has demonstrated notable resilience by reclaiming its position above the crucial 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.00002082, avoiding a potential breakdown. This recovery is a welcome development for investors as it indicates renewed buying interest and signals the possibility of stabilization in the near term. The 200 EMA is often the dividing line between bullish and bearish trends. A drop below this level could have triggered a deeper downward spiral and marked the onset of a prolonged bear market for SHIB. However, its ability to hold above this critical support level reflects underlying strength in the asset‚Äôs price action. Current Price Action and Key Resistance Levels As of report time, SHIB is trading at $0.00002169, attempting to establish a foothold after testing its support. The asset faces significant resistance at the 26 EMA and 50 EMA, positioned at $0.00002242 and $0.00002271, respectively. Breaking through these resistance levels would be essential for SHIB to reignite its bullish momentum and sustain upward movement. However, if SHIB struggles to breach these resistance zones, it may retrace to the consolidation phase, oscillating between the 200 EMA as support and the 50 EMA as resistance. This sideways movement could act as a period of accumulation, giving the market time to reset before making a decisive move. SHIB/USDT Chart; TradingView Technical Indicators Signal a Neutral Stance The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 45, placing SHIB in a neutral zone. This indicates that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold , suggesting that traders are still weighing the next direction for the token. What Could Influence SHIB‚Äôs Next Move? Several external factors could play a role in SHIB‚Äôs price trajectory in the coming days, these include: Market Sentiment: The overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market remains a driving force. Positive developments in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum could support altcoins like SHIB. Whale Activity: Shiba Inu is no stranger to large transactions by whales. Any notable accumulation by significant holders could signal increased confidence in the token and trigger further buying interest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Network Developments: Continued progress within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as the Shibarium‚Äôs adoption or partnerships that boost utility, could serve as catalysts for price appreciation. Macro Trends: Broader economic factors, including interest rate decisions, inflation data, and regulatory developments, may also influence SHIB‚Äôs movement as part of the larger crypto market. Outlook for SHIB In the short term, SHIB‚Äôs ability to maintain its position above the 200 EMA will be critical for its stability. Investors will closely monitor its attempts to break through the 26 EMA and 50 EMA resistance levels. If SHIB manages to surpass these obstacles, it could pave the way for a retest of higher resistance zones and potentially reignite bullish sentiment. Conversely, failure to move past these levels may result in range-bound trading, offering an opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate at current levels. Ultimately, SHIB‚Äôs trajectory will depend on the interplay between technical indicators, market sentiment, and external developments. Its recovery above the 200 EMA is a positive sign, but sustained momentum will be key to ensuring a more bullish outlook.

Investors are increasingly optimistic about the approval of the first spot Solana (SOL) and spot XRP ETPs, especially with expectations of a more favorable regulatory environment under President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. In a Jan. 13 report shared with Cointelegraph , JPMorgan estimated that SOL and XRP ETPs could surpass the performance of spot Ether (ETH) ETFs within their first six months of trading. ‚ÄúWhen applying these so-called ‚Äòadoption rates‚Äô to SOL and XRP, we see SOL attracting roughly $3 billion‚Äì$6 billion of net assets and XRP gathering $4 billion‚Äì$8 billion in net new assets,‚Äù the report stated. The forecast comes after the first anniversary of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which reached nearly $110 billion in cumulative holdings on Jan. 2. Bitcoin ETFs accounted for around 75% of new investments when Bitcoin reclaimed $50,000 in February, just a month after their debut. However, altcoin ETP adoption remains uncertain due to fluctuating investor demand. While Bitcoin ETFs saw a 6% adoption rate and Ether ETFs achieved 3% in their first six months, interest in altcoins like SOL and XRP is less predictable. ‚ÄúOutside of a few primary tokens (BTC, ETH, SOL), the episodic nature of the crypto market is driven by varying investor sentiment and trendy new coins that may capture incremental attention for a limited time,‚Äù JPMorgan‚Äôs report explained. Several asset managers, including VanEck, Grayscale, and 21Shares, have submitted applications for Solana ETFs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to make preliminary decisions by late January, with Grayscale‚Äôs deadline set for Jan. 23 and others by Jan. 25. Alejo Pinto, founder of Solana Layer-2 network Lumio, commented, ‚ÄúAn ETF approval in the U.S. would have a positive price impact on Solana since the probability is low and therefore not yet priced in.‚Äù",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-14 23:15:00

Experts say the deal represents a ‚Äútectonic shift‚Äù in the domestic traditional finance and crypto sectors. Whereas South Korean crypto exchanges once had to win banks over, tradfi firms are now actively pursuing deals with coin trading platforms, analysts believe. Bithumb‚Äôs Brand-new Banking Deal Bithumb trading volumes over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) The deal has been in the pipelines since at least August last year, when Cryptonews.com reported that Bithumb was preparing to dump its long-term partner NongHyup Bank (NH) in favor of a deal with the latter‚Äôs rival KB . The South Korean newspaper Electronic Times reported that sources familiar with the deal said Bithumb will start migrating its customers from NH to KB ‚Äúon February 24.‚Äù A branch of Kookmin (KB) Bank in South Korea.

Both Bithumb and KB are hoping the deal will help them boost their market presence. The exchange currently has a market share of 20%, but is hoping to gain ground on Upbit as it chases a New York Stock Exchange listing. The media outlet called Bithumb‚Äôs move ‚Äúa strategic decision.‚Äù It pointed out that KB ‚Äúhas a solid base of 20-39 year-old customers. This demographic is key in the South Korean crypto market, where younger citizens remain extremely crypto-keen.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing whether Cardano (ADA), XRP, or the emerging Remittix (RTX) will reach $5 first. Table of Contents Cardano poses for a bullish comeback XRP presents buy opportunity amid fluctuations Remittix set to transform global payments Conclusion Cardano is experiencing recent declines but shows promise for a major comeback. On the other hand XRP‚Äôs technical signs point to possible increases. Meanwhile, Remittix is transforming global payments and establishing itself as a financial industry game-changer. The competition to reach $5 first is intense since every one of these top crypto coins presents special benefits. Cardano poses for a bullish comeback The Cardano price momentarily surged to the $1.14 resistance level before falling towards the $0.92 support. Looking at the larger trend, the Cardano price has declined by over 8% in the past month, indicating a bearish phase for the altcoin. Nonetheless, the general sentiment of the Cardano community is still quite positive, suggesting hope for its near-term move. The 2025 Cardano price forecasts point to a good trading range ‚Äî between $0.95 and $5.10. XRP presents buy opportunity amid fluctuations Showing indecisiveness, the XRP price has been consolidating between $2.60 and $2.20 for the past week. The XRP chart shows that the altcoin is much below its 2018 all-time high (ATH) of $3.8. Nevertheless, market analysts and investors are hopeful about the future of XRP since forecasts point to a possible new ATH by the end of Q1 2025. Technical indicators such as the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages support these forecasts. Considering this, XRP is among the promising altcoins to watch in 2025, providing a mix of long-term growth potential and short-term promise.

By supporting over 30 currencies and offering same-day transfers with no foreign exchange fees, the platform will provide a reliable and affordable solution for both individuals and businesses. Central to this transformation is the RTX token, considered one of the most promising cryptos currently available. With over $2.7 million raised during its presale at $0.0199 per token, RTX is anticipated to experience a dramatic price increase in Q1 2025. As demand for low-cost, fast, and efficient payment solutions continues to grow, early RTX adopters have a unique opportunity to benefit. Conclusion Although Cardano and XRP show great promise for growth, Remittix is positioned to transform the financial sector with its creative approach. RTX has a competitive edge from the rising need for quick, reasonably priced, safe cross-border payments. As investor demand keeps rising amid the limited token supply, analysts anticipate a rally to $5 for RTX in this bull run.

Web3Bay is redefining online shopping with its decentralized approach via the 3BAY token. This presale has swiftly raised over $660,000, proving its market appeal.

Web3Bay Elevates E-Commerce to New Heights Web3Bay is not your ordinary e-commerce platform. By harnessing the power of advanced Web3 technology, it empowers you to take complete control and enjoy true freedom when shopping online.

Here, you maintain full ownership of your assets and personal information, backed by top-notch security measures that ensure all transactions are visible and fraud-resistant. Furthermore, Web3Bay leverages smart contracts to streamline transactions, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs. This direct interaction between buyers and sellers not only simplifies transactions but also enhances trust and lowers barriers, embodying the core benefits of Web3 in e-commerce. With blockchain integration, Web3Bay offers a safer and more dependable online shopping experience. To tap into these advantages, all you need is the 3BAY token, available now at an introductory presale price of $0.0039675. Looking ahead, the value of the 3BAY token is poised to soar, with a planned post-presale launch price of $0.1959, potentially yielding a staggering 6480% return on investment for early participants. Already, the token‚Äôs presale has successfully raised over $660,000. If you‚Äôre seeking substantial returns and are excited by Web3 innovation, this is an opportunity you won‚Äôt want to miss. Already, more than 185.88 million coins have been snapped up! Future Prospects The investment in SEED by the Sui Foundation is setting the stage for a scalable Web3 gaming platform, which is set to stimulate growth within the SUI ecosystem using VR, AI, and blockchain technology. Meanwhile, the collaboration between FaTPay and PoPP is fortifying the broader Web3 ecosystem by integrating essential fiat-to-crypto services with rewarding blockchain opportunities.

Arctic Pablo: A Journey to Prosperity Arctic Pablo is not just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs a journey wrapped in an adventurous narrative that fuses myth with reality. The coin takes you to the frosty, uncharted territories of Icyopolis, where Arctic Pablo, the daring explorer, embarks on a thrilling journey to uncover hidden treasures in the form of $APC tokens. These tokens are more than just a cryptocurrency; they represent a mystical gateway to potential riches, made all the more enticing by the coin‚Äôs presale structure. Arctic Pablo‚Äôs presale is uniquely divided by locations, with each phase offering a new opportunity for early investors to get in on the action. The coin‚Äôs appeal isn‚Äôt just in the potential for massive ROI; it‚Äôs in the scarcity built into the tokenomics. Every week, the unsold tokens from the presale are burned, reducing supply and driving up value. The Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is currently priced at $0.00002, but it‚Äôs set to increase every week, with the final presale price set at $0.0008 before launching at $0.008. This gives early investors a staggering ROI potential of over 39,900% from the second stage to the launch. It‚Äôs an exciting, deflationary ecosystem that‚Äôs designed for massive growth. Why did this coin make it to this list? Arctic Pablo Coin stands out not just for its presale potential, but also for the unique narrative and token burn mechanisms that can skyrocket its value as demand surges.

Snek: The Slithering Meme Coin Snek has slithered its way into the meme coin spotlight, showing no signs of slowing down. This meme coin draws inspiration from the viral internet culture surrounding serpents and reptiles, capitalizing on a unique, easily recognizable brand that‚Äôs rapidly gaining traction. While its meme status is strong, Snek offers more than just viral potential‚Äîit‚Äôs backed by a growing community that‚Äôs actively participating in staking and token burns. This adds a layer of sustainability that many other meme coins lack. Why did this coin make it to this list? Snek‚Äôs combination of community involvement, staking opportunities, and meme culture gives it the perfect ingredients for success in 2025. If you want a meme coin that balances fun with profitability, Snek deserves a serious look. 3. Fartcoin: A Fart of Fun and Value Fartcoin may sound lighthearted and quirky, but don‚Äôt let its name fool you‚Äîit‚Äôs quickly becoming a serious contender in the meme coin market. With a focus on humor and community, Fartcoin has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts who are looking for something unique and playful. But behind the meme, Fartcoin has a serious plan for growth, using a tokenomics model that includes deflationary mechanics and regular burns to boost scarcity. Why did this coin make it to this list? Fartcoin may be built on a lighthearted concept, but the community and deflationary mechanisms give it real investment potential. With growing user engagement and a solid burn strategy, Fartcoin is an underrated meme coin with the potential to outperform many others in 2025.

From the trusted Ethereum (ETH) to the fast-rising BigBossInu, these digital assets are poised for substantial gains. Investors are locking onto these top picks as they prepare for the market to take off. BigBossInu‚Äôs Presale Ignites: A Powerful Opportunity for Investors Big Boss Inu is the ultimate game-changer in the crypto universe, proving its dominance with six-figure funding in record time and a community that‚Äôs multiplying at lightning speed.

Recent developments include Ripple‚Äôs expansion into Brazil and Dubai, securing key partnerships that could boost XRP‚Äôs long-term prospects. Analysts suggest that if XRP can break past the $2.5 resistance level, it could aim for $3.0, but a drop below $2.0 may lead to a further decline‚Äã. Cardano (ADA) has been trading between $0.87 and $0.92, with signs of oversold conditions that may present an opportunity for a price rebound. But ADA still faces pressure in the short term. Analysts suggest that ADA could push toward $1.50 if market conditions improve. >>> NEAR Protocol has been relatively quiet in recent weeks, but its fundamentals remain strong as it continues to grow its developer ecosystem. NEAR‚Äôs focus on scalability and user-friendly applications has kept it in the spotlight as a promising Layer-1 blockchain, though price action has been subdued amid broader market conditions. Polkadot (DOT) has been struggling to hold above the $6.83 mark, with recent declines pushing it below key support levels. However, DOT‚Äôs long-term potential remains solid due to its unique parachain ecosystem, which continues to attract attention from developers and investors. Conclusion As Bitcoin eyes a potential 700% surge, altcoins like BigBossInu, XRP, Cardano, NEAR Protocol, and Polkadot are positioned for explosive growth. BigBossInu‚Äôs presale, XRP‚Äôs global expansion, Cardano‚Äôs governance, and NEAR and Polkadot‚Äôs ecosystem development highlight their long-term potential.

The AI startup is hoping to use his expertise to advance the development of its artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company is prioritizing its resources on data centers and new energy resources. Ogunlesi earns another board position after joining Blackrock just last year Adebayo Ogunlesi joined Blackrock Inc. last year after they acquired his company, Global Infrastructure Partners, for about $12 billion. After that acquisition, Ogunlesi became worth about $2.3 billion and is currently Blackrock‚Äôs Senior Managing Director and a board member. Before founding Global Infrastructure Partners, Ogunlesi worked for more than twenty years at Credit Suisse, an investment banking company. Not to mention, he holds other board positions at Topgolf Callaway Brands, Kosmos Energy Holdings, and Terminal Investment Ltd. Now, OpenAI wants to use Ogunlesi‚Äôs experience to better itself, inviting him to join its board of directors. OpenAI has been trying to acquire more data centers and energy resources to grow its infrastructure; at this time, calling Ogunlesi might help. On Tuesday, Ogunlesi shared his willingness to work with the AI startup: As part of this, thoughtful strategies and investment in infrastructure will be key to unlocking AI‚Äôs full potential and delivering its benefits responsibly. I‚Äôm excited to contribute to this effort and look forward to being a part of the OpenAI Board. Adebayo Ogunlesi OpenAI began restructuring its board in late 2023, adding two new members in 2024: Instacart CEO Fidji Simo and Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, now known as the Gates Foundation. OpenAI is planning to launch new AI projects in the coming months OpenAI has increasingly invested in new infrastructure projects, asking for funding from the private and public sectors. According to Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation Energy Corporation, CEO Altman wants to build five to seven data centers, each 5GW. Another source claimed that Open AI wants to devote its attention to a single data center before potentially expanding to others. Besides, the AI startup is still planning to host several events in Washington, D.C., and two key swing states to rally support and investments. The company has also planned its ‚Äúeconomic blueprint‚Äù for AI this January, calling on public and private sectors to collaborate in AI developments to ensure the US stays ahead of China. The company is also set to announce new AI projects in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Alabama in the coming months.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With Dogwifhat (WIF) down 45% in 30 days and struggling to break above $2, Flockerz (FLOCK) is gaining investors‚Äô attention. Table of Contents WIF breaking above the $2 mark: Technical analysis Investors turn to this meme coin as WIF trades range-bound Popular dog-themed meme coin Dogwifhat has been navigating a tough period since December 2024, with its price dropping by 45% over the past month. The token has seen a slight rebound of around 4% over the past day, currently trading at $1.55. However, an analysis of its price performance shows that WIF remains in a broader bearish trend that requires considerable buying pressure to reverse. WIF breaking above the $2 mark: Technical analysis The moving averages suggest mixed signals for the WIF token. The 9-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $1.472 is below the current price, offering short-term support, while the 9-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1.493 supports a slightly bullish outlook. These levels indicate a fragile recovery, but the real test lies in WIF‚Äôs ability to push past the critical $2 mark, a psychological and technical barrier. The Bollinger Bands reflect reduced volatility, with the upper band at $1.622 and the lower band at $1.422. This narrow range highlights the importance of breaking through $1.622 to spark a bullish rally. Conversely, a drop below $1.422 could signal the continuation of the downward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering around 35, suggesting oversold conditions that may attract buyers. However, the MACD shows a bearish crossover, indicating weak momentum. A reversal in these indicators will be crucial for WIF to gather the strength needed for a meaningful rally.

One notable option is Flockerz , a transformative meme coin introducing a vote-to-earn system that empowers its community while incentivizing token holding. The project will allow FLOCK holders to cast votes on various proposals, including decisions on its substantial treasury, rewarding them with additional tokens for their participation. The vote-to-earn mechanism creates a positive feedback loop where governance participation earns users more FLOCK tokens, which can then be staked for estimated APYs of 2276%. The project‚Äôs potential is evident in its massive presale success, surpassing $9.9 million in funding and attracting over 35,000 social media followers.

Table of Contents Catzilla: The fierce feline redefining meme coins Worldcoin on the brink of a major breakthrough Ondo eyes resistance level XRP aims for a break above $3 Uniswap‚Äôs awaited surge Conclusion A new presidency brings a wave of excitement and speculation to the cryptocurrency market. With bullish momentum already building, the inauguration could serve as a catalyst for unprecedented growth and opportunities in the dynamic world of crypto. As such, attention is turning to five standout coins that could thrive under this new era. Catzilla: The fierce feline redefining meme coins In the bustling meme coin arena, Catzilla is clawing its way to the top with unmatched ambition and charm. Inspired by the viral success of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe, Catzilla infuses meme culture with a fresh twist ‚Äî a towering, Godzilla-like cat wreaking havoc and capturing imaginations. Drawing from the chaotic energy of Japanese kaiju culture, this coin‚Äôs narrative is a magnet for gamers, anime fans, and crypto enthusiasts. Unlike fleeting meme coins that vanish as quickly as they rise, Catzilla is designed for longevity and impact. With a 14-stage presale starting at $0.0002 and climbing to $0.0016, investors have multiple chances to join the frenzy. Offering a 700% ROI, Catzilla proves it‚Äôs not just about fun ‚Äî it‚Äôs about serious financial potential. Catzilla isn‚Äôt just another meme coin; it‚Äôs a movement. Here‚Äôs why it stands out: Epic gameplay: Dive into a thrilling game inspired by Catzilla‚Äôs larger-than-life narrative while earning rewards.

Interested investors can join the revolution for a fairer, wilder crypto future via Catzilla‚Äôs presale. You might also like: From meme to millions: These 3 coins are breaking records Worldcoin on the brink of a major breakthrough Worldcoin‚Äôs price floats between $1.86 and $2.41. It‚Äôs still below both its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, hinting at a bearish trend. The coin has dipped over the past month and week, losing around 33% and 17% respectively. Despite this, WLD could bounce back soon. If it breaks above $3.08, momentum might push it toward $3.83, suggesting potential gains of over 60% from its lower range. The RSI sits under the midpoint, indicating it might be undervalued. Although past performance shows a downward trend, any positive market move could propel Worldcoin up. Ondo eyes resistance level Ondo is currently trading in the range of $1.10 to $1.40. The price is hovering near its 10-day moving average of $1.20 but is below the 100-day average of $1.23. Indicators show a balanced momentum with RSI at 50.62 and Stochastic at 80.28, suggesting potential growth. If bulls take charge, the first target is the $1.75 resistance, followed by a leap to around $2.16. Passing these levels could mark a price increase of about 45% to 50% from current prices. However, if support at $0.91 fails, it may test lower levels.

With resistance at $2.84, breaking past this level could easily see XRP targeting $3.24. Its RSI is around 61, pointing to potential further gains. Stochastic at 89 also hints at strong momentum. The 10-day SMA near $2.49 aligns well with the 100-day SMA of $2.43, supporting a potential upward continuation. Investors are watching closely, as XRP could leap higher, riding the wave of market optimism and broader crypto bull run expectations. Uniswap‚Äôs awaited surge Uniswap is poised for potential growth amid the altcoin season excitement. Currently priced between $12.14 and $14.38, it shows some resistance but signs of resilience. The nearest hurdle is at $17, but the crypto‚Äôs strong 6-month rise of over 62% shows promise. While the past week and month saw dips of nearly 3% and 20%, there are signals of a comeback. Key indicators like the high Stochastic index suggest possible upward momentum. If Uniswap breaks through $17, it could aim for the $20 mark, indicating a rise of at least 30%. Conclusion While coins like WLD, ONDO, XRP, and UNI show limited short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains and achieve new heights.

However, the cryptocurrency has since rebounded, trading back above $96,000 at the time of writing. This rapid recovery has drawn the attention of market analysts who are examining the underlying trends driving Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. Related Reading: Rebound Alert: US Bitcoin ETF Interest Picks Up Speed In 2025 Is Bitcoin‚Äôs Surge Above $96k A Stop Hunt? A CryptoQuant contributor, Mignolet, shared an analysis highlighting the recent price dynamics. According to the analyst, the recent drop in BTC to $89,000 and the current recovery was triggered by the breaking of a key short-term support level. Mignolet revealed that this pattern, referred to as ‚Äústop hunting,‚Äù occurs when price movements break support levels temporarily before recovering. Despite the recovery, Mignolet emphasizes that a true trend reversal would require stronger involvement from key market participants. Mignolet‚Äôs analysis points to significant selling activity among whale entities, as observed in Coinbase Premium Gap (CPG) data. Typically, buying whales step in to absorb such dips, creating notable market volatility. However, this time, such activity was absent, raising questions about the sustainability of the ongoing rebound. Additionally, Binance‚Äôs market-buy ratio data suggests that large-scale buyers on the exchange have not capitalized on the recent price movement, indicating cautious sentiment among key players. Further evidence disclosed by Mignolet comes from the exchange-traded fund (ETF) daily inflow and outflow data, which is yet to confirm any major shifts in market dynamics. While the daily candle pattern suggests a meaningful move, the lack of participation from whales could limit Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to sustain a long-term reversal. Mignolet also warned that market sentiment might shift too quickly to optimism without clear supporting data. The analyst noted: While the candle pattern signifies a meaningful move, the major players are not capitalizing on the opportunity. What concerns me more is that many people‚Äôs sentiment may quickly shift to a sense of relief too soon. Bitcoin Market Performance After seeing a notable plunge in price yesterday dropping below $90,000 and triggering a total liquidation of over $300 million in the crypto market, Bitcoin is finally seeing a noticeable reversal in its bearish trend. Particularly, over the past day, Bitcoin has increased by 5.6% bringing its price to trade at $96,351, at the time of writing. However, despite this increase, the asset is still roughly a 10.8% decrease away from its peak above $108,000 recorded last month. While Mignolet‚Äôs analysis suggested that Bitcoin bearishness might not be over yet, it is worth noting that the asset‚Äôs current recovery coincides with reduced selling activity from long-term holders. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Hit Its Peak In Summer 2025? Analysts Weigh In In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost revealed that the net position change of long-term holders (LTHs) over the past 30 days remains negative but shows signs of improvement. From a low of -827,000 BTC on December 5, the figure has improved to -246,000 BTC. This reduction in selling pressure suggests that LTHs are less inclined to sell at current price levels as Bitcoin‚Äôs price declines.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address ‚Äì 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-15 00:52:00

The case , titled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Musk , is docketed as 25-cv-00105 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. According to the complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in Washington, DC, the watchdog accuses Musk of intentionally failing to meet the required deadline to disclose his acquisition of more than a 5% stake in Twitter early in 2022, several months before completing his purchase of the social media platform. Alex Spiro, Musk‚Äôs attorney, dismissed the allegations, stating that the regulator‚Äôs action is ‚Äúan admission‚Äù of its inability to present a legitimate case. He claimed Musk ‚Äúhas done nothing wrong‚Äù and characterized the lawsuit as a ‚Äúsham.‚Äù Spiro said in a statement : The SEC‚Äôs multi-year campaign of harassment against Mr. Musk culminates in this filing of a single-count, administrative complaint under Section 13(d) for allegedly failing to submit one form‚Äîa procedural issue that, even if substantiated, would result in a nominal penalty . Alex Spiro The SEC claims Musk delayed disclosure to buy Twitter shares at artificially low prices The SEC‚Äôs investigation into Musk‚Äôs Twitter investment began in 2022 after the regulator sought an explanation for his failure to disclose his growing stake within the mandated timeframe. The regulator says Musk‚Äôs alleged non-compliance with disclosure rules allowed him to ‚Äúunderpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his financial beneficial ownership report was due. By March 2022, Musk had accumulated beneficial ownership of more than 9% of Twitter‚Äôs outstanding common stock. Under federal securities law, he was required to disclose this within 10 days, but the filing was delayed by 11 days. The lawsuit states that once the disclosure was made, Twitter‚Äôs stock price surged 27% the following day. The SEC seeks penalties from Musk amid lawsuits and political ties The SEC asked the court to direct Musk to pay a civil penalty and return profits, which the agency claims he reaped unjustly from his stock purchases. The agency declined to comment beyond the suit. Musk also faces investor litigation accusing him of hiding his acquisition of Twitter shares. Musk, the world‚Äôs richest individual, has recently emerged as one of Donald Trump‚Äôs prominent supporters and advisors. He has joined the president-elect‚Äôs discussions with foreign officials and, alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, is assisting with a government cost-cutting initiative.

33767162,[object Object],1736902821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Price Mirrors 2021 Election Inauguration Pattern, Here‚Äôs What Happened Last Time",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-mirrors-2021/,"According to Cephii, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), the current Dogecoin price action mirrors the 2021 election inauguration pattern, signaling a potential price surge to new ATHs on the horizon. Despite declining by more than 10% in one week, the Dogecoin price continues to strengthen amidst bearish conditions. Dogecoin Price To Repeat Election Inauguration Rally During the bull cycle in 2021 , the Dogecoin price rallied to new ATHs, driven by broader market adoption, political influence, and other bullish factors. Cephii revealed on X that Dogecoin experienced a massive 1,100% pump just one week after the United States (US) Presidential inauguration in 2021. At the time, Dogecoin had eliminated one zero from its price, rising from $0.00684 to $0.0795. Sharing two parallel charts of this bullish trend pattern, Cephii points out striking similarities between Dogecoin‚Äôs current price action and its behaviour in the 2021 bull cycle . The first chart highlights two Moving Averages (MA), with the blue trend line crossing above the red, signaling potential bullish momentum for Dogecoin . The second chart, depicting Dogecoin‚Äôs current cycle, shows the meme coin trading at $0.344 while its resistance and support zones have been indicated through Fibonacci extension and retracement levels. The chart shows that Dogecoin is nearing a critical point at 0.414 Fib, which aligns with the historical resistance above $0.344. The other Fibonacci levels, such as 0.739 and 1.547, which correspond to the $0.7 and $1.4 price points, represent long-term bullish targets for Dogecoin if its upward momentum continues. Notably, the moving averages in the second chart show a similar pattern of movement. They show a bullish crossover, with the blue MA trendline crossing over the red. This price structure indicates a potential breakout scenario, mimicking the 2021 US Presidential inauguration setup. With Dogecoin‚Äôs price movement tracking historical trends, Cephii has predicted that the meme coin could soon experience an almost identical surge to the one witnessed in the last Presidential inauguration. With Donald Trump set to be inaugurated by January 20, 2025, speculation is brewing that this political event could once again drive a notable rally in the Dogecoin price. How Trump‚Äôs Inauguration Could Affect Dogecoin Discussions in the crypto community are heating up as analysts predict the outlook of the Dogecoin price after Trump‚Äôs US Presidential inauguration on Monday. Reports have revealed that investors are betting on what crypto-related words, like Dogecoin, might be mentioned during the inauguration ceremony. On the other hand, many believe that this inauguration day could be a historical moment for Dogecoin , fueled by bullish sentiment and the creation of Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). With Musk‚Äôs influence, Trump‚Äôs support, and the growing enthusiasm surrounding Dogecoin, many hope this event could spark renewed momentum in the meme coin‚Äôs price.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|Analyst|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AXS|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-15 01:00:21

While technical signals hint that Aave might be undervalued, market corrections are still a risk. In the web3 ecosystem, platforms like AIOZ Network and Web3Bay are introducing major changes. AIOZ Network is improving streaming by using blockchain and decentralized nodes to deliver content more effectively and at a lower cost. At the same time, Web3Bay (3BAY) is transforming online shopping by using blockchain for transparency and smart contracts to create a safer shopping experience and reduce fraud. The 3BAY token presale has raised over $660,000 so far, with a potential 6,430% return by launch, showing rising interest in how it could reshape the online business. Aave Price Prediction: Signs of a Potential Recovery? Aave price prediction for 2025 points to possible hurdles, suggesting a price range between $155 and $233. Although Aave ended 2024 on a high note due to updates like the V3 protocol and a brief rise above $300, it has since encountered downward trends. Technical indicators, such as a Relative Strength Index of 41 and a Total Value Locked (TVL) ratio of 0.21, suggest Aave could be undervalued. September may be key for a potential peak at $534.91, according to wave count analysis, but a following correction might weaken progress. These findings offer a cautious perspective for those tracking Aave price prediction trends. AIOZ Network Drives Sustainable Solutions in Decentralized Streaming AIOZ Network is reshaping the streaming industry with blockchain-based content delivery. Using a network of ‚ÄúEdge Nodes,‚Äù it provides faster, more reliable streaming while cutting costs and avoiding central servers. Recent improvements include advanced AI tools that adjust content delivery in real-time, reducing buffering and improving viewer experiences. This method not only enhances user satisfaction but also reduces environmental impact by using energy-saving nodes. As people look for affordable and eco-friendly solutions, AIOZ Network stands out in the push for better streaming services. Web3Bay Offers a Safer and Smarter Way to Shop Online Web3Bay is a decentralized shopping platform growing within the web3 ecosystem, changing how buyers and sellers connect. Built on blockchain, it removes middlemen to provide a secure, transparent marketplace. By tackling issues like high fees, fraud, and data theft, Web3Bay creates a safer space for online shopping. Central to this system is the 3BAY token, which powers payments and builds trust among users. A standout feature of Web3Bay is its focus on transparency. Smart contracts handle payments and dispute resolutions automatically, ensuring fairness without third parties. All transactions are stored on an unchangeable blockchain, offering a clear and permanent record. This openness prevents fraud and boosts user confidence. Additionally, Web3Bay‚Äôs decentralized setup spreads data across its network, reducing security risks and offering users peace of mind. The 3BAY token is more than just a way to pay‚Äîit‚Äôs a key part of the web3 ecosystem. In its third presale phase, 3BAY has raised over $660,000, currently priced at $0.0039675. As the presale continues, the price rises with each stage, aiming for a final price of $0.1959. Early buyers stand to gain, with a projected 6,430% return at launch. As Web3Bay grows, the increasing demand for 3BAY tokens highlights its promise to change secure, user-friendly online shopping in the web3 ecosystem. Final Thoughts As the crypto market changes, new projects offer fresh opportunities. Aave price prediction models show chances for growth but also warn about market downturns, making it worth watching. Meanwhile, AIOZ Network is improving streaming with its blockchain-based, eco-friendly system, likely growing as more people seek decentralized content options. Yet, Web3Bay is drawing the most attention as it aims to transform online shopping through blockchain security and transparency in the web3 ecosystem. With its 3BAY token presale raising over $660,000 and an expected 6,430% return for early supporters, 3BAY may become the next big success in crypto .

In a video, Pompliano outlined actionable steps to position Trump as a leader in the digital currency revolution. Anthony Pompliano Proposes Repealing SAB 12 In a recent video on X , Anthony Pompliano‚Äôs first recommendation was to repeal Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). This regulation currently limits banks from holding digital assets, requiring them to classify these holdings as liabilities. Pompliano argues that removing this barrier would allow banks to hold Bitcoin on behalf of their customers. This would foster institutional demand for cryptocurrency. According to Anthony Pompliano, enabling financial institutions to incorporate Bitcoin into their balance sheets could create a more robust ecosystem for the digital asset. This change could also provide U.S. banks with a competitive edge in the growing global cryptocurrency market. It is important to note that Bitwise Chief Investment Officer also shared insights on trends in corporate BTC adoption under Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto policies. He emphasized MicroStrategy‚Äôs aggressive Bitcoin strategy, new FASB rules enabling firms to record price gains, Creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for National Growth Another action proposed by Anthony Pompliano was to establish a national Bitcoin reserve. He highlighted that the U.S. government already possesses approximately 200,000 Bitcoin, which could serve as a foundation for building such a reserve. Anthony Pompliano suggested that increasing the government‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings, rather than liquidating them, would be a prudent move. He emphasized that Bitcoin‚Äôs growing utility as a store of value and hedge against inflation could benefit the economy in the long term. The Bitcoin advocate added, ‚ÄúIf Bitcoin is good for individuals or corporations, it‚Äôs going to be good for the country, too.‚Äù The growing Bitcoin prices and adoption have led to major corporate moves and acceptance. In a recent report, Genius Group approved a $33M rights offering to expand its Bitcoin Treasury to $86M. The offering allows shareholders to purchase shares at $0.50, with CEO Roger Hamilton planning to increase his stake by 10.3%. Tax Code Reforms Under Donald Trump Pompliano also urged Donald Trump to introduce tax reforms that would change how Bitcoin is treated under existing laws. Currently, Bitcoin is classified as property, meaning transactions involving the cryptocurrency are subject to capital gains tax. This classification creates complexities for consumers and businesses seeking to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. Pompliano proposed adjustments to the tax code to eliminate these barriers. Moreover, Anthony Pompliano concluded his recommendations stressing that these measures will propel the United States to the forefront of the digital currency revolution. Meanwhile, other countries like El Salvador have already integrated Bitcoin into their national strategies. This has inspired jurisdictions like Bhutan‚Äôs Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC). GMC plans to hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB in its strategic reserves, focusing on digital assets with large market capitalizations and liquidity.

A prime example is TRON‚Äôs blockchain innovation, which showcases its market strength by driving progress in decentralised applications and offering fast and low-cost transactions. At the same time, the Solana price outlook for 2025 presents a mix of optimism and caution, as analysts assess its growth potential amid market uncertainties. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is changing how global trade works with its borderless marketplace, where Web3 payments are made using its 3BAY token. Currently in presale stage 3 and priced at an accessible $0.0039675, the token‚Äôs growing utility and future potential make it an intriguing opportunity for early backers. TRON Blockchain Innovation Drives Market Gains TRON‚Äôs blockchain innovation seems limitless, backed by strong market performance and continuous advancements. With the ability to process over 2,000 transactions per second at minimal fees, TRON proves its dedication to building efficient and scalable blockchain solutions. As of January 2025, TRX‚Äôs price hovers around $0.2291, supported by a substantial 24-hour trading volume of $672 million and ongoing Tron blockchain innovation. This growth highlights the platform‚Äôs expanding adoption and appeal to developers and users alike. With recent surges in value and ongoing advancements, TRON‚Äôs blockchain innovation is redefining possibilities in decentralised applications and efficient digital transactions. Solana (SOL) Price Outlook: Balancing Bullish Trends & Risks The Solana (SOL) price outlook for 2025 reflects both cautious optimism and market uncertainties. Analysts highlight critical technical levels, with SOL currently trading near $190 and potential support around $165 if the price fails to rise further. Bullish projections suggest a move toward $264 or even $300, driven by positive technical patterns and ecosystem upgrades. However, short-term volatility remains, as whale transactions and regulatory decisions weigh on sentiment. Institutional interest in Solana-based ETFs could also influence future prices. Whether SOL experiences steady growth or fluctuates will largely depend on macroeconomic trends and the pace of network improvements. Web3Bay Smashes Global Trade Barriers with Web3 Payments Web3Bay is redefining how global trade works by removing the usual hurdles of traditional e-commerce. With its decentralised platform, Web3Bay opens up a borderless marketplace where buyers and sellers can interact without worrying about high fees, slow transactions, or banking restrictions. By integrating Web3 payments, the platform enables seamless transactions that transcend geographical limitations, creating a space where everyone can participate equally. The Web3Bay system is designed for accessibility and security. Its cryptocurrency-powered transactions bypass currency exchange issues, making cross-border trade more affordable and efficient. For those in underbanked regions, Web3Bay offers opportunities to engage in global commerce through Web3 payments, ensuring they aren‚Äôt left out of the digital economy. Decentralised storage further enhances the platform, guaranteeing privacy and reliability while maintaining a global presence. The 3BAY token is the driving force behind this ecosystem, and its crypto presale is rapidly gaining momentum. Currently priced at $0.0039675 in presale stage 3, with over $660,000 already raised, the token offers early holders a chance to secure impressive returns. With the token price rising at every stage and a launch price set at $0.1959, early participants from the first presale stage now have the potential to earn an impressive 6,430% ROI‚Äîan opportunity that‚Äôs hard to overlook. As Web3Bay continues to expand, the demand for 3BAY tokens is set to rise, making this a moment of opportunity for those who see the future of borderless trade. The Bottom Line To sum up, the crypto market is showcasing incredible opportunities across leading platforms. TRON‚Äôs blockchain innovation continues to advance decentralised applications with efficient and cost-effective transactions, solidifying its market position. Meanwhile, Solana‚Äôs price outlook for 2025 balances cautious optimism with the promise of long-term growth, driven by technical advancements and institutional interest. However, Web3Bay shines the brightest with its transformative vision for global trade. Powered by Web3 payments using its 3BAY token, the platform continues to break barriers in e-commerce. Currently available at the presale price of just $0.0039675 in stage 3, the 3BAY token offers a rare chance to get in early on a rapidly growing platform, with its utility in Web3 payments paving the way for widespread adoption and significant future value.

BigBossInu‚Äôs Hot Presale Unlocks Unprecedented Growth Potential BigBossInu with its record-breaking presale of over $100K raised in hours and a roadmap designed for exponential growth, analysts are calling it a must-have for massive returns. Big Boss Inu stands out with massive APY staking rewards , groundbreaking real-world partnerships, and innovative anti-dump mechanisms, making it a top pick for both short-term gains and long-term potential. If you‚Äôre ready to supercharge your portfolio, Big Boss Inu is the ultimate choice to lead your path to crypto dominance! >>>>>> XRP is seeing strong buying activity from whales, who have accumulated around 470 million XRP tokens. This signals confidence in XRP‚Äôs future, particularly with Ripple expanding its financial services globally, including plans for a stablecoin. XRP is currently trading around $0.60, with analysts expecting it could rise to $1 by the end of October if bullish momentum continues. Solana (SOL) is gaining attention from investors as its price hovers around $191, with key resistance at $190. Solana has been attracting significant interest due to its scalability and speed, making it a top choice for DeFi and NFT platforms. Analysts suggest that a break above $220 could lead to a surge toward $250. Kaspa (KAS) is gaining popularity thanks to its fast transaction speeds, enabled by its unique GHOSTDAG architecture. This allows Kaspa to handle parallel transactions efficiently, making it an attractive option for high-volume traders. Despite some volatility, Kaspa has shown significant growth and is positioning itself for further gains during the next bull run. >>> Polkadot (DOT) remains a key player in the interoperability space, but recent performance has been somewhat lackluster. DOT is currently trading below $7, but with developments in its parachain ecosystem, analysts are optimistic about its long-term potential as the market recovers. Conclusion As Bitcoin whales focus on the next big opportunities, cryptos like BigBossInu, XRP, Solana, Kaspa, and Polkadot are positioned for strong gains. BigBossInu‚Äôs presale success, XRP‚Äôs whale accumulation, and Solana‚Äôs scalability highlight the potential for 50x returns in 2025 . With Kaspa‚Äôs fast transactions and Polkadot‚Äôs advancements in interoperability, these assets could lead the charge in the upcoming bull run.

Ethereum‚Äôs price has surged by more than 26%, climbing past the $3,338 mark and pushing its market capitalization to an impressive $400 billion. Amid Ethereum‚Äôs rise, a new under $1 altcoin is poised to potentially ride on Ethereum‚Äôs coattails to deliver a 9,000% surge. Ethereum Price Projected to Hit $4,000 in a Week Ethereum‚Äôs 26% price surge over the past seven days has left analysts optimistic about its future performance. The ETH price surge can be attributed to several factors, including renewed interest in Ethereum derivatives and a crypto-friendly outlook in the United States following Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory. As Ethereum‚Äôs market capitalization soared beyond $400 billion, so did investor confidence, propelling Ethereum to its current price of around $3,338. This surge reflects the growing demand for Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency in market cap. According to Farside Investors, Ethereum ETFs have also seen a boost, drawing millions of dollars in net inflows. As a result, institutional interest in Ethereum has spiked, contributing to the broader bullish sentiment in the crypto market. Ethereum‚Äôs price continues to rise, presenting a promising outlook for those seeking exposure to the digital asset space. According to ETH price predictions , if it closes above the resistance at $3,668, it is projected to hit the $4,000 mark before the end of this week. RCO Finance Riding on Ethereum‚Äôs Momentum for a Potential 9,000% Surge While Ethereum continues to captivate investors, another altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF), is positioning itself to capitalize on Ethereum‚Äôs bullish run. RCOF is currently in its third presale stage, and its token price has already surged by 337%, from an initial price of $0.01275 to $0.055882. This impressive rise in value shows the potential for further gains as the presale progresses. In the upcoming presale stage, RCOF‚Äôs price is expected to rise to $0.07770, representing a significant potential return for early investors. The final presale stages of RCOF are expected to bring a total surge of over 672.20%, with the price reaching an expected listing price of between $0.4 and $0.6. With such projections, the RCOF token offers investors an exceptional opportunity to multiply their investment exponentially. As the RCOF presale progresses and the native RCO Finance platform gets ready for launch, it‚Äôs clear that the token is on a trajectory to deliver substantial returns to those who get in early. When the platform goes live, and the RCOF token is listed, early investors could see their holdings soar by more than 9,000%‚Äîa rare opportunity for crypto enthusiasts looking to maximize their potential gains. Why RCO Finance (RCOF) Could Outpace Ethereum (ETH) RCO Finance (RCOF) is the native token of RCO Finance, a highly anticipated AI-powered decentralized trading platform designed to democratize access to sophisticated investment strategies. The RCOF token is set to see its value grow exponentially as its native platform grows. The RCO Finance platform integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to create fully automated, personalized investment strategies for its users through its groundbreaking AI-powered Robo Advisor. The Robo Advisor tailors the investment strategies to individual financial goals and risk preferences, making advanced investment strategies accessible to a broader audience. In addition to the AI-powered Robo Advisor, RCO Finance will also offer access to a vast range of assets, including over 120,000 across 12,500 asset classes. This will allow users to diversify their portfolios by investing in traditional assets like stocks and bonds and digital assets like cryptocurrencies. RCO Finance also introduces tokenized real-world assets, allowing users to invest in traditionally illiquid markets like real estate and commodities. As the RCO Finance platform grows, analysts project that RCOF could outpace ETH in terms of price appreciation, especially once it officially launches. Why RCOF Could Be a Better Buy Than ETH Right Now At the moment, RCOF could represent a better investment opportunity than ETH for several reasons. While Ethereum (ETH) has long been a solid investment within the DeFi space, RCO Finance (RCOF) offers unique advantages that could yield higher returns in the short to medium term. RCOF‚Äôs wide range of use cases within the RCO Finance ecosystem makes it a versatile token with strong growth potential. As the platform‚Äôs ecosystem expands, so will the RCOF token‚Äôs value. Moreover, the hype around AI-powered platforms, like RCO Finance, positions RCOF to grow substantially. AI-driven financial tools are becoming increasingly popular, and RCO Finance‚Äôs advanced capabilities set it apart from other platforms. RCOF‚Äôs tokenomics further enhance its appeal. With 50% of tokens allocated for public sale and 12% locked for liquidity, the tokenomics are designed to maintain stability and prevent manipulation. The presale stages have already demonstrated significant price surges, and the listing price is expected to skyrocket to between $0.4 and $0.6, offering potential gains far beyond what Ethereum (ETH) currently offers. Investors looking for an opportunity to multiply their holdings exponentially may find that RCOF offers the best crypto investment available today.

The price plunged over 11%, briefly dipping below the $170 mark before staging an impressive recovery. In just a few hours, SOL managed to reclaim the $182 level, a critical demand zone that has proven to be a key area of interest for investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Forming A 1-Hour Symmetrical Triangle ‚Äì Bullish Breakout Or Deeper Correction? Top analyst Jelle shared a technical price chart highlighting Solana‚Äôs resilience during this turbulent period. According to Jelle, SOL took out its recent lows, successfully retested the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), and ultimately closed the day above all significant key levels. This pattern indicates potential strength in the market and raises the question: what‚Äôs next for Solana? Investors and traders are eyeing the next move as¬†Solana consolidates above its critical demand zone. Will Solana leverage this recovery to push toward new highs, or will bearish pressure take over again? The coming days will be pivotal in determining the trajectory of this market leader. Solana Shows Strength After Weeks of Selling Pressure Solana (SOL) is displaying renewed strength after enduring a 36% decline from its all-time high of $264 in late November to yesterday‚Äôs low of $168. The sharp drop followed weeks of consistent selling pressure, leaving investors uncertain about the immediate future. However, optimism is beginning to return as SOL shows signs of resilience. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Solana‚Äôs impressive recovery in recent price action. According to Jelle, SOL took out its recent lows, retested the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) successfully, and closed the day above all critical levels. This behavior suggests that buyers are stepping in at key support zones, providing a much-needed lifeline to the price. Jelle also points out that reclaiming the $210 mark could set the stage for Solana to challenge its previous highs. While optimism builds following yesterday‚Äôs rebound, caution is warranted as further consolidation or retests of support levels remain possible. The market‚Äôs next phase will largely depend on whether Solana can maintain its newfound momentum. Related Reading: Chainlink Forms A Daily Bullish Pattern ‚Äì Top Analyst Eyes Breakout To $30 As SOL continues to stabilize, investors are keeping a close eye on critical resistance levels, particularly the $210 mark, which could signal the start of a new bullish trend. However, with lingering risks, the coming days will be crucial in determining Solana‚Äôs ability to sustain its recovery and potentially move toward new highs. Price Action: Testing Crucial Levels Solana (SOL) is trading at $186, showing signs of stabilization after a sharp recovery from its recent lows. However, the price has yet to confirm a breakout above the $192 level, a critical resistance zone that bulls need to reclaim to shift market sentiment and potentially change the current trend. A successful reclaim of the $192 mark would signal strength and open the door for further upside. The next significant target for SOL would be breaking above the local high near $223, which could pave the way for a broader bullish trend. Such a move would likely attract renewed investor interest and signal that the market is ready for a sustained rally. On the flip side, failing to reclaim the $192 level could expose Solana to downside risks. In such a scenario, the price may revisit lower demand zones, potentially testing support levels around $170. This would extend the consolidation phase and delay any significant upward momentum.
