This decision comes just 6 days before Gary Gensler, the commission‚Äôs chairman, leaves the agency. Per the filing from the commission, this delay is not a denial as it requires more time to consider the application. The US SEC Notification According to the notice shared by the market regulator, it chose to delay the approval or denial of this filing considering the key factors it has to consider. From the time the asset manager filed the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, the US SEC had an obligation by law to give its consideration within 45 days. The markets regulator filed the decision to delay this proposed rule change three days before the January 17 deadline. Following this delay, the US SEC said it has now fixed March 3, 2025, as the next tentative date to give its decision on the filing. ‚ÄúThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,‚Äù the SEC statement reads, adding that it is designating ‚ÄúMarch 3, 2025, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.‚Äù Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF Approval is Possible It is worth noting that the asset manager applied to list the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund in late November. After successfully operating a spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US, the asset manager chose to expand its supported crypto assets. Bitwise designed the 10 crypto index ETF to provide exposure to the biggest digital currencies by market capitalization. These assets include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Polkadot (DOT), and Uniswap (UNI). While uncertainty clouded approval prospects under outgoing Chairman Gary Gensler, there is reason to remain optimistic now. President-elect Donald Trump nominated Paul Atkins , a crypto-industry-backed candidate, to replace Gensler. With Atkins calling the shots, many industry proponents believe other crypto ETF products are possible. Other Crypto ETFs To Watch Besides the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF, other crypto ETF products like Solana and XRP ETF are also awaiting feedback from the US SEC. Judging by the emergence of Donald Trump, industry optimists believe other crypto ETF products might also be filed soon. In addition to the Solana and XRP funds, asset manager Canary Capital has also pushed for Litecoin and Hedera ETFs.

His comment comes amid the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Garlinghouse‚Äôs remarks highlight the growing frustration in the crypto industry, with many stakeholders demanding clearer regulations. There is a strong call for a shift away from the enforcement-heavy approach defining Gensler‚Äôs tenure. The Clash Between Ripple and the SEC Ripple and the SEC‚Äôs legal dispute traces back to December 2020, when the SEC accused Ripple of offering XRP as an unregistered security. In a landmark 2023 ruling, the court sided with Ripple, asserting that XRP sales to retail investors did not qualify as securities. However, the SEC is appealing this decision, setting the stage for a high-stakes legal showdown. In a recent post on X, Garlinghouse criticized Gensler‚Äôs approach, accusing him of doubling down on a failed strategy. Ripple‚Äôs legal team also expressed disappointment over the SEC‚Äôs refusal to extend the January 15 deadline for its appeal brief. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, slammed the agency‚Äôs decision as a misuse of taxpayer dollars while expressing confidence in Ripple‚Äôs legal position. Gensler‚Äôs Exit Sparks Hope for Clearer Crypto Regulations Gensler‚Äôs departure comes as concerns grow about the SEC‚Äôs tough approach. Many say the agency has been too harsh and lacks clear rules for crypto. In a recent CNBC interview, Gensler argued that all tokens, except Bitcoin, should be treated as securities. This is due to issues with anti-money laundering and other regulations. He said the crypto industry demands stricter oversight. This has left many in the industry hoping for fairer rules under new leadership as Gensler leaves office on January 20. There is a sense of cautious optimism within Ripple and the wider crypto community. Alderoty looks forward to working with new SEC leadership and is hopeful that the regulatory landscape will shift toward clearer guidelines for digital assets. Industry leaders also speculate that Gensler‚Äôs departure could lead to reforms that clarify token classifications and regulations more clearly. The Ripple Effect: Market Reactions and the Future of XRP Meanwhile, Ripple‚Äôs legal victories in the market have fueled optimism, with experts predicting a potential price surge for XRP. Analysts are even forecasting that the token could reach as high as $8 in the near future. The optimism surrounding XRP grows stronger with a massive $265 million transaction. This has sparked speculation about the token‚Äôs future trajectory. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.6, up by 4.60% in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data. As the legal fight goes on, the crypto industry feels more hopeful. JPMorgan analysts expect more interest in digital assets like XRP and Solana (SOL), with new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) coming soon. These changes, along with clearer rules, are boosting confidence in crypto‚Äôs future .

Earlier this month, the IRS was sued by Blockchain Association over the new reporting rule. Table of Contents New tax system IRS abolition IRS vs the crypto community New tax system The H.R. 25 bill, or The Fair Tax Act of 2025 , was introduced by Rep. Earl ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù Carter (R‚ÄìGA). The bill challenges the existing U.S. tax code and the taxation policy status quo and aims to promote freedom, fairness, and economic opportunity. The Fair Tax Act calls to repeal the income, payroll, estate, and gift taxes. Instead, the act proposes enacting the sales tax. The Fair Tax Act: ‚úÖAbolishes the IRS ‚úÖRepeals the Tax Code ‚úÖPuts American in charge of their tax rate ‚úÖForces illegal immigrants to pay taxes & more ‚Äì read hereüëá https://t.co/SjLO4RRaKR ‚Äî Buddy Carter (@RepBuddyCarter) January 10, 2025 According to the bill, the existing Federal income tax retards the economic growth and international competitiveness of the U.S., discourages small businesses and farms, and downgrades the standard of living of Americans, decreasing the savings and investment rates. On top of that, the bill indicates the harm of the existing unnecessary administrative and compliance cost pressure on individual and corporate taxpayers. Privacy violations and lack of transparency in taxation are other problems associated with the Federal income tax. According to the Fair Tax Act, the Social Security, Medicare payroll taxes, and self-employment taxes hurdles employment rates. The alternative proposed in the bill is a broad-based national sales tax on goods and services purchased for final consumption. The act proposes to tax all consumption of goods and services in the U.S. once, preventing double, multiple, and cascading taxation. According to the bill, it will facilitate savings and investment, improve the standard of living of Americans, help businesses, and undo all other evils associated with the actual tax system. Also, the Fair Tax Act provides notes on how the government should foster the change in the policy. IRS abolition One of the most radical changes proposed in the Fair Tax Act is the Internal Revenue Service abolition. The move is meant to get rid of the bureaucratic burdens on individual and business taxpayers. According to Carter, the tax system introduced in the legislation eliminates the need for the IRS. The taxes should be easy and transparent so that people will not need professional assistance to fill out their taxes. The bill is supported by a number of Republican congressmen, including Barry Loudermilk, Eric Burlison, John Carter, Scott Perry, John Rutherford, Warren Davidson, Andy Biggs, Dale Strong, Rich McCormick, Andy Harris, and Andrew Clyde. The latter noted that the act ‚Äúprovides a commonsense solution to eliminate the need for the weaponized IRS, simplify our tax code, and foster economic prosperity‚Äù. Rep. Strong adds that the proposed taxation system will make illegal immigrants pay taxes fairly. IRS vs the crypto community The IRS was sued over the new reporting rules introduced by the service the day the rules were introduced, i.e., on Dec. 28, 2024. The complaint is signed by several organizations, including Blockchain Association, Texas Blockchain Council, and DeFi Education Fund.

According to the new rules, DeFi platforms will be considered brokers. They will have to provide the transaction info and proceeds to the IRS until 2027. The complaint clears that DeFi platforms are not brokers, and that‚Äôs what makes them unique and innovative. As peer-to-peer systems, they don‚Äôt depend on brokers or any other intermediaries, so the IRS‚Äô new rules should not apply to them, but they do. The plaintiffs find the rules unconstitutional and harmful to American development and leadership in the crypto industry. They note that if the rules get into effect, this may impact many leading industry brands to find better jurisdictions instead of working in America. Considering this, the IRS abolition may be seen as a possibility to end the service‚Äôs attacks on the DeFi ecosystems. However, it is not clear yet if the Fair Tax Act of 2025 will be adopted. The history of the act began back in 1999. Will 2025 be a breakthrough year? We‚Äôll see.

Simultaneously, Filecoin‚Äôs price prediction becomes a hot topic, with debates on whether FIL can break past $10 by 2025. On the flip side, Web3Bay , also known as 3BAY, is transforming the traditional e-commerce arena dominated by platforms like Amazon by offering a decentralized solution that provides sellers with no setup fees, instant payouts, and access to a global market. Moreover, Web3Bay‚Äôs crypto presale has amassed over $660K, spotlighting the 3BAY token as a potentially profitable opportunity for early investors, anticipating a significant value increase at its launch. BNB Price Analysis: Crucial Levels and Market Trends BNB‚Äôs price movements are closely watched by traders, who analyze key Fibonacci levels and their impacts on the market. The $709.61 level acts as a possible support area, suggesting reversal points, while the $733.42 level indicates resistance where bullish momentum might slow. Volume increases near these levels show changes in market sentiment, with rising selling pressure as prices near resistance. BNB‚Äôs price movements near the $607.16 support area are critical, as historical interest here might signal either a rebound or a deeper price drop. Can FIL Reach Over $10 by 2025? Filecoin‚Äôs price prediction is increasingly discussed as the digital currency picks up speed, with predictions for potential highs through 2025. If positive trends continue, FIL might near the $10 mark, supported by innovations like the Filecoin Virtual Machine that enhance decentralized app functionality. Yet, obstacles from established providers and scalability issues might slow its growth. Technical analysis suggests FIL‚Äôs price could see a 35% rise to reach the $8.42 retracement level, with its future price also dependent on adoption rates and broader market conditions. Web3Bay Sets New E-commerce Standards‚Äî Early Backers Can Reap 6,430% ROI Web3Bay is reshaping online selling by offering a decentralized e-commerce platform that simplifies operations for entrepreneurs worldwide. Built on blockchain, it removes traditional barriers like setup fees and delayed payouts that burden platforms like Amazon. Sellers gain global reach through a secure, transparent ecosystem powered by the 3BAY token. This platform revolutionizes seller-buyer connections, providing tools that drive growth in an ever-changing digital economy. The 3BAY token ensures quick, affordable, and seamless transactions. Sellers benefit from its liquidity, instant payouts, and cross-chain capabilities, facilitating smooth international operations.

With over $660K raised in the ongoing presale and a current price of $0.0039675, early adopters stand to gain substantial returns. The launch price of $0.1959 represents a staggering 6,430% ROI. As more sellers join Web3Bay, demand for 3BAY is set to surge, offering significant profit potential for early participants. The Bottom Line In the recent market trends, Traders keep a keen eye on BNB‚Äôs price movements, where Fibonacci levels reveal potential market opportunities. Meanwhile, Filecoin‚Äôs price prediction also shows its potential in decentralized storage, anticipated to rise with technological advancements and increased adoption. However, Web3Bay is pioneering a new era in e-commerce. By enabling global sellers through no fees, immediate payouts, and enhanced blockchain functionality, it sets a new standard in decentralized marketplaces . With the ongoing crypto presale and the promising capabilities of the 3BAY token, early engagement could yield substantial investor gains as the market demand escalates.

A whale liquidated 10,070 ETH, resulting in an approximate loss of $1 million. The sell-off transpired as Ethereum‚Äôs price faltered in sustaining momentum, hovering around $3,280 during the transaction. Related Reading: Rebound Alert: US Bitcoin ETF Interest Picks Up Speed In 2025 A Whale‚Äôs Desperate Maneuver The decision to sell a large amount of ETH is notable. This particular whale knows the market well; it took out 24,029 ETH from Binance a few weeks ago, which is worth about $81 million. Even with this new deal, the whale still has 13,959 ETH, which is worth about $45 million. The speed with which this sell-off has been carried out suggests that there may be underlying factors influencing their strategy. Whales are dumping $ETH at a loss! 9 hours ago, 3 wallets(likely belonging to the same whale) sold 10,070 $ETH for 33M $DAI at $3,280, losing $1M. This whale withdrew 24,029 $ETH($81.3m) from #Binance via 10 new wallets 3 weeks ago and currently holds 13,959 $ETH($45.48M).‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/5lqFegRu3i ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 13, 2025 Bringing Down Market Sentiment The crypto market as a whole is unstable, and Ethereum‚Äôs price is following suit. The value of ETH has dropped by 2.50% in the last 24 hours, and it is now worth about $3,177. This drop is the lowest price level in a week and shows why investors are worried about their assets. The mood in the market is changing from excitement to caution as many traders get ready for more price retreats. The Broader Perspective There are other instances of this sell-off. Other prominent players in the Ethereum ecosystem are also unloading their holdings. As part of a systematic transfer strategy, TRON founder Justin Sun recently sent about $320 million in Ethereum to exchanges. These actions suggest that many whales are responding to market conditions by selling their holdings rather than holding onto them in anticipation of potential future gains. Analysts remain somewhat confident in spite of these sell-offs and the overall negative trend. Some predict that Ethereum might hit all-time highs‚Äîpossibly surpassing $10,000 by the middle of 2025‚Äîif market sentiment improves and selling pressure lessens. This optimistic outlook is contingent upon future developments and innovations within the Ethereum ecosystem.

However, analysts are now highlighting an intriguing forecast for the emerging RCO Finance. They believe that RCOF could jump from $0.05 to $1 soon, delivering impressive gains to investors who buy in now. Let‚Äôs examine the factors driving the new altcoin into the spotlight, which has overshadowed the price prospects for XRP and Cardano. Forget Cardano Price And Let RCO Finnace‚Äôs AI Make Profits For You Despite the Cardano price and XRP crossing a key level, RCO Finance (RCOF) appears primed for a significant rally, driven by increasing demand for its unique features designed to improve investors‚Äô trading experience. One of the features is the robo-advisor, an artificial intelligence-based service that distinguishes the platform from traditional decentralized finance platforms. The main advantage of the robo-advisor is thus its ability to analyze data and, given the obtained results, offer the best investment tips. It also offers automatic trading, adjusting investors‚Äô portfolios in real-time according to their risk preferences and financial goals. This allows investors to relax and be confident that their investments are actively managed without constant monitoring. Moreover, investor trust in RCO Finance has been reinforced by a thorough audit from SolidProof, a leading security firm. This audit confirms that the DeFi trading platform meets high-security standards, establishing it as a reliable option for investing in altcoins. With no KYC requirements, traders can engage with the platform without compromising their personal information. This feature protects your identity and simplifies the trading process, making it easier to get started without the usual bureaucratic hurdles.. Cardano Price RSI Signals Overbought Conditions, Analysts Warn The Cardano price has soared to its highest level in seven months, climbing over 40% in the last seven days. This surge is linked to founder Charles Hoskinson‚Äôs comments about potentially supporting U.S. crypto policies if Donald Trump is re-elected in 2025. Currently, the Cardano price is trading around $0.53. However, some analysts warn the market may be overheating, with a potential price drop on the horizon. The RSI for Cardano price is at 78.79 , its highest since December 2023, suggesting it may be overbought. This could lead to selling pressure as investors take profits, driving the Cardano price down and ultimately making RCOF surpass it in the DeFi market. XRP Poised To Hit $0.665 But Lawsuit Might Slows Its Growth Down Analysts still maintain an optimistic tone regarding the XRP price outlook, with some convinced it could pierce through the $0.7655 level. However, there is a significant concern regarding the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. SEC. The SEC has accused Ripple of raising over $1.3 billion without proper registration. An appeal of a 2023 ruling filed last month could delay a final decision and hinder the XRP price momentum. As a result, RCOF may be a more promising option in the current market rally. RCOF Presale Poised To Shatter Market Expectations With Cardano and XRP at a pivotal moment, major investors reportedly hedge their bets with RCO Finance (RCOF) . This trend is evident in the ongoing token presale, which has already raised over $4.5 million. As of November 3, RCOF is in its third presale stage, with a token price of $0.0559 . Those purchasing RCOF could now see up to 900% returns when the token is listed at an anticipated price of between $0.40 and $0.60. Even more compelling, RCOF‚Äôs potential rise to $1 suggests a remarkable 19-fold increase from its current price, surpassing the impressive growth that the Cardano price experienced in 2021. And the exciting part? You can get 50% off the token value using the promo code RCOF50. So, why not join the presale now?

Here‚Äôs What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-recovers-above-key-support-level-heres-what-it-means/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has demonstrated notable resilience by reclaiming its position above the crucial 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.00002082, avoiding a potential breakdown. This recovery is a welcome development for investors as it indicates renewed buying interest and signals the possibility of stabilization in the near term. The 200 EMA is often the dividing line between bullish and bearish trends. A drop below this level could have triggered a deeper downward spiral and marked the onset of a prolonged bear market for SHIB. However, its ability to hold above this critical support level reflects underlying strength in the asset‚Äôs price action. Current Price Action and Key Resistance Levels As of report time, SHIB is trading at $0.00002169, attempting to establish a foothold after testing its support. The asset faces significant resistance at the 26 EMA and 50 EMA, positioned at $0.00002242 and $0.00002271, respectively. Breaking through these resistance levels would be essential for SHIB to reignite its bullish momentum and sustain upward movement. However, if SHIB struggles to breach these resistance zones, it may retrace to the consolidation phase, oscillating between the 200 EMA as support and the 50 EMA as resistance. This sideways movement could act as a period of accumulation, giving the market time to reset before making a decisive move. SHIB/USDT Chart; TradingView Technical Indicators Signal a Neutral Stance The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 45, placing SHIB in a neutral zone. This indicates that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold , suggesting that traders are still weighing the next direction for the token. What Could Influence SHIB‚Äôs Next Move? Several external factors could play a role in SHIB‚Äôs price trajectory in the coming days, these include: Market Sentiment: The overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market remains a driving force. Positive developments in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum could support altcoins like SHIB. Whale Activity: Shiba Inu is no stranger to large transactions by whales. Any notable accumulation by significant holders could signal increased confidence in the token and trigger further buying interest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Network Developments: Continued progress within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as the Shibarium‚Äôs adoption or partnerships that boost utility, could serve as catalysts for price appreciation. Macro Trends: Broader economic factors, including interest rate decisions, inflation data, and regulatory developments, may also influence SHIB‚Äôs movement as part of the larger crypto market. Outlook for SHIB In the short term, SHIB‚Äôs ability to maintain its position above the 200 EMA will be critical for its stability. Investors will closely monitor its attempts to break through the 26 EMA and 50 EMA resistance levels. If SHIB manages to surpass these obstacles, it could pave the way for a retest of higher resistance zones and potentially reignite bullish sentiment. Conversely, failure to move past these levels may result in range-bound trading, offering an opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate at current levels. Ultimately, SHIB‚Äôs trajectory will depend on the interplay between technical indicators, market sentiment, and external developments. Its recovery above the 200 EMA is a positive sign, but sustained momentum will be key to ensuring a more bullish outlook.

Investors are increasingly optimistic about the approval of the first spot Solana (SOL) and spot XRP ETPs, especially with expectations of a more favorable regulatory environment under President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. In a Jan. 13 report shared with Cointelegraph , JPMorgan estimated that SOL and XRP ETPs could surpass the performance of spot Ether (ETH) ETFs within their first six months of trading. ‚ÄúWhen applying these so-called ‚Äòadoption rates‚Äô to SOL and XRP, we see SOL attracting roughly $3 billion‚Äì$6 billion of net assets and XRP gathering $4 billion‚Äì$8 billion in net new assets,‚Äù the report stated. The forecast comes after the first anniversary of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which reached nearly $110 billion in cumulative holdings on Jan. 2. Bitcoin ETFs accounted for around 75% of new investments when Bitcoin reclaimed $50,000 in February, just a month after their debut. However, altcoin ETP adoption remains uncertain due to fluctuating investor demand. While Bitcoin ETFs saw a 6% adoption rate and Ether ETFs achieved 3% in their first six months, interest in altcoins like SOL and XRP is less predictable. ‚ÄúOutside of a few primary tokens (BTC, ETH, SOL), the episodic nature of the crypto market is driven by varying investor sentiment and trendy new coins that may capture incremental attention for a limited time,‚Äù JPMorgan‚Äôs report explained. Several asset managers, including VanEck, Grayscale, and 21Shares, have submitted applications for Solana ETFs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to make preliminary decisions by late January, with Grayscale‚Äôs deadline set for Jan. 23 and others by Jan. 25. Alejo Pinto, founder of Solana Layer-2 network Lumio, commented, ‚ÄúAn ETF approval in the U.S. would have a positive price impact on Solana since the probability is low and therefore not yet priced in.‚Äù",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-14 23:15:00

Experts say the deal represents a ‚Äútectonic shift‚Äù in the domestic traditional finance and crypto sectors. Whereas South Korean crypto exchanges once had to win banks over, tradfi firms are now actively pursuing deals with coin trading platforms, analysts believe. Bithumb‚Äôs Brand-new Banking Deal Bithumb trading volumes over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) The deal has been in the pipelines since at least August last year, when Cryptonews.com reported that Bithumb was preparing to dump its long-term partner NongHyup Bank (NH) in favor of a deal with the latter‚Äôs rival KB . The South Korean newspaper Electronic Times reported that sources familiar with the deal said Bithumb will start migrating its customers from NH to KB ‚Äúon February 24.‚Äù A branch of Kookmin (KB) Bank in South Korea.

Both Bithumb and KB are hoping the deal will help them boost their market presence. The exchange currently has a market share of 20%, but is hoping to gain ground on Upbit as it chases a New York Stock Exchange listing. The media outlet called Bithumb‚Äôs move ‚Äúa strategic decision.‚Äù It pointed out that KB ‚Äúhas a solid base of 20-39 year-old customers. This demographic is key in the South Korean crypto market, where younger citizens remain extremely crypto-keen.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing whether Cardano (ADA), XRP, or the emerging Remittix (RTX) will reach $5 first. Table of Contents Cardano poses for a bullish comeback XRP presents buy opportunity amid fluctuations Remittix set to transform global payments Conclusion Cardano is experiencing recent declines but shows promise for a major comeback. On the other hand XRP‚Äôs technical signs point to possible increases. Meanwhile, Remittix is transforming global payments and establishing itself as a financial industry game-changer. The competition to reach $5 first is intense since every one of these top crypto coins presents special benefits. Cardano poses for a bullish comeback The Cardano price momentarily surged to the $1.14 resistance level before falling towards the $0.92 support. Looking at the larger trend, the Cardano price has declined by over 8% in the past month, indicating a bearish phase for the altcoin. Nonetheless, the general sentiment of the Cardano community is still quite positive, suggesting hope for its near-term move. The 2025 Cardano price forecasts point to a good trading range ‚Äî between $0.95 and $5.10. XRP presents buy opportunity amid fluctuations Showing indecisiveness, the XRP price has been consolidating between $2.60 and $2.20 for the past week. The XRP chart shows that the altcoin is much below its 2018 all-time high (ATH) of $3.8. Nevertheless, market analysts and investors are hopeful about the future of XRP since forecasts point to a possible new ATH by the end of Q1 2025. Technical indicators such as the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages support these forecasts. Considering this, XRP is among the promising altcoins to watch in 2025, providing a mix of long-term growth potential and short-term promise.

By supporting over 30 currencies and offering same-day transfers with no foreign exchange fees, the platform will provide a reliable and affordable solution for both individuals and businesses. Central to this transformation is the RTX token, considered one of the most promising cryptos currently available. With over $2.7 million raised during its presale at $0.0199 per token, RTX is anticipated to experience a dramatic price increase in Q1 2025. As demand for low-cost, fast, and efficient payment solutions continues to grow, early RTX adopters have a unique opportunity to benefit. Conclusion Although Cardano and XRP show great promise for growth, Remittix is positioned to transform the financial sector with its creative approach. RTX has a competitive edge from the rising need for quick, reasonably priced, safe cross-border payments. As investor demand keeps rising amid the limited token supply, analysts anticipate a rally to $5 for RTX in this bull run.

Furthermore, Web3Bay leverages smart contracts to streamline transactions, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs.

Let‚Äôs break down why these meme coins are poised for a wild ride, and how you can position yourself for massive gains. 1. Arctic Pablo: A Journey to Prosperity Arctic Pablo is not just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs a journey wrapped in an adventurous narrative that fuses myth with reality. The coin takes you to the frosty, uncharted territories of Icyopolis, where Arctic Pablo, the daring explorer, embarks on a thrilling journey to uncover hidden treasures in the form of $APC tokens. These tokens are more than just a cryptocurrency; they represent a mystical gateway to potential riches, made all the more enticing by the coin‚Äôs presale structure. Arctic Pablo‚Äôs presale is uniquely divided by locations, with each phase offering a new opportunity for early investors to get in on the action. The coin‚Äôs appeal isn‚Äôt just in the potential for massive ROI; it‚Äôs in the scarcity built into the tokenomics. Every week, the unsold tokens from the presale are burned, reducing supply and driving up value. The Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is currently priced at $0.00002, but it‚Äôs set to increase every week, with the final presale price set at $0.0008 before launching at $0.008. This gives early investors a staggering ROI potential of over 39,900% from the second stage to the launch. It‚Äôs an exciting, deflationary ecosystem that‚Äôs designed for massive growth. Why did this coin make it to this list? Arctic Pablo Coin stands out not just for its presale potential, but also for the unique narrative and token burn mechanisms that can skyrocket its value as demand surges.

Snek: The Slithering Meme Coin Snek has slithered its way into the meme coin spotlight, showing no signs of slowing down. This meme coin draws inspiration from the viral internet culture surrounding serpents and reptiles, capitalizing on a unique, easily recognizable brand that‚Äôs rapidly gaining traction. While its meme status is strong, Snek offers more than just viral potential‚Äîit‚Äôs backed by a growing community that‚Äôs actively participating in staking and token burns. This adds a layer of sustainability that many other meme coins lack. Why did this coin make it to this list? Snek‚Äôs combination of community involvement, staking opportunities, and meme culture gives it the perfect ingredients for success in 2025. If you want a meme coin that balances fun with profitability, Snek deserves a serious look. 3. Fartcoin: A Fart of Fun and Value Fartcoin may sound lighthearted and quirky, but don‚Äôt let its name fool you‚Äîit‚Äôs quickly becoming a serious contender in the meme coin market. With a focus on humor and community, Fartcoin has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts who are looking for something unique and playful. But behind the meme, Fartcoin has a serious plan for growth, using a tokenomics model that includes deflationary mechanics and regular burns to boost scarcity. Why did this coin make it to this list? Fartcoin may be built on a lighthearted concept, but the community and deflationary mechanisms give it real investment potential. With growing user engagement and a solid burn strategy, Fartcoin is an underrated meme coin with the potential to outperform many others in 2025.

From the trusted Ethereum (ETH) to the fast-rising BigBossInu, these digital assets are poised for substantial gains. Investors are locking onto these top picks as they prepare for the market to take off. BigBossInu‚Äôs Presale Ignites: A Powerful Opportunity for Investors Big Boss Inu is the ultimate game-changer in the crypto universe, proving its dominance with six-figure funding in record time and a community that‚Äôs multiplying at lightning speed.

Recent developments include Ripple‚Äôs expansion into Brazil and Dubai, securing key partnerships that could boost XRP‚Äôs long-term prospects. Analysts suggest that if XRP can break past the $2.5 resistance level, it could aim for $3.0, but a drop below $2.0 may lead to a further decline‚Äã. Cardano (ADA) has been trading between $0.87 and $0.92, with signs of oversold conditions that may present an opportunity for a price rebound. But ADA still faces pressure in the short term. Analysts suggest that ADA could push toward $1.50 if market conditions improve. >>> NEAR Protocol has been relatively quiet in recent weeks, but its fundamentals remain strong as it continues to grow its developer ecosystem. NEAR‚Äôs focus on scalability and user-friendly applications has kept it in the spotlight as a promising Layer-1 blockchain, though price action has been subdued amid broader market conditions. Polkadot (DOT) has been struggling to hold above the $6.83 mark, with recent declines pushing it below key support levels. However, DOT‚Äôs long-term potential remains solid due to its unique parachain ecosystem, which continues to attract attention from developers and investors. Conclusion As Bitcoin eyes a potential 700% surge, altcoins like BigBossInu, XRP, Cardano, NEAR Protocol, and Polkadot are positioned for explosive growth. BigBossInu‚Äôs presale, XRP‚Äôs global expansion, Cardano‚Äôs governance, and NEAR and Polkadot‚Äôs ecosystem development highlight their long-term potential.

The AI startup is hoping to use his expertise to advance the development of its artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company is prioritizing its resources on data centers and new energy resources. Ogunlesi earns another board position after joining Blackrock just last year Adebayo Ogunlesi joined Blackrock Inc. last year after they acquired his company, Global Infrastructure Partners, for about $12 billion. After that acquisition, Ogunlesi became worth about $2.3 billion and is currently Blackrock‚Äôs Senior Managing Director and a board member. Before founding Global Infrastructure Partners, Ogunlesi worked for more than twenty years at Credit Suisse, an investment banking company. Not to mention, he holds other board positions at Topgolf Callaway Brands, Kosmos Energy Holdings, and Terminal Investment Ltd. Now, OpenAI wants to use Ogunlesi‚Äôs experience to better itself, inviting him to join its board of directors. OpenAI has been trying to acquire more data centers and energy resources to grow its infrastructure; at this time, calling Ogunlesi might help. On Tuesday, Ogunlesi shared his willingness to work with the AI startup: As part of this, thoughtful strategies and investment in infrastructure will be key to unlocking AI‚Äôs full potential and delivering its benefits responsibly. I‚Äôm excited to contribute to this effort and look forward to being a part of the OpenAI Board. Adebayo Ogunlesi OpenAI began restructuring its board in late 2023, adding two new members in 2024: Instacart CEO Fidji Simo and Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, now known as the Gates Foundation. OpenAI is planning to launch new AI projects in the coming months OpenAI has increasingly invested in new infrastructure projects, asking for funding from the private and public sectors. According to Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation Energy Corporation, CEO Altman wants to build five to seven data centers, each 5GW. Another source claimed that Open AI wants to devote its attention to a single data center before potentially expanding to others. Besides, the AI startup is still planning to host several events in Washington, D.C., and two key swing states to rally support and investments. The company has also planned its ‚Äúeconomic blueprint‚Äù for AI this January, calling on public and private sectors to collaborate in AI developments to ensure the US stays ahead of China. The company is also set to announce new AI projects in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Alabama in the coming months.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With Dogwifhat (WIF) down 45% in 30 days and struggling to break above $2, Flockerz (FLOCK) is gaining investors‚Äô attention. Table of Contents WIF breaking above the $2 mark: Technical analysis Investors turn to this meme coin as WIF trades range-bound Popular dog-themed meme coin Dogwifhat has been navigating a tough period since December 2024, with its price dropping by 45% over the past month. The token has seen a slight rebound of around 4% over the past day, currently trading at $1.55. However, an analysis of its price performance shows that WIF remains in a broader bearish trend that requires considerable buying pressure to reverse. WIF breaking above the $2 mark: Technical analysis The moving averages suggest mixed signals for the WIF token. The 9-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $1.472 is below the current price, offering short-term support, while the 9-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1.493 supports a slightly bullish outlook. These levels indicate a fragile recovery, but the real test lies in WIF‚Äôs ability to push past the critical $2 mark, a psychological and technical barrier. The Bollinger Bands reflect reduced volatility, with the upper band at $1.622 and the lower band at $1.422. This narrow range highlights the importance of breaking through $1.622 to spark a bullish rally. Conversely, a drop below $1.422 could signal the continuation of the downward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering around 35, suggesting oversold conditions that may attract buyers. However, the MACD shows a bearish crossover, indicating weak momentum. A reversal in these indicators will be crucial for WIF to gather the strength needed for a meaningful rally.

One notable option is Flockerz , a transformative meme coin introducing a vote-to-earn system that empowers its community while incentivizing token holding. The project will allow FLOCK holders to cast votes on various proposals, including decisions on its substantial treasury, rewarding them with additional tokens for their participation. The vote-to-earn mechanism creates a positive feedback loop where governance participation earns users more FLOCK tokens, which can then be staked for estimated APYs of 2276%. The project‚Äôs potential is evident in its massive presale success, surpassing $9.9 million in funding and attracting over 35,000 social media followers.

Table of Contents Catzilla: The fierce feline redefining meme coins Worldcoin on the brink of a major breakthrough Ondo eyes resistance level XRP aims for a break above $3 Uniswap‚Äôs awaited surge Conclusion A new presidency brings a wave of excitement and speculation to the cryptocurrency market. With bullish momentum already building, the inauguration could serve as a catalyst for unprecedented growth and opportunities in the dynamic world of crypto. As such, attention is turning to five standout coins that could thrive under this new era. Catzilla: The fierce feline redefining meme coins In the bustling meme coin arena, Catzilla is clawing its way to the top with unmatched ambition and charm. Inspired by the viral success of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe, Catzilla infuses meme culture with a fresh twist ‚Äî a towering, Godzilla-like cat wreaking havoc and capturing imaginations. Drawing from the chaotic energy of Japanese kaiju culture, this coin‚Äôs narrative is a magnet for gamers, anime fans, and crypto enthusiasts. Unlike fleeting meme coins that vanish as quickly as they rise, Catzilla is designed for longevity and impact. With a 14-stage presale starting at $0.0002 and climbing to $0.0016, investors have multiple chances to join the frenzy. Offering a 700% ROI, Catzilla proves it‚Äôs not just about fun ‚Äî it‚Äôs about serious financial potential. Catzilla isn‚Äôt just another meme coin; it‚Äôs a movement. Here‚Äôs why it stands out: Epic gameplay: Dive into a thrilling game inspired by Catzilla‚Äôs larger-than-life narrative while earning rewards.

Interested investors can join the revolution for a fairer, wilder crypto future via Catzilla‚Äôs presale. You might also like: From meme to millions: These 3 coins are breaking records Worldcoin on the brink of a major breakthrough Worldcoin‚Äôs price floats between $1.86 and $2.41. It‚Äôs still below both its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, hinting at a bearish trend. The coin has dipped over the past month and week, losing around 33% and 17% respectively. Despite this, WLD could bounce back soon. If it breaks above $3.08, momentum might push it toward $3.83, suggesting potential gains of over 60% from its lower range. The RSI sits under the midpoint, indicating it might be undervalued. Although past performance shows a downward trend, any positive market move could propel Worldcoin up. Ondo eyes resistance level Ondo is currently trading in the range of $1.10 to $1.40. The price is hovering near its 10-day moving average of $1.20 but is below the 100-day average of $1.23. Indicators show a balanced momentum with RSI at 50.62 and Stochastic at 80.28, suggesting potential growth. If bulls take charge, the first target is the $1.75 resistance, followed by a leap to around $2.16. Passing these levels could mark a price increase of about 45% to 50% from current prices. However, if support at $0.91 fails, it may test lower levels.

With resistance at $2.84, breaking past this level could easily see XRP targeting $3.24. Its RSI is around 61, pointing to potential further gains. Stochastic at 89 also hints at strong momentum. The 10-day SMA near $2.49 aligns well with the 100-day SMA of $2.43, supporting a potential upward continuation. Investors are watching closely, as XRP could leap higher, riding the wave of market optimism and broader crypto bull run expectations. Uniswap‚Äôs awaited surge Uniswap is poised for potential growth amid the altcoin season excitement. Currently priced between $12.14 and $14.38, it shows some resistance but signs of resilience. The nearest hurdle is at $17, but the crypto‚Äôs strong 6-month rise of over 62% shows promise. While the past week and month saw dips of nearly 3% and 20%, there are signals of a comeback. Key indicators like the high Stochastic index suggest possible upward momentum. If Uniswap breaks through $17, it could aim for the $20 mark, indicating a rise of at least 30%. Conclusion While coins like WLD, ONDO, XRP, and UNI show limited short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains and achieve new heights.

However, the cryptocurrency has since rebounded, trading back above $96,000 at the time of writing. This rapid recovery has drawn the attention of market analysts who are examining the underlying trends driving Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. Related Reading: Rebound Alert: US Bitcoin ETF Interest Picks Up Speed In 2025 Is Bitcoin‚Äôs Surge Above $96k A Stop Hunt? A CryptoQuant contributor, Mignolet, shared an analysis highlighting the recent price dynamics. According to the analyst, the recent drop in BTC to $89,000 and the current recovery was triggered by the breaking of a key short-term support level. Mignolet revealed that this pattern, referred to as ‚Äústop hunting,‚Äù occurs when price movements break support levels temporarily before recovering. Despite the recovery, Mignolet emphasizes that a true trend reversal would require stronger involvement from key market participants. Mignolet‚Äôs analysis points to significant selling activity among whale entities, as observed in Coinbase Premium Gap (CPG) data. Typically, buying whales step in to absorb such dips, creating notable market volatility. However, this time, such activity was absent, raising questions about the sustainability of the ongoing rebound. Additionally, Binance‚Äôs market-buy ratio data suggests that large-scale buyers on the exchange have not capitalized on the recent price movement, indicating cautious sentiment among key players. Further evidence disclosed by Mignolet comes from the exchange-traded fund (ETF) daily inflow and outflow data, which is yet to confirm any major shifts in market dynamics. While the daily candle pattern suggests a meaningful move, the lack of participation from whales could limit Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to sustain a long-term reversal. Mignolet also warned that market sentiment might shift too quickly to optimism without clear supporting data. The analyst noted: While the candle pattern signifies a meaningful move, the major players are not capitalizing on the opportunity. What concerns me more is that many people‚Äôs sentiment may quickly shift to a sense of relief too soon. Bitcoin Market Performance After seeing a notable plunge in price yesterday dropping below $90,000 and triggering a total liquidation of over $300 million in the crypto market, Bitcoin is finally seeing a noticeable reversal in its bearish trend. Particularly, over the past day, Bitcoin has increased by 5.6% bringing its price to trade at $96,351, at the time of writing. However, despite this increase, the asset is still roughly a 10.8% decrease away from its peak above $108,000 recorded last month. While Mignolet‚Äôs analysis suggested that Bitcoin bearishness might not be over yet, it is worth noting that the asset‚Äôs current recovery coincides with reduced selling activity from long-term holders. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Hit Its Peak In Summer 2025? Analysts Weigh In In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost revealed that the net position change of long-term holders (LTHs) over the past 30 days remains negative but shows signs of improvement. From a low of -827,000 BTC on December 5, the figure has improved to -246,000 BTC. This reduction in selling pressure suggests that LTHs are less inclined to sell at current price levels as Bitcoin‚Äôs price declines.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address ‚Äì 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI.

The case , titled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Musk , is docketed as 25-cv-00105 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. According to the complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in Washington, DC, the watchdog accuses Musk of intentionally failing to meet the required deadline to disclose his acquisition of more than a 5% stake in Twitter early in 2022, several months before completing his purchase of the social media platform. Alex Spiro, Musk‚Äôs attorney, dismissed the allegations, stating that the regulator‚Äôs action is ‚Äúan admission‚Äù of its inability to present a legitimate case. He claimed Musk ‚Äúhas done nothing wrong‚Äù and characterized the lawsuit as a ‚Äúsham.‚Äù Spiro said in a statement : The SEC‚Äôs multi-year campaign of harassment against Mr. Musk culminates in this filing of a single-count, administrative complaint under Section 13(d) for allegedly failing to submit one form‚Äîa procedural issue that, even if substantiated, would result in a nominal penalty . Alex Spiro The SEC claims Musk delayed disclosure to buy Twitter shares at artificially low prices The SEC‚Äôs investigation into Musk‚Äôs Twitter investment began in 2022 after the regulator sought an explanation for his failure to disclose his growing stake within the mandated timeframe. The regulator says Musk‚Äôs alleged non-compliance with disclosure rules allowed him to ‚Äúunderpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his financial beneficial ownership report was due. By March 2022, Musk had accumulated beneficial ownership of more than 9% of Twitter‚Äôs outstanding common stock. Under federal securities law, he was required to disclose this within 10 days, but the filing was delayed by 11 days. The lawsuit states that once the disclosure was made, Twitter‚Äôs stock price surged 27% the following day. The SEC seeks penalties from Musk amid lawsuits and political ties The SEC asked the court to direct Musk to pay a civil penalty and return profits, which the agency claims he reaped unjustly from his stock purchases. The agency declined to comment beyond the suit. Musk also faces investor litigation accusing him of hiding his acquisition of Twitter shares. Musk, the world‚Äôs richest individual, has recently emerged as one of Donald Trump‚Äôs prominent supporters and advisors. He has joined the president-elect‚Äôs discussions with foreign officials and, alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, is assisting with a government cost-cutting initiative.

While technical signals hint that Aave might be undervalued, market corrections are still a risk. In the web3 ecosystem, platforms like AIOZ Network and Web3Bay are introducing major changes. AIOZ Network is improving streaming by using blockchain and decentralized nodes to deliver content more effectively and at a lower cost. At the same time, Web3Bay (3BAY) is transforming online shopping by using blockchain for transparency and smart contracts to create a safer shopping experience and reduce fraud. The 3BAY token presale has raised over $660,000 so far, with a potential 6,430% return by launch, showing rising interest in how it could reshape the online business. Aave Price Prediction: Signs of a Potential Recovery? Aave price prediction for 2025 points to possible hurdles, suggesting a price range between $155 and $233. Although Aave ended 2024 on a high note due to updates like the V3 protocol and a brief rise above $300, it has since encountered downward trends. Technical indicators, such as a Relative Strength Index of 41 and a Total Value Locked (TVL) ratio of 0.21, suggest Aave could be undervalued. September may be key for a potential peak at $534.91, according to wave count analysis, but a following correction might weaken progress. These findings offer a cautious perspective for those tracking Aave price prediction trends. AIOZ Network Drives Sustainable Solutions in Decentralized Streaming AIOZ Network is reshaping the streaming industry with blockchain-based content delivery. Using a network of ‚ÄúEdge Nodes,‚Äù it provides faster, more reliable streaming while cutting costs and avoiding central servers. Recent improvements include advanced AI tools that adjust content delivery in real-time, reducing buffering and improving viewer experiences. This method not only enhances user satisfaction but also reduces environmental impact by using energy-saving nodes. As people look for affordable and eco-friendly solutions, AIOZ Network stands out in the push for better streaming services. Web3Bay Offers a Safer and Smarter Way to Shop Online Web3Bay is a decentralized shopping platform growing within the web3 ecosystem, changing how buyers and sellers connect. Built on blockchain, it removes middlemen to provide a secure, transparent marketplace. By tackling issues like high fees, fraud, and data theft, Web3Bay creates a safer space for online shopping. Central to this system is the 3BAY token, which powers payments and builds trust among users. A standout feature of Web3Bay is its focus on transparency. Smart contracts handle payments and dispute resolutions automatically, ensuring fairness without third parties. All transactions are stored on an unchangeable blockchain, offering a clear and permanent record. This openness prevents fraud and boosts user confidence. Additionally, Web3Bay‚Äôs decentralized setup spreads data across its network, reducing security risks and offering users peace of mind. The 3BAY token is more than just a way to pay‚Äîit‚Äôs a key part of the web3 ecosystem. In its third presale phase, 3BAY has raised over $660,000, currently priced at $0.0039675. As the presale continues, the price rises with each stage, aiming for a final price of $0.1959. Early buyers stand to gain, with a projected 6,430% return at launch. As Web3Bay grows, the increasing demand for 3BAY tokens highlights its promise to change secure, user-friendly online shopping in the web3 ecosystem. Final Thoughts As the crypto market changes, new projects offer fresh opportunities. Aave price prediction models show chances for growth but also warn about market downturns, making it worth watching. Meanwhile, AIOZ Network is improving streaming with its blockchain-based, eco-friendly system, likely growing as more people seek decentralized content options. Yet, Web3Bay is drawing the most attention as it aims to transform online shopping through blockchain security and transparency in the web3 ecosystem. With its 3BAY token presale raising over $660,000 and an expected 6,430% return for early supporters, 3BAY may become the next big success in crypto .

Anthony Pompliano Proposes Repealing SAB 12 In a recent video on X , Anthony Pompliano‚Äôs first recommendation was to repeal Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). This regulation currently limits banks from holding digital assets, requiring them to classify these holdings as liabilities. Pompliano argues that removing this barrier would allow banks to hold Bitcoin on behalf of their customers. This would foster institutional demand for cryptocurrency. According to Anthony Pompliano, enabling financial institutions to incorporate Bitcoin into their balance sheets could create a more robust ecosystem for the digital asset. This change could also provide U.S. banks with a competitive edge in the growing global cryptocurrency market. It is important to note that Bitwise Chief Investment Officer also shared insights on trends in corporate BTC adoption under Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto policies. He emphasized MicroStrategy‚Äôs aggressive Bitcoin strategy, new FASB rules enabling firms to record price gains, Creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for National Growth Another action proposed by Anthony Pompliano was to establish a national Bitcoin reserve. He highlighted that the U.S. government already possesses approximately 200,000 Bitcoin, which could serve as a foundation for building such a reserve. Anthony Pompliano suggested that increasing the government‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings, rather than liquidating them, would be a prudent move. He emphasized that Bitcoin‚Äôs growing utility as a store of value and hedge against inflation could benefit the economy in the long term. The Bitcoin advocate added, ‚ÄúIf Bitcoin is good for individuals or corporations, it‚Äôs going to be good for the country, too.‚Äù The growing Bitcoin prices and adoption have led to major corporate moves and acceptance. In a recent report, Genius Group approved a $33M rights offering to expand its Bitcoin Treasury to $86M. The offering allows shareholders to purchase shares at $0.50, with CEO Roger Hamilton planning to increase his stake by 10.3%. Tax Code Reforms Under Donald Trump Pompliano also urged Donald Trump to introduce tax reforms that would change how Bitcoin is treated under existing laws. Currently, Bitcoin is classified as property, meaning transactions involving the cryptocurrency are subject to capital gains tax. This classification creates complexities for consumers and businesses seeking to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. Pompliano proposed adjustments to the tax code to eliminate these barriers. Moreover, Anthony Pompliano concluded his recommendations stressing that these measures will propel the United States to the forefront of the digital currency revolution. Meanwhile, other countries like El Salvador have already integrated Bitcoin into their national strategies. This has inspired jurisdictions like Bhutan‚Äôs Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC). GMC plans to hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB in its strategic reserves, focusing on digital assets with large market capitalizations and liquidity.

A prime example is TRON‚Äôs blockchain innovation, which showcases its market strength by driving progress in decentralised applications and offering fast and low-cost transactions. At the same time, the Solana price outlook for 2025 presents a mix of optimism and caution, as analysts assess its growth potential amid market uncertainties. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is changing how global trade works with its borderless marketplace, where Web3 payments are made using its 3BAY token. Currently in presale stage 3 and priced at an accessible $0.0039675, the token‚Äôs growing utility and future potential make it an intriguing opportunity for early backers. TRON Blockchain Innovation Drives Market Gains TRON‚Äôs blockchain innovation seems limitless, backed by strong market performance and continuous advancements. With the ability to process over 2,000 transactions per second at minimal fees, TRON proves its dedication to building efficient and scalable blockchain solutions. As of January 2025, TRX‚Äôs price hovers around $0.2291, supported by a substantial 24-hour trading volume of $672 million and ongoing Tron blockchain innovation. This growth highlights the platform‚Äôs expanding adoption and appeal to developers and users alike. With recent surges in value and ongoing advancements, TRON‚Äôs blockchain innovation is redefining possibilities in decentralised applications and efficient digital transactions. Solana (SOL) Price Outlook: Balancing Bullish Trends & Risks The Solana (SOL) price outlook for 2025 reflects both cautious optimism and market uncertainties. Analysts highlight critical technical levels, with SOL currently trading near $190 and potential support around $165 if the price fails to rise further. Bullish projections suggest a move toward $264 or even $300, driven by positive technical patterns and ecosystem upgrades. However, short-term volatility remains, as whale transactions and regulatory decisions weigh on sentiment. Institutional interest in Solana-based ETFs could also influence future prices. Whether SOL experiences steady growth or fluctuates will largely depend on macroeconomic trends and the pace of network improvements. Web3Bay Smashes Global Trade Barriers with Web3 Payments Web3Bay is redefining how global trade works by removing the usual hurdles of traditional e-commerce. With its decentralised platform, Web3Bay opens up a borderless marketplace where buyers and sellers can interact without worrying about high fees, slow transactions, or banking restrictions. By integrating Web3 payments, the platform enables seamless transactions that transcend geographical limitations, creating a space where everyone can participate equally. The Web3Bay system is designed for accessibility and security. Its cryptocurrency-powered transactions bypass currency exchange issues, making cross-border trade more affordable and efficient. For those in underbanked regions, Web3Bay offers opportunities to engage in global commerce through Web3 payments, ensuring they aren‚Äôt left out of the digital economy. Decentralised storage further enhances the platform, guaranteeing privacy and reliability while maintaining a global presence. The 3BAY token is the driving force behind this ecosystem, and its crypto presale is rapidly gaining momentum. Currently priced at $0.0039675 in presale stage 3, with over $660,000 already raised, the token offers early holders a chance to secure impressive returns. With the token price rising at every stage and a launch price set at $0.1959, early participants from the first presale stage now have the potential to earn an impressive 6,430% ROI‚Äîan opportunity that‚Äôs hard to overlook. As Web3Bay continues to expand, the demand for 3BAY tokens is set to rise, making this a moment of opportunity for those who see the future of borderless trade. The Bottom Line To sum up, the crypto market is showcasing incredible opportunities across leading platforms. TRON‚Äôs blockchain innovation continues to advance decentralised applications with efficient and cost-effective transactions, solidifying its market position. Meanwhile, Solana‚Äôs price outlook for 2025 balances cautious optimism with the promise of long-term growth, driven by technical advancements and institutional interest. However, Web3Bay shines the brightest with its transformative vision for global trade. Powered by Web3 payments using its 3BAY token, the platform continues to break barriers in e-commerce. Currently available at the presale price of just $0.0039675 in stage 3, the 3BAY token offers a rare chance to get in early on a rapidly growing platform, with its utility in Web3 payments paving the way for widespread adoption and significant future value.

From Ethereum (ETH) to the fast-rising BigBossInu, these digital currencies are primed for considerable gains. Investors are focusing on these top picks, expecting them to lead the charge in the upcoming market rally. BigBossInu‚Äôs Hot Presale Unlocks Unprecedented Growth Potential BigBossInu with its record-breaking presale of over $100K raised in hours and a roadmap designed for exponential growth, analysts are calling it a must-have for massive returns. Big Boss Inu stands out with massive APY staking rewards , groundbreaking real-world partnerships, and innovative anti-dump mechanisms, making it a top pick for both short-term gains and long-term potential. If you‚Äôre ready to supercharge your portfolio, Big Boss Inu is the ultimate choice to lead your path to crypto dominance! >>>>>> XRP is seeing strong buying activity from whales, who have accumulated around 470 million XRP tokens. This signals confidence in XRP‚Äôs future, particularly with Ripple expanding its financial services globally, including plans for a stablecoin. XRP is currently trading around $0.60, with analysts expecting it could rise to $1 by the end of October if bullish momentum continues. Solana (SOL) is gaining attention from investors as its price hovers around $191, with key resistance at $190. Solana has been attracting significant interest due to its scalability and speed, making it a top choice for DeFi and NFT platforms. Analysts suggest that a break above $220 could lead to a surge toward $250. Kaspa (KAS) is gaining popularity thanks to its fast transaction speeds, enabled by its unique GHOSTDAG architecture. This allows Kaspa to handle parallel transactions efficiently, making it an attractive option for high-volume traders. Despite some volatility, Kaspa has shown significant growth and is positioning itself for further gains during the next bull run. >>> Polkadot (DOT) remains a key player in the interoperability space, but recent performance has been somewhat lackluster. DOT is currently trading below $7, but with developments in its parachain ecosystem, analysts are optimistic about its long-term potential as the market recovers. Conclusion As Bitcoin whales focus on the next big opportunities, cryptos like BigBossInu, XRP, Solana, Kaspa, and Polkadot are positioned for strong gains. BigBossInu‚Äôs presale success, XRP‚Äôs whale accumulation, and Solana‚Äôs scalability highlight the potential for 50x returns in 2025 .

Ethereum‚Äôs price has surged by more than 26%, climbing past the $3,338 mark and pushing its market capitalization to an impressive $400 billion. Amid Ethereum‚Äôs rise, a new under $1 altcoin is poised to potentially ride on Ethereum‚Äôs coattails to deliver a 9,000% surge. Ethereum Price Projected to Hit $4,000 in a Week Ethereum‚Äôs 26% price surge over the past seven days has left analysts optimistic about its future performance. The ETH price surge can be attributed to several factors, including renewed interest in Ethereum derivatives and a crypto-friendly outlook in the United States following Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory. As Ethereum‚Äôs market capitalization soared beyond $400 billion, so did investor confidence, propelling Ethereum to its current price of around $3,338. This surge reflects the growing demand for Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency in market cap. According to Farside Investors, Ethereum ETFs have also seen a boost, drawing millions of dollars in net inflows. As a result, institutional interest in Ethereum has spiked, contributing to the broader bullish sentiment in the crypto market. Ethereum‚Äôs price continues to rise, presenting a promising outlook for those seeking exposure to the digital asset space. According to ETH price predictions , if it closes above the resistance at $3,668, it is projected to hit the $4,000 mark before the end of this week. RCO Finance Riding on Ethereum‚Äôs Momentum for a Potential 9,000% Surge While Ethereum continues to captivate investors, another altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF), is positioning itself to capitalize on Ethereum‚Äôs bullish run. RCOF is currently in its third presale stage, and its token price has already surged by 337%, from an initial price of $0.01275 to $0.055882. This impressive rise in value shows the potential for further gains as the presale progresses. In the upcoming presale stage, RCOF‚Äôs price is expected to rise to $0.07770, representing a significant potential return for early investors. The final presale stages of RCOF are expected to bring a total surge of over 672.20%, with the price reaching an expected listing price of between $0.4 and $0.6. With such projections, the RCOF token offers investors an exceptional opportunity to multiply their investment exponentially. As the RCOF presale progresses and the native RCO Finance platform gets ready for launch, it‚Äôs clear that the token is on a trajectory to deliver substantial returns to those who get in early. When the platform goes live, and the RCOF token is listed, early investors could see their holdings soar by more than 9,000%‚Äîa rare opportunity for crypto enthusiasts looking to maximize their potential gains. Why RCO Finance (RCOF) Could Outpace Ethereum (ETH) RCO Finance (RCOF) is the native token of RCO Finance, a highly anticipated AI-powered decentralized trading platform designed to democratize access to sophisticated investment strategies. The RCOF token is set to see its value grow exponentially as its native platform grows. The RCO Finance platform integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to create fully automated, personalized investment strategies for its users through its groundbreaking AI-powered Robo Advisor. The Robo Advisor tailors the investment strategies to individual financial goals and risk preferences, making advanced investment strategies accessible to a broader audience. In addition to the AI-powered Robo Advisor, RCO Finance will also offer access to a vast range of assets, including over 120,000 across 12,500 asset classes. This will allow users to diversify their portfolios by investing in traditional assets like stocks and bonds and digital assets like cryptocurrencies. RCO Finance also introduces tokenized real-world assets, allowing users to invest in traditionally illiquid markets like real estate and commodities. As the RCO Finance platform grows, analysts project that RCOF could outpace ETH in terms of price appreciation, especially once it officially launches. Why RCOF Could Be a Better Buy Than ETH Right Now At the moment, RCOF could represent a better investment opportunity than ETH for several reasons. While Ethereum (ETH) has long been a solid investment within the DeFi space, RCO Finance (RCOF) offers unique advantages that could yield higher returns in the short to medium term. RCOF‚Äôs wide range of use cases within the RCO Finance ecosystem makes it a versatile token with strong growth potential. As the platform‚Äôs ecosystem expands, so will the RCOF token‚Äôs value. Moreover, the hype around AI-powered platforms, like RCO Finance, positions RCOF to grow substantially. AI-driven financial tools are becoming increasingly popular, and RCO Finance‚Äôs advanced capabilities set it apart from other platforms. RCOF‚Äôs tokenomics further enhance its appeal. With 50% of tokens allocated for public sale and 12% locked for liquidity, the tokenomics are designed to maintain stability and prevent manipulation. The presale stages have already demonstrated significant price surges, and the listing price is expected to skyrocket to between $0.4 and $0.6, offering potential gains far beyond what Ethereum (ETH) currently offers. Investors looking for an opportunity to multiply their holdings exponentially may find that RCOF offers the best crypto investment available today.

The price plunged over 11%, briefly dipping below the $170 mark before staging an impressive recovery. In just a few hours, SOL managed to reclaim the $182 level, a critical demand zone that has proven to be a key area of interest for investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Forming A 1-Hour Symmetrical Triangle ‚Äì Bullish Breakout Or Deeper Correction? Top analyst Jelle shared a technical price chart highlighting Solana‚Äôs resilience during this turbulent period. According to Jelle, SOL took out its recent lows, successfully retested the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), and ultimately closed the day above all significant key levels. This pattern indicates potential strength in the market and raises the question: what‚Äôs next for Solana? Investors and traders are eyeing the next move as¬†Solana consolidates above its critical demand zone. Will Solana leverage this recovery to push toward new highs, or will bearish pressure take over again? The coming days will be pivotal in determining the trajectory of this market leader. Solana Shows Strength After Weeks of Selling Pressure Solana (SOL) is displaying renewed strength after enduring a 36% decline from its all-time high of $264 in late November to yesterday‚Äôs low of $168. The sharp drop followed weeks of consistent selling pressure, leaving investors uncertain about the immediate future. However, optimism is beginning to return as SOL shows signs of resilience. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Solana‚Äôs impressive recovery in recent price action. According to Jelle, SOL took out its recent lows, retested the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) successfully, and closed the day above all critical levels. This behavior suggests that buyers are stepping in at key support zones, providing a much-needed lifeline to the price. Jelle also points out that reclaiming the $210 mark could set the stage for Solana to challenge its previous highs. While optimism builds following yesterday‚Äôs rebound, caution is warranted as further consolidation or retests of support levels remain possible. The market‚Äôs next phase will largely depend on whether Solana can maintain its newfound momentum. Related Reading: Chainlink Forms A Daily Bullish Pattern ‚Äì Top Analyst Eyes Breakout To $30 As SOL continues to stabilize, investors are keeping a close eye on critical resistance levels, particularly the $210 mark, which could signal the start of a new bullish trend. However, with lingering risks, the coming days will be crucial in determining Solana‚Äôs ability to sustain its recovery and potentially move toward new highs. Price Action: Testing Crucial Levels Solana (SOL) is trading at $186, showing signs of stabilization after a sharp recovery from its recent lows. However, the price has yet to confirm a breakout above the $192 level, a critical resistance zone that bulls need to reclaim to shift market sentiment and potentially change the current trend. A successful reclaim of the $192 mark would signal strength and open the door for further upside. The next significant target for SOL would be breaking above the local high near $223, which could pave the way for a broader bullish trend. Such a move would likely attract renewed investor interest and signal that the market is ready for a sustained rally. On the flip side, failing to reclaim the $192 level could expose Solana to downside risks. In such a scenario, the price may revisit lower demand zones, potentially testing support levels around $170. This would extend the consolidation phase and delay any significant upward momentum.

Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law (TRUMPLAW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPLAW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law by entering its contract address ‚Äì 7mYansF38wyaSvnj7C1Gr536FdMbGA4ufqY7PwzC7CxM ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPLAW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-15 02:20:58

Solana Sets Ambitious $600 Target for 2025 Solana‚Äôs reputation as a high-performance blockchain continues to attract developers and enterprises, solidifying its position as a top-tier network.

Lightchain AI‚Äôs roadmap emphasizes sustainability and scalability, making it a forward-thinking platform designed for industries like logistics, finance, and healthcare. A key feature is its commitment to fostering developer-centric programs , which include grants, tools, and resources to accelerate the creation of decentralized applications.

Solana, Ethereum (ETH) and the rapidly climbing BigBossInu are positioned to deliver significant gains. Investors are eyeing these top picks closely, expecting them to lead the market surge. BigBossInu: Disrupting the Crypto Market with Its Hot Presale BigBossInu is leading the charge as one of the top picks for skyrocketing 12,000% returns in 2025. With its lightning-fast presale success‚Äîover $100,000 raised in hours‚Äîand a community-driven ecosystem, Big Boss Inu is more than a meme coin; it‚Äôs a movement. Packed with massive APY staking rewards, bold real-world partnerships, and innovative anti-dump mechanisms, it‚Äôs built for long-term growth and investor confidence. As Solana continues to climb, BigBossInu is carving out its place as a top-tier contender for the next crypto bull run. >>>>>> Solana (SOL) is experiencing strong bullish momentum, currently trading around $192. It has been rising steadily, and analysts suggest that if SOL breaks through the $186 resistance level, it could push towards $210. This is supported by a growing interest in Solana‚Äôs scalability and low transaction fees, positioning it well for further growth‚Äã. Ethereum (ETH) remains a key player in the crypto market, with its price hovering around $3,440. While the market is showing mixed signals, ETH could see a significant boost if it surpasses the $3,700 resistance level, potentially reaching new highs in the next few months‚Äã. Aptos (APT) has been a standout performer recently, rising over 40% in the last month, driven by strategic acquisitions and its expansion into Asia. APT‚Äôs price is currently around $9.16, and its unique MOVE programming language continues to attract interest from developers and enterprises‚Äã. >>> Kaspa (KAS), known for its high-speed blockDAG technology, has faced some volatility recently. After reaching a high of $0.118 earlier this year, it has dropped to around $0.113. Despite this dip, Kaspa‚Äôs innovative technology and scalability make it a project to watch for future growth‚Äã. Conclusion As the crypto market prepares for a major bull run, altcoins like BigBossInu, Solana, Aptos, and Kaspa are capturing attention for their high-growth potential. BigBossInu‚Äôs presale is sparking investor excitement, while Solana‚Äôs scalability, Ethereum‚Äôs market dominance, and Aptos‚Äô strategic expansion into Asia position these cryptos for significant gains. Kaspa‚Äôs innovative technology also holds strong future potential despite recent volatility.

This is a pattern signaling a potential breakout. While traders speculate on Solana‚Äôs next move, the spotlight is shifting to PCHAIN , an AI-powered altcoin making waves in the crypto world. With its innovative approach to real estate investment and blockchain integration, PropiChain is targeting an astronomical 55,409% surge, presenting a golden opportunity for investors seeking transformative returns. Solana Price Analysis: A Symmetrical Triangle Signals a Crucial Breakout The crypto community has been closely monitoring the Solana Price , which is currently trapped in a symmetrical triangle pattern. Renowned analyst Ali Charts recently noted on X that Solana ($SOL) is at a pivotal point, consolidating within this geometric formation. A breakout above $214 or a dip below $183 could trigger a significant 40% price movement. The question on everyone‚Äôs mind is: which direction will Solana take? On one hand, the Solana price performance in 2024 showcased resilience, bouncing back from multiple market corrections and maintaining its position as a top altcoin. On the other, the current volume of transactions shows signs of weakening, leading to speculation about whether the bulls have enough momentum to reclaim dominance. While the Solana Price navigates this crucial moment, investors are beginning to diversify their portfolios into promising altcoins with substantial growth potential like PropiChain (PCHAIN). PropiChain: The AI Altcoin Revolutionizing Real Estate Investment PropiChain is gaining attention as a transformative player in the crypto space, blending the power of AI and blockchain to redefine how real estate is bought, sold, and invested in. This new project is already capturing investor interest with its unique features and practical applications. For instance, PropiChain‚Äôs real estate tokenization digitizes property assets, enabling investors to buy and sell these properties as tokens seamlessly on a blockchain. Another standout feature is fractional ownership, which allows users to own smaller portions of high-value properties. For example, a $1,000 investment could give you a fraction of a $1 million commercial building. This feature makes real estate investment accessible to individuals who previously couldn‚Äôt afford to participate, providing an opportunity for everyone to earn passive income through rental dividends. PropiChain‚Äôs AI analytics provide invaluable insights for investors by predicting market trends, identifying undervalued properties, and optimizing portfolios. So instead of spending hours researching properties, you can rely on PropiChain‚Äôs AI to deliver precise recommendations based on your investment goals. Also, the platform‚Äôs integration with the metaverse opens the door to virtual property exploration. Investors can tour digital replicas of real-world properties, streamlining the decision-making process. As PropiChain grows, analysts believe it has the potential to reach $6 and outperform many top-performing altcoins. PropiChain Presale: The Opportunity for Transformative Gains While the Solana price navigates the uncertainty of its symmetrical triangle, PropiChain is making waves in the crypto world with over $2 million generated so far in its presale. The presale is currently in Stage 2, where the token is priced attractively at $0.011. However, this price won‚Äôt last long; stage 3 is around the corner, with prices set to rise to $0.023. So this very low price offers a golden opportunity for early investors to secure their positions before the broader market catches on. For example, a $1,000 investment at the current price could yield over $500,000 in returns as PropiChain scales up. And with its innovative features and market disruption potential, the token‚Äôs value trajectory looks promising. Compared to the Solana price, which needs to break above $214 to make significant gains, PropiChain‚Äôs growth path is clear. Analysts predict that PropiChain could hit milestones faster. In fact, some suggest PropiChain could reach $2 before Solana Price climbs to $300. Conclusion While the Solana Price remains stuck in its symmetrical triangle, investors face a choice: wait for Solana‚Äôs breakout or seize the opportunity with PropiChain . If you‚Äôre seeking a clear path to significant returns, PropiChain‚Äôs presale offers a chance to get in early and ride the wave of innovation. As Solana navigates its next move, PropiChain is already charting its course towards high returns. The choice is yours; join or miss out.

However, with bankruptcies hitting record highs, pensioners starving, and the government mismanaging funds, it‚Äôs clear Mow is either unaware or willfully ignorant of the fact that slapping a centrally regulated BTC band-aid on things is not going to help. The former Blockstream executive and now CEO of a BTC/nation-state liaison enterprise called JAN3, Samson Mow, has weighed in on what Japan needs to do in order to see economic recovery. The Canadian-born video game developer tweeted on X on January 14 (JST) that ‚ÄúThe Japanese Yen, the third largest currency in the world, is almost back to where it was last summer.‚Äù Samson Mow continued: ‚ÄúAll of the BOJ interventions did nothing.‚Äù Samson Mow went on to emphasize that it is ‚Äúonly a matter of time until they [the Bank of Japan] embrace Bitcoin.‚Äù While the multi-millionaire, laser-eyed maximalist is correct that the yen is in horrible shape, he‚Äôs absolutely out of touch, or ignoring, what‚Äôs happening on the ground in Japan. It‚Äôs a situation no regulated, state-embedded crypto (such as what BTC would be if held in a BoJ reserve) could fix. Samsung Mow‚Äôs X post Wracked by bankruptcy and poverty-line pensions, Japanese struggle under weak yen It‚Äôs just been reported that corporate bankruptcies in Japan are expected to exceed 10,000 in 2024, for the first time in 11 years. This, combined with record restaurant bankruptcies, retailers facing falling profits for the first time in three years, and the pain of ever-escalating inflation, has Japanese scrambling to stay afloat and survive day-to-day life as small and medium-sized enterprises are pushed out of the market. Doctor‚Äôs offices and clinics are also shuttering their doors on the country‚Äôs graying population, who scrape by on pensions that nobody could survive on (around $800 USD a month for some retired folks), for the same reasons. But, according to Samson Mow, all this could be fixed with a little BTC in the hands of the same state that created this mess. At the time of writing, JPY is about 158 yen to the dollar, indeed approaching exchange lows not seen since last summer. But one look could at the state of the Blackrock and Trump-championed asset called BTC, and the state of the Japanese government, says a Bank of Japan bitcoin reserve wouldn‚Äôt help the everyday people living on the archipelago. Chart showing corporate bankruptcies exceeding 10,000 in 2024, the most since 2013. Source: Nikkei/Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Anti-crypto, anti-freedom Japanese government won‚Äôt help For starters, Japan‚Äôs prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, has repeatedly and publicly questioned the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, refusing to consider a lowered 20% tax rate , and aiming to increase defense spending dramatically even as the aging population goes hungry on boiled bean sprouts. If the BoJ adopted a BTC reserve, it would still be in the hands of figureheads like this deciding how to allocate the coins. Second, BTC is not easy to spend for the average Japanese individual. Long wait times, high transaction fees, and beyond-tedious KYC (know-your-customer) requirements at the nation‚Äôs top centralized exchanges means that for most residents ‚Äî and especially the older ones ‚Äî getting into crypto in this fashion is a non-starter. So what is Samson Mow actually talking about? At the end of the day, he is talking about a captured, centralized asset being in the hands of a nation-state that is already taxing residents into literal poverty and homelessness. What is really needed, as always, is permissionless exchange as described by Satoshi Nakamoto, out of the hands of abusive, centralized powers. Thankfully for those in Asia and Japan, it is happening at a grassroots level , for everyday people, via meetups, wallets, trade and commerce with assets like BCH (bitcoin cash), regardless of what Samson Mow may proclaim from his ivory tower.

Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) made headlines with a jaw-dropping 62.11% price surge and a massive 280.78% spike in trading volume. Meanwhile, Snek (SNEK), Cardano‚Äôs most traded token, continues to captivate its community. But all eyes are on BTFD Coin (BTFD), whose innovative referral program and ongoing presale have cemented its place among the best new meme coins for massive return potential . Meme coins have evolved from simple internet jokes to serious investments offering incredible opportunities. BTFD Coin‚Äôs Bulls Squad, referral rewards, and staking options make it a standout choice. Paired with FARTCOIN‚Äôs growth and SNEK‚Äôs cultural dominance, these tokens represent the best of what meme coins have to offer. BTFD Coin: Earn Big with the BTFD Referral Rewards What makes BTFD Coin the ultimate choice for the best new meme coins for massive return potential? Its presale performance and community-driven initiatives are key. With over $5.2 million raised and 64 billion tokens sold, BTFD is attracting attention from crypto enthusiasts and newcomers alike. The referral program is a standout feature. Participants earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens when their referral code is used, provided they rank in the top 20 on the leaderboard by the month‚Äôs end. It‚Äôs a win-win for everyone involved. Investors start by connecting their wallet on the BTFD presale page to generate a unique referral code. This code can be shared with friends and family, giving referrals an extra 10% BTFD on purchases over $50. Referrers, in turn, earn 10% of the purchase value in tokens. BTFD isn‚Äôt stopping there. Its P2E game, launched earlier this month, offers players a chance to earn rewards while enjoying an immersive gaming experience. Combine that with staking rewards of 90% APY, and you have a token designed for both engagement and financial growth. Consider this: An $8,000 investment at the current presale price of $0.000142 will secure 56.34 million tokens. When BTFD lists at $0.0006, those tokens will be worth $33,804‚Äîa substantial return on investment. With its Bulls Squad growing daily and just three presale stages remaining, now is the time to join the action. The referral program ensures that both new and existing investors benefit, making BTFD a top pick for 2025. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN): A Meme Coin on the Rise Fartcoin continues to prove that humor can be highly profitable. Trading at $1.18, the token has surged 62.11% in the past 24 hours, driven by a massive 280.78% increase in trading volume. Its market cap now sits at $1.16 billion, solidifying its place as a top-performing meme coin. Launched on the Solana blockchain in October 2024, FARTCOIN started as a joke but quickly gained traction in the crypto community. It reached an all-time high of $1.60 earlier this month, showing its potential for massive returns. While its 7-day performance shows a slight dip of 5.8%, the token‚Äôs growing volume and market cap indicate that investor interest remains strong. Fartcoin‚Äôs rise underscores the potential of meme coins to deliver substantial financial gains. Snek (SNEK): Cardano‚Äôs Cultural Icon Snek (SNEK) is more than just a token; it‚Äôs a movement within the Cardano ecosystem. Trading at $0.006095, SNEK has seen a 5.28% price increase in the last 24 hours, with trading volume surging 70.46%. As a deflationary memecoin, SNEK represents fun, innovation, and community engagement. It has become the most traded token on Cardano, uniting the ecosystem with its strong cultural presence. Despite a 12.3% dip over the past month, SNEK‚Äôs vibrant community ensures its long-term potential remains intact. Snek plays a critical role in making the crypto space more accessible and engaging, particularly for newcomers. Its consistent trading activity highlights its value as both a meme coin and a unifying force within the Cardano ecosystem. The Final Words Based on our research and market trends, 2025 is shaping up to be a breakout year for meme coins. Fartcoin‚Äôs explosive growth demonstrates the financial power of humor-driven tokens, while Snek‚Äôs cultural significance within Cardano showcases the lasting impact of community engagement. But BTFD Coin shines brightest. With its referral rewards, Bulls Squad, and a presale that‚Äôs raised over $5.2 million, BTFD offers a unique blend of innovation and profitability.

ETH is rising and facing hurdles near the $3,240 zone. Ethereum started a minor recovery wave above the $3,120 zone. The price is trading above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could struggle to start a fresh increase above the $3,240 resistance level. Ethereum Price Aims Higher Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $3,050 level like Bitcoin . ETH was able to clear the $3,080 and $3,120 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. The price even cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,334 swing high to the $2,920 low. However, the bears are active near the $3,220 and $3,240 levels. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading just above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,230 level.

The main resistance is now forming near $3,330. A clear move above the $3,330 resistance might send the price toward the $3,450 resistance. An upside break above the $3,450 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,500 resistance zone or even $3,550 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,240 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,180 level. The first major support sits near the $3,120. A clear move below the $3,120 support might push the price toward the $3,050 support.

However, some analysts remain optimistic that BTC is poised to break out of this range to the upside following what they describe as a ‚Äòfinal capitulation.‚Äô Bitcoin Consolidation Nearing Its End? Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade recently shared their analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs price action on X. According to the analyst, BTC might be approaching a final capitulation before experiencing a significant breakout that could end its prolonged range-bound movement. The analyst commented: The current crypto market sentiment isn‚Äôt great. I‚Äôd actually welcome a downturn in the next couple of days to complete this price action. Bitcoin experienced a final capitulation at the 27th bar during consolidation in January 2024, just before a massive rebound. If history repeats, the final capitulation level will be reached today or tomorrow. After that, BTC will surge with a massive rebound. Related Reading: MARA CEO Advocates ‚ÄúInvest And Forget‚Äù Approach To Bitcoin, Citing Strong Historical Performance To support their prediction, Trader Tardigrade shared a chart comparing Bitcoin‚Äôs current price action with its behavior in January 2024. During that period, BTC consolidated for 53 days, underwent a final capitulation, and then rallied sharply, climbing from around $39,000 to as high as $71,000. Interestingly, Bitcoin‚Äôs current consolidation phase has already lasted over 50 days. If BTC follows its January 2024 pattern, the final capitulation could occur on January 13 or 14. Another crypto analyst, @CryptosBatman, pointed to tightening Bollinger Bands on Bitcoin‚Äôs three-day chart. They highlighted that the Bollinger Bandwidth has reached an extremely oversold level and remarked: Historically, such lows signal a local bottom. Remarkably, the bandwidth is now tighter than when Bitcoin was at $50K, suggesting the bottom might be very close. For the uninitiated, Bollinger Bandwidth is a metric derived from Bollinger Bands that measures the distance between the upper and lower bands relative to the moving average. It is often used to identify periods of low volatility, which can signal potential breakout opportunities. Crypto Analysts Foresee A Positive 2025 While Bitcoin‚Äôs ongoing consolidation phase might frustrate bulls, many analysts remain confident that digital assets will benefit from multiple favorable factors in the coming months.

Similarly, crypto analyst Dave The Wave has forecasted that BTC is likely to hit a peak during summer 2025. At press time, BTC trades at $96,424, up 4.9% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains a dominant force, but altcoins are breaking through with incredible potential. From Ethereum (ETH) to the fast-rising BigBossInu, these digital currencies are set for explosive gains. These top picks are poised to outperform the broader market before the rally hits its peak. BigBossInu: Seize the Future of Crypto with This Presale Opportunity Big Boss Inu stands out as one of the top altcoins that could turn $500 into $500,000 .

Combined with an ambitious roadmap that includes global awareness campaigns and top-tier exchange listings, it‚Äôs a must-have for anyone looking to ride the wave of the next big crypto revolution. >>>>>> Uniswap (UNI) is experiencing a bullish breakout, largely due to the launch of its Layer-2 network, Unichain. This development has positioned Uniswap as a significant player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, with faster and cheaper transactions. Polkadot (DOT) is focusing on expanding its interoperability capabilities across blockchains. Market analysts are optimistic about DOT‚Äôs long-term potential as blockchain interoperability becomes increasingly important‚Äã. >>> Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has seen moderate growth in recent months, with its price hovering around $445.94. BCH remains a strong choice for users looking for lower transaction fees and faster processing times compared to Bitcoin. Litecoin (LTC) is trading at around 101, with consistent performance as a major cryptocurrency for peer-to-peer transactions.

With its value largely influenced by market sentiment, Dogecoin‚Äôs slump is causing concern among investors. Interestingly, one of the top Dogecoin addresses has been linked to a promising new AI altcoin. This innovative project combines AI and blockchain to tokenize real-world assets (RWA), such as real estate. These features, along with the platform‚Äôs numerous benefits, have fueled strong interest in the altcoin‚Äôs token presale, which is nearing the $2M milestone. As a result, experts forecast that this AI altcoin could surge to $2 from a post-listing price of $0.01, echoing Dogecoin‚Äôs meteoric rise in its early days. Dogecoin Struggles Makes Investors Wary Dogecoin (DOGE) initially soared to prominence due to massive community adoption and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Its low price and high volatility attracted early adopters who leveraged social media buzz and celebrity influence to amplify its popularity. However, despite a 1.88% rise in the last 24 hours , Dogecoin has lost approximately 10% over the past week, highlighting its struggles to maintain upward momentum. Coupled with Dogecoin‚Äôs limited utility, the asset volatility has sparked mixed reactions from investors. As concerns grow about a potential prolonged bear market for Dogecoin, a top Dogecoin address has been linked to PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a promising AI altcoin. PropiChain‚Äôs unique value proposition lies in its focus on fractional ownership of real-world assets (RWA), particularly in the lucrative real estate sector, which is less prone to market volatility. Moreover, the project‚Äôs capped token supply of 1.5 billion adds scarcity, driving demand and offering significant growth potential. This blend of scarcity and utility positions early investors to capitalize on market trends and secure substantial returns, making PropiChain a compelling alternative for investors‚Äô portfolios. PropiChain: Transforming Real Estate Investment Via AI Technology Amid Dogecoin‚Äôs ongoing struggles, PropiChain is emerging as a standout contender in the next wave of crypto adoption. This innovative altcoin is addressing critical inefficiencies in the $300-trillion global real estate industry via AI and blockchain technology. Already listed on CoinMarketCap and certified as secure through a comprehensive BlockAudit review, PropiChain has gained credibility among investors. Below are the key features driving its potential price growth after launch: Fractional Ownership for Wider Accessibility PropiChain‚Äôs revolutionary property tokenization system allows users to digitally own, buy, sell, and transfer property fractions. This eliminates traditional legal complexities and reduces barriers to entry. Investors can now acquire fractional real estate ownership, investing as little as $1,000 instead of $200,000 for an entire property. This democratization of wealth-building aligns with the ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi), making PropiChain an ideal AI altcoin. AI-Driven Insights for Smarter Investments PropiChain seamlessly integrates AI to create an intelligent ecosystem for real estate transactions. The platform analyzes vast data sets to provide actionable insights into market trends, property valuations, and economic signals, enabling investors to make informed decisions. Likewise, PropiChain provides investors with 24/7 personalized support through its advanced AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants. These tools guide users at every stage of their real estate investment journey, offering seamless assistance with property selection, market analysis, transaction processes, and other investment needs. Metaverse Integration Through its Metaverse capabilities, PropiChain redefines property exploration. Investors and sellers can participate in virtual property tours, hold virtual meetings, and make informed decisions without the constraints of geographical barriers. This approach introduces a new level of transparency and convenience while enhancing cross-border transactions. Smart Contracts and Unmatched Security Smart contracts form the backbone of PropiChain‚Äôs secure ecosystem, automating critical tasks such as lease agreements. These contracts execute only when specific conditions are met, ensuring tamper-proof transparency and reducing the need for intermediaries. Additionally, transactions are logged on a decentralized Title Contract ledger, minimizing risks of fraud and counterparty disputes while cutting costs and boosting operational efficiency. PCHAIN: AI Altcoin Ready To Explode While Dogecoin‚Äôs price continues to fluctuate with market trends, PropiChain‚Äôs native token, PCHAIN, stands out as a pivotal element of its ecosystem. The AI altcoin offers diverse utilities and significant advantages for early investors. This includes key benefits like property discounts, staking rewards, referral incentives, governance rights, zero-fee transactions, and exclusive community perks. Meanwhile, investors who hold PCHAIN through the final presale stage could see impressive returns of over 800%. This implies a modest $1,000 investment could potentially return about $80,000 or more. Additionally, the token‚Äôs limited supply and extensive utility have driven predictions of a price surge from $0.01 to $2 post-listing. The combination of scarcity and value-driven use cases makes PCHAIN an enticing opportunity for early investors to tap into a high-growth, utility-focused project with vast potential. Tap into PropiChain‚Äôs Unique Investment Opportunity Although Dogecoin retains its status as a cultural phenomenon, savvy investors are increasingly turning their attention to value-driven assets like PropiChain. As its token presale nears the $2M milestone, experts express optimism about its price post-listing. The second presale stage currently offers tokens at $0.011 each, with the third stage projected at $0.023 and a listing price of $0.032. The token‚Äôs limited supply continues to fuel demand, making this presale phase the most accessible and affordable entry point for investors. For those who missed the first phase, now is the perfect time to join PropiChain‚Äôs innovative ecosystem and capitalize on its promising future. Join PropiChain (PCHAIN) now and leverage AI-powered insights for smarter, faster, and more secure real estate transactions.

The price is trading above the important $2.80 level and is now eyeing to break the $3 mark. XRP hit a high of $2.87 and then hit a reverse. Local Uptrend and Support Levels XRP has been in a local uptrend since December 30, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. To maintain the bullish outlook, it‚Äôs crucial for these higher lows to hold. Currently, the market is undergoing a sideways correction, which may signal the completion of the triangle pattern. Wave Structure and Price Action The triangle could be forming an ABCDE structure, with the E-wave possibly having bottomed last week. Typically, triangle breakouts are swift and aggressive, and the price action so far has been a bit more convincing. Analyzing Recent Price Movements The recent dip in XRP price occurred in three waves, which broke micro support but did not invalidate the overall uptrend. This suggests that the price could test support levels again before making a breakout move. As long as critical support levels hold, the bullish outlook remains valid. Critical Price Levels to Watch The key level to watch is $1.96. A break below this would suggest that the triangle pattern has failed and could lead to a decline to around $1.80. Key Support: A drop below $2.32 would indicate that the local uptrend is over. Key Resistance: Upside breakouts above $2.72 and $2.90 would signal the potential for further bullish movement, with the possibility of reaching all-time highs or even $5 in the medium term.

Musk is accused of violating federal securities laws by waiting 11 days to reveal that he had acquired 5% of the company‚Äôs shares. The SEC‚Äôs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accuses Musk of violating Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and related rules. The SEC claims Musk‚Äôs delayed disclosure allowed him to buy over $500 million worth of Twitter shares at artificially low prices. When Musk finally announced his purchases on April 4, 2022, Twitter‚Äôs share price jumped 27%. The lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and return profits he allegedly gained unfairly. Musk went on to purchase Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, later rebranding the company as X. The SEC‚Äôs complaint claims that Musk‚Äôs failure to file a timely beneficial ownership report resulted in investors selling Twitter stock between March 25, 2022, and April 1, 2022, at artificially low prices. This, according to the SEC, caused those investors significant financial losses. Musk has responded to the lawsuit on his platform, X (formerly Twitter), calling the SEC a ‚Äútotally broken organization‚Äù and criticizing the agency for focusing on this issue while other more serious crimes go unpunished.

According to a Jan. 13 report by The Washington Post , Trump is expected to address crypto-related policies immediately after taking office. These include measures targeting crypto de-banking and the repeal of a banking accounting rule that mandates banks holding cryptocurrencies to list them as liabilities. ‚ÄúThe Trump team has made it very clear that this is a priority,‚Äù a source involved in the discussions told the Post . Critics of President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration have alleged that financial regulators were used to pressure banks into severing ties with the crypto industry, a move dubbed ‚ÄúOperation ChokePoint 2.0.‚Äù Additionally, crypto leaders have been pushing back against the controversial SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB 121) issued in March 2022, which introduced the requirement to report crypto as a liability.

Pepe coin price also rose, as one crypto analyst predicted more gains that could see it flip Shiba Inu to become the second-biggest meme coin. Pepe Coin Price Could Surge And Flip Shiba Inu The Pepe price dropped to a low of $0.000015 on Monday as Bitcoin and most altcoins dived amid the soaring US and global bond yields. However, one crypto analyst argues that the coin faces a perfect storm that could push it to a record high and flip Shiba Inu. He pointed to the symmetrical triangle pattern the coin has formed on the weekly chart. Pepe Coin Forecast The analyst also expects the upcoming Ethereum price rebound as a key catalyst for Pepe. Some analysts have predicted that it is just a matter of time before the ETH price jumps and hits the crucial resistance at $5,000. He expects Pepe‚Äôs market cap to get to $50 billion in this bull run. Pepe‚Äôs outperformance has helped to narrow its market cap with Shiba Inu. It now has a market cap of over $7.2 billion compared to SHIB‚Äôs $12.6 billion. If SHIB stayed stagnant, it means that Pepe needs to rise by 75% to cross its valuation. Pepe Price Technical Analysis: Could It Hit ATH? Pepe‚Äôs daily chart is sending mixed signals on the next price action. On the positive side, the coin has retested the important support level at $0.00001716, the upper side of the cup and handle pattern that formed between March and November 2024. A break out and then a retest is usually a good continuation sign. The other positive sign is that the value of Pepe may have formed a triple-bottom pattern whose neckline is at $0.00002826. The coin has failed to drop below that level three times and instead formed two false breakouts, Further, Pepe remains above the 100-day moving average. Therefore, if these positives work, the coin may rebound and retest the 2024 high of $0.00002826, up by 65% above the current level. Pepe Coin Price On the other side, Pepe coin price has formed what looks like a head and shoulders pattern with a neckline is at $0.00001713. A H&S pattern is one of the few bearish chart patterns. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at the psychological point at $0.000010, down by 42% below the current level.

This rebound also happened after Cardano overtook Bitcoin in a key ranking. So, will this be the start of a major ADA bull run that could push it to the psychological point of $1.5? Cardano Price Rises As It Overtakes Bitcoin On A Key Ranking A report by Brand Intimacy has ranked Cardano the number one crypto brand globally. It has flipped popular coins like Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, and Ripple. Its report also ranks Cardano as the 26th corporate brand globally, making it more popular than popular firms like Walmart, Toyota, AMD, Ubisoft, and Home Depot. Cardano Ranking Overtakes Bitcoin The report based its data on key areas like indulgence, fulfillment, ritual, identity, enhancement, and nostalgia. It then uses big data and artificial intelligence to identify a quotient figure, in which case is 52.6 compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 51.9. Still, Bitcoin remains a better-known brand in the crypto industry with a market cap of almost $2 trillion compared to Cardano‚Äôs $34 billion. Also, DeFi Llama says Bitcoin has over 730,000 active addresses compared to Cardano‚Äôs 31,000. Bitcoin also has a total value locked of $6.52 billion compared to Cardano‚Äôs $500 million. Looking ahead, Cardano has numerous catalysts that will push its price higher in the long term. As a popular crypto brand, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely to approve a spot ADA ETF as soon as this year. Further, Cardano‚Äôs Midnight zero knowledge scaling feature will be launched this year. Also, Cardano will integrate with BitcoinOS, unlocking over $1 trillion in liquidity. ADA Price Technical Analysis: Can It Hit $1.5? Technicals suggest that the value of ADA has more upside after Monday‚Äôs drop. It formed a small morning star candlestick pattern, which closely resembles a hammer. This pattern comprises a long lower shadow, a small body, and a small upper shadow and is a popular reversal sign. Cardano has also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern whose head is at $0.7600. Like the morning star, an inverse H&S pattern is a popular bullish sign in the market. ADA also formed a break and retest pattern by falling to $0.8082, its March 2024 high briefly. Therefore, the coin may continue rising in the next few weeks. The two resistance levels it needs to flip to get to $1.15 are $1.1500 and $1.3268, its highest swings on January 7 and December 3. Cardano Price Chart The bullish ADA price forecast will become invalid if it drops below the right shoulder at $0.8800. If that happens, it will risk it dropping to the next key support at $0.7600.

Central to these predictions is the assertion that Ethereum (ETH) may outshine Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of performance, even as Bitcoin continues to hold a dominant position in the market. Expert Predicts A New Crypto Bull Run In 2025 With Bitcoin approaching the significant $100,000 mark once again after a sharp correction over the past weeks and altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the horizon, the expert believes that the current crypto bull run is only just beginning. Related Reading: XRP Price Dominates: Outperforming Bitcoin With Confidence VirtualBacon poses an intriguing question: Is 2025 the year when cryptocurrencies break all previous records? The anticipation surrounding potential market movements is palpable, especially given the bullish sentiment fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price surge and the impending introduction of altcoin ETFs. The expert reflects on the previous year‚Äôs predictions, noting that Bitcoin reached $80,000, crypto gaming gained traction, and Trump‚Äôs return to the political scene significantly boosted market momentum. Looking ahead, VirtualBacon predicts a longer, slower bull cycle extending potentially into the fourth quarter of 2025. This forecast is underpinned by the Federal Reserve‚Äôs cautious approach to liquidity, which is expected to mitigate the risks of sudden market crashes. The likelihood of a recession is projected to drop to 33%, signaling a period of relative stability. Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance is anticipated to rise, largely driven by institutional demand, with spot ETFs already holding approximately 5% of Bitcoin‚Äôs supply. While altcoins may lag initially, VirtualBacon asserts that this ‚Äúslower cycle‚Äù is seen as a ‚Äúblessing,‚Äù providing ample time for growth and maturation within the market. Will Ethereum Outperform Bitcoin This Year? One of the most consequential factors influencing the crypto market in 2025 is anticipated massive liquidity injections. The US debt crisis is likely to compel the Federal Reserve to implement quantitative easing, thereby expanding its balance sheet and flooding markets with cash. Additionally, a revaluation of gold‚Äîpotentially adjusting from $42 per ounce to around $2,000‚Äîcould create even more liquidity in the system. Such conditions typically lead to inflation, which is historically associated with rising asset prices, suggesting that cryptocurrencies may thrive in this environment. However, despite these optimistic predictions, VirtualBacon casts doubt on the likelihood of a US Bitcoin Reserve Act passing in 2025. The proposal for the US Treasury to acquire one million Bitcoin over five years faces significant hurdles, particularly in securing taxpayer support for such a massive expenditure. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Under Pressure: Struggles to Reclaim Lost Ground On the regulatory front, VirtualBacon anticipates that pro-crypto legislation may favor altcoins, particularly through the proposed Fit for the 21st Century Act. This legislation could provide a clearer regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, designating decentralized tokens like Layer-1 blockchains as commodities under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), while less decentralized assets would fall under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, potentially leading the SEC, major cryptocurrencies may flourish, although smaller startups could face challenges navigating the new landscape, according to the expert. The prediction of altcoin ETFs gaining traction is another exciting prospect for 2025. VirtualBacon expects ETFs for cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, HBAR, XRP, and Solana to emerge, driven by their unique statuses and pending legal resolutions. With Ethereum ETFs already drawing institutional interest, a similar pattern could unfold for these altcoins, further accelerating institutional adoption in the crypto market. Perhaps the most captivating prediction is that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin, potentially doubling Bitcoin‚Äôs returns in 2025. With institutional investors increasingly favoring ETH over BTC in recent months, along with historical performance trends favoring Ethereum in the first half of the year, the stage is set for significant growth in the Ethereum ecosystem. VirtualBacon estimates end-of-year prices of approximately $200,000 for Bitcoin and $14,000 for Ethereum, presenting ambitious yet ‚Äúpotentially attainable targets‚Äù given the expected influx of liquidity and institutional support. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $95,840, recording gains of over 4% in the 24-hour time frame. Similarly, ETH is trading at $3,200, recording even higher gains of nearly 6% in the same time frame.

38986168,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=316070,1736916032,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,Three Homomorphic Encryption Trends for 2025,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/01/14/three-homomorphic-encryption-trends-for-2025/,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post As 2025 dawns, FHE (fully homomorphic encryption) is a PET (privacy-enhancing technology) on the cusp of going mainstream. FHE keeps data encrypted during computation so that even if it‚Äôs intercepted, it can‚Äôt be read. Hardware acceleration, venture capital investment and cross-industry standards development organization and consortia all have gathered strong prevailing winds behind FHE, and the next two years will see the first commercial applications. In 2025, I‚Äôm expecting to observe three trends as FHE adoption begins in earnest. 1. Adoption will start on the bleeding edge with AI and blockchain AI requires third-party computation on a massive, unprecedented scale, and that data is vulnerable during every query. Despite all the potential benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), many chief security officers (CSOs) have put off adoption due to the security risk. AI providers need FHE to create an ironclad security solution for enterprise clients. Blockchain is the other industry currently straining at the traces to implement FHE. Blockchain ledgers are public and immutable, which prevents certain desirable activities and makes it difficult for blockchain applications to fully comply with privacy regulations like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). FHE would allow users to process transactions or execute smart contracts while keeping all personal identifiers private, enabling use cases like private DeFi (decentralized finance) or private auctions. Since the 2024 election swept several noted crypto enthusiasts into power in the US, we‚Äôre also in the middle of an undeniable blockchain resurgence. The crypto bull market will fuel a wave of new investment in blockchain technology, accelerating development efforts in an industry that‚Äôs already proven eager to embrace FHE. 2. Law enforcement will warm to widespread encryption Bodies such as the FBI and the IACP (International Association of Chiefs of Police) have warned that encryption allows criminals to ‚Äògo dark,‚Äô making it impossible for law enforcement agencies to obtain digital communications records even with a warrant. Lately, however, the FBI has also found itself promoting the use of encrypted messaging tools in response to ‚ÄòSalt Typhoon,‚Äô a massive telecommunications cyberattack attributed to Chinese actors. Salt Typhoon makes clear that widespread encryption is a matter of national security. Perpetrators were reportedly able to steal communications metadata and even record exchanges involving US government officials ‚Äì and they were empowered by the fact that perimeter-based security cannot scale fast enough to keep pace with the billions of endpoints and attack surfaces inherent to global telecommunications (telcos). The data itself must be encrypted at every stage. The threat extends far beyond telcos. Amazon has reported observing a 750% increase in the number of attacks in 2024 ‚Äì up to nearly one billion hack attempts per day. State and non-state actors work tirelessly to gain access to financial records, personal data, enterprise records and more. Encrypting all of this data would massively exacerbate the issue of ‚Äògoing dark‚Äô ‚Äì but FHE offers some mitigation. Using FHE, regulatory bodies can perform compliance checks and audits without needing to view sensitive data as plain text. Similarly, law enforcement can analyze a dataset for evidence of a suspected crime without exposing the suspect‚Äôs entire private life to scrutiny. FHE could prevent ‚Äòdigital stop and frisk‚Äô without impeding the ability to investigate serious crimes. 3. It‚Äôs going to be a group effort We‚Äôre done with ‚Äòsecurity by obscurity.‚Äô Practical, scalable FHE solutions will emerge not from private Skunk Works but from a foundation of collaboratively developed industry standards. Closed development of security solutions often hides vulnerabilities until after they are widely deployed. Perhaps if Intel‚Äôs SGX had been subject to open design review, its vulnerability to Spectre- and Meltdown-style side-channel attacks would have been exposed before widespread implementation. The same could be said of the AMD Zen Two Zenbleed exploit, or the Rowhammer vulnerabilities across multiple generations of DRAM. Open development and review encourage broader scrutiny, uncovering flaws faster. What‚Äôs more ‚Äì privately developed solutions can be unacceptable to many stakeholders. As a case in point, look at Google‚Äôs efforts to bootstrap new private browsing solutions. In 2019, Google launched the ‚ÄòPrivacy Sandbox‚Äô initiative to replace third-party cookies with privacy-preserving technologies that would still allow targeted advertising. A year later, they announced plans to eliminate the use of third-party cookies in Chrome. Cookie phase-out was supposed to be complete in 2024, but UK antitrust regulators intervened to oppose the change. Why? Google‚Äôs competitors in the targeted ads business worried that the various schemes proposed under Privacy Sandbox would leave them more reliant on Google‚Äôs internal Chrome browser data. This led, in their view, to a serious risk that Google Ads would get preferential access to data. UK regulators agreed , forcing Google to reconsider. Privacy Sandbox continues to work with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to develop more open private browsing alternatives ‚Äì but Google‚Äôs original plan to rapidly phase out third-party cookies has been consigned to the ash heap of history. FHE hardware and software providers and users need to work together to develop standards for hardware/software interoperability, implementation best practices, compute optimization guidelines and more. This work is currently being undertaken by FHE- and PEC-focused consortia and industry associations, with new organizations launching within the last 12 months to focus specifically on removing roadblocks to commercial implementation. Open standards will help the industry build solutions that are more secure, broadly supported and easier to implement and scale. Despite the appetite of industries like AI and blockchain for FHE solutions ‚Äì and the urgency of the risks they face ‚Äì t hese collaborative efforts are still in the early phases. Still, in 2025, I expect things to move fast ‚Äì and as we begin to see real-world benefits in emerging use cases, mainstream compute applications will shortly follow.

The following altcoins have a proven track record with undeniable utility and massive potential for growth. Ethereum, Solana, Shiba Inu, Stellar, and Rollblock (RBLK) deserve a place in any savvy Web3 investor‚Äôs portfolios as these coins have the best chance of supercharging investors‚Äô financial prospects in 2025‚Ä¶ Rollblock (RBLK) Profit-Sharing Casino On Track For Incredible Growth Rollblock ( RBLK ) empowers the Web3 generation with a refreshing emphasis on trust and fairness that has long been missing from the $500 billion online gambling sector. By recording all bets onto the Ethereum blockchain, Rollblock has removed one of the major pain points from this sector, as it has emerged in recent years that a shocking 9% of traditional online gaming platforms have engaged in corrupt manipulation. Rollblock‚Äôs 7,000+ games are all powered by AI technology with provably better odds than competing platforms. A new sports betting league has also contributed to the $1.75 million in wagered bets that was recorded during the month of December. This figure looks set to double in January, as registrations have surged by over 600% in just a month. More than 40,000 investors have stepped up to allocate to the $RBLK presale, raising more than $8.5 million in the process. This has led to Rollblock making consistent new highs in the past few months while the rest of the crypto market has been stagnant. RBLK can be staked for a risk-free yield of up to 30%, thanks to a deflationary buyback and burn scheme. Each week a percentage of the platform‚Äôs profits is used to buy RBLK, which is then burned (60%) and allocated to community staking rewards (40%). Over time, this deflationary feature will strip exchanges of tokens, meaning that the price of RBLK will have no choice but to reprice aggressively to the upside from its current level of $0.045. Ethereum (ETH) Looking Primed To Pump As Burn Rate Increases Ethereum is showing signs of recovering from the recent crypto crash, having gained 1.6% in the last day of trading. This has seen Ethereum reclaim the $3.2k level after bouncing from solid support at $2.9k this week. Ethereum remains the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with a total value of $387.9 billion. Although Ethereum has lost a significant 12% in the last 7 days, Ethereum bulls are still targeting $10k as a reasonable prediction for 2025. This is in part due to Ethereum‚Äôs deflationary supply as the DeFi protocol Uniswap has burned an incredible 786 Ethereum tokens valued at $2.6 million in the past week alone. If this reduction in the circulating supply of Ethereum continues, then selling pressure will be in short supply and the Ethereum price should have no trouble reaching five figures in the months ahead. Solana (SOL) Raking In The Revenue Solana is seen as a potential Ethereum killer with a market cap of $91.2 billion. Solana is currently trading at $188 after having gained 5% in the last 24 hours. Solana transaction fees exceeded Ethereum‚Äôs gas fees this week. Solana managed to take in around $32.2 million in revenue compared to Ethereum‚Äôs $25.5 million. This has been put down to the popularity of decentralized exchanges on the Solana chain such as Raydium and the meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, which continues to dominate transaction volume across DeFi. With huge adoption across so many crypto sectors, Solana could easily reach $1,000 this cycle. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Has A TREAT Up Its Sleeve For Holders Shiba Inu has also had an encouraging bounce recently, gaining 4.1% in the last day of trading to reach $0.0000214. With a market cap now above $12.6 billion, Shiba Inu has regained 16th position in the crypto rankings and remains the second-biggest meme coin in the entire sector behind Dogecoin. The Shiba Inu ecosystem has been expanding as the protocol recently raised $12 million from investors, including Panga Capital and Animoca Brands, to develop the Shiba Inu TREAT layer 2. This reward token incentivizes users to interact on the Shiba Inu chain and is set to list on the Bitget exchange on the 14th of January. Stellar (XLM) Growing As Blend Hits $12M in TVL Stellar investors have been buying the dip, taking advantage of a 6.8% decline in the last 7 days. The Stellar price is currently $0.42, having recovered from its recent crash to $0.31. This can be seen in a startling 24% rise in Stellar 24-hour trading volume that has been detected on-chain. Stellar has a market cap of $12.9 billion and is currently in 14th place in the crypto top 20. The Stellar ecosystem is seeing rapid growth, and recently its first on-chain protocol achieved more than $12 million in TVL. The Blend liquidity protocol recently surpassed its all-time high on December 4th as it integrated with the Stellar wallet Meru. Such encouraging adoption metrics highlight hugely bullish momentum that Stellar has established this year, and new all-time highs above $0.73 look inevitable for Stellar during Q1. These Tokens Will Dominate Crypto This Year These projects will all likely deliver outstanding returns as they have proven themselves to be leaders in their various crypto niches. Ethereum, Solana, Shiba Inu, and Stellar remain attractive buys at current levels, but truly life-changing returns are likely to be found in allocating to the Rollblock (RBLK) pre-sale before it hits the mainstream this year. Massive utility and a growing scarcity factor will ensure that Rollblock smashes its way up the crypto rankings this year to take its place among the giants of the gaming sector. Stage 9 tokens are currently selling out rapidly at $0.045 and are set to rise yet again in the days to come. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

The transaction marks the first direct cryptocurrency purchase by a bank in the country, potentially reshaping its cautious approach to digital assets. Breaking Tradition Rumors of the acquisition first emerged on 4chan after a user shared screenshots of emails attributed to Intesa‚Äôs head of digital asset trading and investment, Niccol√≤ Bardoscia. The messages showed Bardoscia celebrating the accomplishment and commending the collaboration behind the operation, with one email reading, ‚ÄúAs of today, Intesa Sanpaolo owns 11 Bitcoins. Thank you all for your teamwork.‚Äù According to Wired Italia, a bank representative verified the purchase details, acknowledging that the institution obtained 11 BTC for about $1.03 million. The entity is no stranger to crypto, having used the Polygon network to underwrite Italy‚Äôs first on-chain digital bond, worth $25.6 million, in July 2024. Later that year, it started offering options, futures, and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to digital assets via a dedicated desk. Market watchers view its BTC purchase as a defiance of Italy‚Äôs conservative approach towards digital assets, a perspective seemingly personified by the country‚Äôs central bank governor, Fabio Panetta. The 65-year-old economist is reported to have expressed skepticism about the intrinsic value and security of such products, labeling them as speculative and vulnerable to fraud and cybersecurity risks. Institutional Adoption Intesa‚Äôs foray into BTC coincides with a growing trend of institutional interest in cryptocurrencies pioneered by MicroStrategy. On Monday, the U.S.-based software giant bought an additional 2,530 coins for $243 million, bringing its total holdings to 450,000. Similarly, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet recently announced plans to expand its Bitcoin reserves to 10,000 units. Meanwhile, energy storage company KULR Technology Group committed to allocating up to 90% of its surplus cash into the cryptocurrency. The organization started by buying more than 217 coins for $21 million on Boxing Day last year, with its CEO, Michael Mo, highlighting the asset‚Äôs utility as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical instability. Medical equipment manufacturer Semler Scientific has also had a successful Bitcoin treasury strategy. Between December 16, 2024, and January 10, 2025, it acquired 237 BTC for more than $23 million, bringing its entire stash to 2,321 coins worth about $224.4 million at the current price.

The wallet also converted another 16.6199 WBTC for 1.7 million USDT through the Cow Protocol and subsequently transferred 11,917.635 ETH worth about $38.396 million to Coinbase Prime. Trump established the crypto venture in mid-September through a live stream on X, describing it as a ‚Äúdecentralized finance‚Äù initiative centered around a crypto token called WLFI. Trump featured three of his sons in the project, including Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Baron Trump, as the project‚Äôs Web3 ambassadors. However, the details about the project are still hazy and confusing. The news comes after Ethana Labs, an Ethereum-based DeFi platform, announced a strategic partnership with Word Liberty Financial. The collaboration between the synthetic dollar provider and Trump‚Äôs crypto project will integrate Ethena‚Äôs staked synthetic dollar (sUSDe) token into World Liberty Financial‚Äôs Aave instance. The collaboration will allow users to deposit USDe and earn rewards using both World Liberty‚Äôs WLFI token and sUSDe. Ethana announced the alliance on X and emphasized that the proposal aims to increase stablecoin liquidity and utilization rates within the protocol, similar to the effect of sUSDe‚Äôs integration into Aave‚Äôs Core instance. Justin Sun invests $30 million in World Liberty Financial The announcement came shortly after a controversial Chinese crypto entrepreneur, Justin Sun, purchased WLFI tokens worth $30 million, making him the largest single World Liberty Financial token holder then. Less than a week after Sun‚Äôs major financial involvement in the project, World Liberty purchased $500,000 worth of ENA tokens at an average price of $0.98. The venture also purchased Ether, AAVE, ONDO, Chainlink, and cbBTC for about $30 million. The venture sold only 848.63 million WLFI tokens for $12.7 million in its first 24 hours, leaving 19.1 billion tokens up for grabs. Afterward, the venture‚Äôs token sales slowed down. According to the official website of World Liberty Financial, Trump and his family have sold a total of 5.33 billion WLFI tokens at an average price of $0.015 per token. World Liberty Financial website reveals that the venture still has 14.65 billion tokens available for purchase. Crypto investors bet on Trump to transform the crypto after his inauguration Although the project is a massive sign that Blockchain technology is growing rapidly, a few concerns from conflict of interest critics emerged. The launch of a new crypto token raises questions about investors buying into the project to earn influence or Trump pushing on regulators to greenlight his personal businesses, especially now that agencies such as the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have received pro-crypto appointments from the President-elect. Trump has been a strong advocate of crypto and blockchain technology. He took the world by storm last year during his campaigns when he addressed crypto enthusiasts at the Bitcoin Conference 2024 event in a bid to lure crypto investors to vote for him. Trump made promises to the crypto community, making him the best alternative for U.S.-based crypto voters. His victory against Kamala Harris in the presidential elections sparked a wave of optimism as crypto investors began to hope Trump would deliver on his promises, including ending Biden‚Äôs war on crypto and establishing a BTC reserve for the U.S. Treasury.

They awaited a crucial U.S. consumer inflation report that was expected later in the day, keeping investors from making their big moves. According to a Reuters report , the dollar steadied earlier in the Asian session after dropping overnight. Earlier in the week, it had hit a two-year high. However, it soon backed away. This pullback was contributed to by a softer U.S. producer prices report, which eased Treasury yields from their peaks. The euro hovers above its recent two-year low against the greenback Against the dollar, the euro hovered above its recent two-year low and last exchanged for $1.0303 at the time of this writing. On the other hand, the pound fell 0.09% against the greenback to $1.2205. Meanwhile, higher borrowing costs and worries about the UK‚Äôs fiscal health kept applying pressure on the Sterling. Investors are closely eyeing Inflation data in the United Kingdom which will come out later on Wednesday. A weak economy and domestic price pressures catalyze the mounting pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the UK‚Äôs finance minister.

As we move into 2025, the cryptocurrency market is alive with potential. Stellar has made a strong comeback with a 30% price surge, while Helium is showing resilience in a volatile market. These developments highlight the dynamic possibilities within the blockchain space. Qubetics ($TICS), a Web3 aggregator designed to tackle real-world problems that others have yet to solve. With innovative features like Cross-Border Transactions and a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, Qubetics is creating tools that matter. If you‚Äôre hunting for the top altcoins to invest in today, Qubetics might just be the opportunity you‚Äôve been waiting for. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics ($TICS), the world‚Äôs first Web3 aggregator, is redefining blockchain innovation with groundbreaking solutions like its Cross-Border Transactions. With over 14,400 holders and its presale gaining traction, Qubetics is setting a new standard for the crypto industry. Currently in its 17th presale stage, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0501. Over $9.5 million has been raised, and more than 418 million tokens have been sold. Analysts predict explosive growth, making Qubetics the top altcoin to invest in today for massive ROI. One of Qubetics‚Äô most compelling features is its focus on Cross-Border Transactions. Imagine a small business owner in Europe needing to pay suppliers in Asia. Traditional bank transfers are not only slow but also expensive, thanks to intermediary fees and unfavorable exchange rates. Qubetics simplifies this process, offering a blockchain-based solution that‚Äôs fast, secure, and cost-effective. For freelancers working globally, receiving payments in different currencies can be a logistical nightmare. Qubetics offers a streamlined platform to handle these transactions effortlessly. Even families sending remittances can benefit, avoiding the hefty fees associated with traditional money transfer services. Stellar: A Bullish Comeback Stellar, trading at $0.42 as of January 2025, has experienced a 30% price surge this month. This marks a significant rebound after a month-long downtrend, reigniting investor confidence. While the asset faces challenges to sustain this momentum, the bullish sentiment is hard to ignore. Stellar‚Äôs primary focus is on cross-border payments, making it a direct competitor to traditional banking systems. Think about the ease of transferring money across borders in seconds, with minimal fees‚Äîthat‚Äôs Stellar‚Äôs promise. Its partnerships with financial institutions and enterprises have solidified its role as a leader in this space. However, while Stellar offers stability and proven use cases, it doesn‚Äôt have the groundbreaking innovation of Qubetics‚Äô broader ecosystem. Stellar excels in specific niches, but Qubetics is breaking new ground by integrating a wider range of functionalities under one roof. Helium: Powering IoT Connectivity Helium, trading at $4.84, has shown resilience with a 1.76% price increase over the past 24 hours. Its focus on creating a decentralized network for the Internet of Things (IoT) sets it apart in the blockchain space. Helium‚Äôs unique approach involves incentivizing users to provide network coverage using low-power devices, a concept that has gained traction globally. Imagine a smart city where devices like sensors and meters communicate seamlessly, supported by a decentralized network. Helium makes this vision a reality, offering cost-effective and reliable connectivity solutions for IoT applications. For businesses, this means reduced operational costs and improved efficiency. While Helium‚Äôs niche focus on IoT is impressive, its growth potential is more limited compared to a multifaceted project like Qubetics. Helium solves a specific problem, but it doesn‚Äôt offer the same comprehensive solutions that make Qubetics the top altcoin to invest in today. Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Miss This Opportunity For those seeking the top altcoins to invest in today, Qubetics stands as a top contender. Its groundbreaking features and immense growth potential set it apart in a competitive market. While Stellar and Helium present strong use cases, Qubetics goes further‚Äîoffering a forward-looking vision that‚Äôs already becoming a reality. Timing is everything in crypto, and the Qubetics presale is an opportunity you don‚Äôt want to miss. Dive in, explore the platform, and position yourself for what could be one of the most exciting rides in crypto history. The future of blockchain is here, and Qubetics is leading the charge.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address ‚Äì 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI.

According to a recent report by Franklin Templeton, 70% of AI-powered virtual assistants, known as AI agents, choose to operate on the Solana ( SOL ) blockchain. This preference is largely due to Solana‚Äôs ability to handle large volumes of transactions efficiently and at lower costs. Intersection of AI Agents & the Crypto Ecosystem pic.twitter.com/dr621skRxy ‚Äî Franklin Templeton Digital Assets (@FTDA_US) January 14, 2025 These AI agents are sophisticated tools that carry out tasks, make decisions, and interact with both people and digital systems, transforming how operations are managed within the crypto sector. An interesting example of these AI agents at work is the Truth Terminal project AI chatbot which initially gained fame on Twitter by promoting a fictional religion called the ‚ÄúGoatse Gospel.‚Äù It caught the public eye in July 2024 after receiving a large Bitcoin ( BTC ) donation from Marc Andreessen, a well-known venture capitalist from Andreessen Horowitz. Truth Terminal‚Äôs influence extended further when it actively promoted and boosted the Solana-based meme coin Goatseus Maximus ( GOAT ), which achieved a market cap of nearly $1.22 billion on November 16, 2024. As of Jan. 15, GOAT is trading at $0.338 with a market cap of $338 million.

Another promising project, ARC, is a high-performance platform running on Solana to allow rule-based AI agents, which are virtual assistants that help users make decisions or take action.

In the last 24 hours, GRIFFAIN has been up over 19%, AI16Z by over 14%, and ZEREBRO by over 4%, reflecting the strong optimism for these Solana-based AI coins. Most AI agents are still in the nascent stages. The market cap for AI tokens stands at $3.95 billion as of Jan. 15, which makes up only 0.11% of the total crypto market cap. However, certain Solana-funded projects have already gained quite some popularity by pushing the total AI token market cap by 14.5% in a day, as per CoinGecko . For instance, Zerebro has released music albums , while Dolos Diary, another AI agent, has amassed millions of views on TikTok . Apart from these AI agent projects, notable growth has also been seen in Virtual Protocol ( VIRTUAL ), an AI agent launchpad on Ethereum (ETH), which reached a market cap of $4.62 billion on January 1, 2025, but declined to $1.92 billion as of this writing. Interestingly, aixbt ( AIXBT ) by Virtuals Protocol, which operates on both the Base and Solana, has been up by 45.2% in the last 24 hours, as per CoinGecko . While some skeptics in the blockchain community suggest that the AI agent hype is more marketing than technology, the integration of these agents into Solana flourishes as they leverage the performance and price accessibility of the Solana ecosystem to improve its features and user experience. how can crypto AI agents be a bubble, the most hyped narrative of 2025 and the future of humanity at the same time? similar to 2021 where P2E/NFTs were the hype, we saw a lot of possible utility, and it ran for around 12 months. early 2022 the uk/russia war broke out and the‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Condz (@condzxyz) December 29, 2024 Read more: Jito flips Ethereum, Uniswap, and Solana on a crucial metric",News|AI|Blockchain|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-15 05:08:37

The prediction platform typically requires users to place crypto bets on ‚Äòyes‚Äô or ‚Äòno‚Äô answers to a presented question. Just before the November 5 election, the platform saw a significant surge in bets based on who would win the election, suggesting that the election results were a far more exciting topic for the crypto community than the topics it‚Äôs currently presenting. Polymarket‚Äôs trading volume slumps by $2 billion in January from November According to Dune Analytics , prediction platform Polymarket saw $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion in trading volume in October and November, respectively. The surge in trading volume can be attributed to the rise in bets on predicting the outcome of the November 5 US election. November‚Äôs 2024 trading volume was even more than 37,700% higher than the $6.8 million volume in November 2023, hinting at how election results were important to crypto investors. Despite a surge in activity in November, the market has struggled to maintain the same activity level in 2025. Trading volume has dwindled in the first few weeks of 2025 to only $515 million from $1.9 billion in December. Moreover, open interest on Polymarket slumped by 77% between November 6 and January 13. As of January 14, the most trending markets included predictions about how many times Elon Musk would post on X this week, whether New York City would repeal its controversial congestion pricing policy by summer, or if Donald Trump would attempt to purchase Greenland. Polymarket is still struggling with restrictions, user criticism, and market competition As much as Polymarket saw its trading volume rise in November, its popularity did invite regulatory scrutiny. In November, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Shayne Coplan, Polymarket‚Äôs CEO, to determine whether the market continued to comply with the ban imposed on American markets in 2022. Moreover, Singapore restricted access to the prediction platform this January, joining France and Taiwan. Some of the platform‚Äôs users have even voiced concerns over some of the market‚Äôs bets, particularly those centered around LA wildfires. Some have claimed the platform was trying to profit from a national disaster, inviting criticism from concerned crypto investors. Not to mention, the platform still has to fight off top competitor Kalshi after the firm won the court‚Äôs favor in September, allowing American users to bet on its platform.

Bitcoin Realized Price Is Yet To Flip 200-Week MA In a new post on X, analyst James Van Straten has discussed about the Realized Price and 200-week moving average (MA) for Bitcoin. The ‚ÄúRealized Price‚Äù here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition price of the average investor on the BTC network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Under $91,000 As Crypto Inflows See 56% Decline When the spot price of the cryptocurrency is greater than this metric, it means the holders as a whole are in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the indicator suggests the overall market is holding loss. The 200-week MA, the other metric of interest here, is an indicator from technical analysis. An MA is a tool that calculates the average value of a given quantity over a specified time period and as its name implies, moves with time. MAs are useful for studying long-term trends, as they remove all the short-term kinks out of an asset‚Äôs price chart. Certain MAs are considered to carry more significance than the other, with one such period being 200 weeks. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price and 200-week MA over the past several years. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin Realized Price fell under the 200-week MA back during the 2022 bear market. Since then, the metric has remained under the line, but recently, it has been fast approaching a retest. From the chart, it‚Äôs apparent that previous crosses for the indicator above the MA led to full-blown bull runs for the cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúWhen the realized price flips the 200WMA the fun begins,‚Äù notes Van Straten. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Now Capitulating: Bottom Here? Thus, it‚Äôs possible that such a crossover could end up being bullish for Bitcoin in the current cycle as well. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the Realized Price would actually end up surpassing the level in the near future or if a rejection is waiting. On another note, the Realized Price has historically served as the boundary line for the bear market lows in the asset‚Äôs price. As mentioned earlier, the majority of the market enters into a state of loss when BTC falls under the metric. There aren‚Äôt many sellers left looking to take profits in such a market, which is why the asset tends to reach a bottom during it. BTC Price Bitcoin has shown a sharp jump over the past day as its price has recovered to the $96,600 mark after having dropped as low as under $90,000 yesterday.

Meanwhile, the bears try hard to restrict the levels below the 2024 highs at $2.9 but after a small consolidation, the token is believed to secure fresh highs. The newly formed third-largest crypto with over $160 billion market cap surging by over 30% in just a couple of days suggests a huge rise in the trader‚Äôs attention. The question arises whether the Ripple (XRP) price may ever surpass Ethereum (ETH) to become the second largest crypto. It has been over 4 years since the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit and has reached a pivotal point. As per the new report, the agency is required to file its opening brief by January 15. With Gary Gensler stepping down on January 20, incoming pro-crypto SEC Chair Paul Atkins raises hopes for a favourable resolution, though the case‚Äôs complexity tempers expectations. Is a New XRP ATH Coming Soon? Now that the XRP price has flipped the previous resistance and the bullish sentiments surround the token, will the price mark a new ATH this quarter? The historical price action of XRP suggests the XRP price has launched a massive bullish attack. It has been following a pattern, according to which marking a two-digit milestone seems to be inevitable for the rally. Presently, the XRP price is trading nearly the interim highs at $2.9 and the historical pattern suggests the token is due for an upswing of a minimum of 200% in the next few months. The monthly RSI has entered the overbought zone for the first time since the 2018 bull run with a notable rise in the volume. On the other hand, the +Di of DMI has risen above the ADX, suggesting a rise in the rally‚Äôs strength. Therefore, the XRP price is primed for a vertical explosion as it did during the past couple of rallies after a couple of pullbacks. Therefore, the XRP price is expected to surpass $3 anytime from now, which could push the levels towards a new ATH at $3.5, probably during the weekend. This move is expected to attract some bearish activity but after a small consolidation, a bullish continuation seems imminent. The XRP price has been maintaining strong bullish momentum, even amidst the market retracement. Moreover, with the positive sentiments mounting ahead of the speculation of approval of a spot XRP ETF , liquidity in billions is expected to enter the platform. Besides, XRP is moving forward with a robust technology as a solution in international payments and remittances. With the optimism surrounding the inauguration of the new government in the U.S., cryptos like XRP are expected to gain new highs soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President with significant contributions and a grand ‚ÄúInaugural Crypto Ball‚Äù in Washington, DC. Scheduled for January 17, this black-tie event celebrates Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto policies and signals a revolutionary change toward digital currencies in U.S. policy. Major Backing for the ‚ÄúCrypto Ball‚Äù Event The Crypto Ball event is being hosted by BTC Inc. and co-hosted by Stand With Crypto, Exodus, Anchorage Digital, and Kraken. The event has garnered strong backing from major players like Coinbase, MicroStrategy, and Galaxy Digital. Prominent blockchain companies such as Sui, Mysten Labs, Solana, and Uniswap Labs are also key sponsors, showcasing the growing influence of crypto in mainstream politics. Tickets for the event have seen overwhelming demand, with Gold tickets sold out at $2,500 each. Remaining options include $5,000 Black tickets and exclusive VIP packages priced at $100,000 or $1 million, offering unique perks like a private dinner with Trump. While Trump is not expected to attend, his appointed AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks , will host the ball. Trump To Form Crypto Advisory Council Reports suggest that Trump is forming a Crypto Advisory Council of up to 22 blockchain leaders to guide federal policies. On his first day in office, Trump is expected to issue executive orders promoting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These orders may include overturning restrictive SEC policies and allowing banks to hold custody of digital assets. Impact OF Crypto Ball Event On BTC Price As the event nears, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has shown positive movement, recovering from $89K to $97K as of January 15.

Filan revealed on Wednesday. The attorney noted that both parties had submitted a stipulation while agreeing to file a deferred appendix. Amid this development, XRP price is also up by 11.52% with bulls now eyeing a breakout past $3. XRP Lawsuit and Cross-Appeals Timeline Providing the recent updates in the ongoing XRP lawsuit and cross-appeals, defense attorney James K. Filan said both parties have submitted a stipulation agreeing to file a deferred appendix for the cross-appeals 21 days after the appellee‚Äôs opening brief is served. Additionally, attorney James Filan has also confirmed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) needs to file its opening brief by the stipulated deadline, scheduled for tomorrow. The official filing document reads: ‚ÄúIT IS HEREBY STIPULATED, CONSENTED, AND AGREED by and between the undersigned counsel for the parties that the parties will file a deferred appendix for this appeal and cross ‚Äì appeal pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 30(c) and L.R. 30.1(c)‚Äù. Commenting on this filing, Sherrie who closely follows the case noted: ‚ÄúWhat this means: parties will file a single combined appendix that only includes the information referenced in the briefs later on. This doesn‚Äôt change anything regarding the briefs that are yet to be filed‚Äù. With the start of 2025, another Ripple lawsuit has seen some key developments. Last week, Senior District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton granted the defendants‚Äô motion to seal confidential documents from public access in the In re Ripple Labs Litigation . Ripple and CEO Brad Garlinghouse filed a request to seal eight exhibits submitted as part of their motion for summary judgment in the ongoing XRP lawsuit. All Eyes on SEC‚Äôs Opening Brief Last year in 2023, the court announced that Ripple needs to pay $125 million in settlement charges to the US SEC, much lower than the $2 billion demanded by the securities regulator. The securities regulator will file a brief by the January 15 deadline while appealing the court ruling in XRP Lawsuit. Investors have been accumulating XRP, driving its token price higher as anticipation builds ahead of the SEC‚Äôs appeals brief.

The daily trading volumes have also surged by 12% to over $11.5 billion showing strong support for the bullish momentum to continue. As per the Coinglass data , the XRP open interest has surged by 21% while the 24-hour liquidations have surged to $14 million of which $10 million is in short liquidations. The XRP price hits fresh highs on the monthly chart, amid strong accumulation by whales holding anywhere between 1 million to 10 million XRP. These large-scale investors have increased their holdings by over 37% in the past two months, adding approximately $3.8 billion worth of XRP since November 12, 2024. This trend underscores robust market confidence and heightened demand for the Ripple cryptocurrency. Source: Santiment On the other hand, XRP Ledger is seeing strong demand due to its potential applications in banking and financial transactions. The demand is likely to surge following the expected settlement of the XRP lawsuit during the Trump administration. Furthermore, banking giant JPMorgan hinted at the possibility of an XRP ETF approval this year in 2025, while expecting nearly $8 billion in inflows during the first year of approval.

Remittix Set For 3,000% Gains By July!",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-vs-shiba-inu-which-one-will-prevail-in-2025-remittix-set-for-3000-gains-by-july/,"Crypto market has been losing steam in recent weeks without spearing the meme tokens. In the past week, Dogecoin is down by 16.8% following a 21% loss in the past one month. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is also down by 15% and 28% in the same period. Based on available data, analysts are currently analyzing the two tokens, projecting which would prevail in 2025. Same analysts have eyes set on Remittix , a token they predict will surge by 3,000% by July. Dogecoin‚Äôs Recovery or More Bearish Signals? Dogecoin is the largest memecoin by market cap, currently standing at $47.1 billion, dominating more than 50% of the meme coin market, and still maintaining its strong influence despite the ongoing decline..Over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin has dropped by 3.89% and is currently holding at $0.32. Data from TradingView shows that the Dogecoin‚Äôs price is retracing, reaching $0.3262, creating its fifth consecutive bearish candle. This persistent downtrodden highlights strong selling pressure. Also, the prevailing bearish trend shows the exponential moving average lines have given bearish crossovers and attained a negative alignment. Meanwhile, looking at the Fibonacci pattern, the Dogecoin trend suggests a potential double-bottom reversal from the 23.60% level. So, if this reversal plays out, it could initiate a bullish recovery, rechallenging the $0.40 mark. However, a bearish closing under the 23.60% Fibonacci level will put the $0.30 psychological zone at risk, potentially dropping to $0.265 support level. Could SHIB Recover From Its Downward Trend? Looking at the Shiba Inu‚Äôs price trend, there is not much difference in their prices patterns in recent weeks. Shiba Inu is currently down by 6.9% and 15.6% in the past day and week, currently trading at 0.00002011. With a market cap of $11.8 billion, it ranks as the 15th-largest cryptocurrency. With its price cheaper than Dogecoin, holders could accumulate more Shib than the former. While this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that Shiba Inu will outperform Dogecoin, it does make the token more appealing to some investors. Additionally, Shiba Inu has a lower market cap compared to Dogecoin, potentially giving investors more return if both coins should have a similar percentage increase. Looking at Shib on the 1-day chart, the altcoin seems to be consolidating in a short-term range between $0.0000211 and $0.0000246. However, this formation doesn‚Äôt indicate clear bullish momentum on the higher time frames. Additionally, Shiba Inu‚Äôs trading volume has dipped in recent weeks, suggesting that market traders are waiting for a strong bullish trend to emerge. From the current market sentiment and trading volume, a push towards the $0.00002312 level and audacious highs at $0.00002464 seems more likely. However, the reduced trading and the still broader crypto market, especially Bitcoin‚Äôs suggest Shib‚Äôs price will follow the broader cryptocurrency market trends Is Remittix Gearing For a 3,000% Surge? Before looking at the price analysis of RTX, a closer look at the use cases of the Remittix would explain the sentiment surrounding the token. For years, cross-border payments have been a challenge for users due to hidden costs, slow transaction times, and bloated systems. However, Remittix enters the PayFi space and pairs fiat banking with cryptocurrency to offer a frictionless, low-cost payment option. Addressing challenges of excessive delays and inflated costs, Remittix‚Äôs foundation is modern blockchain technology to enable instantaneous global transfers. By integrating cryptocurrency wallets with fiat bank accounts, Remittix eliminates middlemen and hidden charges, allowing users to send and receive money across borders with same-day processing and zero foreign currency fees. Additionally, With support for over 40 currencies, Remittix provides exceptional value for individuals and businesses needing quick, reliable payment solutions.

Remittix‚Äôs unique selling point is its commitment to user confidence. As such, the platform and RTX token has been audited by leading security firms. Additionally, liquidity is locked for three years to guarantee stability. With the presale underway and tokens selling rapidly, Remittix is poised to set a new standard. The RTX token is currently priced at $0.0207 in its ongoing presale and has already raised over $2.8 million in weeks. Analysts predict strong growth by July, potentially surging above 3,000% mark, a move that will see its price rise above $0.6169. This positions RTX as a top investment.

With $9.7 million raised within a few months, Flockerz has captured the attention of investors with its unique blend of meme culture and real utility. Currently priced at $0.0066883 per token, $FLOCK offers early investors an opportunity to join a project that is setting new benchmarks in the meme coin sector. As the clock ticks down, Flockerz is poised for a strong debut in the rapidly growing meme coin market. Redefining Meme Coins With Flocktopia‚Äôs Vote-to-Earn DAO What sets Flockerz apart from typical meme coins is its groundbreaking decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Flocktopia. Designed to put power into the hands of its community, Flocktopia allows $FLOCK holders to vote on important decisions that shape the project‚Äôs future, such as partnerships, development initiatives, and token burns. https://twitter.com/FlockerzToken/status/1831330384770207825 Unlike traditional DAOs, Flocktopia introduces a Vote-to-Earn model, where participants are rewarded with $FLOCK tokens for their votes. This system not only encourages active participation but also ensures that the community‚Äôs interests are aligned with the project‚Äôs long-term success. By incentivizing decentralized governance, Flocktopia addresses a key issue in the crypto space: centralization. Many meme coins are controlled by small, centralized teams, which can lead to decisions that don‚Äôt benefit the broader community. Flocktopia‚Äôs model ensures fairness, transparency, and inclusivity, making it a standout feature in the crowded meme coin market. High-Yield Staking: Passive Income for $FLOCK Holders In addition to its innovative governance model, Flockerz offers investors a chance to grow their holdings through its staking mechanism. Currently, $FLOCK holders can stake their tokens to earn an impressive 280% annual percentage yield (APY). With over 642 million tokens already staked, this program reflects strong investor confidence in Flockerz‚Äôs vision. Staking during the presale comes with dual benefits. Not only do investors compound their holdings before the token is listed on exchanges, but they also stand to gain from potential price increases after the launch. This mechanism creates a steady demand for $FLOCK while reducing the circulating supply, contributing to price stability. Flockerz has allocated 25% of its total token supply to staking rewards, ensuring that loyal investors continue to benefit as the ecosystem grows. However, as more tokens are staked, the APY will decrease, making early staking even more advantageous. Analyst Confidence in Flockerz‚Äôs Potential Flockerz‚Äôs unique approach has caught the attention of crypto analysts and influencers. ClayBro, a prominent YouTuber with over 135K subscribers, talked about how $FLOCK is collecting more than $100K daily through the ongoing presale. The YouTuber emphasized that the high staking rewards and Vote-to-Earn ecosystem will play a role in making Flockerz a top long-term investment opportunity. Flockerz Token Will Be Launching Soon! Bull Market Gains Ahead, But Only If We Participate! The success of Flockerz comes at a time when the meme coin market is experiencing a significant revival. In 2024, the market‚Äôs valuation skyrocketed from $20 billion to over $120 billion ‚Äì a staggering 500% increase. Furthermore, retail investors are diversifying into new presales ‚Äì with the likes of Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) collecting nearly $50 million in just a couple of months. With the momentum firmly in favor of meme coins, Flockerz is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this trend and deliver substantial returns to its investors. Final Opportunity to Join the $FLOCK Presale With just seven days remaining, this is the last chance for investors to secure $FLOCK tokens at presale prices. The token is available for purchase through the Flockerz website or the Best Wallet app , which features $FLOCK in its ‚ÄúUpcoming Tokens‚Äù section. The presale offers a unique opportunity to invest in a project that combines the fun and creativity of meme culture with real-world utility. As Flockerz prepares for its exchange debut, early adopters who stake their tokens now could see compounded rewards and significant returns in the future. Flockerz isn‚Äôt just riding the wave of meme coin popularity ‚Äì it‚Äôs setting new standards for the space. By merging decentralized governance, high-yield staking, and community engagement, Flockerz offers a comprehensive ecosystem that goes beyond hype. As the meme coin market continues to grow, Flockerz‚Äôs innovative features and strong community backing make it a standout contender for exponential growth. Flockerz has quickly built a vibrant and engaged community, with over 30,000 followers on X , and 5,800 Telegram members. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned investor or new to crypto, Flockerz presents a compelling opportunity to be part of a project that is shaping the future of meme coins. The project has also undergone rigorous audits by Coinsult and Solid Proof , ensuring a high level of security and transparency for its users.

CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us), a crypto news and analysis platform on X, highlighted these movements in a recent post, referencing a chart by Washigorira. The chart reveals that XRP experienced a death cross in December 2024, signaling bearish momentum. Another death cross appeared on XRP‚Äôs chart in early January 2025, marking the digital asset‚Äôs first significant bearish indicator of the new year. However, subsequent market movements invalidated these bearish signals. A golden cross, where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average, has now formed, often regarded as a strong bullish signal. Additionally, XRP has broken through a descending trendline, further supporting a potential upward trend. On Saturday, January 11, the digital asset experienced a notable surge, breaking above $2.6. It currently trades at $2.83, up 4.3% from last week. In the post, CryptosRus stated that XRP is ‚Äúgearing up for some big moves,‚Äù implying that these combined indicators could lead to significant price gains.

Get ready, XRP is gearing up for some big moves Chart: Washigorira pic.twitter.com/AYuxACZL10 ‚Äî CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) January 12, 2025 Potential Target for XRP The chart shows an intriguing target that could help XRP achieve a feat the community eagerly anticipated. The Fibonacci extension on the chart sets an ambitious target of $4.32 for XRP, representing a new all-time high for the digital asset. This level is also above the $4 level, which many analysts see as a crucial resistance level. In late 2023, one analyst predicted that a surge to $4 would come out of nowhere , and with this golden cross formation, XRP could experience a notable rally in no time. Can XRP Reach This Target? The golden cross comes as market participants are closely monitoring XRP‚Äôs price movements. With Donald Trump set to take office in under a week, the XRP army is excited about the future of digital assets. There are many promising developments, like the upcoming resignation of Gary Gensler , the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who has waged a war on crypto for years. Ripple, XRP, and the broader crypto market are about to be set free to grow and change the global financial landscape, and 2025 could be a game-changing year for XRP.

The complaint was filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., and alleges that Musk violated disclosure laws while amassing a large stake in the social media company. Elon Musk Faces US SEC Lawsuit for Securities Fraud In the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit , Elon Musk is accused of acquiring more than 5% of Twitter stock in March 2022. According to the federal regulations, shareholders are expected to report their holdings once they cross this threshold within ten days. The SEC alleges that Musk failed to disclose this information for 11 days and during this time he was purchasing shares at a lower price to avoid public knowledge. According to the SEC, Musk‚Äôs delayed disclosure let him purchase shares from unsuspecting investors and allegedly saved him more than $150 million. On 4th of April, 2022, Musk made public his investment in Twitter and claimed to have more than 9% of Twitter‚Äôs stocks. In the same week, Twitter made an announcement that it would be joining the exchange and its stock price increased by more than 27%. Legal Team Denies Allegations The attorney representing Elon Musk, Alex Spiro, said that the SEC complaint is a ‚Äòsham‚Äô and that the SEC is harassing Musk. Spiro said that the case was rooted in a bureaucratic matter and pointed out that ‚Äúeven if it is proven this alleged failure to submit a form has a very limited consequence.‚Äù Musk and the SEC have been in a tense relationship for the past few years with several investigations and legal battles. The billionaire has earlier on complained to the agency saying that it has been after him. Last month, Musk told X that the SEC had tried to convince him to pay a fine in the case but when he refused the regulator decided to pursue charges. Moreover, the agency has been called out severally for regulation by enforcement with recent lawsuit against Ripple moving forward as both parties submitted a stipulation while agreeing to file a deferred appendix. US SEC Seeks Financial Penalties In the lawsuit, the SEC wants the court to order Musk to give up any purported profits from the non-disclosure and also pay civil penalties. The agency is also asking for a jury trial in the case to decide whether or not Musk has violated securities laws. The lawsuit is the latest in a string of legal battles that Elon Musk has had to deal with since acquiring Twitter in a $44bn deal in October 2022. The acquisition was signed after a long period of negotiations and public confrontation between the parties, including Musk‚Äôs attempts to withdraw from the deal due to the presence of bots on the platform. This follows another lawsuit by the SEC regarding Musk‚Äôs acquisition of Twitter Inc. The Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System had sued Musk in 2022 for allegedly defrauding investors and untimely revelation of his plan to acquire the company. According to the pension fund, Musk‚Äôs actions impacted other shareholders‚Äô choices and harmed them financially through the lawsuit he filed. That lawsuit, Rasella v. Musk, was filed in a federal court in New York and the case is ongoing. The SEC‚Äôs lawsuit also comes at a time when there are changes in the leadership at the agency. Outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has been under pressure from business leaders, including Ripple CEO Brad, said that he will step down at the end of his term, which is on 20th January, after President-elect Donald Trump swearing in.

This strategy skyrocketed DOG‚Äôs value and established it as a significant token within the Runes system.

The decision follows the termination of a deal for Bitwise Asset Management to acquire OBTC‚Äôs assets. In a statement on January 14 , Osprey revealed plans to file a Form S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ‚Äúas soon as practicable.‚Äù Osprey CEO Optimistic About Filing for Bitcoin ETF Conversion Osprey‚Äôs CEO Greg King expressed optimism about filing the form by the end of January. ‚ÄúWe are committed to getting our investors into a Bitcoin ETF. This seems like the surest path at this point,‚Äù King stated. OBTC, launched in February 2021, was initially positioned as a competitor to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The fund tracks Bitcoin‚Äôs price without directly holding the cryptocurrency and currently manages $181 million in assets. While OBTC has seen a 151% price increase over the past year, it remains below its $50 all-time high reached at launch. Part 2 $OBTC https://t.co/rCgBotZO06 https://t.co/Nl69tyZen9 ‚Äî Greg King, CFA (@GregoryDKing) January 14, 2025 The decision to pursue an ETF conversion follows the collapse of a proposed acquisition by Bitwise. The deal, announced in August 2024, allowed for termination after December 31, 2024, if regulatory approvals were not secured. Osprey‚Äôs announcement comes amid growing momentum in the ETF market, with the SEC recently approving Bitcoin and Ether ETFs from Hashdex and Franklin Templeton. Currently, 32 Bitcoin ETFs trade in the U.S., though only 11 are spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to VettaFi. Osprey‚Äôs OBTC closed its last trading session with a 3% increase, reaching $29.84. The firm, however, has faced challenges in the highly competitive crypto asset market. In January 2023, Osprey filed a lawsuit against Grayscale, alleging misleading advertising and anti-competitive practices that allowed Grayscale to dominate the Bitcoin OTC trust market. This lawsuit remains unresolved. Osprey also explored options to sell or liquidate OBTC in March 2024, citing the fund‚Äôs units trading at a discount to Bitcoin‚Äôs value. Despite these hurdles, the firm appears determined to position OBTC as a spot Bitcoin ETF, a move aimed at capitalizing on the growing demand for regulated Bitcoin investment products. US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Over $35B in Inflows in 2024 As reported, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States recorded a remarkable $35.66 billion in net inflows in 2024, significantly exceeding early industry projections. BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) led the market with $37.31 billion in inflows, followed by Fidelity‚Äôs Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $11.84 billion, and ARK‚Äôs 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) with $2.49 billion. Other significant contributors included the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which reported $2.19 billion in inflows. These figures far surpassed Galaxy Digital‚Äôs initial $14 billion first-year estimate. However, Bitcoin ETFs faced a slight downturn toward the year‚Äôs end, with $1.33 billion in outflows since Dec. 19. On the Ether ETF front, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) led inflows with $3.52 billion and $1.56 billion, respectively. Grayscale‚Äôs low-fee Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) secured $608.1 million in inflows, while the Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) crossed $400 million.

Recently, Bitcoin touched the $100K mark for the first time, driven by the appointment of Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, as SEC Chair under the Trump administration. This move marks a significant regulatory shift towards fostering innovation in the digital asset market in the US. As the bull run market continues, the Crypto Market Sentiment Index climbed to 63, which reflects the growing optimism of investors. Popular altcoins like XRP and Solana closely follow the growth trajectory of Bitcoin, surging 5.8% and 7.3%, respectively. Naturally, investors looking to diversify their portfolios and ride the crypto wave are exploring the hottest crypto presales in January 2025 . With the market poised for further evolution, here are the top 5 presales you should be looking at. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) ‚Äì Overall Best Crypto Presale in January 2025 Having raised over $48M during its ongoing presale, Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) continues to dominate the list of most sought-after crypto assets in 2025. Interestingly, it blends entertainment and innovation. $WEPE stands out as it aims to break the dominance of whales (or institutional investors) and empower small-scale traders like you and me. As a $WEPE holder, you‚Äôll gain access to expert market strategies and alpha trading calls. Plus, you‚Äôll also benefit from tools previously available only to Wall Street pros. One $WEPE is currently available at $0.00036647, with the price set to increase in the next four hours. So, interested investors shouldn‚Äôt delay their purchase any more. If this is your first time buying a presale, check out our how to buy $WEPE guide for all the info. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Layer-2 Solution Promises to Revolutionize Solana Solaxy ($SOLX) has been built on the Solana blockchain and focuses on low-cost transactions at ultra-high speeds. This makes it ideal for gaming, DeFi applications, and decentralized projects. Most importantly, it aims to remove all inadequacies of Layer-1 chains. Its multi-chain compatibility and staking rewards appeal to both analysts and investors alike. Capitalizing on Solana‚Äôs growing dominance in the crypto market, $SOLX‚Äôs price is likely to soar in 2025, with experts suggesting it could be the next 100x token. Currently in presale, $SOLX has already crossed the $10M mark, and each token is presently available at $0.0016. 3. Flockerz ($FLOCK) ‚Äì Unique V2E Mechanism & Rewarding Staking APY As a pioneering Vote-to-Earn project, Flockerz ($FLOCK) has gained significant traction. Investors can shape the future of this project by voting on key decisions, for which they earn rewards. This innovative project has already raised over $10M during its presale, and you can get in now for just $0.0066883 per token. Analysts expect $FLOCK‚Äôs post-listing value to rise significantly, as the project features a robust NFT-based ecosystem that allows users to mint, trade, and collect unique digital birds. Token holders can also engage in a gaming metaverse, which delivers an intuitive experience. What‚Äôs more, a 274% APY staking reward and robust security audits ( SOLIDProof and Coinsult ) add to Flockerz‚Äôs appeal. 4. iDEGEN ($iDEGEN) ‚Äì One of the Best AI Meme Coins iDEGEN ($iDEGEN) is an AI meme coin that aims to revolutionize the crypto market. It‚Äôs powered by an autonomous, sentient AI that interacts dynamically on X , responding to every mention and learning from inputs provided by users. This kind of interactivity creates a unique and community-driven ecosystem where users can influence the AI‚Äôs behavior. Since its presale began, $iDEGEN has raised over $16M, recording a staggering 23,446% price increment since its launch. This coin is quickly gaining traction and is an exciting choice for investors. While some investors tag this coin a bit risky, that‚Äôs the element that can fetch you impressive returns. The high-risk/high-reward potential of iDEGEN makes it a bold pick among analysts in 2025. 5. Race to a Billion ($RACE) ‚Äì Predict Virtual Race Outcomes and Win Tokens Race to a Billion ($RACE) is another new coin that redefines gaming with blockchain, making it more meaningful and rewarding for players. Token holders can predict virtual race outcomes between meme-inspired characters. $RACE tokens act as digital assets, which makes them different from traditional gaming currency. Therefore, as an investor, you hold real value recorded by blockchains that can grow over time. Staking incentivizes community participation, which creates a stable foundation for growth through smart contracts. $RACE brings you a practical way to explore blockchain gaming while building long-term value. Having raised over $227K during its ongoing presale, it‚Äôs admittedly slower than the other presales, but there‚Äôs a lot of potential. Each token is currently price at just $0.00829. Verdict ‚Äì Fast BUT Furious Having shown you the top crypto presales on the market right now, it‚Äôs important we mention that investments are subject to market risks. This is especially true in the crypto space, which is wrought with volatility. So, you must do your own research and only invest an amount you‚Äôre comfortable losing.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-15 07:12:25

According to a Bloomberg report published on Jan. 15, the Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission might allow Bitcoin ETFs to list on local exchanges for the first time as the country attempts to keep up with other countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and the U.S. in terms of developing its cryptocurrency sector. As of Nov. 30, 2024, data from the Thailand SEC shows that there are at least 270,000 active crypto trading accounts. The number of active accounts in November more than doubled compared to that of the previous month, which only reached 117,000. Acknowledging the importance of the crypto sector in Thailand moving forward, Secretary-General Pornanong Budsaratragoon said the SEC will consider letting individuals and corporations invest directly in local Bitcoin ETFs. ‚ÄúLike it or not, we have to move along with more adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide. We have to adapt and ensure that our investors have more options in crypto assets with proper protection,‚Äù said Pornanong. Thailand is not the only one. Leaders of major banks in Japan have also been pushing for its regulators to allow crypto-backed ETFs, specifically Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs . Other countries in the Asia-Pacific region like Hong Kong and Australia, have approved their own spot crypto ETFs .

As previously reported by crypto.news, the Thailand Crime Suppression Division is in the process of obtaining arrest warrants for those involved. Back in June 2024, Thailand‚Äôs One Asset Management had already launched a fund-of-funds that offers investors exposure to Bitcoin ETFs linked to companies overseas. However, Thailand has yet to allow local ETFs to invest directly in Bitcoin, the current largest cryptocurrency by market cap. In addition, the Thai SEC is also considering allowing local companies to issue stablecoins backed by their own bonds in order to expand access to corporate debt markets and minimize costs, according to Pornanong. Last December, Thailand‚Äôs former prime minister and crypto advocate Thaksin Shinawatra proposed a pilot project to develop Bitcoin payment in Phuket. Deputy Prime Minister Pichai Chunhavajira confirmed that the pilot project will mainly focus on tourists, making it easier for them to do digital payments in the region.

A recent report on Wednesday revealed Thailand‚Äôs plans to adopt Bitcoin ETFs, permitting local exchanges to list the exchange-traded funds. Thailand Prepares for Bitcoin ETF Debut The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to approve its first Bitcoin ETF, aligning with the country‚Äôs crypto hub vision, Bloomberg reported on January 15. SEC Secretary-General Pornanong Budsaratragoon posited that the move would allow individual and institutional investors to invest in the Bitcoin vehicles directly. Promoting the use of cryptocurrencies, Thailand is paving the way for the worldwide adoption of digital assets. During an interview on Tuesday, Pornanong stated, Like it or not, we have to move along with more adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide. We have to adapt and ensure that our investors have more options in crypto assets with proper protection. Although, One Asset Management in Thailand has introduced a fund-of-fund tracking international Bitcoin ETFs, a direct investment tool remains pending approval. The ONE Bitcoin ETF Fund of Funds Unhedged and not for Retail Investors (ONE-BTCETFOF-UI) and was approved by the Thai SEC last year. Thailand‚Äôs Thaksin To Legalize Crypto The latest development came on the heels of Pheu Thai Party leader Thaksin Shinawatra‚Äôs efforts to legalize crypto. Citing the incoming US President Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly approach, Thaksin suggested Thailand embrace a more progressive stance on virtual assets. He also proposed the increased issuance and use of stablecoins. Digital-asset trading activity in Thailand is picking up amid a wider rally that pushed Bitcoin to a record high of $108,315. Crypto hedge funds had a great last year but failed to give more returns than Bitcoin (BTC), as per Bloomberg Thailand‚Äôs Broader Crypto Vision and Regulations Thailand has long been striving to solidify its position at the forefront of the global crypto market. In a recent development, the country announced its crypto payment pilot project, with the trial set in Phuket. While the initiative is expected to be executed within Thailand‚Äôs existing legal framework, it bolsters the nation‚Äôs crypto vision. The country is broadly looking to boost crypto adoption and Bitcoin ETFs will be welcome move for the local crypto industry.

The investment management firm said in a Jan. 14 statement that it would file a Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ‚Äúas soon as practicable‚Äù to convert the Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OBTC) into an ETF. Launched in February 2021, OBTC offers investors exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct investment, such as managing wallets or keys. The fund carries a management fee of 0.49%, making it one of the lowest-cost solutions of its kind. As of January 7, 2025, OBTC managed approximately $186.7 million in assets, with each share representing about 0.000326 Bitcoin. The decision to convert OBTC into an ETF comes after the termination of a proposed asset purchase agreement with Bitwise. Announced in August 2024, the deal aimed to transfer OBTC‚Äôs assets to Bitwise‚Äôs portfolio, providing unitholders with exposure to Bitcoin through Bitwise Bitcoin shares. However, as the December 31 regulatory deadline passed without the necessary approvals, the deal fell through , forcing both parties to walk away.

Of these, 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively manage around $109 billion in assets as of Jan. 15, just a year after the first approval .

This delay allows the SEC more time to conduct a thorough evaluation. The fund aims to track the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Cardano, Avalanche, Bitcoin Cash, Polkadot, and Uniswap. NYSE Arca initially submitted the proposal on November 14, 2024. It was published in the Federal Register on December 3, with no public comments submitted. By law, the SEC must act within 45 days, meaning the initial deadline was January 17, 2025. However, the decision has now been postponed. Approval of this ETF would mark a significant milestone in cryptocurrency regulation , signaling a pivotal moment for crypto investment vehicles. Bitwise has managed this fund since 2018, and the proposed ETF conversion has generated interest within the financial and crypto sectors. Analysts widely anticipated this delay, as the SEC often takes a cautious approach to such applications. Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart commented on Twitter, saying the postponement was expected. He also predicted similar delays for other proposals, including Grayscale's GDLC fund, whose decision deadline is February 2, 2025. In addition, crypto analyst Marty Party linked these delays to political factors, suggesting that approvals may come more swiftly after the next presidential inauguration. He pointed out that the Bitwise fund includes major cryptocurrencies like BTC , ETH, and SOL. Such funds could significantly impact the market if approved. Separately, Bitwise filed a new application with the SEC in December for the ""Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF."" This fund would focus on companies holding large Bitcoin reserves. The SEC‚Äôs methodical approach to these proposals highlights its effort to balance innovation with investor protection. While delays were expected, the potential approval of these ETFs would represent a breakthrough for crypto investment products , enabling more widespread participation in digital asset markets. Analysts and investors alike continue to monitor these developments closely.",,EN,0,0,BCH|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-15 07:26:28

The three nations urged stronger collaboration between public and private sectors to counter these attacks and recover stolen funds. North Korean hackers stole over $1.3 billion in cryptocurrency in 2024 , a record amount, with much of it funding ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs. The statement highlights the advanced tactics used by North Korean hackers, who frequently target cryptocurrency exchanges, digital asset custodians, and individuals. These cyberattacks often involve malware, social engineering, and insider operations. North Korean IT workers have infiltrated Web3 and blockchain companies, compromising their networks while posing as employees of legitimate organizations. The governments warned companies in these sectors to carefully vet freelancers and contractors to avoid unintentionally hiring DPRK-affiliated workers. According to Chainalysis, North Korean hackers stole $660.50 million in 2023 across 20 incidents. In 2024, this figure rose dramatically to $1.34 billion across 47 incidents‚Äîa 102% increase. These funds are believed to directly support North Korea‚Äôs missile programs and military advancements. The notorious Lazarus Group, a DPRK-linked hacker collective, has been responsible for many of the largest thefts in the cryptocurrency sector. Three weeks ago, South Korea sanctioned 15 North Korean IT organization members for allegedly aiding the country‚Äôs nuclear weapons program. The sanctioned individuals were reportedly operating in China, Russia , Southeast Asia, and Africa under fake identities, funneling earnings back to North Korea. The US, Japan, and South Korea emphasized the need for transnational collaboration to disrupt these activities. They called for increased efforts to prevent theft, recover stolen funds, and deny North Korea access to illicit revenue streams. The statement also urged private entities to implement stricter cybersecurity measures and to review governmental advisories on mitigating cyber threats. In October, US authorities seized Bitcoin and Tether linked to the Lazarus Group after they stole $879 million. Legal actions were initiated to recover $2.67 million in digital assets from two major hacks: one involving $1.7 million USDT stolen from Deribit and another targeting Bitcoin holdings worth over $970,000. The statement underscores the persistent threat posed by DPRK-affiliated hacking groups. These advanced groups, including the Lazarus Group, have been labeled as ongoing security risks by authorities in the US, Japan, and South Korea.

Expert Predicts Final Correction Before Bull Market Resurgence,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/last-dip-for-altcoins-expert-predicts-final-correction-before-bull-market-resurgence/,"As the cryptocurrency market grapples with a broader decline, altcoins have faced significant challenges, with Ethereum (ETH) leading the way with losses nearing 20%. This drop comes after Ethereum‚Äôs repeated failures to break through the crucial resistance level of $4,000, a barrier that has proven formidable in recent months also preventing the cryptocurrency to reach new record levels as Bitcoin (BTC) did to close 2024. Mid-Cycle Correction For Altcoins: A Path To Recovery? Market expert Ash Crypto has recently offered insights in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), into the current state of altcoins, suggesting that they are undergoing a ‚Äúmid-cycle correction.‚Äù According to Ash Crypto, this phase is a natural part of the bull market cycle and may set the stage for a recovery of previously lost value and potentially even higher gains for these digital assets. Related Reading: Chainlink Weekly Chart Looks Promising ‚Äì If Bulls Reclaim $30 ‚ÄòATH Are Next‚Äô In his social media post, the expert highlighted historical precedents, noting that similar price actions were seen in January 2021, just before the onset of an altcoin season that captivated investors. Despite recent fluctuations, Ethereum and other altcoins have shown slight signs of recovery, with ETH managing to surge above $3,200, rebounding from its nearest support level of $3,100. This recent uptick prevented further losses and sparked hope among traders. However, Ash Crypto cautions that another dip may be on the horizon before a more sustained recovery can take hold. Market Whales May Shake Out Retail Investors In his analysis, Ash Crypto projected that altcoins could experience one final market correction before entering what he believes will be a full bull mode later this year. The expert referenced a chart he shared, depicting the total market capitalization of altcoins excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, which showed potential consolidation between the $926 billion and $930 billion levels. This consolidation phase could precede a move towards a bullish cycle peak, estimated to reach as high as $3.39 trillion. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Crash To $89,000 Reveals Where BTC Is Headed Next Adding to the intrigue, Ash Crypto remarked that Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance appears to have topped out, suggesting that an altcoin season is imminent. However, he warns that before this potential surge, market whales may attempt to shake out retail investors by manipulating prices. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,215, up over 3% in the 24-hour time frame. Other altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) have also risen by 5%, 3% and 5.3% respectively in the same time frame. Taking into account Ash Crypto‚Äôs analysis, it remains to be seen whether further consolidation or another correction will take place for altcoins before what could be the most notable gains for these digital assets in history.

These estimates are based on adoption rates observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs, signaling strong growth potential for these digital assets. Historical Context of ETP Adoption According to the image shared by Sigel, Exchange-traded products tied to Bitcoin currently hold $108 billion in assets, which accounts for 6% of Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization of $1.874 trillion. Similarly, Ethereum ETPs reached a penetration rate of 3% of the asset‚Äôs total market cap‚Äî$12 billion of assets relative to Ethereum‚Äôs $395 billion market cap‚Äîwithin their first six months of operation. JPMorgan analysts applied these adoption metrics to forecast potential outcomes for XRP and Solana. If these assets achieve similar levels of penetration, their ETPs could unlock significant new capital flows into the respective markets. SOL & XRP ETPs Could Attract $3-8bn Each: JPM ETP assets ($108bn) make up 6% of the total Bitcoin market cap ($1,874bn) after the ETPs‚Äô first year of trading; likewise, ether ETP assets ($12bn) have a 3% penetration rate of the total Ethereum market cap ($395bn) within its first‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/7rApA2z71h ‚Äî matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) January 13, 2025 XRP and Solana ETP Projections The report suggests that XRP, with its market cap of $146.5 billion at the time of the analysis, could attract between $4.3 billion (at a 3% penetration rate) and $8.4 billion (at a 6% penetration rate) into ETPs. Solana, with a market cap of $90.5 billion, might see inflows ranging from $2.7 billion (3%) to $5.2 billion (6%). These projections underline the strong potential of both assets to capture a significant share of institutional and retail investment through ETPs.

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional and Retail Implications The potential influx of billions into XRP and SOL through ETPs could mark a pivotal step in broadening access to these digital assets. ETPs simplify exposure to cryptocurrencies for institutional investors and retail participants by bypassing the complexities of direct token ownership. The success of XRP and Solana ETPs would further validate the demand for regulated and tradable investment products tied to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, these projections come at the moment when regulatory clarity for XRP is expected to improve with Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. Experts believe the SEC will dismiss its lawsuit against Ripple once Trump takes office, and provide proper crypto-friendly regulation to help the industry grow. This would increase investor confidence, and XRP‚Äôs ability to draw institutional interest. JPMorgan‚Äôs analysis highlights the importance of ETP adoption rates as a key indicator of institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. If Solana and XRP replicate the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum, they could significantly strengthen their positions within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The recent breakout has fueled investor optimism, cementing XRP‚Äôs position as a standout performer in the crypto market. Here‚Äôs are why the XRP price is surging today. What‚Äôs Behind XRP Price 10% Surge Today? XRP price surged 10% today, driven by multiple factors, including speculation around Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal case with the SEC. Market watchers are focused on the SEC‚Äôs January 15 deadline to file its opening brief in the appeal against Judge Torres‚Äô ruling. The broader crypto market also showed strong momentum, with Bitcoin hovering above $97,000. The global crypto market cap rose by 2.86% over the last 24 hours, contributing to positive sentiment. Major tokens, including Ripple, benefitted significantly from the bullish trend. Ripple‚Äôs anticipated release of its stablecoin, RLUSD, on Cardano‚Äôs blockchain is another potential catalyst for the asset‚Äôs rally. The development has sparked optimism within the community, further fueling price momentum. Additionally, political shifts in the United States appear to have boosted market sentiment. Donald Trump‚Äôs upcoming inauguration on January 20 and his pro-crypto regulatory nominations, including Paul Atkins, favor Ripple price. Meanwhile, reports suggest SEC Chair Gary Gensler will step down soon, with a crypto-friendly successor expected to take the reins. Whale activity around XRP has been particularly noteworthy. Over the past week, whales accumulated 1.09 billion Ripple tokens, suggesting strong institutional interest. This accumulation is believed to be a significant driver of today‚Äôs price spike.

Let‚Äôs delve into the details shaping this silent financial revolution in the Asian region. Thailand‚Äôs Push for Bitcoin ETFs As per recent reports , the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Asian country of Thailand is preparing to allow Bitcoin ETFs to list on local exchanges. SEC Secretary-General Pornanong Budsaratragoon acknowledged the reports revealed the regulator‚Äôs plan to bring revolutionary changes in the crypto sector. Once implemented, the plan will enable individuals and institutions to invest directly in local BTC ETFs. Currently, only indirect exposure through overseas funds is permitted. Thailand‚Äôs Ambition of Becoming a Digital-Assets Hub Several Asian financial powers have openly come forward to express their support for the cryptocurrency industry. Among those, Singapore and Hong Kong are the most prominent ones. They have introduced several pro-crypto policies to create a suitable environment for the growth of the sector. With the aforementioned policies, what Thailand aims is to counter the dominance of these two financial powers in the crypto sector and to emerge as the topmost crypto hub in the Asia-Pacific region. Reports suggest that the country may introduce strong policies to ensure investor protection and foster cryptocurrency adoption . Reports add that Thailand‚Äôs regulatory authority is considering the possibility of permitting corporations to issue stablecoins backed by bonds. Thailand‚Äôs Thriving Tourism Sector & The Crypto Revolution Thailand is an extremely famous tourist destination in Asia. At least 28 million tourists visit Thailand a year. Experts think that the country‚Äôs tourism sector will be one of the primary beneficiaries of its effort to introduce policies to create a positive environment for crypto adoption. Reports note that Phuket, a city in Thailand, may become a testing ground for Bitcoin transactions in tourism. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SEC Delays Decision on Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF Application Until March 2025 , Thailand‚Äôs Crypto Market Trends Currently, around 270,000 active crypto trading accounts are operated from Thailand.

However, data indicates that the rate of crypto trading activities in the country is far lower than the peaks it recorded in the pre-2022 period.

The SEC is still required to file its opening brief by tomorrow (January 16). Despite this, the XRP community is questioning whether the new SEC chair Paul Atkins could potentially retract the appeal. Bill Morgan, a legal expert, expressed uncertainty, suggesting that a vote by all five commissioners might not be required. Morgan has always anticipated the SEC would proceed with filing the opening brief, noting the appeal is arguable and the SEC holds a decent position for negotiation. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel weighed in, stating that a newly-formed SEC would likely need to vote to dismiss the appeal, although it would be a highly unusual move. Morgan responded, acknowledging Fagel‚Äôs point but clarified he doesn‚Äôt expect the SEC to vote to dismiss. He suggested that the SEC might instead seek a better deal through settlement, even if enforcement actions shift under new leadership. A newly-constituted SEC would need to vote to dismiss the appeal. Which they may do (though it‚Äôs a highly unusual move). ‚Äî Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) January 14, 2025 Morgan wrote on X, I don‚Äôt see or at least don‚Äôt assume the SEC will vote to dismiss it. They could quietly negotiate a better deal by settlement even if the policy changes towards enforcement actions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Eyes a 30% Rise After a 40% Upswing‚ÄîWill it Surpass Ethereum in 2025? , XRP Price Rallies Ripple‚Äôs XRP is currently up by more than 12 percent and is now eyeing to break the crucial $3 mark.

The token aimed to build a no-stress investment community around the drone meme, when the team was approached with a malicious wallet-draining link. Chill Drone (CHONE) started its trading with a major setback, as team and community wallets were drained through a malicious link. The Chill Drone team, unfortunately, encountered a common crypto scam when trying to verify its token through Jupiter. The project sent out the usual form to verify CHONE. After not receiving feedback for two weeks, the Chill Drone team decided to be proactive and reach out through the legitimate Telegram channel of Jupiter DEX aggregator. Jupiter DEX aggregator usually verifies Solana tokens after at least 21 days from launching, after a minimal $10K in daily volumes. CHONE fulfilled all the market cap and community conditions, though the team still claimed they had to wait for verification. The Chill Drone project already built up a Telegram channel with over 2,000 members, where attempts at sending malicious links are still a threat. The token has a total of 1,803 holders, with around 5.54% of the supply held in the Raydium liquidity pool. CHONE trades at a valuation of $1.12M, the usual range for a token just starting out. The asset expects a potential breakout, similar to other memes just starting out. The initial idea of CHONE was to launch a token for both meme token veterans and newcomers with limited crypto experience. Chill Drone was created by a team with previous business experience outside crypto, which increased the token‚Äôs credibility. The project aims to follow a model similar to Pudgy Penguins, creating a community with physical items and merchandise. Chill Drone team gets wallets drained in Telegram phishing attack Like other meme tokens, Chill Drone had multiple copycats after its launch on Pump.fun. This created the need to become verified, especially on the Jupiter aggregator and routing service. An OK tick on Jupiter would ensure the community chose the right CHONE token. One of the Chill Drone team members decided to contact Jupiter through Telegram, encountering a legitimate-looking group with over 73,000 members. One of the group‚Äôs members, claiming to be a Jupiter developer, opened a personal chat with Chill Drone‚Äôs team. The alleged developer, Alex Dobrin, would turn out to be a scammer who sent out a malicious link. The hacker contacted the founder of Chill Drone with an offer of verifying the token on Jupiter DEX. The hacker contacted the founder of Chill Drone with an offer of verifying the token on Jupiter DEX. The alleged Jupiter developer looked over Chill Drone‚Äôs wallets and requested to connect the main team wallet with the biggest balance to the link that he sent. After that, the funds were moved and laundered. ‚Äú Before I realized what was happening, all the tokens in that account, along with those in the linked wallets, were drained. It‚Äôs especially heartbreaking because it wasn‚Äôt just the dev team‚Äôs wallets‚Äîit also included funds from family members and community members who had invested with us, many of whom were new to buying crypto and asked us to buy for them,‚Äù said the project‚Äôs founder, Adnaan. The team became aware of the drained wallet only after the community noticed the missing funds, which initially appeared to be a rug pull. The CHONE token‚Äôs price plummeted following a $60,000 sell-off in a single transaction. To stabilize the asset, the team injected personal funds, helping to redirect its trajectory. The only source of selling was the hacker, as CHONE is widely distributed across multiple wallets, none of which hold more than 5% of the total supply. The team put in about $50K in personal funds, and continued buying more tokens to bring up the market cap, and buy back the stolen tokens. This ensured the coin‚Äôs stability and repaired the reputation with the community. ‚ÄúMany of the community members, with the long-term vision and confidence they have, bought back into the coin as they realized it was effectively trading at a ‚Äòdiscount ,'‚Äù explained the project‚Äôs founder. The token team has not given up on CHONE, and will continue to develop the asset. The newly verified token is already listed on CoinGecko, starting trading anew from January 13. The token creator team will investigate the hack, while also taking care of the platform‚Äôs development. After the exploit, the Jupiter Exchange Official channel once again posted its message to warn against impersonators. Source: Jupiter DEX Telegram channel Hacker swapped CHONE for SOL The hacked address was created for the sole purpose of draining the CHONE tokens. Based on wallet activity, the hacker wallet retained USDC for $29,250 . The funds were drained in a single transaction on January 5, then swapped for SOL. The final balance in the hacker‚Äôs wallet is in USDC. Source: DexScreener As a proof for the exploit, the hacker‚Äôs wallet was first funded by the Chone reserve wallet, with no transfers or connections before that. The hacker also interacted with a known Binance hot wallet, going under the name of kiing.sol .

He is an American investor, entrepreneur, and business executive. He is the CEO of Coinbase,¬†a cryptocurrency platform.

The memecoin built on the Base network will be listed on the Coinbase Global network after reaching a crucial milestone in terms of trading activity. According to the announcement , Toshi memecoin was added to the listing roadmap by Coinbase Global. As a result, the Toshi token will follow other memecoin projects listed on the Coinbase exchange led by Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and Floki (FLOKI), among others Impact on the Toshi Price Action Following the listing plans on Coinbase Global, Toshi‚Äôs price rallied more than 120 percent in the past 24 hours to reach a daily high of about $0.0003679. The small-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $114 million, registered a 515 percent surge in daily average trading volume to about $60M. Consequently, Toshi‚Äôs price rebounded above the daily 50 Moving Average (MA), thus invalidating the previous bearish sentiment. However, Toshi‚Äôs price must consistently close above the resistance level of around $0.0004 to guarantee a new bullish trend in the near term. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : DOGE & SHIB Prices Plunge: Will These Memecoins Recover? , Fundamental Outlook The small-cap memecoin has grown to a vibrant project listed on a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges and decentralized exchanges . As a result, Toshi has attracted more than more than 489k on-chain holders. Furthermore, Toshi has a decent liquidity of around $1 million in Wrapped Ether (WETH). With the goal of becoming the premier memecoin on the Base network, Toshi‚Äôs listing in Coinbase will be a major boost. Moreover, the existence of thousands of memecoins has significantly diluted the altcoin industry, hence slowing down the timings of the much-anticipated altseason. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With this, Binance founder has not only teased his support for buying BTC at its lower price but has also sought due consideration from crypto enthusiasts due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Everyone has FOMO. Just do it responsibly. ‚Äî CZ BNB (@cz_binance) January 15, 2025 Impact on BTC Price There has been a notable surge in BTC price over 2% in the last 24 hours. The flagship cryptocurrency is now exchanging hands above $97K, which also represents a rise of 126.87% over the year. BTC price has been rising constantly throughout the day with the initial price recorded at $94,823.5. Source: CoinMarketCap This has triggered speculation that its prices will soar in the days to come, especially as Donald Trump gets closer to assuming the US Presidential office. The lower-than-expected PPI data on Tuesday fueled BTC is estimated to grow by 26.38% in the next 30 days amid a volatility of 3.53% and an FGI of 63 points. Data related to Open Interest from Coinglass data shows Bitcoin has gained bullish sentiment amid demand from derivatives market. Earlier Support for Bitcoin This is not the first time that Changpeng ‚ÄòCZ‚Äô Zhao and Robert Kiyosaki have come forward to express their support for Bitcoin. On Tuesday, Binance Founder teased buying BTC dips when it was anticipated that Donald Trump would sign key crypto executive orders during his early days as the US President. CZ, at that time, had compared that opportunity to the initial days of Bitcoin when the token was just starting to gain traction, or when its prices were just starting to pick a momentum on the price chart. Similarly, Robert Kiyosaki earlier called the crash of Bitcoin ‚Äògreat news‚Äô, emphasizing that he would continue buying Bitcoin because a crash in BTC prices meant an opportunity to buy the token at a discount. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has broken the silence on Solana and XRP ETFs , highlighting that there is a possibility for both ETFs to bring an inflow of $15 billion within the first year. This has backed the adoption of cryptocurrencies and hence, is also boosting the price surge of BTC.

Experts forecast the asset could hit $4 and $8 soon, with some projecting its market cap might exceed $500 billion. XRP Makes the Headlines The cryptocurrency sector experienced a substantial revival in the last 24 hours, with its global market capitalization rising above $3.5 trillion once again . Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and many more leading digital assets are well in the green today (January 15) , but some lead the pack with double-digit price spikes. One notable gainer is Ripple‚Äôs XRP, whose valuation recently hit a 7-year high of almost $2.90. Currently, the price is hovering around $2.88 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data), representing a 14% increase on a daily scale . XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Alongside its significant surge, XRP became the top-trending cryptocurrency on January 14. According to Santiment, the reasons behind the buzz surrounding the asset are the increased optimism over its potential use in banking and financial transactions, the bullish predictions of a further rally, and the XRP ETF speculations. The platform‚Äôs research estimated that the second most-trending cryptocurrency is Ethereum (ETH) . The interest is supposedly fueled by the introduction of Soneium (an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain solution developed by Sony). ‚ÄúThere are multiple transactions involving significant amounts of ETH, highlighting active trading and investment throughout the Ethereum ecosystem,‚Äù Santiment added. Other cryptocurrencies that have captured the attention of industry participants as of late include Bitcoin (BTC), Kaspa (KAS), and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) . XRP Targets Fresh Peaks As mentioned above, numerous analysts believe the price of Ripple‚Äôs native token could reach a new all-time high as soon as this year. X user CRYPTOWZRD recently claimed that the asset ‚Äúhas flipped previous resistance to support‚Äù of around $2 and is now poised to soar to $4 and then $8. They said such a scenario would mirror the pre-bull run in 2017 and the subsequent rally the following year. The veteran trader Peter Brandt also chipped in. He outlined multiple bullish forecasts lately, assuming that XRP‚Äôs market capitalization could explode above $500 billion. Such a pump would result in a price increase of almost $9.50. It is worth mentioning that Brandt has been predominantly anti-XRP for the past several years. Earlier this month, though, he apologized for his stance and wished the Ripple community all the best.

On Jan. 14, Tom Emmer, an American attorney and Congressman, was appointed as the Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence. Formed in 2023, the Subcommittee is tasked with overseeing the development and regulation of crypto assets, examining the integration of AI in financial services, and exploring advancements in financial technology. The 63-year-old Congressman expressed his honor at the new position, stating that under his leadership, he will ensure ‚Äúthe future of digital assets is guided by Americans, with American values.‚Äù I am honored to have been selected as Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence.

Gensler, a polarizing figure in the crypto world, will end his term concurrent with the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th president of the U.S. on Jan. 20.

Emmer was also a part of the FIT21 Bill , which created the term ‚Äúdigital commodity‚Äù for cryptocurrencies and clarified the SEC‚Äôs role in regulating them. All in all, the Congressman has been an advocate for crypto-friendly laws. Moreover, in Consensus 2024 , a crypto conference that took place in Austin, Texas, Emmer said that crypto was ‚Äúnonpartisan and here to stay.‚Äù In a 2023 post on X, Emmer highlighted Binance‚Äôs $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice as evidence that properly enforced existing laws can effectively root out misconduct in the crypto industry.

The act sought to relieve some of the regulatory relief on small banks and credit unions, thereby giving them greater capacity to serve their local communities. Emmer is one of the many picks among other pro-crypto elected officials like Patrick McHenry, Senator John Thune, and Bryan Steil , to name a few. As Donald Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20, the crypto industry prepares itself for a possible shift in regulatory and legislative attention: a Republican majority in both Houses poses renewed hope for things to get friendlier in terms of policy.

As DOGE and BONK navigate the volatile market, Remittix presents a unique PayFi solution that has bolstered massive adoption. Table of Contents Could Dogecoin hit $1 in 2025? Bonk struggles despite major burn event Better alternative for DOGE and BONK: Remittix RTX presale on path to $3m Meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) have highlighted mixed sentiments reflecting the broader crypto market dynamism. After facing significant pressure in the past week, Dogecoin‚Äôs price has risen in response to Elon Musk‚Äôs tweet appreciating U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and others for supporting D.O.G.E. On the other hand, Bonk has experienced a downtrend even after its strategic step of burning 1.6 trillion BONK tokens. The burning event aims to increase scarcity and exemplifies its commitment to long-term growth. As Bonk and Dogecoin quietly position themselves for explosive growth, Remittix (RTX) has generated substantial buzz with its unique PayFi solution and growth potential. Each of these tokens brings something unique, whether it is a strong community backing or technology. Let‚Äôs look at the deets. Could Dogecoin hit $1 in 2025? DOGE crypto jumped above $0.3432 on Tuesday, rallying alongside the top three cryptocurrencies. The uptick was likely catalyzed by Elon Musk‚Äôs tweet and a broader market relief rally. The meme token has showcased resilience, holding gains above its critical support level of $0.30. Dogecoin‚Äôs uptick coincides with a more than 90% jump in daily trading volume to over $3.80 billion. Despite the broader market correction, Dogecoin whales have indicated strong confidence in the token‚Äôs recovery. Per crypto analyst Ali Charts, large wallets have accumulated approximately 470 million DOGE tokens worth $155 million at $0.33. The upsurge in whale accumulation highlights optimism for DOGE‚Äôs long-term potential and recovery prospects. Notably, the meme coin‚Äôs price action has coincided with its historical patterns. After an uptrend in late 2024 and a healthy correction, the token mirrored previous cycles where Dogecoin consolidated near the key Fibonacci retracement levels before triggering another breakout. CryptoSurf has indicated that DOGE is hovering near the 0.618 Fib retracement level around the $0.33 mark, a key area for reversals. Historically, Dogecoin has exhibited explosive rallies from similar levels. If this pattern repeats, the DOGE coin could see a significant upside toward the $1 psychological barrier in the coming months. Bonk struggles despite major burn event Following its recent token-burning event, which successfully removed 1.69 trillion BONK tokens, worth over $51 million, from circulation, the Bonk price witnessed a brief rally but slipped back to its downtrend. Looking ahead, the BONK ecosystem seems focused on diversification beyond token burns. The team had shared plans to support projects building on top of BONK, creating value streams and additional utility. Combining supply reduction with ecosystem expansion through development plans could heighten its growth potential in 2025. Moreover, its Arkham Exchange listing could encourage more trading activity and exposure, resulting in significant price changes. Beyond network development, Bonk‚Äôs technical structure indicates the meme coin is hovering below its 100-day simple moving average. This positioning below the SMA typically signals a bearish outlook. Per Andrew Griffiths‚Äôs analysis, Bonk‚Äôs price has shown signs of a bullish breakout, with its upper resistance forming a falling wedge. The meme token is targeting $0.00003141. Notably, if BONK can sustain its momentum, it could target the $0.000075 mark and, ultimately, the $0.11 mark by the end of 2025. Its relative strength index (RSI) is below 50, suggesting that BONK coin has room for more upside rally, with prices poised for a recovery if buyers step in.

Months later, the reports confirm that World Liberty‚Äôs portfolio faced a $4.8M loss with these holdings. At the same time, the wallet address transaction history shows multiple transactions from the portfolio. Let‚Äôs discuss the Trump‚Äôs crypto bets and the current conditions. World Liberty Financial Loses $4.9M In Its Crypto Holdings Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto project was launched in September, but its first crypto purchase occurred in December. The DeFi platform spent $12 million to buy popular cryptos like Ethereum (ETH), Aave, and Chainlink (LINK), with ETH having the biggest portion. At that time, the prices of these cryptos rose higher with WLFI‚Äôs buying . That was just a start, and the firm bought even more with time, adding WBTC, ONDO, ENA, and many others to its holdings. However, amid market uncertainties and Bitcoin price struggles, altcoins faced a major correction. This impact is visible in World Liberty‚Äôs portfolio, which lost nearly $4.8M in unrealized losses in the ETH, WBTC, AAVE, LINK, ENA, and ONDO holdings. The crypto project has not sold any holdings till the time of reporting but bears significant unrealized losses. In contrast, Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto holdings are growing. Eventually, this will make him the first-ever sitting President with meme coin holdings .¬†Although losses were quite expected in this changing market, the project seems unaffected, except for a few transactions. Is Donald Trump‚Äôs Crypto Project Selling Holdings? Many on-chain analytics platforms have noticed the transaction from the WLFI wallet. A Lookonchain X post states that the World Liberty firm exchanges some of its WBTC for ETH and USDC for WBTC. According to the post, the crypto project has exchanged 103 WBTC ($9.89M) for 3,075 ETH at the rate of $0.0354. After that, a total of $59.8M worth of ETH has been transferred to Coinbase. WLFI also spent 1.7M USDT and bought 17.62 WBTC at $96,491. This constant buying confirms the project‚Äôs farseeing in the industry, as it‚Äôs still holding despite current losses. These transfers have concerned investors about a possible selling mindset, as the WLFI transferred massive holdings to Coinbase. However, the DeFi crypto project‚Äôs team has clarified the reasons behind these transactions. With an X post, the team explained that these transactions were routine movements that addressed the project‚Äôs functioning. More importantly, these were just a relocation for their ordinary business purpose and were not a sale. Key Points To Remember Amid the market‚Äôs uncertainties, Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto project faces significant unrealized losses. Crypto holdings, primarily in ETH, WBTC, AAVE, LINK, and ONDO, collectively declined by $4.8M. At the same time, World Liberty Financial made a few swaps between WBTC and ETH and added more WBTC to its holdings before transferring $59.8M in ETH to the Coinbase exchange. However, the WLFI team has confirmed that these transactions and exchanges are not connected to selling behavior but are just routine moves needed for the functioning of the project.

Thanks to that, the AI sector‚Äôs 2024 valuation reached a staggering $621.19 billion. Latest projections indicate a possible explosive surge to $2.74 trillion by 2032. Furthermore, with the technology continuing to permeate into every sector of the global economy, tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta have collectively poured around $200 billion into AI development over the course of 2024 alone. Nonetheless, this monetary commitment extends beyond software development. The market for AI infrastructure is also expanding at an unfathomable rate. Investments into data centers, hardware, software solutions, and other related fields are growing by 40-55% annually . This commendable growth rate has the potential to skyrocket the industry to $1.4 trillion by 2027. Last year, there was the invasion of ‚Äòdigital twins.‚Äù To be precise, AI-enabled virtual replicas of physical beings that are capable of redefining how individuals interact with technology. This in turn is offering unfathomable possibilities for personalization and engagement in the digital world.

It‚Äôs intriguing to know that AI algorithms have become so capable that they can analyze subtle facial expressions. Additionally, the can also assess voice modulations, behavioral patterns, and much more to understand and respond to human emotions with remarkable accuracy. This enables digital representations to engage in more natural, context-aware conversations that can adapt to the emotional state of their human counterparts. Naturally, these AI twins have opened up new frontiers for deployment across the board. In customer service, AI twins can be used to handle routine inquiries with personalization. On the other hand, in the healthcare domain, they can be used for remote caregiving. However, these advancements also raise important considerations. The primary problems are related to privacy, emotional manipulation, and the ethical implications of AI systems that can recognize and respond to human emotions. Amidst this rapidly evolving fray, Antix has emerged as a leading innovator in the digital twin space. It offers cutting-edge solutions that are designed to transform how brands engage with their audiences. Through its proprietary technology, Antix creates hyper-realistic ‚ÄòDigital Twins‚Äô and ‚ÄòDigital Humans‚Äô ‚Äî helping maximize customer interaction quality.

This makes Antix‚Äôs solutions particularly valuable for content creators and influencers. This is the case as they can use these digital twins to expand their reach and engage with audiences more effectively. The platform‚Äôs AI-driven personalization ensures that each digital human maintains the authentic characteristics and personality traits of their real-world counterparts. Lastly, Antix‚Äôs service suite has also expanded into the realm of enterprise solutions. To elaborate, their technology affords businesses the power to create personalized customer experiences at scale, with digital humans serving as brand ambassadors, customer service representatives, and educational facilitators. Such a high degree of versatility has already helped the project attract a community of over 100,000 active users, thus signalling a growing demand for such solutions. Is the dawn of a new digital era upon us? Looking ahead, the continued emergence of AI tech stands to fundamentally reshape how humans interact with digital systems across different industries. Beginning with revolutionizing entertainment and education to transforming customer service and healthcare delivery, the concept of digital twins has already laid the groundwork for a more connected and personalized digital future. As companies like Antix continue to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in today‚Äôs advanced digital world, the line between physical and digital experiences seems to be diluting. Ergo, it‚Äôs opening up unprecedented opportunities for human-computer interaction and digital engagement. Interesting times ahead!

At this point, Bitcoin has exceeded $97,000, while altcoins have also experienced small increases. However, XRP positively separated from the market and came to the fore with a 12.8% increase in the last 24 hours. While wondering what is behind this rise, Santiment said that whale accumulation and ETF speculation are behind the XRP rise. Cryptocurrency analytics firm Santiment attributed XRP‚Äôs recent price surge in the uncertain crypto market to several factors, saying the most important one is the significant accumulation of wallets holding 1-10 million XRP. ‚ÄúXRP investors are delighted to see the third-largest cryptocurrency, XRP, reach $2.69 today for the first time since December 17, 2024. This rise is supported by the ongoing massive accumulation of wallets holding 1 million-10 million XRP. These wallets hold over 37% more XRP than they did 2 months ago, adding approximately $3.8 billion worth of XRP since their holdings began on November 12, 2024. Apart from Santiment, Sean Dawson, head of research at on-chain protocol Derive, also commented on the XRP rally. Dawson said that the expectation of an XRP ETF launch in 2025 has increased and that this expectation supports the rise. Dawson also added that the rise was also driven by the growing expectation that XRP‚Äôs legal battle with the SEC could be resolved in Ripple‚Äôs favor. As anticipation for XRP ETF approval grows, banking giant JPMorgan estimated that the XRP ETF could attract $4-8 billion inflows.

Dogecoin remains at the forefront of discussions, with experts delivering a Dogecoin price prediction pointing to significant changes in 2025. Meanwhile, Solana‚Äôs prowess in DeFi continues to capture the spotlight, as Solana TVL hits a remarkable $9.52 billion, achieving a three-year record. On another front, BlockDAG (BDAG) is ramping up for its eagerly awaited 2025 mainnet launch, an event poised to escalate BDAG‚Äôs value dramatically. In celebration, they‚Äôve rolled out the LAUNCH300 code for a limited time. This appealing offer provides a 300% bonus on BDAG acquisitions, sparking increased demand as the presale shatters records and gathers steam. Dogecoin Price Prediction 2025: What‚Äôs on the Horizon? Dogecoin continues to be a vibrant subject in the crypto market, and its 2025 outlook is drawing keen interest from analysts. Current predictions for Dogecoin price projection indicate a potential range from $0.30 to $0.44, driven by significant market shifts and network activities. Recent commentary by KrissPax compares Dogecoin‚Äôs present trends to its past dynamics, hinting at a substantial upswing in 2025 after a consolidation phase. As specialists refine their Dogecoin price predictions, the $0.40 resistance level is becoming increasingly pivotal. The trajectory of Dogecoin will largely depend on unfolding market trends and community perceptions. Solana‚Äôs Record-Breaking TVL: Exploring the Drivers Solana has reached an important benchmark, with Solana TVL surpassing $9.52 billion, its highest in three years. This surge is underpinned by a dynamic DeFi ecosystem and an impressive $3.98 billion in daily DEX trading volume, outstripping Ethereum and other second-layer solutions. The network‚Äôs scalability and affordable transaction fees have fostered broad adoption, while the upcoming SIMD-0215 upgrade is set to improve real-time account updates to meet growing demands. As Solana TVL continues its ascent, the blockchain‚Äôs ability to handle substantial transaction volumes cements its status as a central figure in the DeFi arena. Seize BlockDAG‚Äôs LAUNCH300 Bonus Before It‚Äôs Gone! BlockDAG is ramping up excitement for its 2025 launch with an extraordinary bonus offer: the limited-time LAUNCH300 code. This code grants a whopping 300% bonus in BDAG coins with each purchase, marking it as one of the most compelling offers in the marketplace. For example, buying $200 worth of BDAG coins with this code will net an extra $600 in bonus coins, significantly boosting the buyer‚Äôs total. With the presale already stirring considerable buzz, this bonus represents a not-to-be-missed chance. Remember, the LAUNCH300 code is only available for a short duration. BlockDAG‚Äôs presale has electrified the crypto market, amassing over $180 million and distributing more than 17.8 billion BDAG coins. The coin‚Äôs price has skyrocketed by 2380%, rising from just $0.001 in its first release to $0.0248 in the current batch 27. This spectacular ascent has spotlighted BlockDAG as one of the best long term crypto assets. With an active presale and soaring demand, BDAG‚Äôs prominence is setting the stage for the network‚Äôs upcoming comprehensive launch. As BlockDAG gears up for its 2025 debut, BDAG is capturing widespread attention. Analysts are forecasting its value might hit $20 by 2027, indicating significant growth potential. This rapid expansion, alongside BlockDAG‚Äôs dynamic progress, hints at a luminous future. The LAUNCH300 bonus introduces an extra thrill, giving buyers a rare opportunity to amass more coins at a pivotal moment in BDAG‚Äôs trajectory. As the clock ticks down, the blend of explosive presale results, enticing bonus offers, and future prospects positions BDAG as a thrilling prospect in the cryptocurrency arena. Final Analysis The latest Dogecoin price prediction shines a spotlight on DOGE, with analysts projecting prices might fluctuate between $0.30 and $0.44, propelled by robust market dynamics and network activity. Simultaneously, Solana TVL smashing the $9.52 billion mark highlights its preeminence in decentralized finance, fueled by enhanced scalability and broad adoption. Yet, BlockDAG dominates the stage as its groundbreaking presale leads up to an epic 2025 mainnet launch. The fleeting LAUNCH300 code, which delivers a staggering 300% bonus on BDAG purchases, is creating substantial excitement. With presale interest at an all-time high and forecasts suggesting a $20 valuation by 2027, bypassing BlockDAG now could mean missing out on one of the best long term crypto opportunities.

In a new strategy session, Svenson tells his 81,800 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin‚Äôs parabolic trend indicates the flagship crypto asset may surge to at least $124,000 before June, correct for a few months, then have one final explosive move in late 2025. ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin parabolic trend [on the weekly chart] is in strong health. It‚Äôs very healthy. Look at it. The weekly‚Äôs going back to the green. It looks like a nice hammer candle is being printed right here‚Ä¶ hammer candle before a major uptrend continuation‚Ä¶ Bitcoin is elevated heavily off the parabolic trendline, which means that, in theory, Bitcoin could dip even further if it wanted to, and it would still be an exponential higher low within a parabolic trend. Not saying it‚Äôs going to. My bias is bullish, and there‚Äôs not really anything wrong with the trend at all.‚Äù Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube According to the analyst, Bitcoin appears to be in base four of the parabolic curve pattern, putting BTC in a position to witness massive gains in a steep upward move. ‚ÄúAnd in theory, Bitcoin is right now creating base four of the parabolic trend‚Ä¶ This parabola is beautiful, and you see base one, base two, base three. Now that‚Äôs base four. It‚Äôs possible that we could dip a little lower. Doesn‚Äôt really matter, as long as we‚Äôre getting an exponential higher low. Well, that would be the creation of base four. It could be this low. Could be, I don‚Äôt see why not. This is the creation of base four, which means that our sell point is coming up on the next target.‚Äù Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Lastly, Svenson predicts Bitcoin will reach a cycle peak of approximately $160,000 in about ten months. ‚ÄúFrom base three, the price doubles, which is roughly $124,000, meaning that this parabolic trend would look to run up to about $124,000, maybe slightly higher, before breaking the parabolic trend and settling up through the summer before an end of year run at the 80th week in October, and then the bear market begins.‚Äù Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $96,569 at time of writing, up 2.2% in the last 24 hours.

The asset management titan wants the world to know it‚Äôs playing a different game. While MicroStrategy‚Äôs entire identity revolves around amassing Bitcoin like it‚Äôs Pok√©mon cards, BlackRock takes a more measured, institutional approach. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock‚Äôs head of digital assets, spelled it out clearly: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not BlackRock hoarding Bitcoin; it‚Äôs about providing access to a broad pool of investors.‚Äù MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 450,000 Bitcoin. That‚Äôs more than 2% of all Bitcoin in circulation. They‚Äôve spent $62,503 per Bitcoin on average, translating to a portfolio worth $41.1 billion. In January 2025 alone, they added 3,600 BTC to their stash. First, they scooped up 1,070 BTC for $101 million. A week later, they snagged another 2,530 BTC for $243 million. Saylor isn‚Äôt just buying Bitcoin, he‚Äôs betting the farm on it, raising $2 billion through perpetual preferred stock offerings to keep his Bitcoin spree alive. The goal? Deliver returns 1.5 times greater than Bitcoin‚Äôs own performance. BlackRock: Bitcoin for the masses BlackRock‚Äôs approach couldn‚Äôt be more different. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust holds around 250,000 Bitcoin. The trust doesn‚Äôt serve as BlackRock‚Äôs personal piggy bank. Instead, it‚Äôs a tool for institutional investors who want in on Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Mitchnick explained, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not buying and selling Bitcoin for ourselves. This is for our investors.‚Äù The numbers back it up‚Äî682 unique investors filed holdings in the latest quarterly report from Q4 2024. BlackRock‚Äôs strategy is about scale and diversification. Unlike MicroStrategy, which thrives on leverage, BlackRock avoids piling risk on top of an already volatile asset. Mitchnick put it bluntly: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need a three-times levered Bitcoin ETF. The asset‚Äôs got enough volatility without it.‚Äù This ethos has made BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF a runaway success. In its first year, it brought in $36 billion in net new assets, doubling the total market value of cryptos. But the question now is whether that momentum can continue. Crypto ETFs face an uncertain future The buzz around Bitcoin ETFs has cooled. Applications for new funds tied to altcoins like Solana, XRP, Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin are stacking up, but analysts are skeptical. Even if these ETFs get approved, they‚Äôre unlikely to attract the same level of interest. JPMorgan estimates Solana ETFs could bring in $3 billion to $6 billion, while XRP ETFs might pull in $4 billion to $8 billion. That‚Äôs chump change compared to Bitcoin ETFs, which hold $108 billion, making up 6% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total market cap. Ether ETFs haven‚Äôt fared much better. They‚Äôve only managed to capture 3% of Ether‚Äôs market cap, totaling $12 billion in assets. The disparity is clear: Bitcoin remains king, and other cryptocurrencies aren‚Äôt ever gonna dethrone it. Regulation is another wildcard. With a pro-crypto Congress and White House in 2025, the industry is hopeful for favorable changes. A new SEC chairman could pave the way for more innovative crypto products. Analysts believe this could open doors for hybrid Bitcoin and Ether ETFs and other creative solutions.

By the end of 2030, we might see 1inch price surging toward $5.16. The 1inch network is a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator. To gauge its future prospects, it‚Äôs crucial to look at the 1inch price prediction for 2025. 1inch Labs and the 1inch Foundation facilitate the development and expansion of the network. The non-profit 1inch Foundation initiated the 1INCH token, while the community-driven 1inch DAO manages the token‚Äôs smart contract within the network. This structure supports community governance of the token‚Äôs functions. The 1inch protocol offers a trading platform that searches for optimal transactions across various DEXes. It enables 1inch users to swap cryptocurrencies, granting access to multiple liquidity sources on Polygon, including platforms like Curve, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, and Aave V2.

However, buyers continue to defend a decline below the immediate Fib channels. 1INCH price analysis 1-day chart: Bears aim for a rise in dominance Analyzing the daily price chart of 1inch, 1INCH‚Äôs price witnessed a bearish rally after bulls failed to hold the price around $0.4. Over the last 24 hours, 1INCH price has been on a bearish trend as it is aiming for a drop below $0.37; however, buyers are strongly defending. The 24-hour volume surged to $3.2 million, showing an increased interest in trading activity today. 1INCH price is currently trading at $0.37, increasing by over 0.2% in the last 24 hours. 1inch price chart The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and currently hovers around 41-level, showing that bulls are slowly gaining the momentum of the price chart. The SMA-14 level suggests upward volatility in the next few hours. 1INCH/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a decline below moving averages The 4-hour 1INCH price chart suggests 1INCH price continues to experience bearish activity within $0.37, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to drop below EMA lines, bears are aiming to create a consolidation below EMA20. 1inch price chart The BoP indicator is trading in a bearish region at 0.44, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near support levels and boost a downward correction.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the 1INCH price from an immediate surge. However, if the 1INCH price successfully breaks above $0.396, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.4465. 1inch price chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, 1INCH price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.3375, resulting in a correction to $0.2622. Is 1INCH A Good Investment? It‚Äôs challenging to determine the right time to buy 1INCH, as it‚Äôs close to an all-time low and it‚Äôs uncertain when the dip will end or how much it might recover. However, 1Inch offers a valuable service and the token has potential. As with any crypto investment, thorough research is crucial before deciding to invest in 1INCH. Why is 1INCH Price Down Today? 1INCH price made a heavy decline in the last few days following Bitcoin‚Äôs significant bearish liquidation. Currently, the price is consolidating below $0.37. Will 1INCH Price Reach $1? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see 1INCH price touching the $1 milestone in the coming months. According to our prediction, 1INCH price might hit the $1 mark in 2026. Will 1INCH Price Reach $10? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and 1inch develops more user-friendly utilities, we might see its price surpassing the $10 mark. Is 1INCH a Good Long-Term Investment? Yes, 1INCH is a good long-term investment option. As buyers‚Äô interest continues to grow and the network expands, we might see profitable returns by investing in 1INCH. Recent 1INCH News/Opinions In 2024, 1inch Network broke records by handling $155 billion in swap volume, growing its user base to 10 million, and completing 53 million swaps. 1inch Price Prediction January 2025 1inch price triggered a bullish rally over the last few days as Bitcoin price aimed for a rally above $100K. However, as the market has now cooled down, the price of 1INCH is facing a surge in bearish dominance from short term holders. However, if the altcoin market cap gains momentum in January following Bitcoin‚Äôs surge above $100K, we might see a robust comeback in the 1INCH price. As a result, it is anticipated that the 1inch Network will have a minimum price of $0.33 in January. The maximum price level could hit $0.46, with an expected average price of $0.4 throughout the month. 1inch Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 1inch Price Prediction January 2025 $0.33 $0.4 $0.46 1inch Price Prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn‚Äôt felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the 1inch network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. In 2025, the 1inch Network is expected to achieve a minimum price of $0.6415. It could potentially reach a high of $0.7827, with an average price of $0.6600 during the year. 1inch Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 1inch Price Prediction 2025 0.6415 0.6600 0.7827 1inch Network Token Price Prediction 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 0.9074 0.9404 1.1000 2027 1.3400 1.3800 1.5800 2028 1.9500 2.0000 2.3000 2029 2.9000 3.0000 3.3300 2030 4.3400 4.4900 5.1600 2031 5.7 6.12 7.55 1INCH Price Forecast for 2026 For 2026, forecasts indicate that the 1inch Network will see a minimum price of $0.9074.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct proper investment advice and then invest money. 1inch (1INCH) Historic Price Sentiment During early 2021, the crypto market experienced a significant growth trajectory, allowing 1INCH to reach a peak of $7.87 on May 8, before declining to $2.89 by the end of the year. The year 2022 proved challenging for cryptocurrencies, including 1INCH, which fell below one dollar in May and ended the year at $0.384 after a series of market crashes‚Äîmarking a decline of over 80%. In 2023, 1INCH had a mixed year; it experienced a high of $0.6896 in a robust market, but struggled significantly after the U.S. SEC announced lawsuits against major crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. This news led to a new low of $0.2535 on June 15. A brief spike occurred on July 17, pushing the price up to $0.5811, mainly fueled by buzz on the Upbit exchange, but this was followed by another fall to $0.2211 on September 11. The token managed a slight recovery to $0.254 by October 19, 2023, and eventually closed the year at $0.4265, marking a 10% annual increase, which seems modest compared to the overall crypto market‚Äôs doubling in the same period. 1INCH price declined heavily in April and touched below $0.4. After touching the lows of $0.22 in November, the price of 1INCH rebounded strongly from the bearish trend utility In December, the price of 1inch surged to a high of $0.63; however, it declined later and ended the year at $0.38.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,1INCH|BTC|EXCHANGE|ICO|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-15 09:25:17

Brandt has been a long-standing critic of XRP, often highlighting its volatility and perceived shortcomings compared to Bitcoin. In his message, Brandt offered an olive branch to the XRP army, acknowledging past criticism and clarifying his perspective. Brandt‚Äôs post reflects a notable shift in tone. He admitted to taking hard shots at XRP and its holders over the years. He acknowledged that some of the backlash he received in return was justified, even calling certain comments from XRP supporters funny and creative. Brant‚Äôs comments come a few days after Mr. Intuitive, a well-respected member of the XRP community, called him out and drew attention to his previous stance against XRP. Despite his earlier criticisms, Brandt emphasized that his comments were not personal attacks on XRP investors but rather critiques of the broader narrative surrounding the asset. Reasons For Brandt‚Äôs Criticism Explaining his past stance, Brandt shared insights from his extensive career in trading, which began in 1981. He highlighted the importance of preserving his capital, particularly in volatile markets. He emphasized XRP‚Äôs history of significant losses against Bitcoin, which ranged from 80% to as high as 97%, as a major factor behind his skepticism. For Brandt, holding an asset with such dramatic declines against a more stable alternative contradicted sound trading principles. While Brandt reiterated his belief that Bitcoin serves as the store of wealth standard in the cryptocurrency space, he clarified that his criticisms were directed at the defense of XRP‚Äôs steep declines, not the ambition of its holders to achieve financial success. Brandt also expressed happiness for the recent success of XRP holders, noting that he takes pride in seeing other traders succeed. He maintained, however, that his trading philosophy remains centered on cutting losses quickly and allowing profitable trades to grow. He explained that his faith is rooted in disciplined trading, not unwavering commitment to any asset. An Olive Branch to $XRP holders Accept it if you will, reject it if you must, but I offer it with good intent Over the years I have taken some hard shots at you and your $XRP asset. I admit my rudeness. You've now had your chance to return the ""favor."" I get it.

He reiterated his belief that holding assets prone to extreme volatility is not sustainable for wealth accumulation. He also declared that this would be his final post about XRP, leaving the community with a choice to accept or reject his gesture. This marks a significant moment for the XRP community. While his stance on XRP has softened, it seems the community‚Äôs willingness to forgive Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson was not extended to him. This reluctance has likely pushed him away from publicly supporting the asset. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a recent investor note, Kendrick emphasized that macro-economic uncertainty and market sentiment could drive additional panic selling . However, he also projected a $200,000 price target by the end of 2025 , contingent on institutional inflows under the Trump administration. Bitcoin‚Äôs Key Support at $90K Risk of a 10% Drop Standard Chartered highlighted $90,000 as a critical support level: Break Below $90K: A breach could trigger an additional decline of 10% , pushing Bitcoin to $81,000 . Market Sentiment: Panic selling and macroeconomic concerns may exacerbate downward pressure. Price Action Context Bitcoin has already approached the $90,000 threshold, reflecting increased volatility following the U.S. election and recent macroeconomic developments. Macro Factors Affecting Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Spot ETF Performance Break-Even Point Reached: Spot Bitcoin ETFs have hit the break-even mark after the U.S. election, leading to reduced upward momentum. ETF-Driven Selling: Profit-taking among ETF holders could contribute to selling pressure near key support levels. Economic Conditions Global Uncertainty: Rising Treasury yields and inflation concerns continue to weigh on risk assets like Bitcoin. Market Liquidity: Tightened financial conditions limit liquidity, increasing Bitcoin‚Äôs vulnerability to sell-offs. Long-Term Outlook: A $200K Target by 2025 Institutional Inflows Under the Trump Administration Kendrick expressed optimism about Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to reach $200,000 by the end of 2025, citing: Pro-Crypto Policies: A second Trump administration is expected to implement crypto-friendly regulations, boosting institutional confidence. Increased Adoption: Anticipated regulatory clarity could attract major institutional inflows, driving demand for Bitcoin. Historical Patterns Post-Halving Growth: Bitcoin‚Äôs halving cycles have historically preceded significant price rallies, aligning with Kendrick‚Äôs projection. Short-Term Strategy for Bitcoin Investors Risk Management Monitor Support Levels: Watch for price movements around $90,000 and prepare for potential declines to $81,000. Diversify Portfolios: Balance Bitcoin holdings with other assets to mitigate volatility risks. Long-Term Perspective Accumulate on Dips: Investors confident in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term potential may view price corrections as buying opportunities. Focus on Fundamentals: Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity and adoption trends support its role as a long-term store of value. Conclusion Standard Chartered‚Äôs analysis underscores the dual nature of Bitcoin‚Äôs current market dynamics. While a break below $90,000 could trigger short-term declines of up to 10% , the potential for institutional inflows under favorable regulatory conditions may drive Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025 . Investors should remain cautious in the near term while considering Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term growth trajectory as a foundational asset in the cryptocurrency market.

Bulls regained momentum following a brief market decline. The price broke past the $0.36 resistance level, fueling optimism among investors. Analysts are now closely monitoring DOGE, citing the potential for further growth. Like BTC and ETH, Dogecoin is capturing renewed attention, with speculations rising about its ability to hit $3 this month. Is Dogecoin Price Set to Hit $3 in January? A crypto analyst predicts Dogecoin price could reach $3.00, citing Fibonacci retracement patterns and historical trends. Currently Dogecoin hovering above at $0.35, the projection suggests a massive 8x rally. While optimism grows, skeptics warn of market dependencies. Investors await signs of a breakout as Dogecoin‚Äôs popularity continues to fuel speculation. Source: X Dogecoin price could be poised for significant gains as market momentum in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin gathers steam. Bitcoin‚Äôs current surge to $9,000 and increased activity in meme coins like SHIB, PINGU, WIF, and BONK could positively influence Dogecoin‚Äôs trajectory. Analysts note that during the 2021 bull cycle, Dogecoin soared over 1,100% within a week of the U.S. Presidential inauguration. As the January 20 inauguration of Donald Trump approaches, speculation grows about its potential impact on Dogecoin‚Äôs price. Market watchers recall the influence of political events and broader crypto adoption during previous rallies. Notably, rumors about Elon Musk heading the Department of Government Efficiency add to the excitement. Experts suggest that Dogecoin could be just one tweet away from a significant pump, reinforcing its reputation as a market-moving asset during key events. Tweet Analyst Predicts Potential Breakout for DOGE in the Short Term Analyst has identified a bullish flag pattern on DOGE on 8-hour timeframe, indicating a potential breakout. If this scenario unfolds, the cryptocurrency could witness a significant upward trend, fueling optimism among traders and investors. According to the analysis, a breakout from the upper resistance line of this channel could trigger a sharp price rally. The projected move suggests a potential price increase of approximately 60%, as indicated by the green breakout zone. Source: X Dogecoin Price Analysis As of Wednesday, the DOGE price was trading at $0.3619, reflecting a strong 10% rise during U.S. trading hours. The price ranged between $0.3428 and $0.3645 throughout the day. A sustained move above the $0.37 mark could spark a new bullish trend. In this case, the Dogecoin price forecast may target the next key resistance near $0.40, with a possibility of climbing toward $0.50. On the downside, initial support lies at $0.35, and a break below $0.34 could lead to further declines. On the 4-hour chart, the MACD indicator is gaining traction in the bullish zone, suggesting momentum could favor an upward trajectory in the near term. Dogecoin price chart: TradingView Dogecoin‚Äôs price shows significant bullish momentum, backed by technical analysis and market activity. Analysts speculate further growth, eyeing $3 as a potential target. However, market conditions remain pivotal.

Analysts have made a significant projection regarding the potential impact of a new wave of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on alternative crypto assets. Should these funds receive the green light from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), they could attract inflows of up to $14 billion, marking a notable development in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments. JPMorgan Highlights Growing Interest In Alternative Crypto ETFs The analysts specifically highlighted the anticipated interest in proposed ETFs for Solana and XRP. They estimate that Solana ETFs could draw between $3 billion and $6 billion within six to twelve months post-approval, while XRP funds might see inflows ranging from $4 billion to $8 billion over the same time frame. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Crash To $89,000 Reveals Where BTC Is Headed Next This optimism is grounded in the observed adoption rates of existing spot cryptocurrency ETFs. For context, Bitcoin (BTC) funds currently hold approximately $108 billion in assets, which represents about 6% of Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization since their introduction a year ago. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds have accumulated $12 billion in just six months, translating to a 3% penetration rate of Ethereum‚Äôs market value. While JPMorgan anticipates that Bitcoin will remain the dominant choice for investors, the interest in Solana and XRP underscores a growing diversification within the crypto investment community. However, the analysts noted that the key question remains: how much demand exists for additional crypto products? They expressed uncertainty about whether the launch of new exchange-traded products (ETPs) will significantly impact the market. Signs Of Industry Growth Post-Trump Election The SEC has recently received numerous applications for funds tracking various cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Solana, and Litecoin. This influx of filings signals a broader industry push to make cryptocurrencies more accessible to retail investors. In addition, the regulatory landscape has been particularly dynamic in light of the recent election of Donald Trump, who has shifted from being a Bitcoin skeptic to a supporter of digital assets. His administration has already shown a willingness to align with the interests of the crypto community, notably by appointing Paul Atkins, a proponent of cryptocurrency, as the new SEC chair, replacing the previous chair Gary Gensler, who was more critical of the industry. Related Reading: Chainlink Weekly Chart Looks Promising ‚Äì If Bulls Reclaim $30 ‚ÄòATH Are Next‚Äô Despite the positive outlook, JPMorgan cautioned that progress on ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ether may be slow due to the recent change in administration and the ongoing lack of regulatory clarity.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.67, posting gains of nearly 6% in the 24-hour time frame. Solana, on the other hand, is trading at $188, up 3% in the same time frame.

This means those who didn‚Äôt invest in Bitcoin missed out on its record-breaking returns. David Kalk, founder and CIO of Reflexive Capital, said: ‚Äú2024 was a challenging year for many crypto funds because it was a Bitcoin and memecoins year ‚Äî those were the best assets, and everything else trailed behind.‚Äù David Jeong, CEO of Tread.fi, an algorithmic crypto trading platform for institutional investors, believes that outperforming Bitcoin is tough for crypto hedge funds, as ‚Äúit‚Äôs really hard to time these things.‚Äù Directional and quantitative strategies drive strong performance for crypto hedge funds Nevertheless, according to VisionTrack data, hedge funds focusing on directional and quantitative strategies in the digital asset space posted the best average performance last year. The VisionTrack Quant Directional Index gained over 53%, while the VisionTrack Fundamental Index grew over 40% in the same period. The VisionTrack Market Neutral Index added about 18.5%. Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Alpha Liquid Fund increased by 76.6% in 2024, according to a person familiar with the performance. David Tawil‚Äôs ProChain Master Fund, a multi-strategy crypto fund, gained approximately 70% last year. This follows an 80% surge in 2023 thanks to substantial positions in larger tokens, including Bitcoin. Fundamental research and macro funds, which have strong convictions in crypto assets based on in-depth research of the tokens or blockchain technology, generally performed well. Reflexive Capital, based in San Francisco, saw a net return of 106% in 2024, according to a source familiar with the performance. The Tephra Digital Asset Fund LP, led by former Wall Street professionals Ryan Price and Raghav Chopra, posted approximately 100% gross returns by year-end, compared to 41% the previous year, according to their December letter to investors, dated Jan. 6. According to Galaxy‚Äôs data, most crypto hedge fund gains occurred in the final quarter of 2024. President-elect Donald Trump, once a crypto skeptic, became one of the industry‚Äôs most vocal supporters. His victory in the US presidential election sent Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to new heights. Adding to Bitcoin‚Äôs stellar year was the successful launch of exchange-traded funds in the US that invest directly in Bitcoin.

The speculation originated from an X post by ‚ÄúWale.moca,‚Äù a researcher at NFT firm Azuki, who cited unnamed sources close to the deal. Market Reacts to CryptoPunks Speculation CryptoPunks‚Äô floor price climbed from 36.6 ETH to 41 ETH, equivalent to over $130,000, as reported by NFT Floor Price data. However, the identity of the potential buyer remains a mystery, with Wale.moca suggesting it isn‚Äôt a Web2 company or an existing NFT brand like Pudgy Penguins, Azuki, or Doodles. This development could mark a major milestone in the NFT space, given CryptoPunks‚Äô dominance as the most valuable NFT collection in the market. According to NFT Price Floor, CryptoPunks boasts a staggering market cap of 414,700 ETH ($1.3 billion), far outpacing competitors such as Pudgy Penguins, which sits at 213,080 ETH . Yuga Labs‚Äô Dominance Yuga Labs acquired the IP rights to 423 CryptoPunks NFTs from Larva Labs in March 2022 for an undisclosed amount. At that time, the collection‚Äôs floor price was around 65 ETH. Despite a 37% decline in ETH-denominated floor price since then, the value of Ether itself has risen over 24%, providing some cushion to the collection‚Äôs overall valuation. Yuga Labs, which also owns the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection, has remained a key player in the NFT ecosystem. BAYC holds the third position in market value among NFTs , further cementing Yuga‚Äôs dominance. In February 2024, Yuga Labs saw a leadership change as co-founder Greg Solano returned as CEO, replacing Daniel Alegre. Solano‚Äôs tenure included a series of layoffs announced in April , with a focus on restoring the company‚Äôs creative-first ethos amidst shifting market dynamics. A Catalyst for the NFT Industry? If Yuga Labs proceeds with selling CryptoPunks‚Äô IP rights, it could redefine the industry‚Äôs approach to intellectual property in digital collectibles. As speculation continues to fuel market activity, investors and NFT enthusiasts are closely watching for confirmation. While the potential deal‚Äôs specifics remain unclear, the surge in CryptoPunks‚Äô floor price underscores the enduring interest in high-value NFTs and the impact of market rumors on digital assets.

According to a report by media outlet New Straits Times, Ibrahim returned to Malaysia after a three-day visit to Abu Dhabi with plans to start developing policies related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology so that the nation does not get left behind. Speaking to reporters, the Prime Minister said he had lengthy conversations with the Abu Dhabi government and the former Binance CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao about crypto and blockchain technology. ‚ÄúWe have talked about digital transformation, data centres and artificial intelligence. We now face demands which require us to think about making significant changes,‚Äù said Ibrahim. He claimed that he has requested government agencies such as the Treasury, the Securities Commission, and the national bank, Bank Negara, to study how Malaysia can keep up with the rapid developments of the crypto industry.

The Philosophy Behind CZ‚Äôs Statement Why Timing Matters in Crypto CZ‚Äôs message reflects the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, where early movers often reap the greatest rewards: Bitcoin‚Äôs Historical Growth: Early Bitcoin investors saw unparalleled returns, with BTC rising from mere cents to over $90,000. Adoption Curve: Cryptocurrencies are still in the early stages of adoption compared to traditional financial systems, offering significant growth potential. Overcoming Investor Hesitation Many potential investors delay entering the market, only to regret not acting sooner: Fear of Volatility: Concerns about price swings can deter action. Missed Opportunities: As the market matures, the cost of waiting often outweighs the risks of early investment. Why ‚ÄòToday‚Äô Matters More Than Ever Expanding Use Cases The cryptocurrency ecosystem is growing beyond Bitcoin, with applications in decentralized finance (DeFi) , non-fungible tokens (NFTs) , and AI integration creating new opportunities. Institutional Involvement Bitcoin ETFs: The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs is increasing accessibility for retail and institutional investors alike. Corporate Adoption: Major companies are integrating blockchain technology into their operations, signaling long-term confidence in the sector. Lessons from Missed Opportunities Looking Back at Bitcoin‚Äôs Growth Early Days: In 2010, Bitcoin was worth less than $1, and its potential was largely underestimated. Today‚Äôs Perspective: At over $90,000, Bitcoin continues to demonstrate resilience and value growth, proving early critics wrong. Investor Reflections CZ‚Äôs statement resonates with those who have observed Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory from the sidelines: Regret of Inaction: Many investors wish they had entered the market during its nascent stages. The Importance of Action: Recognizing the current moment as an opportunity could prevent future regret. Navigating the Crypto Market Today Key Strategies for New Investors Start Small: Allocate a portion of your portfolio to crypto investments to minimize risk. Diversify: Explore a mix of large-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and emerging altcoins with growth potential. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regularly invest small amounts to mitigate the impact of market volatility. For Experienced Investors Stay Informed: Keep up with emerging trends like AI integration, DeFi, and layer-2 solutions. Expand Holdings: Diversify into newer projects that align with long-term market narratives. The Bigger Picture: Crypto‚Äôs Future Potential Adoption and Innovation Cryptocurrencies are at the forefront of technological innovation: Global Financial Inclusion: Blockchain technology offers solutions for the unbanked and underbanked populations. Digital Transformation: From supply chain management to gaming, crypto applications are reshaping industries. The Role of Early Adoption As CZ emphasized, acting early positions investors to capitalize on crypto‚Äôs transformative potential before widespread adoption drives prices higher. Conclusion Changpeng Zhao‚Äôs message, ‚ÄúToday is earlier than all the days to come,‚Äù serves as a timely reminder of the value of early action in cryptocurrency investing. With Bitcoin and the broader crypto market continuing to evolve, seizing opportunities now could prevent future regret over missed chances.

As Ethereum maintains its dominance, emerging tokens like Yeti Ouro are carving out a space in the growing Play-to-Earn gaming sector, offering investors exciting opportunities for 2025. Table of Contents Ethereum forecast for 2025 Yeti Ouro: Can it lead the P2E market? Can Yeti Ouro beat Shiba Inu? Why invest in Yeti Ouro? Conclusion The crypto space is always changing. Established players like Ethereum (ETH) are still dominant, while new tokens like Yeti Ouro (YETIO) are finding their space in the growing Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming sector. For investors, understanding these assets is key to finding opportunities. Ethereum forecast for 2025 Ethereum , the second largest crypto by market cap, is successful due to its powerful smart contract capabilities and a huge network of decentralized applications (dApps). As of January 14th, 2025, Ethereum price is currently trading at around $3,230.56. Regarding Ethereum‚Äôs 2025 expected price performance, experts are divided. Some say it could go to $6,000 if spot Ether ETFs get approved in the US and institutional money comes in. Others say $5,000 to $15,000, depending on the market and Ethereum‚Äôs progress on scalability solutions. Ethereum‚Äôs upgrades, like Ethereum 2.0 and the switch to proof-of-stake, will lower transaction fees and improve scalability and security. These will make the network more attractive to devs and users and could drive more price growth. Yeti Ouro: Can it lead the P2E market? Yeti Ouro is a new cryptocurrency making moves in the P2E gaming space. Unlike many meme coins without real-world use, YETIO powers the Yeti Go ecosystem, a P2E racing game built on Unreal Engine. Players earn YETIO tokens through gameplay, which can be used for in-game purchases, staked for rewards, or traded. The P2E space is growing; analysts predict it could be a multi-billion dollar industry. Yeti Ouro‚Äôs entry into this growing market means it‚Äôs poised for mass adoption. Its deflationary model with a capped supply and token burn mechanisms adds scarcity, making it attractive to investors looking for assets with long-term value. The team shared a video showcasing the first glance at the Level 1 map at a distance. This is a larger area of the map that uses the same deathmatch style game play. Players have a large surface area to avoid attackers and collect power-ups to help them defeat opponents. There is so much detail yet to be shown, with garages for vehicle repairs and upgrades as well as hidden tunnels and harsh terrains to get through. Can Yeti Ouro beat Shiba Inu? Due to community hype and speculation, Shiba Inu (SHIB) became a meme coin with a big market cap. But with no real use case, it‚Äôs hard to see how it will last. Yeti Ouro combines the community-driven aspect of meme coins with a real use case in P2E. This is a stronger play in the crypto market. During presale, Yeti Ouro returned over 40% The crypto market is unpredictable, but Yeti Ouro has a solid use case and is aligned with a growing industry, so it could outperform Shiba Inu in adoption and value growth. However, it‚Äôs still early for YETIO so there is a large potential upside, so it‚Äôs definitely worth consideration by investors. Why invest in Yeti Ouro? Yeti Ouro has several reasons to invest: Real use case: YETIO is essential to the Yeti Go gaming ecosystem, so there will be steady demand from players. Scarcity: Capped supply and token burns create scarcity, which will drive up the price as demand increases. Market trend: Gaming and blockchain are converging, so Yeti Ouro is in the right place. First mover: Early investors will benefit as the project gains momentum and adoption grows. Conclusion Ethereum is the leading blockchain development platform with high growth potential in 2025. However emerging tokens like Yeti Ouro offer opportunities in niche spaces like P2E gaming. With utility, scarcity, and alignment with market trends, Yeti Ouro could be a good addition to users portfolios and may even beat Shiba Inu. As always, thorough research and careful consideration of risk tolerance are essential before investing in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Brett Knoblauch, Head of Crypto and Digital Assets Research at Cantor Fitzgerald, highlighted MicroStrategy‚Äôs potential to raise $26.7 billion through equity, preferred stock, and debt, allowing the firm to acquire an additional 287,000 Bitcoin (BTC) . This move reflects growing confidence in MicroStrategy‚Äôs position as a corporate Bitcoin powerhouse. MicroStrategy‚Äôs Current Bitcoin Holdings MicroStrategy, co-founded by Michael Saylor, continues to lead the corporate world in Bitcoin holdings: Recent Purchase: On January 12, 2025, the company acquired an additional 2,530 BTC for $243 million , at an average price of $95,972 per Bitcoin . Total Holdings: MicroStrategy now holds 450,000 BTC , purchased at an average price of $62,691 per Bitcoin. Portfolio Value: The total investment amounts to $28.2 billion . Cantor Fitzgerald‚Äôs Optimism: Key Drivers 1. Potential Capital Raise for Bitcoin Purchases Knoblauch pointed to MicroStrategy‚Äôs ability to raise substantial funds to expand its Bitcoin portfolio: Equity Issuance: The company could issue $6.7 billion in equity. Preferred Stock: An additional $2 billion could be raised through preferred stock. Debt Financing: MicroStrategy has the capacity to secure $18 billion in debt , boosting its purchasing power. 2. Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation If fully realized, the raised funds could enable the purchase of approximately 287,000 BTC , further solidifying MicroStrategy‚Äôs dominance as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder. Michael Saylor‚Äôs Vision for Bitcoin Michael Saylor has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value: Corporate Strategy: Saylor views Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a tool for wealth preservation. Long-Term Confidence: By consistently increasing its holdings, MicroStrategy reinforces its belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term potential. Market Implications of MicroStrategy‚Äôs Strategy Positive Sentiment for Bitcoin MicroStrategy‚Äôs aggressive accumulation supports Bitcoin‚Äôs market perception as a premier asset for institutional adoption. Stock Valuation Boost Cantor Fitzgerald‚Äôs increased price target reflects growing optimism about MicroStrategy‚Äôs business model and its alignment with the rising value of Bitcoin. Broader Corporate Adoption As MicroStrategy sets a precedent, other companies may follow suit, further integrating Bitcoin into their corporate strategies. Risks and Considerations Market Volatility Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Fluctuations: The firm‚Äôs strategy ties its financial health closely to Bitcoin‚Äôs market performance. Debt Risks: Raising significant debt for Bitcoin acquisitions increases financial risk if prices drop substantially. Regulatory Challenges Uncertain Policies: Global regulatory changes could impact Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption and MicroStrategy‚Äôs strategy. Investment Outlook for MSTR Analyst View Cantor Fitzgerald‚Äôs updated price target suggests strong growth potential for MSTR, driven by Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term trajectory and MicroStrategy‚Äôs strategic positioning. Investor Takeaway Bitcoin Exposure: Investing in MSTR provides indirect exposure to Bitcoin, appealing to institutional and retail investors alike. Risk Management: Investors should weigh the volatility of Bitcoin when considering MSTR as part of their portfolios. Conclusion Cantor Fitzgerald‚Äôs decision to raise MicroStrategy‚Äôs price target to $613 highlights the firm‚Äôs growing confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs role in the company‚Äôs strategy. With the potential to acquire an additional 287,000 BTC , MicroStrategy remains at the forefront of institutional Bitcoin adoption. However, investors must consider the risks associated with Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility and the capital-intensive nature of the strategy. As the crypto market evolves, MicroStrategy‚Äôs bold approach continues to set it apart as a leader in the space.

Ozak AI has a target price of $1, and a listing price set at $0.01, early investors stand to gain significant returns. Not only did the project‚Äôs prelaunch attract a lot of hype by offering advanced AI-driven financial solutions as well as deflationary tokenomics, but they managed to remain a standout within the industry. Injective (INJ) Experiences Reduced Market Activity On the other hand, exchange coin Injective (INJ) has suffered a prolonged bear trend. INJ traded between $20.83 and $21.66 over the last 24 hours and closed at $21.08 , with a 1.0% increase during the last 24 hours. But, the overall trading volume plummeted significantly to 38.10%, seeing $102.1 million. The decrease in market activity points both to waning interest and to a steady upward bias in the token. The token‚Äôs current price remains 59.83% below its all-time high of $52.62, achieved on March 14, 2024. This huge drop from its highest point shows the difficulties INJ faces in rebuilding investor trust due to changing market conditions.

Predictive AI Models like ARIMA algorithms and neural networks are used to accurately forecast market trends. These networks are Predictive AI Models that deliver accurate market trend prediction.

Ozak Data Vaults manage secure, scale storage for financial data, while Prediction Agents (PAs) provide data/service forecasts based on unique individual needs. This shows Ozak AI‚Äôs willingness to deliver these tools that can help users be more empowered. $OZ‚Äôs further tokenomics also make it attractive. The model is economic on its own, with a total supply of 10 billion tokens capped. Selling more than 2.79 million tokens in the presale phase shows how investors are biting by. Conclusion After Injective‚Äôs (INJ) struggle in recovering its momentum, Ozak AI stands as a leading contender with its creative offerings and great future outlook. Ozak AI‚Äôs presale has an incredibly attractive $0.002 entry point for investors searching for high returns.

XDC Network ( XDC ) soared 22% to $0.1231 over the past day, becoming the top gainer among the 100 largest crypto assets per data from CoinGecko. Its market cap stood at over $1.7 billion as of press time. The altcoin‚Äôs price rally was accompanied by a surge in trading volume and open interest in the futures market. Notably, the asset‚Äôs trading volume was up 44% over the past day, hovering over $84 million, while its open interest doubled over the same timeframe to $4.62 million. XDC rallied after the project announced its partnership with the account abstraction platform PillarX, which will integrate XDC into its ecosystem. This would enable the platform‚Äôs users to incorporate XDC into their Web3 activities while benefiting from advanced features like enhanced transaction efficiency and usability. The partnership will also strengthen the XDC Network‚Äôs foothold in the RWA tokenization market by enhancing its accessibility and utility for tokenizing real-world assets through seamless Web3 integration. RWA tokenization allows users to convert physical assets, like real estate, into digital tokens that can be traded on blockchain networks. The XDC Network has previously partnered with Archax, a digital securities exchange and custodian regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, to promote the adoption of tokenized real-world assets. As such, the project holds the second-largest position in the RWA market, trailing behind only Mantra, which has a market cap of over $3.6 billion. Another factor that has renewed investor confidence in the project is the growth of the XDC Network DeFi ecosystem over the past months. According to DefiLlama, its total value locked in the DeFi ecosystem has surged from $8.5 million at the beginning of November to an all-time high of $31.23 million, as seen on Jan. 15. Further, the altcoin‚Äôs rally was partly supported by Bitcoin‚Äôs march back toward $100k as the broader crypto market recovered following cooler-than-expected inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Crypto Fear and Greed In dex has also shifted back to ‚ÄúGreed‚Äù from the neutral levels seen last week, with a reading of 70 at press time, indicating a risk-on sentiment in the market.

This is confirmed by the Supertrend indicator, with the Supertrend line moving below the line to support the bullish outlook. XDC 50-day and 200-day EMA chart | Source: crypto.news The altcoin is also trading above the 50-day and 200-day Moving Averages which means the buying pressure is still up with bulls targeting higher prices, potentially aiming for a new all-time high of $0.19, around 39% higher than the current price of $0.1131. However, the XDC rally could face a pullback before continuing its rally as its price approaches the upper Bollinger Band and the Relative Strength Index nears overbought levels. Another potential driver that could hinder a bullish continuation is increased selling activity observed from retail traders. Over the past day, XDC traders have moved $3.06 million worth of tokens into exchanges, while $2.57 million was withdrawn per CoinGlass data. Increased amounts of cryptocurrency being sent to exchanges is typically a sign that investors could be preparing to sell off their holdings either to cash in profits or rotate funds into a different asset.

Lin Chen, Head of Business Development for Asia at Deribit, shared the analysis on X, highlighting a cautious outlook amid prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty. Ethereum‚Äôs Current Market Context Price Dynamics As of January 14, ETH is trading below the $4,000 threshold , struggling to regain its footing after a volatile close to 2024. Key Resistance Levels: Analysts point to $4,000 as a psychological barrier and technical resistance level for Ethereum. Market Sentiment: While optimism around Ethereum‚Äôs long-term potential remains intact, short-term sentiment reflects cautious enthusiasm. How the Options Market Derives Probability The 10.62% probability reflects investor sentiment and price expectations based on options market activity: Implied Volatility: The market‚Äôs expectations for price swings over the next few weeks are factored into option premiums. Strike Prices: The $4,000 strike price has attracted limited demand, signaling low confidence in a rapid breakout. Market Conditions: Broader macroeconomic factors and ETH‚Äôs recent performance influence these calculations. Key Factors Impacting Ethereum‚Äôs Outlook Positive Catalysts DeFi Growth: Ethereum continues to dominate the DeFi sector, with increased adoption bolstering its utility. Layer-2 Scaling: The success of solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism is enhancing Ethereum‚Äôs scalability and appeal. Regulatory Optimism: Anticipated pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration could drive institutional interest. Challenges Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Rising U.S. Treasury yields and cautious Federal Reserve policies could weigh on risk assets, including ETH. Competition: Rival blockchains offering faster and cheaper alternatives pose ongoing challenges to Ethereum‚Äôs dominance. Low Trading Volume: Reduced trading activity in the crypto market could hinder ETH‚Äôs ability to breach $4,000. What the 10.62% Probability Means for Investors Cautious Optimism The modest probability reflects market skepticism about ETH‚Äôs short-term ability to exceed $4,000 but acknowledges the potential for unexpected bullish catalysts. Strategic Implications Options Traders: The low probability suggests potential opportunities for higher-risk strategies, such as selling options at the $4,000 strike. Long-Term Investors: Those focused on Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals may see current levels as an attractive entry point, regardless of near-term fluctuations. Historical Context: Ethereum and $4K Milestones All-Time High: Ethereum‚Äôs peak above $4,800 in November 2021 remains a benchmark for bullish potential. 2023-2024 Trends: ETH‚Äôs struggle to consistently hold above $4,000 highlights the psychological significance of this price point. Conclusion The options market‚Äôs 10.62% probability of Ethereum exceeding $4,000 by the end of January reflects tempered expectations amid challenging market conditions. While Ethereum‚Äôs long-term fundamentals remain strong, investors and traders should approach the current environment with cautious optimism, balancing short-term strategies with a focus on the protocol‚Äôs broader potential.

It is the deadline for the regulator to file its opening brief in its appeal against Judge Torres‚Äôs ruling. The situation has created several sensational media headlines. Some have triggered serious discussions on whether the SEC would proceed with its appeal or not. The XRP community appears sharply divided, with some speculating the possibility of abandoning the appeal and others forecasting the probability of it proceeding. Anyway, the ongoing discussions on XRP have benefited the market extensively. In the last 24 hours alone, the market has grown by 12%, outperforming almost all the top ten cryptos. Time to analyse the scenario a little deeper. Ready? XRP Overview: What‚Äôs Happening in the Market At the start of the year, the price of XRP was at $2.08. Since then, the market has surged by 36.53%. Interestingly, between January 4 and 9, the market witnessed a small correction of 7.51%. However, with a sharp upward swing of 13 per cent between January 10 and 11, the market strongly recovered from the correction. In the last three days alone, XRP has increased by nearly 13.79%. The RSI of XRP stands at 68.96 ‚Äì just a few points below the overbought range of 70. This indicators that there is more room for growth in the market. In the last 24 hours, XRP has outperformed the overall crypto market, as well as almost all the top ten cryptos, including Bitcoin (+1.6%), Ethereum (+1.4%), BNB (+0.8%), Solana (+1.4%), and Dogecoin (+4.6%). Will the SEC Abandon the Appeal against Ripple? Even though many XRP enthusiasts suggest that there is little chance for the SEC to pursue the appeal, some experts believe that the regulator is less likely to abandon the appeal, highlighting certain crucial factors, including the recent restructuring of the SEC litigation team leadership with litigators having expertise in handling crypto cases. New SEC Chairman to Join This Month Even if the SEC, led by crypto-skeptic Gary Gensler, proceeds with its tougher stand, the impact will be short-lived, as Gensler is expected to step down from his position, paving the way for the appointment of a pro-crypto executive, Paul Atkins. XRP enthusiasts strongly believe that Atkins would withdraw the SEC‚Äôs appeal against the US court ruling, which partly accepted Ripple‚Äôs argument that XRP is not a security. In conclusion, the legal developments around Ripple and the SEC have boosted XRP‚Äôs market momentum, with its price outperforming major cryptos. While uncertainty remains regarding the SEC‚Äôs appeal, upcoming changes in leadership could significantly impact the case, potentially favouring Ripple.

Meanwhile, the latest recovery suggests the tokens are on a bullish track as the global market capitalisation surged over $3.5 trillion while the sentiments have again become greedy. In the meantime, Algorand (ALGO) is among the top performers for the day, attracting over double-digit gains, which has raised hopes for an extended bullish action of over 60% in the next couple of weeks, which could elevate the ALGO price above $0.5. Will ALGO price reclaim $1 in 2025? The latest collaboration of Algroand with Mastercard is believed to be the classic move that may attract massive liquidity. The adoption is expected to increase with higher changes of ALGO being used as a mode of payment, wherever Mastercard is accepted. Moreover, the latest upgrade, Algorand 4.0, which is expected to be deployed any time from now, could attract the required liquidity with its staking feature. As per the X post shared by Algorand CTO John Woods, the consensus upgrade is expected to consume a week. The staking rewards will go live after 6.5 days (208,000 rounds), achieving over 90% of stake votes. With the beginning of a new era, ALGO‚Äôs demand could increase, which may eventually impact its value over time. After rebounding from the support zone between $0.32 and $0.3278 for the third consecutive time, the price surged to the resistance, completing a triple-bottom pattern. The technicals have turned bullish, suggesting a breakout in the next few hours. Chaikin money flow, which is used to measure money flow volume, has just surged above ‚Äò0‚Äô which is a sign of market strength with an increased buying pressure. On the other hand, the +Di & -Di are about to undergo a bullish crossover, which suggests the momentum has shifted to bullish. Besides, the RSI has been varying in and out of the average range, suggesting the bulls to have held a significant strength. Besides, the MACD underwent a bullish crossover after overcoming a small bearish action, hinting towards a bullish continuation. Hence, all the factors, fundamental and technical, point towards the continuation of a bullish trend beyond the resistance zone between $040 and $42. This may further push the price above $0.5. However, after withstanding minor bearish activity, the price is expected to revamp a strong rise to $0.6, which may open the doors to $1 later this year.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALGO|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-15 09:49:45

Punisher Coin, Pepe Coin and Stellar",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/which-crypto-should-i-buy-in-2025-punisher-coin-pepe-coin-and-stellar/,"The post Which Crypto Should I Buy In 2025? Punisher Coin, Pepe Coin and Stellar appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As we begin 2025, a lot of seasoned and new crypto investors are asking themselves the same question; which crypto should I buy in 2025? With so many projects emerging, it can be tough to separate the hype from the true potential. In this article, we‚Äôll compare three popular options: Stellar (XLM), Pepe Coin (PEPE), and Punisher Coin ($PUN). Each one offers unique features, but one stands out for its exciting presale and game-changing vision. Punisher Coin ($PUN) ‚Äì The Game-Changer for 2025 Now, let‚Äôs talk about Punisher Coin. This project has everything you could want in a crypto investment for 2025: bold ambition, unique utility, and an exciting presale opportunity. Punisher Coin operates on the Solana blockchain, combining meme culture with real-world value in a way few other projects can. At its core is the Mean Meme Machine, a decentralized platform where users can create, share, and monetize memes. As part of the ecosystem, the best meme creations are turned into NFTs, offering creators a stake in the project‚Äôs success. But Punisher Coin doesn‚Äôt stop there. Its real-world ambitions include the launch of Punisher Energy Drinks, with a focus on funding blockchain education and innovation. Coupled with hyper-deflationary tokenomics, which reduces supply with every transaction, $PUN presents a compelling mix of creativity, community, and economic strategy. Perhaps the most exciting part is that the Punisher Coin presale is set to launch soon, providing early investors with a rare opportunity to get in before the project explodes onto the market. This kind of momentum is exactly what crypto investors crave, and $PUN is well-positioned to make a significant impact. Stellar (XLM) ‚Äì The Cross-Border Pioneer Stellar has long been a favorite in the world of cryptocurrency. As a blockchain platform, its primary goal is to facilitate cross-border payments with low fees and fast transaction speeds. Stellar is already well-established and has partnerships with large institutions, including IBM and Deloitte. However, despite its strong fundamentals and real-world use cases, Stellar‚Äôs growth prospects in 2025 are likely to be steady rather than explosive. Investors looking for stability and long-term value might consider Stellar, but it may not provide the kind of skyrocket potential many are hoping for in 2025. Pepe Coin (PEPE) ‚Äì Meme Magic with a Twist Meme coins like Pepe Coin have taken the crypto world by storm. Originating from the infamous Pepe the Frog meme, Pepe Coin aims to capitalize on internet culture, much like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu did in the past. While meme coins have certainly proven their worth in the short term, their long-term sustainability can be questionable. Many of these coins rely heavily on community hype and social media trends to fuel their growth. The real question remains: Can Pepe Coin evolve beyond meme status, or will it become another flash-in-the-pan success? While Pepe Coin may provide short-term thrills and gains, its future is uncertain without significant utility or technological advancements. Investors should approach with caution, especially if they‚Äôre hoping for something with lasting potential. Why Punisher Coin Is the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025 While Stellar and Pepe Coin each have their merits, it‚Äôs clear that Punisher Coin offers something truly unique. With its multifaceted approach combining humor, utility, and innovation, Punisher Coin ($PUN) stands out as a project with real-world impact and a visionary roadmap for the future. The presale launch is just around the corner, and the opportunity to get in early on this exciting venture is one you don‚Äôt want to miss. So, if you‚Äôre asking yourself, ‚ÄúWhich crypto should I buy in 2025?‚Äù look no further than Punisher Coin. Visit Punisher‚Äôs website and get ready to invest in the presale‚Äîthis is a coin that could go big in 2025 and beyond!

The transfer involved 100,000,000 XRP, valued at $265.47 million, moving from one unknown wallet to another. It‚Äôs worth noting that this is the largest XRP transaction not involving Ripple since December 2024. Such significant movements often prompt speculation about their purpose and implications. 100,000,000 #XRP (265,467,057 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/1ZT2mBAI0s ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 14, 2025 The Unique Timing Of The Transaction The crypto community is actively debating the potential reasons behind this transaction. With no involvement from Ripple, the movement likely stems from private entities or individuals. The timing of this event has drawn attention, as the cryptocurrency market anticipates a pivotal shift in U.S. regulatory policies on January 20, 2025. On this date, President-elect Donald Trump, a vocal supporter of cryptocurrencies, will take office. Additionally, Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is set to resign , with Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly figure, nominated as his replacement. Many believe the incoming administration could dismiss the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against Ripple. This optimism stems from the perception that Atkins and the new administration will be fair toward cryptocurrencies, potentially reducing regulatory hurdles for Ripple and similar entities. This environment may explain the whale activity, as investors position themselves for potential market changes. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Potential Explanations The transfer‚Äôs size raises questions about its intent. One possibility is that it represents an institutional interest in XRP, with entities preparing for a bullish market following the anticipated regulatory shift. This transaction could also be part of an internal restructuring by a major entity managing substantial XRP holdings. However, such interpretations remain speculative without clear identifiers for the wallets involved. Historically, significant XRP transactions have occasionally preceded notable market movements. Investors often interpret such activity as a signal of increased confidence in the asset‚Äôs future. The alignment of this transaction with key upcoming events adds to the intrigue. If the Ripple lawsuit is dismissed, XRP‚Äôs market position could strengthen significantly, potentially driving further adoption and investment. XRP whale activity has been rising since December 2024 , and the recent transaction shows the excitement surrounding cryptocurrencies in 2025. The potential for pro-crypto policies under Trump‚Äôs administration has invigorated market participants, and the explosive XRP rally investors have been anticipating for years could finally materialize.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Lee highlighted that Bitcoin‚Äôs current price of $90,000 offers a ‚Äúgood entry point‚Äù for long-term investors, despite acknowledging the potential for short-term dips to $70,000 or even $50,000 . Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Action and Current Entry Point Why $90,000 Is Attractive Resilience: Bitcoin has demonstrated strength during recent market turbulence, maintaining levels above $90,000. Long-Term Value: Lee emphasized that buyers at this level are unlikely to lose money over time. Potential Downside Short-Term Dips: $70,000: A pullback to this level would align with historical corrections. $50,000: While less likely, such a dip could present a significant buying opportunity. Lee‚Äôs Optimism: Early Halving Cycle Impact Lee attributes much of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential for outperformance in 2025 to its position within the early stages of a halving cycle. Halving Dynamics Supply Reduction: Bitcoin‚Äôs halving, which occurs approximately every four years, reduces block rewards by 50%, tightening supply. Price Impact: Historically, halvings have preceded major bull runs, as reduced supply coincides with increased demand. Two Potential Scenarios for Bitcoin in 2025 Scenario 1: Minor Correction Before Rally Drop to $70,000: A mild pullback could allow Bitcoin to consolidate before resuming an upward trajectory. Investor Confidence: Such a correction is unlikely to deter long-term investors. Scenario 2: Deeper Correction with Strong Recovery Drop to $50,000: In this case, macroeconomic pressures or unexpected events could trigger a steeper decline. Recovery Potential: Bitcoin‚Äôs history of rebounding strongly from bear markets suggests a rally could follow. Macro Factors Supporting Bitcoin‚Äôs Growth Institutional Adoption ETFs: The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs has increased accessibility for institutional investors. Global Hedge: Bitcoin continues to be seen as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. Regulatory Optimism Trump Administration: Anticipated pro-crypto regulations under the new administration are fueling investor confidence. Investment Strategy for 2025 For Long-Term Investors DCA Strategy: Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) can mitigate the impact of short-term volatility. Focus on Fundamentals: Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity and institutional interest support its long-term value proposition. For Traders Key Levels to Watch: Support: $70,000 and $50,000 as potential buying zones. Resistance: Breaking above $100,000 could trigger a new bull market phase. Risk Management: Use stop-loss orders to minimize exposure to unexpected downturns. Conclusion Tom Lee‚Äôs forecast underscores Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to shine as a top-performing asset in 2025, despite the possibility of short-term volatility. With a current price of $90,000, Bitcoin offers an attractive entry point for long-term investors, particularly as it enters the early stages of a halving cycle. While dips to $70,000 or even $50,000 remain possibilities, Lee‚Äôs analysis highlights the robust recovery potential that has historically defined Bitcoin‚Äôs market cycles.

This data, reported by Trader T on X (@thepfund), highlights continued cautious sentiment among investors. While most ETFs recorded outflows, BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA bucked the trend with $12.81 million in net inflows , signaling mixed market dynamics.

Positive Inflow BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA: Contrasted the broader trend with $12.81 million in net inflows, showing selective investor confidence. Other ETFs No significant inflows or outflows were reported across remaining Ethereum ETFs. Market Sentiment: Factors Driving Outflows Macro Uncertainty Economic Data: Recent strong U.S. labor reports and rising Treasury yields have heightened concerns about tighter financial conditions. Federal Reserve Policies: Uncertainty over potential interest rate hikes continues to weigh on risk assets, including Ethereum. Profit-Taking Behavior Recent ETH Rally: Ethereum‚Äôs price increases in late 2024 prompted profit-taking among investors, contributing to ETF outflows. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA: A Positive Outlier Why ETHA Attracted Inflows BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA recorded $12.81 million in inflows, reflecting targeted investor interest: Institutional Trust: BlackRock‚Äôs reputation may have driven confidence during a volatile period.

Impact on Ethereum Prices Short-Term Pressure Price Volatility: Sustained outflows from major ETFs like Grayscale‚Äôs mini ETH and ETHE could increase selling pressure on Ethereum. Market Liquidity: Reduced demand in the ETF market may lead to thinner liquidity, affecting price stability. Long-Term Outlook Growth Potential: Despite short-term challenges, Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals, including its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, remain strong. Institutional Adoption: Continued interest from major players like BlackRock suggests optimism for Ethereum‚Äôs long-term trajectory.

Diversify Investments Diversification across multiple assets and ETFs can help mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations. Long-Term Focus Short-term outflows may create buying opportunities for investors confident in Ethereum‚Äôs growth potential.

While Grayscale‚Äôs ETFs faced significant withdrawals, BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA stood out with notable inflows, signaling selective confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs future.

However, he acknowledged its global appeal, noting that seven billion people want to trade it. According to Watcher Guru on X, Gensler likened Bitcoin‚Äôs significance to that of gold , which has been a store of value for over 10,000 years . Gensler also reaffirmed his intention to resign from his position as SEC Chairman on January 20, 2025 . Bitcoin as a Global Asset Gensler‚Äôs Gold Comparison Gensler‚Äôs statement draws a parallel between gold and Bitcoin: Historical Store of Value: Gold has served as a reliable store of value for millennia. Modern Digital Gold: Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold , has become a sought-after asset due to its decentralized nature and scarcity. Global Demand for Bitcoin Gensler suggested that Bitcoin‚Äôs popularity transcends borders and demographics: Widespread Appeal: The fact that seven billion people desire access to Bitcoin underscores its potential as a universal asset. Speculative Nature: Despite its appeal, Gensler warned that Bitcoin remains speculative and subject to volatility. Gensler‚Äôs Tenure as SEC Chairman As SEC Chairman , Gensler played a significant role in regulating cryptocurrencies: Crypto Regulation Stance: He has consistently emphasized the need for clear regulations to protect investors in the rapidly evolving crypto market. Spot ETF Approval Delays: Under his leadership, the SEC delayed several Bitcoin spot ETF applications, contributing to regulatory uncertainty. Upcoming Resignation January 20 Departure: Gensler‚Äôs decision to step down marks a pivotal moment for U.S. crypto regulation, as his successor will inherit key regulatory challenges. The Debate Around Bitcoin‚Äôs Speculative Nature Volatility Concerns Bitcoin‚Äôs price has been characterized by significant fluctuations: 2021 to Present: Bitcoin‚Äôs rise from $10,000 to over $60,000 and subsequent corrections illustrate its volatile nature. Investor Risk: Gensler‚Äôs remarks serve as a reminder that Bitcoin‚Äôs value is influenced by market sentiment and macroeconomic factors. Institutional Adoption Despite Gensler‚Äôs cautionary remarks, Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption continues to grow: Spot ETFs: Institutional investors are eyeing Bitcoin spot ETFs as a way to access the asset through regulated financial products. Corporate Holdings: Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla continue to hold significant Bitcoin reserves. Global Interest in Trading Bitcoin Bitcoin‚Äôs global popularity is driven by several factors: Decentralization: Bitcoin operates without central control, appealing to those seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems. Cross-Border Transactions: Its borderless nature makes it ideal for international transactions and remittances. Store of Value: Many investors view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. Gensler‚Äôs Impact on the Crypto Market Mixed Legacy Gensler‚Äôs tenure as SEC Chairman has had a mixed impact on the crypto industry: Push for Regulation: His efforts to regulate the market were welcomed by some as necessary for investor protection. Industry Frustration: However, delays in approving Bitcoin ETFs and enforcement actions against crypto firms frustrated industry stakeholders. The Road Ahead With Gensler stepping down, the crypto industry awaits new leadership that could shape future regulatory approaches. Conclusion Gary Gensler‚Äôs assertion that seven billion people want to trade Bitcoin highlights the cryptocurrency‚Äôs global appeal despite its highly speculative nature. As he prepares to resign as SEC Chairman, his remarks serve as both a cautionary note and a testament to Bitcoin‚Äôs evolving role as a modern-day digital gold .

Analysts predict the asset could reach $1.20 soon, with long-term targets as high as $7 based on technical patterns and upcoming developments. What Caused the Pump? Cardano‚Äôs ADA is among the best-performing cryptocurrencies today (January 15), with its price soaring to a one-week high of approximately $1.05 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data). Its market capitalization jumped above $37 billion, thus solidifying the asset‚Äôs position in crypto‚Äôs top 10 club . ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko Perhaps the most obvious reason fueling the rally is the overall resurgence of the digital asset market. Bitcoin (BTC), whose price briefly dipped below $90K a few days ago, is now worth around $97,000. Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) , and many others have also charted impressive gains in the last 24 hours. Another factor could be the whale activity. The popular X user Ali Martinez revealed that such large investors have accumulated more than 100 million ADA (worth over $100 million) in the past 48 hours. Whale purchases reduce the available supply, potentially creating buying pressure and pushing prices higher due to basic economic principles. The move often signals confidence in the asset, encouraging smaller players to follow suit, further amplifying the upward price movement. Last but not least , ADA‚Äôs latest pump could be attributed to the speculations about an upcoming partnership between Ripple and Cardano. The leaders of the two entities have held discussions in the past few months. Most recently, Cardano‚Äôs founder Charles Hoskinson hinted the possible collaboration could involve the integration of Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already had a call with the RLUSD people. We are actively talking.‚Äù ADA Predictions Many market observers think Cardano‚Äôs native token has yet to reach new peaks. X user Ssebi claimed the asset had formed a ‚Äúbig W pattern‚Äù on its price chart. According to them, ADA is headed toward $1.20 because it broke the $1.02 depicted resistance. Others who weighed in lately include Dan Gambardello and Altcoin Daily. The former believes ADA has ‚Äúone of the most bullish weekly pattern setups in crypto,‚Äù envisioning a potential price explosion¬†to as high as $7. Altcoin Daily made optimistic forecasts about numerous cryptocurrencies at the start of the year, predicting that ADA‚Äôs valuation might reach $6.45 sometime in 2025. Meanwhile, Cardano is poised for significant advancements over the next 12 months that could drive its token‚Äôs price higher .

Bitcoin (BTC) may be the powerhouse, but altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and the fast-rising BigBossInu are catching fire. These cryptocurrencies are positioned to deliver exponential gains as the market rallies. BigBossInu Soars with Its Explosive Presale Big Boss Inu stands tall as one of the top 5 portfolio picks ready to deliver a 12,000% gain frenzy .

A break above $0.67 could push XRP toward $0.74, while a drop below $0.56 may lead to declines towards $0.46. The ongoing market sentiment will likely determine its next move‚Äã. Bitcoin (BTC) is performing well, trading around $95,928. Bitcoin continues to benefit from positive market trends, and analysts expect it could push toward $115,000 if momentum continues. Kaspa (KAS) is showing strong potential due to its high transaction speeds and scalability, currently being recognized as one of the promising altcoins for the next bull run. KAS has been gaining attention from investors looking for innovative blockchain solutions‚Äã. Polkadot (DOT) is trading around $6.22 with support levels holding. If the bulls can push it above the 20-day moving average, DOT could see a recovery towards $10. Otherwise, it may face further consolidation‚Äã. >>> Conclusion: As the crypto market gears up for its next bull run, altcoins like BigBossInu, Bitcoin, Kaspa, and Polkadot are positioned for explosive growth. BigBossInu‚Äôs presale has ignited investor interest, and its ambitious roadmap indicates strong growth potential.

TAO Price Plunges Below $399 & XRP Target Set At $2.70,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-offers-300-bonus-ahead-of-10-cex-listings-tao-price-plunges-below-399-xrp-target-set-at-2-70/,"Crypto traders are zeroing in as the market is seeing shifts in vastly different directions. Bittensor (TAO) price has slipped below $399, sparking speculation about a major rebound. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is drawing attention with its bullish target eyeing $2.70, fueled by a key liquidation zone. But BlockDAG (BDAG ) is securing its position as a presale giant by making bold moves with its massive LAUNCH300 bonus, which offers a staggering 300% boost on all BDAG purchases. This offer drops just before BlockDAG‚Äôs upcoming listings on 10 major centralized exchanges (CEX) and its rapidly approaching mainnet launch. As BDAG‚Äôs presale surges past $180 million, experts are calling it the next big crypto ready for explosive growth. The race to capitalize on this rare opportunity is on, and BlockDAG‚Äôs momentum shows no signs of slowing. TAO Price Crashes Below $399: Will It Rebound or Sink Deeper? The TAO price has kept traders on edge after recently falling below the critical $399 mark, now trading at $397. This dip has heightened concerns and anticipation in the market. Renewed optimism following the launch of the dTAO Testnet on January 11 is providing some support. This significant development by the OpenTensor team aims to refine tokenomics and governance, advancing the project toward full decentralization. Historically, spikes in social dominance around TAO have preceded strong demand surges, suggesting that the current increase in discussions could drive the Bittensor price higher. If support stabilizes above $397, analysts suggest the TAO price could rebound by 50%, potentially reaching $650 in the short term. However, continued declines below this threshold could risk a sharp fall toward $250. XRP Target Set at $2.70, Liquidation Zone Comes into Play The $2.70 XRP target has been a major focus for traders aiming to capitalize on its bullish movement. Recent analysis highlights a significant liquidation zone at $2.60, which could trigger market makers to push prices higher. Ali_Charts , a prominent crypto analyst, noted, ‚ÄúA lot of $XRP shorts were opened at $2.60, creating a substantial liquidation zone that market makers may try to grab.‚Äù This insight has fueled speculation about the XRP target reaching $2.70 or even $2.90 in the near term. Positive market sentiment combined with Bitcoin‚Äôs post-halving rally has further supported the bullish XRP target, keeping it at the forefront for traders looking for opportunities in 2025. BlockDAG LAUNCH300: 300% More Coins On Purchases? BlockDAG is capturing massive attention with its record-breaking LAUNCH300 bonus, offering a massive 300% bonus on all BDAG purchases‚Äîthe largest in its history. This unprecedented offer arrives as BlockDAG prepares to debut on 10 major CEX Exchanges and finalize its highly anticipated mainnet launch this year. Currently priced at just $0.0248 in batch 27, BlockDAG has raised over $180 million and sold an impressive 17.8 billion coins since its crypto presale began. Early backers have already seen a 2,380% ROI, creating even more excitement around what‚Äôs next. The LAUNCH300 bonus provides a rare opportunity for both seasoned buyers and newcomers to significantly grow their BDAG holdings. It not only rewards existing supporters but also draws in new buyers who recognize BlockDAG‚Äôs potential as the next big crypto. Upcoming exchange listings for BDAG will lead to even greater visibility, more buyers, higher demand, and stronger market confidence‚Äîall of which will accelerate its growth and significantly raise its value. This has created a sense of urgency for those looking to get in early. As presale batches continue to sell out quickly, the window to secure BDAG coins at this price point is closing fast! Decision Time: Which Is the Next Big Crypto? As Bittensor wrestles to regain footing after slipping below $399 and XRP eyes a surge past its $2.60 liquidation zone, traders are watching both assets for potential rebounds. TAO‚Äôs recent dip has raised concerns, but the dTAO Testnet launch could reignite interest and push prices toward the $650 mark. Meanwhile, XRP‚Äôs bullish target of $2.70‚Äì$2.90 is gaining traction as market makers circle key price levels. Yet, despite the speculation surrounding TAO and XRP, BlockDAG is the crypto traders are talking about this week. Its record-breaking LAUNCH300 bonus offers a massive 300% boost on BDAG purchases. Pair that with upcoming listings on 10 major exchanges and BlockDAG is quickly being hailed as the next big crypto primed for exponential growth.

While established giants like Bitcoin and Shiba Inu have already achieved monumental growth, newer projects like Doge Uprising are capturing investor attention with their potential for massive returns. Here‚Äôs a closer look at how crypto presales can be a game-changer for investors and why Doge Uprising is making waves. The Power of Crypto Presales Crypto presales are an entry point for investors to purchase tokens at the lowest possible price before public launch. These early phases often feature discounted rates, incentivizing adoption and building strong communities. Historically, many investors who entered projects during presales reaped significant rewards. For instance, those who invested $1,000 in Ethereum during its presale in 2014 saw their holdings skyrocket to over $3 million at its all-time high. Similarly, Shiba Inu‚Äôs early backers turned small investments into life-changing wealth. Presales provide more than just financial upside‚Äîthey allow participants to engage with the project‚Äôs vision early on, securing governance rights, community rewards, and often exclusive NFTs or tokens. With Doge Uprising, the opportunity is no different, but its narrative and ecosystem elevate it above the competition. Why Doge Uprising Stands Out Doge Uprising has emerged as one of the most exciting presales of 2025, raising over $50,000 in its first hour. Here‚Äôs why: Innovative Ecosystem: Doge Uprising combines meme culture with advanced blockchain technology, offering staking rewards, gaming integration, and ultra-rare Doge Mecha NFTs. Immersive Storytelling: Set in a dystopian future, the project creates a compelling narrative that attracts gamers and investors alike. Presale Accessibility: With 60% of its token supply allocated to the presale, Doge Uprising ensures early adopters benefit the most. If Doge Uprising achieves even a fraction of the success of Shiba Inu, early investors could see substantial returns. A $1,000 investment during the presale, if multiplied 10x, would yield $10,000‚Äîa lucrative prospect for those willing to take the plunge. Bitcoin and Shiba Inu: Established Giants Bitcoin remains the undisputed leader in the crypto market, often referred to as digital gold. Its role as a store of value and hedge against inflation has cemented its position. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs massive market cap makes it challenging to achieve 10x growth today. Shiba Inu, on the other hand, exemplifies the power of community-driven meme coins. In 2021, its meteoric rise made headlines, turning modest investments into millions. While Shiba Inu continues to innovate with its Shibarium Layer 2 solution, its growth potential may not match the exponential opportunities of newer projects like Doge Uprising. Blockchain Technology: The Foundation of Growth The success of any cryptocurrency relies on the strength of its underlying technology. Doge Uprising leverages the Ethereum blockchain‚Äôs robust infrastructure, ensuring scalability, security, and compatibility with the broader crypto ecosystem. This foundation positions it for seamless integration into DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and gaming applications. Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof-of-Work model and Shiba Inu‚Äôs expanding ecosystem highlight how blockchain innovation drives value. However, Doge Uprising‚Äôs focus on utility and engagement gives it an edge in appealing to a broader audience. Seize the 10x Opportunity Crypto presales represent a unique opportunity for investors to achieve significant gains by entering projects early. While Bitcoin and Shiba Inu have proven their worth as market leaders, Doge Uprising offers the excitement of a fresh narrative, cutting-edge technology, and a passionate community. For those seeking the next big thing in crypto, Doge Uprising‚Äôs presale is an opportunity to explore. With its innovative ecosystem and potential for exponential growth, it might just be the secret to unlocking 10x returns in 2025.

The latest purchase comes from NYSE-listed Genius Group (GNS). On Jan. 10, GNS reported increasing its bitcoin holding to $35 million, which was ahead of its scheduled target of $120 million. In the process, it acquired 372 BTC at an average price of $94,047 per bitcoin. The first announcement came on Nov. 12, when it announced its ""Bitcoin-first"" strategy. On Tuesday, GNS also reported a rights offering , allowing shareholders to purchase additional shares at discounted prices. If fully subscribed, the rights offering could generate $33 million. GNS founder and CEO Roger Hamilton intends to buy join in the rights offering and buy 500,000 shares. The firm is also pursuing loan finances to accumulate bitcoin. Shares of GNS closed 7% higher on Tuesday. Apart from GNS, Nasdaq-listed Ming Shing Group (MSW) , a wet trades works service provider, also purchased 500 BTC at an average price of $94,375 per bitcoin. MSW shares were up 43% higher year-to-date. The new wave of bitcoin treasury adoption surges ahead with four publicly traded companies announcing bitcoin buys and seven companies announcing a strategy, but no acquisition.

The asset saw support from ongoing whale buying, as well as high-volume trading between top wallets. AIXBT is the most active AI agent token as of January 15, recently reaching a new peak above $0.75. AI agent tokens show a pattern of turnover coming from top wallets, as funds flow to spark the next rally. AIXBT rallied to a new peak amid new whale buying. | Source: CoinGecko In the past day, a dedicated whale moved in to accumulate AIXBT, still holding most of the tokens. The whale invested $3.03M into AIXBT, adding to the previous holdings. In addition to the single notable buyer, AIXBT has seen clusters of activity, becoming more active as the token rallied. The wallet has AIXBT as the main holding, with a peak valuation above $5.61M . The whale also owns GAME and VIRTUAL tokens. The wallet‚Äôs buying pattern uses repeated transaction through the Uniswap universal router, to build up reserves of AIXBT while swapping out of GAME and VIRTUAL. The purchases are happening every few minutes, using a day-long strategy to roll over from the two previously hot tokens. AIXBT did not rally entirely by itself, but as part of a larger trend for some of the top AI agent personalities. Other AI agent tokens in the green included FREYSA, ChainGPT, and AVA. Daily growth is also happening for AI16Z and ELIZA, as traders seek out potential platforms with utility, in addition to the content and personality. Are whales affecting the AIXBT rally? The recent AIXBT rally is seen as relatively risky and possibly organized by whales. The token is among top AI agents, more liquid than newly launched tokens, but still easily swayed with large-scale orders. One of the factors boosting AIXBT is its trading activity, which is concentrated on Uniswap V3 , where whale orders are also transparent. AIXBT also relies on Binance for over 36% of its trading activity, making the token more reactive compared to those that still depend on Raydium. However, DEXs remain a good source of accumulation for whales. AIXBT is also trying to gain users and show its value as a venue for reliable market information. AIXBT is one of the leading agents of Virtuals Protocol, which relies on regular content creation through AI-based market analysis. However, the short-term price action is still seen as risky, causing a deeper drawdown if the buying stops. The AI agent space is still trying to retain its gains and bounce off the recent lows. The sector as a whole regained value, bouncing from a low of $11B to over $14.66B. AI agents are seen as one of the most promising narratives for 2025, but there is no consensus on how fast or sustainable their rally would be. Additionally, whales and retail are still seeking the hottest tokens. AIXBT has the advantage of a Binance listing and more active social media presence, which also leads to more dramatic pumps. The token has not entered a cycle where the price dips temporarily, inviting buyers to make use of the recovery. AIXBT builds up user count in the past month AIXBT hosted around 6.64K users in the past month, not counting engagement through social media. The growth for the AIXBT terminal has been slow, as the product is rolled out for testing. Part of the AIXBT rally may be due to the expectation for tiered access coming soon. Massive spike in market cap and mind share for @aixbt_agent . Today, only ~250 people have access to the terminal ($384,000), which is 0.16% of $AIXBT holders. Next week, tiered access is being rolled out. If the terminal is made widely available and impresses, expect even more‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/zUDXn4QK80 ‚Äî Nick Garcia (@NickDGarcia) January 14, 2025 AIXBT has been growing its user base since November, standing out among other Virtuals Protocol personalities. Instead of relying on simple engagement, AIXBT aims to turn into one of the main information and analysis sources for the crypto market. The protocol taps the trend for tokenized information apps, including Arkham and Bubblemaps. If the information and analysis of AIXBT gains influence, the token may be a proxy for the app‚Äôs success. In the short term, AIXBT remains a speculative-interest token, which may repeat the success of VIRTUAL. AIXBT has the advantage of gaining a presence on both Solana and Base, potentially gaining users with the lowest possible transaction cost.

Deze ochtend ligt de bekende altcoin op $1,05, maar dat is mogelijk nog niet alles. Het optimisme van investeerders kan namelijk zorgen voor een breakout boven $1,10. Een breakout boven dit niveau maakt een stijging richting $1,74 mogelijk, wat gelijk staat aan een koersstijging van 64%. Kan het groeiende optimisme van investeerders Cardano omhoog lanceren? Cardano breekt opnieuw door $1 Na een sterke daling op maandag, zagen we dat Bitcoin gisteren een sterk herstel maakte en een bodem op $96k vestigde. Het optimisme van de markt is overgeslagen op Cardano holders. De Cardano koers is vannacht weer boven $1 gebroken en lijkt deze ochtend nog verder te klimmen. Het aantal short-term holders dat klaarstaat om Cardano te dumpen na een kleine stijging is gekrompen. Dit is te zien aan de Mean Coin Age indicator, die aangeeft hoelang Cardano wordt vastgehouden door de gemiddelde investeerder. De Mean Coin Age, of MCA, is boven 540 gestegen en lijkt hiermee een nieuwe uptrend te beginnen. Als Cardano holders blijven vasthouden en de crypto markt stijgt daarnaast verder, is de kans op een breakout boven $1,10 nog hoger. Kan Cardano meeliften op Bitcoin? Een van de plannen van Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson, was om Bitcoin bruikbaar te maken op de Cardano blockchain. Dit is een ingewikkeld proces om voor elkaar te krijgen, maar indien succesvol, kan het Cardano een grote boost geven. De blockchain van Bitcoin zelf is erg gedateerd en traag, daarom is interoperabiliteit een belangrijke use-case waarmee Bitcoin met de tijd mee kan gaan. UPDATE: Cardano integrates Bitcoin to boost multi-asset interoperability, enhancing the DeFi ecosystem and unified wallet experience. pic.twitter.com/Jz6NHzNDM6 ‚Äî Cardano Intern (@Cardano_Intern) January 14, 2025 Uiteraard is Cardano niet de eerste blockchain waarop Bitcoin gebruikt kan worden, toch kan het de altcoin een boost geven. De decentralisatie van Cardano maakt de blockchain interessant om Bitcoin op te gebruiken. ADA koers verwachting ‚Äì Wanneer gaat Cardano stijgen? De Cardano koers is sinds maandag al aan het klimmen en lijkt vandaag nog niet te stoppen. ADA is momenteel een $1,04 waard en kan binnenkort zijn resistance bij $1,140 testen. Een breakout boven dit niveau kan leiden tot een gigantische 64% pump naar $1,74. Wel ligt er nog een mogelijke resistance in de weg rond $1,33, gebaseerd op de piek van begin december. De groeiende interesse in crypto, in combinatie met de groeiende interesse in Cardano zelf, kan leiden tot een grote pump in de komende weken. Het trading volume van Cardano ligt vandaag rond $1,5 miljard, vergelijkbaar met het niveau van gisteren. Dit betekent dat de interesse in Cardano nog steeds hoog is en dat een stijging naar $1,10 of hoger vandaag nog mogelijk is. Als hierna een pump van 64% volgt, kan dit in enkele dagen na deze breakout gebeuren. Realistisch gezien is het wel belangrijk dat Bitcoin zijn huidige niveau behoudt of verbetert. Als BTC bijvoorbeeld opnieuw boven $100k breekt, is de kans nog groter dat Cardano naar zijn volgende resistance klimt. De inauguratie van Trump op 20 januari is een belangrijke katalysator om in de gaten te houden. Die dag zelf en de opkomende dagen kunnen erg volatiel worden voor crypto. In de week van 20 januari is het mogelijk dat Cardano zelfs boven $2 stijgt, een pump van zo‚Äôn 90%. Welke altcoins gaan exploderen in volgende crypto rally? De stijging van Bitcoin die we deze week zien is niet de gekte die losbarst; het is investeerders die zich voorbereiden op de gekte. De aanpassingen die Trump vanaf 20 januari kan maken aan het Amerikaanse systeem, kunnen crypto een enorme boost geven. Uiteraard zal niet alleen Cardano hiervan profiteren. Hieronder kijken we naar drie alternatieven voor Cardano die potentie hebben om veel harder te stijgen als de crypto markt opnieuw explodeert in activiteit. Deze kleine crypto‚Äôs dragen meer risico dan Cardano, maar kunnen nog voor een vaste lage prijs gekocht worden tijdens de presale. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is een van de hotste nieuwe meme coins op het moment. De presale van $WEPE heeft namelijk meer dan $48 miljoen opgehaald sinds zijn lancering in december. Inmiddels wordt de meme coin overspoeld door aandacht en toont daarom de meeste potentie om te stijgen na de presale. De meeste meme coins weten aandacht te krijgen, omdat traders enkel speculeren over de prijs. Wall Street Pepe gaat een stapje verder, want door de token vast te houden, krijg je toegang tot een exclusieve community. Binnen deze community word je voorzien van elite trading inzichten, die wellicht voor nog meer winst kunnen zorgen. Grinding. Stacking. Focused on the green. üê∏ ‚öîÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/W0MbgCIoaL ‚Äî Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) January 14, 2025 De community is exclusief voor token holders, wat betekent dat als de trading inzichten van hoge kwaliteit, de vraag naar $WEPE door het plafond zal gaan. In zo‚Äôn geval betaal je erg veel voor $WEPE, maar vandaag heeft hij nog een vaste lage prijs van $0,00036648 per token.

Donald Trump ‚Äòs inauguration is less than a week away, and analysts are now bracing for ‚Äúheightened volatility‚Äù in the crypto market. Singapore-based QCP Capital suggested in its latest report that, similar to 2017, Trump‚Äôs actions are already shaking global markets before he officially takes office on Jan. 20. Inflation is still a major concern for the U.S. economy. While job growth exceeded expectations, with non-farm payrolls coming in at +256,000 versus the expected +165,000, inflation remains a worry. ‚ÄúWhile CPI appears to be moderating above the 2% target‚Ä¶market participants still expect December‚Äôs CPI to come in higher than the previous reading,‚Äù the analysts warn. You might also like: Donald Trump Jr. joins Kalshi as a strategic advisor Additionally, Trump‚Äôs planned tariffs on China are fueling those inflation fears, though they may be rolled out gradually instead of immediately. QCP pointed out that markets are now pricing in just two rate cuts for 2025 and 2026, as bond yields rise. ‚ÄúExpect heightened volatility before and after the inauguration as markets digest and adjust to a new term under Trump.‚Äù QCP Capital Despite the uncertainty, there‚Äôs some hope for crypto investors. QCP notes that Trump‚Äôs administration has crypto-friendly officials, and ‚Äúrumors that Trump will enact wide-ranging and crypto-friendly executive orders provide a short-term tailwind, potentially supporting prices.‚Äù Still, analysts are cautious.

Having raised an impressive $10.4 million during its presale at $0.00525 per token, Lightchain AI is capturing the attention of both seasoned investors and industry experts. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at what sets this altcoin apart and why it‚Äôs poised for success.

ZEN, currently priced at $25.36, has experienced a significant 24-hour price increase of 19.5%, trading within a day‚Äôs range of $20.92 to $26.53. This surge comes as iDEGEN‚Äôs presale , which has already amassed over $16.4 million, nears its end. Horizen has appointed new executives Horizen‚Äôs recent price explosion isn‚Äôt merely a random market fluctuation but is closely tied to strategic developments within the company. On January 14th, Horizen Labs announced the appointment of two new executives, signalling a commitment to expand its influence, especially in the Asian market. Gwendolyn Regina, appointed as Regional Vice President for Asia, brings extensive experience from her tenure at Binance, while Andy Bryant, the new Chief Strategy Officer, comes with a rich background in blockchain and fintech. This leadership overhaul comes at a pivotal time as Horizen prepares for the Mainnet launch of its Horizen 2.0 blockchain in the first half of 2025. The anticipation around the upcoming Mainnet launch and the leadership overhaul seems to have catalyzed investor interest, driving the ZEN price upward. Furthermore, Horizen‚Äôs focus on zero-knowledge cryptography and its collaboration with industry leaders like Yuga Labs and Animoca Brands have positioned it as a tech innovator, potentially attracting more investment and attention to its token. The iDEGEN presale gains momentum as the token nears listing The correlation between Horizen‚Äôs market performance and the iDEGEN presale momentum might not be direct, but the broader context of market sentiment towards innovative blockchain projects certainly plays a role. As iDEGEN gains traction with its unique community-driven AI model, it sparks discussions and excitement, which can spill over into an increased interest in related or similarly innovative projects like Horizen. iDEGEN has introduced a novel concept where an AI, born from the community‚Äôs interactions on X , evolves without human interference into what could be the next big thing in memecoins or beyond. The presale‚Äôs pricing model adds to its allure, reflecting real-time market demand in a way that traditional presales do not. This system not only keeps potential investors engaged but also creates a buzz that can elevate the profile of other cryptocurrencies, including Horizen. The excitement around iDEGEN isn‚Äôt just about potential financial gains but also about being part of an experiment in AI autonomy and community control. This resonates with a segment of the crypto community that values not just the technology but the philosophy of decentralization and community governance. As iDEGEN learns and grows, it could redefine what a meme coin can be, potentially influencing the trajectory of other projects like Horizen by setting new standards for community engagement and project evolution.

Hill addressed the importance of encouraging innovation while protecting consumers, saying, ‚ÄúTogether, our Committee will work to craft a regulatory framework that maintains America as a leader in innovation while protecting consumers and investors, right-sizing the regulatory system including for community banks, and ensuring our agencies are held accountable to their statutorily directed missions.‚Äù Emmer, an advocate for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, has continuously mentioned the importance of decentralization. ‚ÄúWith Gary Gensler confined to the waste bin of Washington, we have an excellent opportunity to ensure that the future of digital assets is guided by Americans,‚Äù Emmer said in a January 15 X post.

His cooperation with other crypto-friendly congressmen, such as Congressman Bryan Steil, will add to the subcommittee‚Äôs ability to develop a forward-thinking legislative framework. Subcommittee aims to explore crypto, fintech and AI The crypto and AI sectors have long been troubled by legislative inconsistency, particularly in the US, which restricts innovation and investment opportunities. Emmer‚Äôs appointment marks an enhanced focus on partnership between the public and private sectors. His track record is nothing short of a unique balance between innovation and security which is essential as new technologies become more integrated into financial systems. The subcommittee that Emmer will serve as vice chairman for was created back in 2023 to oversee the development and use of cryptocurrencies and other related financial technologies. It also aims to examine the use and development of AI in the financial sector. Tom Emmer‚Äôs appointment might positively impact crypto regulations The intense focus on developing a legislative framework for cryptocurrency assets points out the increased interest from lawmakers to provide clarity in the evolving crypto space. With President-elect Donald Trump ready to take the White House on January 20, some analysts predict fast executive actions will be taken in the US to regulate digital assets. A strong and innovative framework could help the United States become a global leader in cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, and deliver on Trump‚Äôs earlier promise to make the US the ‚Äúcrypto capital‚Äù of the world. Earlier this week, in an interview with ABC News, Emmer said that he would help implement Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly agenda.

At press time, XRP was trading at $2.83, a gain of almost 10% in the past day. In the weekly timeframe, the token has surged by over 20%. This short-term momentum has been characterized by significant buying interest, pushing the market cap to $163 billion‚Äîan increase of nearly $20 billion in the last 24 hours. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP‚Äôs path to $3 The current rally can be tied to several factors, with regulatory developments appearing to play a significant role. For instance, XRP is gaining momentum ahead of Gary Gensler‚Äôs exit from the SEC. Notably, the regulator has long been viewed as a barrier to cryptocurrency sector growth, and the XRP community, in particular, has been at odds with Gensler following the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against Ripple. Additionally, Sean Dawson, head of research at the on-chain protocol Derive, believes the ongoing rally could be linked to the possibility of an XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) being listed later this year. The general cryptocurrency market sentiment remains bullish , bolstered by Donald Trump‚Äôs upcoming inauguration. Trump is expected to sign executive orders on crypto on his first day in office, potentially a bullish development for XRP. With these fundamentals in play, one lingering question is whether XRP can reclaim the $3 level, viewed as a major juncture toward triggering the asset‚Äôs next record high. To this end, XRP‚Äôs technical setup supports the possibility of the asset hitting $3 in the coming days. One outlook was shared by pseudonymous X analyst LordOfAlts , who noted that XRP is breaking out of a descending parallel channel, signaling a bullish shift after weeks of consolidation. The breakout, marked by sustained higher lows, has strong momentum, pushing the Ripple token toward the $3 target. XRP price analysis chart.

The expert projects $3.25 (at the 1.272 Fib extension) as the next target, supported by strong bases at $2.24 (the 0.382 Fib) and $2.47 (0.618 Fib). XRP price analysis chart. Source: MikybullCrypto XRP‚Äôs whale transactions impact Meanwhile, whale activity seems to be driving momentum, and the sustainability of this transaction might be central to XRP hitting $3. In this line, data shared by prominent on-chain analyst Ali Martinez on January 15 shows 341 transactions exceeding $1 million in the past 24 hours. XRP whale transactions. Source: Santiment/Ali_charts At the same time, previous Finbold reports shared analysts‚Äô predictions of higher XRP targets in the coming days. For instance, The Great Mattsby forecasts XRP is ‚Äújust days‚Äù away from an all-time high breakout, while World of Charts predicts XRP could hit $4 in the ‚Äúnext couple of days.‚Äù On a more ambitious note, technical analyst Gert van Lagen speculates that if XRP replicates its 2017-2018 cycle performance, the token‚Äôs next target could be as high as $100 . Overall, XRP‚Äôs short-term structure looks strong. The price is well above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.25 and 200-day SMA of $1.00, signaling bullish momentum. However, risks of a pullback remain. The 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) at 65.41 is nearing overbought levels, while a Fear & Greed Index of 70 (Greed) suggests optimism may wane. Volatility at 5.83% also leaves XRP vulnerable to sharp price swings.

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President crypto project, World Liberty Financial, has grabbed the attention of the crypto community with $4.8M in unrealised losses and significant transactions. Let‚Äôs explore the project‚Äôs journey and its implications. Ready? Dive in! WLFI‚Äôs Crypto Journey: From Launch to Big Bets WLFI, which was launched in September, made its first crypto purchase in December. Among the cryptos it initially purchased were prominent cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, AAVE and LINK. Later, it added some sensational crypto like Wrapped Bitcoin Price Chart, ONDO and Ethena. In the last month, Ethereum has displayed a change of -18.9%, Aave (-26.2%), LINK (-33.3%), WBTC (-7.4%), ONDO (-44.4%), and Ethena (-35.8%). $4.8M Unrealised Losses: The Market Impact on WLFI Reports suggest that Trump‚Äôs project has suffered a severe unrealised loss of $4.8M. As per reports, the key reason that has led to this massive unrealised loss is market uncertainty. Reports reveal that ETH, WBTC, AAVE LINK and ONDO are the primary cryptos which have contributed to the massive decline. WLFI‚Äôs Suspicious Transactions: What You Should Know A recent post by Lookonchain reveals that WLFI recently exchanged some of its WBTC for ETH and USDC for WBTC. Though the suspicious transfers triggered serious concerns, the leadership of Trump‚Äôs project, denouncing all speculations suggesting the possible commencement of a selling spree, termed them routine movements. Trump's World Liberty( @worldlibertyfi ) exchanged 103 $WBTC ($9.89M) for 3,075 $ETH at a rate of $0.03354 and deposited 18,536 $ETH ($59.8M) into #CoinbasePrime . Afterward, World Liberty spent 1.7M $USDT to buy 17.62 $WBTC at $96,491.

In conclusion, Trump‚Äôs WLFI crypto venture showcases resilience amid market volatility. With $4.8M in unrealised losses and significant transactions, the project‚Äôs strategic moves highlight its long-term confidence in the crypto industry, signalling that the game has just begun for World Liberty Financial. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The announcement, made on January 14, highlights Tom Emmer‚Äôs pivotal role in shaping policies aimed at fostering U.S. leadership in emerging technologies. ‚ÄúWith President Trump in the White House, and Gary Gensler confined to the waste bin of Washington, we have an excellent opportunity to ensure that the future of digital assets is guided by Americans, with American values,‚Äù Tom Emmer stated on social media shortly after his appointment. The subcommittee, established in 2023, is tasked with overseeing the rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets, exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and financial services, and ensuring a balanced regulatory approach. Chairman French Hill expressed confidence in the leadership team, emphasizing the committee‚Äôs focus on crafting a regulatory framework that safeguards innovation while protecting consumers and investors. Bipartisan Focus on Regulatory Frameworks The momentum behind creating comprehensive crypto regulations continues to grow. Congressman Bryan Steil, recently appointed chair of the Financial Services Subcommittee, echoed similar sentiments last year, calling it ‚Äúimperative‚Äù for lawmakers to address regulatory clarity for digital assets. French Hill has identified establishing a clear regulatory structure for cryptocurrencies as a top priority for 2025. This aligns with the broader objectives of the House and Senate, which aim to address pressing issues before President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration on January 20. Speculation is rife that executive orders targeting digital asset policies could emerge soon after the administration takes office. Industry leaders are closely watching for signals that may shape the next chapter of the U.S. crypto market. Tom Emmer Discusses Trump‚Äôs Economic Agenda In a recent interview, Tom Emmer outlined his commitment to advancing Trump‚Äôs economic agenda , which includes addressing inflation, excessive spending, and global stability. He also emphasized the importance of fostering innovation in financial technology as a cornerstone of America‚Äôs economic future. This appointment marks a crucial step for U.S. crypto policy at a time when global competition for digital asset leadership intensifies.

While altcoins also accompanied the recovery in Bitcoin, Santiment said that XRP and Ethereum were the altcoins that attracted the most attention. Listing the reasons for XRP‚Äôs trend, Santiment said that there is increasing optimism regarding its potential use in banking and financial transactions, increasing expectations for further increases, and XRP ETF speculations. He said that the introduction of Soneium (an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain solution developed by Sony) was effective in making Ethereum a trend. ‚ÄúXRP and Ethereum were the most popular altcoins in the cryptocurrency market on Tuesday.

Among them, there are a few ERC 20 tokens that are showing potential for further growth going forward, and one of them might just outshine the rest. Ergo, let‚Äôs take a closer look at these top ERC 20 tokens. 1. Polygon (POL) Polygon has been facing multiple setbacks over the past few months, despite undergoing a major upgrade. Nonetheless, considering its utility, popularity, and past successes, it remains one of the top ERC 20 tokens in the market. As the market turned bullish, the Polygon price reached $0.445 as its value increased by over 6% in the last 24 hours‚Äîinstilling hope for a full-fledged recovery in the coming days. Last year, Polygon pushed an update, which upgraded its native token MATIC to POL. During that time, several expected POL to explode, but the opposite happened. However, the recent push once again can stir up bullish sentiment around the token. In fact, POL‚Äôs daily chart points out a bullish pennant pattern. At press time, the token was testing the support of the pattern. In the event of a breakout, POL might become one of the top gaining ERC 20 tokens, with an expected surge towards $0.7 in the near term. Source: TradingView 2. Pikamoon (PIKA) While Polygon is a mainstream crypto, considering its market cap, Pikamoon (PIKA) is an emerging ERC 20 token that bags immense potential. This is the case, as it offers multiple services that can attract a large chunk of crypto enthusiasts and, in turn, propel the token‚Äôs price up. Pikamoon provides a number of benefits within the NFT ecosystem. Pikamoon is creating one of the most advanced GameFi metaverses in the world. To do this, the platform emphasizes immersive 3D graphics, artwork, and gameplay. On top of that, Dreva Metaverse custom experiences and competitive esports venues are exclusively available to Pikamoon NFT holders. Analysis revealed that investors are actually considering buying the token. PIKA‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick‚Äîa sign of rising buying pressure. Whenever buying activity increases, it suggests that the possibility of a price rise is high. Thanks to investors interest, PIKA price already surged by 4% in the last 24 hours and was trading at $0.0003851 with a market cap of over $6.7 million. Source: TradingView 3. PEPE PEPE, one of the most popular meme coins, also gained bullish momentum, which can be attributed to the current market condition. To be precise, PEPE price witnessed an over 6% daily price hike after a 14% weekly decline, making it trade at $0.0000173. As per IntoTheBlock‚Äôs data , after the latest volatility in the meme coin‚Äôs price, nearly 68% of the total number of PEPE addresses remained in profit. Despite having no utility, the meme coin might outperform other ERC 20 tokens because of its loyal fan base. Like Pikamoon, buying pressure on PEPE was also rising, which was evident from its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which moved slightly northward. However, the technical indicator MACD remained bearish‚Äîa challenge PEPE must overcome to sustain its uptrend. Source: TradingView 4. AAVE Pretty much outpacing the rest, AAVE is showcasing commendable performance with its 10% daily gains. At press time, AAVE price was at $292.38 with a market cap of over $4.3 billion. In addition to the latest price hike, AAVE‚Äôs trading volume also spiked by 45% during the same period. Generally, a rise in trading volume amidst a price increase legitimizes the uptrend, hinting at a continued bull rally. Interestingly, the token‚Äôs price has already rebounded after touching the lower limit of the Bollinger Bands. Going forward, it faces a resistance near its 20-day simple moving average (SMA). A successful breakout above that level can potentially make AAVE one of the top gaining ERC 20 tokens in the coming days. Source: TradingView Conclusion The change in market conditions is pushing most crypto prices up. These aforementioned ERC 20 tokens are showing immense growth potential. While these major tokens continue to grow, investors must not miss out on Pikamoon (PIKA) because it can outperform others. Therefore, investors should keep a close eye on PIKA‚Äôs price movement, as this might be the right time to accumulate the token at a discounted rate and, in turn, enjoy other benefits that come along with it.

Speaking to the New York Association for Business Economics, Janet praised decisions made under Biden‚Äôs watch as transformative. According to her, the U.S. economy is outperforming its global peers and defying gloomy predictions. ‚ÄúAll policy choices entail tradeoffs, but the Biden administration made sound decisions that set the economy on a strong course,‚Äù she said. Janet stood firm, backing up her claim with data and outcomes, not fluff. While admitting inflation stung everyday Americans post-pandemic, Janet argued the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan stopped the U.S. from spiraling into chaos. She said, ‚ÄúThe strength in the labor market and a rapid drop in unemployment helped us avoid ‚Äòlabor market scarring.‚Äô‚Äù That phrase, a favorite among economists, refers to the long-term damage caused when people stay unemployed for too long. Under Biden‚Äôs policies, that scenario didn‚Äôt play out. Labor market resilience under Biden Janet, a labor economist to her core, has always been obsessed with jobs. She pointed out that the administration‚Äôs laser focus on employment paid off big time. The unemployment rate plunged rapidly, allowing people to get back to work without the long-term scars that could cripple future economic output. She wasn‚Äôt blind to criticism, either. Critics of the American Rescue Plan have slammed it for fueling inflation, but Janet brushed that off, saying the benefits of the plan dwarfed its drawbacks. Her argument? The economy bounced back faster, workers stayed engaged, and the foundation of the labor market held strong. It wasn‚Äôt just about jobs, though. The plan was designed to help Americans who were on the brink, and Janet made it clear that leaving them to fend for themselves was not an option. The quick recovery, she emphasized, showed how critical it was to act decisively. Global challenges: China, Russia, and economic warfare Janet didn‚Äôt just deal with domestic issues. Her role required her to navigate an absolute minefield of international crises. From tense relations trade with China to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, she was in the thick of it all. On China, Janet stepped into a mess left by Trump‚Äôs trade wars and other incidents, including a spy balloon saga that only added fuel to the fire. Despite the chaos, she managed to reestablish communication with Beijing, calling it ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù to let ties with the world‚Äôs second-largest economy deteriorate further. ‚ÄúObviously, we don‚Äôt agree with China about a lot of matters, and we have our grievances,‚Äù Janet said, making no attempt to sugarcoat the tension. Her efforts included high-stakes trips to China, where she made some headway. On one trip, senior Chinese officials even brought her a book she‚Äôd written about the U.S. economy to sign. But while diplomacy helped reopen lines of communication, Janet didn‚Äôt hold back from criticizing China‚Äôs manufacturing subsidies, which she said hurt American businesses. Then there was Russia. Janet led the charge to impose U.S.-led sanctions after Russia invaded Ukraine. These sanctions hit Moscow hard, curbing oil revenues and freezing assets. Yet, despite the heavy financial toll, the measures couldn‚Äôt entirely derail Russia‚Äôs economy or its military ambitions. Still, Janet saw value in multilateral efforts. She worked to bring allies on board, saying, ‚ÄúWe have worked hard to rebuild our relationships with our allies and pursue objectives to the maximum extent jointly.‚Äù One particularly tense moment came when a cyberattack hit the U.S. branch of China‚Äôs largest bank, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. The attack, traced to a Russian criminal gang, threatened to disrupt global financial markets. Janet acted fast, assuring Chinese officials that the U.S. was not behind the crisis and was working to resolve the situation before it spiraled out of control. Biden‚Äôs economic vision and Janet‚Äôs legacy Biden hasn‚Äôt been shy about framing his policies as a departure from his predecessor. Speaking recently, he said the U.S. was ‚Äústronger than four years ago,‚Äù citing economic stability and resilience after what he called ‚Äúthe worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.‚Äù Janet shares those sentiments, pointing to the importance of multilateral strategies in tackling global and domestic challenges. Yet she admitted that the progress made under Biden could be at risk if Trump wins another term. Trump has already vowed to ramp up tariffs on China and slash U.S. support for Ukraine. Janet‚Äôs departure raises questions about what comes next. Her likely successor, Scott Bessent , has voiced support for her policies, including her ‚Äúfriend-shoring‚Äù strategy. This approach aims to align America‚Äôs supply chains with its allies, creating a stronger economic and security network. Bessent has called her doctrine ‚Äúthe most important speech in her distinguished career.‚Äù Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",Economy|CNY|RUB|Treasury Department|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-15 11:47:23

Analyst Ali Martinez said that ENA needs to reclaim $0.86 and turn it into support. A failure to reclaim $0.86 could put ENA at the risk of dropping to $0.69 or $0.57. ENA, the native token of the synthetic dollar protocol Ethena, is facing significant bearish pressure despite an overall recovering market, according to crypto analyst Ali Martinez. He warns that if ENA fails to reclaim a crucial price level, a major price crash could occur. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Martinez highlighted that the ENA token has broken out of a parallel channel. As shown in the image below, the upper trendline acted as resistance, and the lower trendline provided support. This bearish breakout suggests potential downward momentum for ENA. Traders should wait for confirmation, as the breakout could be a fakeout. However, ENA remains at risk of a price correction to $0.69 or even $0.57.

Seit Stunden befindet sich XRP wieder in der Aufw√§rtsbewegung und konnte von 2,55 US Dollar auf 2,87 US Dollar klettern. Vor sechs Tagen lag XRP noch bei 2,24 US Dollar. Innerhalb der letzten 30 Tage stieg der Preis um 15 Prozent, gegen√ºber dem Januar des Vorjahres um 370 Prozent. Die laut Marktkapitalisierung drittst√§rkste Kryptow√§hrung k√∂nnte in den n√§chsten Tagen das Allzeithoch aus dem Jahr 2018 in Angriff nehmen. Doch damit noch nicht genug: Versan Aljarrah, der Gr√ºnder von Black Swan Capitalist, ist √ºberzeugt, dass XRP nicht nur ein klassisches Krypto Asset ist, sondern der Schl√ºssel zu einem neuen Finanzsystem. Doch damit nicht genug: Aljarrah meint, XRP k√∂nnte auf 10.000 US Dollar steigen. XRP k√∂nnte eine tragende Rolle spielen Der Analyst ist √ºberzeugt, dass XRP eine entscheidende Rolle einnehmen wird, wenn es um die Weiterentwicklung des globalen Finanzwesens geht. Aljarrah betonte, dass es wichtig sei, den XRP Token zu sch√ºtzen; man m√ºsse ihn in Non Custodial-Wallets aufbewahren. XRP repr√§sentiert f√ºr Aljarrah nicht nur Reichtum, es geht auch darum, einen Zugang zu einem neuen finanziellen √ñkosystem zu bekommen. Diese Aussagen spiegeln nat√ºrlich den Optimismus wider, der in der XRP Community herrscht. Der Krypto Analyst Aljarrah ist kein unbeschriebenes Blatt: Er ist bekannt daf√ºr, sehr optimistische Prognosen zu erstellen, wenn es um XRP geht. Dabei kn√ºpft die aktuelle Aussage an jenen Behauptungen an, dass der Besitz von XRP dem Besitz eines Teiles der globalen Geldmenge gleichkommen w√ºrde ‚Äì diese √Ñu√üerung t√§tigte er im Sommer 2023. Aljarrah ist √ºberzeugt, dass XRP eine gro√üe Zukunft vor sich hat, sofern das XRP Ledger die Plattform Nummer 1 wird, wenn es darum geht, globale Verm√∂genswerte zu tokenisieren. Zudem ist Aljarrah √ºberzeugt: Wer 5.000 US Dollar in XRP investiert, k√∂nnte demn√§chst 2 Millionen US Dollar auf seinem Konto haben. Wie das m√∂glich sein soll? Er verwies auf Januar 2016, als XRP bei 0,0065 US Dollar lag und dann innerhalb 48 Monate auf 3,40 US Dollar kletterte. H√§tte man zu diesem Zeitraum 5.000 US Dollar investiert, so w√§re am Ende wirklich ein Betrag von √ºber 2 Millionen US Dollar entstanden. Wieso es unvermeidlich ist, dass XRP auf 10.000 US Dollar steigt In einem Interview mit Edoardo Farina, CEO der Alpha Lions Academy, hat Aljarrah klar kommuniziert, was er von XRP in kommender Zeit erwarte: einen Anstieg auf 10.000 US Dollar. Diese Preisexplosion sei laut Aljarrah auch unvermeidlich. Denn er ist √ºberzeugt, Finanzinstitutionen und Zentralbanken w√ºrden einen hohen Startpreis f√ºr XRP beschlie√üen, √§hnlich wie das bei der Preisgestaltung bei den B√∂rseng√§ngen ist. Das sei erforderlich, damit die Rolle von XRP bei den gro√üen Finanztransaktionen gesichert werden kann. Abseits von Bitcoin und XRP gibt es noch weitere Kryptow√§hrungen, die in den kommenden Monaten durch die Decke gehen k√∂nnen. Unter anderem Solaxy. Die Homepage von Solaxy Presale ist gestartet: Jetzt in Solaxy investieren Zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt k√∂nnen all jene, die von dem Projekt Solaxy √ºberzeugt sind, √ºber die Homepage SOLX Token erwerben. Was man daf√ºr ben√∂tigt? ETH, USDT oder BNB sowie eine kompatible Wallet, damit die SOLX Token dann √ºbertragen werden k√∂nnen. Hat man investiert, kann man die Token in weiterer Folge staken. Daf√ºr gibt es eine Rendite von bis zu 370 Prozent. Doch wie erfolgversprechend ist Solaxy? Der Plan: 138,046 Milliarden SOLX Token sollen ausgegeben werden. Damit dann das Projekt auf lange Zeit gesichert werden kann, werden dann 20 Prozent der Token als Reserve aufbewahrt. 15 Prozent der Token werden f√ºr das Marketing verwendet, damit das Wachstum und die Bekanntheit von Solaxy vorangetrieben werden k√∂nnen. 25 Prozent aller SOLX Token stehen f√ºr die fr√ºhen Investoren bereit. Das sind jene, die schon w√§hrend dem Presale investieren bzw. investiert haben. Nach dem Ende des Presales stehen 10 Prozent f√ºr die Listung auf einer Kryptob√∂rse zur Verf√ºgung.

As Solana faces a significant price drop, market players are assessing chances for a rebound. At the same time, Pepe is drawing interest with significant accumulations and optimistic forecasts suggesting an upcoming surge. Amid these dynamics, BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging prominently for different reasons. Its plan to be listed on more than 10 exchanges by 2025 is laying the groundwork for a major advance in its market visibility. BlockDAG is not just increasing access; it‚Äôs building momentum. With forecasts of reaching $1 by 2025, the excitement around its scalable technology and unique features is well-founded. Further boosting the enthusiasm is the LAUNCH300 campaign, which offers a 300% bonus, marking an ideal time to get involved with this promising crypto. BlockDAG: Aiming High with 10 Exchanges and a $1 Goal BlockDAG‚Äôs strategy to be listed on over 10 exchanges by 2025 aims to significantly expand its growth potential. The reason is straightforward: widespread exchange presence enhances liquidity and trust, facilitating easier participation in the BlockDAG network globally. The impact? Increased trading activity could significantly influence BDAG‚Äôs price path, positioning it as a crypto to keep an eye on. Enhancing this momentum is the current presale, which has successfully gathered $180 million by distributing 17.8 billion units. With a price now at $0.0248, early participants have realized an impressive 2380% ROI since the initial price of $0.001. The LAUNCH300 promotion increases the allure, offering a 300% bonus on each purchase, providing a strong reason to engage before the price potentially rises with the listings. Crypto analysts believe BDAG could reach $1 by 2025, based on data showing that listings can lead to a 50%-200% price increase. This access-price growth relationship adds urgency for those looking to get involved before BlockDAG becomes more broadly adopted. Supporting this excitement is a robust technical foundation. BlockDAG‚Äôs DAG-based consensus mechanism enables enhanced scalability and quicker transaction speeds than traditional blockchain technologies. These capabilities are designed to smoothly handle growing demand, solidifying why its strategic market approach could elevate it to a leading position in the crypto industry. Solana‚Äôs Price Fall Triggers Market Analysis Solana has experienced a notable decrease in price, now trading at around $178.64 following a 6.97% drop. This downturn is capturing the attention of the market, with many assessing its potential for recovery. Despite the price fall, Solana‚Äôs ecosystem continues to thrive, featuring updates like Solayer Labs‚Äô InfiniSVM blockchain aimed at improving scalability, and Raydium‚Äôs new perpetual trading platform, which enhances futures trading options. These developments highlight Solana‚Äôs commitment to keeping its competitive advantage, despite fluctuating prices. The recent drop in Solana‚Äôs price offers a varied perspective. While some view this as a chance to purchase, others remain wary of potential further drops. Experts believe that Solana‚Äôs technological progress and adoption initiatives may play a crucial role in its recovery, presenting a timely opportunity for those anticipating a market upturn. Pepe‚Äôs Market Movements: A Whale of an Opportunity? Pepe has become a focal point with significant activity from large holders and positive market predictions. Over 480 billion PEPE units have been snapped up by major participants, underscoring a strong belief in its prospects. Now at $0.00001738 after a 2.4% decrease, analysts predict a possible short-term increase, with forecasts suggesting a rise to $0.0000199 soon. Predictions for Pepe‚Äôs longer-term future are also compelling, ranging from $0.000015 to $0.0182 by 2030. Despite the volatility inherent in the meme asset category, major holder activities and continuous community engagement underline its potential for staying relevant. For market observers, Pepe‚Äôs resilience in bouncing back from lows and leveraging market trends could provide valuable opportunities. The Bottom Line The price fall of Solana to $178.64 has the market weighing its prospects for recovery, while initiatives like InfiniSVM and Raydium‚Äôs platform bolster its ecosystem. Concurrently, significant acquisitions and optimistic projections surrounding Pepe have spurred interest, with forecasts indicating both short and long-term gains. Amidst these fluctuating crypto assets, BlockDAG distinguishes itself with its planned listings on more than 10 exchanges. This strategy, together with its LAUNCH300 bonus and the success of its crypto presale , offers a distinct avenue for engagement. For those interested in a promising crypto future, BDAG merges modern technology with strategic market placement, poised for considerable expansion.

However, a market shift might be on the horizon as the incoming Trump administration prepares to assume office. Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Dog Wif Hat (WIF) might gain momentum. So, where should you buy? Weekly Insights on $DOGE Source: TradingView The $DOGE weekly chart paints a clear picture. Recently, support has been robust, particularly around the critical horizontal level of $0.31. This might have been the ideal buying opportunity, even more so for those who took advantage of the low at $0.26, reaping considerable rewards. Currently, some horizontal resistance and the 0.382 Fibonacci level have been reached. A move back to at least $0.34 seems probable, with buys down to $0.315 offering a solid position. If prices drop to $0.28, this would be a prime opportunity for further purchases. Upside targets lie at the higher Fibonacci levels. $PEPE Approaching Key Supports - Will It Reach Them? Source: TradingView $PEPE seems to have been turned away at the $0.000018 horizontal price mark. The weekly candle has already revisited the 0.618 Fibonacci level, prompting questions about whether it will drop further. If it does, it could fall to the bull market support at $0.000012, the deepest 0.786 Fibonacci level. Purchases might start at $0.00001560 and could be increased if the price declines. $BONK Nearing Key Supports and Uptrend Line Source: TradingView $BONK is edging closer to the base of its bullish trendline. Strong support levels exist at $0.00002500 and $0.00002100, with the latter likely aligning with the upward trendline. Buying around $0.00002500 or lower might be a strategic move. Exercise Caution with $WIF Source: TradingView $WIF is exploring new lows. The breakdown from a long-standing triangle has not been favorable for this memecoin. For those considering a risky move, waiting for the price to dip to about $1.100, which aligns with the 0.786 level, might be wise. This could also form a triple bottom.

The largest cryptocurrency has recovered from a flash crash under $90,000 and macroeconomic headwinds last week. Large scale profit-taking could push BTC to the support zones on the weekly chart, close to the $70,000 level. Table of Contents Bitcoin market movers and the Trump effect Institutional appetite for Bitcoin cools down, sentiment deteriorates Bitcoin on-chain and derivatives data analysis Expert commentary on where Bitcoin is headed Technical analysis and Bitcoin price forecast Bitcoin market movers and the Trump effect President elect-Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration on January 20 is a key event that traders keep their eyes peeled. Trump looms large over cryptocurrencies, with his pro-crypto picks for Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, AI & Crypto Czar, and an expectation of pro-crypto regulation. Bitcoin price trend has grown increasingly intertwined with U.S. macro moves in the past few weeks. BTC and crypto represent one of the most easily liquidable risk assets, influencing their price with macroeconomic updates. Bitcoin started the day lower, opening above $94,000, and covered lost ground, reaching a high of $97,371 in today‚Äôs trading session. BTC/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news The President-elect has been clear on his expectations from the Federal Reserve and promised a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. Crypto traders are concerned since the central bank is independent and the incoming President will not play a role in its decision-making. The Bitcoin Act proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis would establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the U.S., and dollar-denominated debt would be used to buy 1,000,000 BTC, or just under 5% of the total fully diluted supply of Bitcoin in the next five years. Traders are watching for the ‚ÄúTrump effect‚Äù on Bitcoin‚Äôs price trend closer to the inauguration next week. Bitcoin analysts at 10X Research remain cautious ahead of Trump‚Äôs term. Analysts observe that market drivers are weak, and Bitcoin is likely to remain range-bound until mid-March. Even as crypto‚Äôs post-election honeymoon phase ends, the crypto industry that donated $238 million in the previous election cycle helped secure 298 pro-crypto lawmakers in Congress. It remains to be seen whether the relationship is reciprocal and could influence Bitcoin price in the long term. Institutional appetite for Bitcoin cools down, sentiment deteriorates AmberData research on Bitcoin ETF dynamics shows that institutions have drastically scaled back their inflows to U.S.-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs and likely paused new allocations amidst the recent price retreat. The move signals a risk-off behavior by institutional investors. Bitcoin traders‚Äô short-term caution is likely to be followed by renewed conviction as BTC rallies towards its milestone of $100,000. As Bitcoin price stabilizes above $95,000, it could make or break the next leg of inflows to Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Research suggests that sustained inflows from major players like BlackRock would signal restored confidence, while continued outflows by 21Shares or Franklin Templeton might reinforce a risk-off narrative. Traders should monitor ETF allocations closely to predict Bitcoin price trends, to determine whether the asset consolidates or tests new levels in the coming weeks.

As derivatives traders position themselves for a continued upside ahead of Trump‚Äôs inauguration, sudden BTC price moves could trigger a slew of long liquidations and leave the traders exposed to the negative impact on their portfolio. Bitcoin derivatives data analysis | Source: Coinglass The current optimism among derivatives traders, evident from the long/short ratio (greater than 1) on exchanges like Binance and OKX, can be attributed to an expectation of a crypto-friendly Trump regime. The Bitcoin log chart and Market value to realized value ratio on 10X Research shows that the token is reaching levels that are historically associated with profit-taking by ‚Äúsmart money,‚Äù meaning large wallet investors and institutions. The MVRV ratio has reached 2.7x, this typically triggers profit-taking by BTC holders, as observed in previous instances. Historically, when the MVRV ratio rises to 4x or 6x it marks the onset of a major correction in Bitcoin price. Bitcoin log chart vs. MVRV ratio | Source: 10Xresearch When on-chain analysis is combined with an anticipated hawkish stance by the U.S. central bank for several months, there is a strong probability of Bitcoin price testing support at $76,000 and potentially $69,000, a dip under the $70,000 mark. The Network realized profit/loss metric on Santiment nods in agreement with the MVRV ratio and deteriorating sentiment among traders. Consistent profit-taking spikes over extended time periods are associated with a correction in Bitcoin price.

Alan considers $86,000 as a key support level and the $76,000 level as the secondary support. If Bitcoin suffers a steep correction and fails to bounce off the two support levels, it could dip under the $70,000 level.

Everything is changing fast enough. BTC quotes have broken through the resistance level of $92,000, which may further lead to a decline to $73,000, where strong support in the form of 200 SMA is currently taking place.‚Äù Matteo Bottacini and the Crypto Finance team note Bitcoin‚Äôs quick recovery from its dip under $90,000. The first key inflection point for a higher range is $96,800 and BTC is holding steady above support at $92,000. Technical analysis and Bitcoin price forecast Bitcoin is currently consolidating around the $96,600 level. The BTC/USDT daily price chart shows the formation of two imbalance zones, or support levels for Bitcoin. The first one is between $81,500 and $85,072, and the second lies between $76,900 and $80,216. The $70,000 level is a key support for Bitcoin and comes into play once BTC fails to bounce from the two support zones and continues its decline. A 27% drop from the current price could push Bitcoin to test the $70,000 level as support. This could erase all gains in Bitcoin since November 5, 2024, meaning post-election BTC rally would be wiped out. The Moving average convergence divergence indicator shows red histogram bars under the neutral line, meaning there is negative momentum underlying Bitcoin price trend.

With hawkish Fed fears in the air and bitcoin strengthening its correlation with tech stocks, Wednesday's report becomes even more significant for the digital assets market. The stalled liquidity inflows through stablecoins have also raised question marks on the sustainability of price recovery from under $90K, and traders are preparing for potential downside volatility by adding short-dated puts. Here‚Äôs what experts are saying about the upcoming event: QCP Capital ""In crypto, cautious sentiment is evident in BTC options flows, with puts rolled below the key $90k support. Front-end vols and flies remain elevated, while the VIX stays high at 18.68 ‚Äì suggesting volatility to persist through January."" Geoffrey Chen, author of the Fidenza Macro blog ""The rising markets in November and the lifting of election uncertainty pushed business confidence higher, resulting in stronger data. The frontloading of goods imports and the raising of prices to get ahead of tariffs may have also contributed to higher PMIs. On top of that, oil has woken up and rallied over 10% from its December levels, reinforcing the stagflation regime. None of this bodes well for CPI tomorrow [Jan. 15] and the FOMC later this month. These risk events may surprise towards hawkish and stagflationary outcomes, putting more pressure on risk assets.‚Äù Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research ""Bitcoin continues to trade within a narrowing wedge, with several critical catalysts on the horizon. Expectations for a higher CPI number have risen, creating a scenario where a softer-than-expected inflation reading could trigger a bitcoin rally."" Focus on XRP and AI XRP surged to $2.90 early today, matching the December high with technical analysis suggesting a continued run higher. Meanwhile, according to Wintermute, dip buyers have been active in AI coins, namely FAI, GRASS, VIRTUAL, Ai16z and TAO. These coins, therefore, could chalk out bigger gains in case the CPI spurs renewed risk-taking in financial markets.

Positive gamma means market makers will likely trade against the market direction, arresting price volatility.

However, a market pivot could be coming as the new Trump administration prepares to take office. Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK) and Dog Wif Hat (WIF) could run wild. Where to buy? Clear weekly picture for $DOGE Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $DOGE gives a clear picture. Support has held well over these last few weeks, and especially the major horizontal support at $0.31. Here was probably the place to buy, although anyone who bought the bottom of the wick that went all the way down to $0.26 would have done extremely well indeed. As things stand, some horizontal resistance, plus the 0.382 Fibonacci have been reached. A return to at least $0.34 is likely, with buys all the way down to $0.315 providing a good position. If the price came all the way back to $0.28, this would be an excellent level to buy more. Upside targets are the Fibonacci levels above. $PEPE heading for major supports - will it get there? Source: TradingView $PEPE looks to have been rejected from the $0.000018 horizontal price level. The weekly candle has already been down to retest the 0.618 Fibonacci, so it is to be wondered whether it will go lower than this. If it does, the dip could go all the way down to the bull market support at $0.000012, which would be the deepest Fibonacci level of the 0.786. Buys could start to be allocated at $0.00001560 and could be increased in value if the price comes lower. $BONK not far from major supports and bull market trendline Source: TradingView $BONK is moving towards the base of its own bull market trendline. That said, there are very strong support levels at $0.00002500 and $0.00002100. The latter would also probably coincide with the aforementioned ascending trendline. Buys at $0.00002500 and below may provide an excellent position. Trade $WIF with caution Source: TradingView $WIF is really plumbing the depths. Dropping out of the long-time triangle did nothing to improve the prospects of this memecoin. While the current strong support might hold, If a gamble is to be made here, one might wait for the price to fall to around $1.100, which is the level of the 0.786. This would also form a triple bottom. Trading on $WIF should be treated with utmost caution. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

De SEC dient vandaag zijn Opening Brief aan te leveren voor zijn hoger beroep in de rechtszaak tegen Ripple. Als de SEC gewoon zijn deadline haalt, is dit mogelijk de laatste zet van Gary Gensler als SEC-voorzitter. Op 20 januari stapt hij namelijk op. De voorzitter wordt volgende week maandag vervangen door Paul Atkins. Dit is dezelfde dag dat Trump aan de macht komt in de VS. Maar wat betekent dit voor Ripple en XRP? Ripple vs SEC nieuws: Gensler slaat laatste slag voor 20 januari Ripple is niet al te enthousiast over de zet van Gary Gensler en kijkt vooral uit naar zijn samenwerking met de nieuwe administratie. Stuart Alderoty, de Chief Legal Officer van Ripple, heeft de SEC gevraagd om zijn Opening Brief uit te stellen. Tot nu toe weigert de SEC dit te doen. Ondanks deze kleine tegenslag, zegt Alderoty dat Ripple nog steeds veel vertrouwen heeft in zijn hoger beroep. Brad Garlinghouse, de CEO van Ripple, was ook niet verrast dat de SEC een uitstel weigerde. Het is volgens hem typisch iets wat Gensler zou doen. De Amerikaanse regulator is in oktober 2024 in hoger beroep gegaan in de lopende Ripple vs. SEC rechtszaak. üö® RIPPLE VS.

Vanaf dat moment is het mogelijk dat Ripple en de SEC sneller tot een conclusie kunnen komen end at de rechtszaak wellicht eindigt in het eerste kwartaal. Gensler staat bekend om zijn felle acties tegen crypto bedrijven en exchanges, uiteraard om investeerders te beschermen. Atkins zal hier waarschijnlijk minder ver in gaan. Zo kan hij investeerders beschermen en tegelijkertijd voortgang binnen de sector waarborgen. Ripple koers verwachting ‚Äì Wat gaat XRP doen? Los van wat er gaat gebeuren in de rechtszaak, het ontslag van Gary Gensler is onvermijdelijk. Dat is wellicht ook te zien in de XRP koers, die vandaag weer boven $2,80 is geschoten. De altcoin test het niveau van $2,90 voor een nieuwe high sinds 2017, maar krijgt hierin nog veel resistance. Mocht XRP deze week boven $2,90 breken, dan kan hij verder stijgen naar zijn all-time high van $3,84. Naast een mogelijke psychologische weerstand rond $3, zijn er geen duidelijke resistance levels bekend tussen $3 en $3,84. Momenteel ligt XRP op $2,82 na een indrukwekkende stijging van 9,4% in de afgelopen 24 uur en 21% in de afgelopen 7 dagen. XRP krijgt nog extra support van zijn 30-daagse moving average (geel) op $2,34, gevolgd door $2,58, die eerder deze week diende als resistance. Tot slot vormt zich ook nog een mogelijke support rond $2,75, die stijgingen boven $2,90 mogelijk maakt in de komende week. Het bullish momentum, aangegeven door de Relative Strength index (RSI) van 68, maakt de weg vrij voor een explosieve stijging na het ontslag van Gary Gensler. Het is mogelijk dat de koers volgende week sporadisch naar een nieuwe all-time high stijgt boven $4. Vanuit hier zou dat een toename van 41% zijn. Crypto hype keert terug ‚Äì welke altcoins kunnen profiteren? Altcoins zoals XRP en Cardano en enkele anderen uit de top 50 crypto‚Äôs zijn vandaag behoorlijk gestegen. Dit is ook iets wat we zagen in november, toen de hype rondom crypto terugkeerde na de overwinning van Trump in de verkiezingen. Als deze hype zich opnieuw opbouwt, is dit niet alleen positief voor XRP, maar ook voor kleinere altcoins. Toch zijn veel altcoins op het moment nog ondergewaardeerd, ten opzichte van hoe hoog ze kunnen gaan in een nieuwe crypto rally.

After reaching an all-time high earlier this year, SUI experienced a mid-year correction before regaining bullish momentum. As the market recovers, SUI continues to show strength, eyeing a potential breakout toward $10. Analysts remain optimistic about sustained upward momentum in the coming months. Sui Price Targets $10 with Key Levels Signaling a Breakout Sui price has emerged as a market leader among altcoins, showcasing remarkable gains in the current cryptocurrency cycle. Over the past year, Sui has delivered a return exceeding 600%, significantly outperforming competitors like Binance Coin (BNB), which recorded a 132% return within the same timeframe. According to market analysts, key technical levels indicate that the top altcoin may be gearing up for a breakout. With its price already climbing above $4.50, analysts predict a possible surge toward the $10 mark if the current momentum persists. Source: X SUI Technical Analysis Sui appears positioned to join the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in the coming weeks. Currently ranked 14th, the SUI price is trading at $4.48 after a recent surge. Despite this, the coin has lost 5% over the past week, struggling to maintain levels above $5 during its recent rally. The broader cryptocurrency market has experienced a rebound, with leading tokens like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP showing resilience. Sui price has been moving within an ascending channel, recently bouncing off the lower trendline near $4.40. The price stabilizes above $4.50, indicating potential for further gains. A sustained hold above $4.50 could propel the Sui price prediction toward $5.00 and potentially $5.50 if bullish momentum continues. Analysts suggest a move to $10 would require over a 2x surge. However, a break below $4.40 may invalidate this trend, risking a decline to $4.20. The MACD indicator reflects a bullish outlook for Sui‚Äôs price trajectory.

This upward movement raises the question about whether XLM can mirror XRP‚Äôs path, and register similar yet impressive gains? XLM Price Analysis: What‚Äôs Next for Stellar After Breakout? After a sharp rise of 600% in November 2024, Stellar price has been trading inside the Symmetric Triangle pattern since Nov 2024. After days of consolidation, altcoin has breached the technical formation to the upside coupled with strong volumes. This development suggests Stellar is ready for a bullish move. The chart indicates a breakout around $0.4500 level. By calculating the pattern height, approx 132%, and adding it to the breakout level, then the projected price is approximately near $1.0566. If bullish momentum holds then the Stellar price could reach its target soon. The bullishness displayed by the technical formation is confirmed as XLM trades above the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day Moving Averages, showcasing strength. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows bullish momentum with rising histograms. This is in line with the RSI, which also indicates an uptick in buying pressure. XLM/USDT 1-day chart All in all, the outlook for Stellar price prediction hints a target of $1.0566. Experts are also of the same opinion and expect XLM to shoot higher. Expert Forecasts Bullish Future for Stellar (XLM) Crypto expert Javon Marks recently shared a bullish outlook on Stellar Lumens (XLM) in his latest tweet on X. Following its impressive bullish performance, the momentum suggests even more gains could be on the horizon. With growing buying pressure and supportive market conditions, $XLM seems ready for substantial growth if these key resistance levels are surpassed. XLM/USDT 5 Day Chart With technicals hinting at another 54% move to $0.681 and experts forecasting a similar outlook, XLM price looks primed for a breakout rally. A break above $0.681 could pave the way for XLM to aim for $1.29 in the short term. Market Sentiment Shift According to Coinglass data, The total liquidation in the last 24 hours was $2.34 Million with $542.88K coming from long positions and $1.80 million from short positions, indicating a major shift in the crypto market . XLM Liquidation Rising Open Interest and Trading Volume XLM Open Interest Soar by 38.33% to $321.07 million and the trading volume also increased by 36.66% to $1.07B. The sharp rise in Open Interest and Trading Volume indicates that investors are heavily speculating on Stellar‚Äôs XLM token. XLM Open Interest What Next For XLM? Currently, XLM price is facing a key resistance level at $0.4900, which could determine its short-term direction. A breakout above this level might trigger a rally toward $0.5600 and $0.6400, marking significant gains. However, failure to clear $0.4900-$0.5000 could lead to a retracement, with support levels identified at $0.4500 and $0.3900.

They may also rebound ahead of the upcoming Donald Trump inauguration and Gary Gensler‚Äôs resignation. So, here are some of the best crypto coins to buy and hold for long-term profits. Best Crypto Coins To Buy And Hold Bitcoin is one of the best crypto coin to buy and hold for long-term profit. However, it is not an affordable investment with each coin going for almost $100,000. Some of the best cryptocurrencies to buy and hold are IOTA (IOTA), Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP). IOTA (IOTA) IOTA is a top crypto coin to buy and hold because of its upcoming turnaround efforts that may make it a viable alternative to Ethereum and Solana. The network will launch the Rebased upgrade soon that will introduce new features like staking and smart contracts. It is also going through a governance vote that will unlock 44 million tokens that will be used to promote the network. It has also partnered with LayerZero , a top scaling project. IOTA Rebased Image As such, IOTA price is a big bargain as it trades at $0.36, down by 85% from its all-time high. That means that it may rebound and retest $2.65 in the near term. On top of that, the coin will be yielding between 10% and 15%. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Virtuals Protocol is another top crypto coin to buy and hold because of the ongoing demand for AI agent tokens and its growing ecosystem. The network houses some of the biggest AI agent tokens in the industry like GAME, Iona, Olyn, and aixCB, which have accumulated millions of dollars in assets . VIRTUAL was one of the best-performing coins in 2024 and has more room to run in the long term because of its market share. Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin is a good cryptocurrency to buy because of its strong technicals. In this BNB price forecast , we noted that technicals pointed to a surge from about $650 to $1,000 in this bull run. BNB also has other catalysts like the fact that it burns tokens worth over $1 billion each quarter and that its ecosystem is still growing. Binance Coin generates a 7% staking yield, making it one of the highest-yielding crypto projects. Solana (SOL) Solana is another popular crypto token to buy because of its crucial role in the crypto industry, where it has become the second-biggest blockchain in the industry. It houses some of the top crypto projects like Orca, Raydium, and Jupiter. It also has the biggest market share in the meme coin industry and has a 5% staking yield, making it a good coin to stake. Ripple (XRP) XRP is a good crypto coin to buy because of several tailwinds. The RLUSD stablecoin is gaining market share in the industry. XRP meme coins have started surging, and there are rising odds that the SEC will approve a Ripple ETF in 2025. All these catalysts, together with its strong technicals, mean that it will have a strong bullish breakout. Other Good Cryptocurrencies To Buy The other fast-growing cryptocurrencies to buy because of their substantial catalysts are XDC Network, Raydium, Stellar Lumens, and Injective.

Still, a SHIB rival has the potential to increase to a whopping 4800%, outpacing Shiba Inu. This SHIB rival is Rexas Finance (RXS) , and the reasoning for analysts predicting a 4800% surge is driven by real-world asset tokenization. Currently, RXS is in presale stage 11, and its token has been seeing alot of demand where it has been selling out presale stages in a quick way.

Currently trading at $0.00002371, SHIB has experienced an upward momentum in the last few days, with a 4.61% increase over the past day. Analysts are positive about its future as they indicate classic bullish patterns that imply a rally to $0.000081. It is a key resistance level, and should this level break; it could open up a 300% move from the present price. SHIB has seen more excitement than ever, thanks to recent whale activity. Large investors are showing massive interest in the SHIB tokens as 220 billion SHIB tokens have moved off Binance. The surge in trading volume could be a good catalyst for the price movement of SHIB and could back up analyst predictions of a huge rally coming up. Rexas Finance Presale Hits $35.8M: Transforming Real-World Asset Ownership with 4800% Growth Potential! Quietly, Rexas Finance is changing the ownership and trading of assets. It specializes in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, mainly for the purpose of giving investors access to high-value assets like real estate, gold, and art through fractional ownership. This innovative model democratizes an investment opportunity that was previously only available to institutional players. RXS is in Stage 11 of its presale right now and costs $0.175, having so far raised a whopping $35,889,886 towards its $41 million target. We have seen strong demand for RXS with a high level of market confidence in the project's vision and execution. As with every presale stage, the price keeps increasing from its initial stages to now, and investors are desperate to get in before the launch. What sets Rexas Finance apart, besides its different products, is its dedication to security and transparency. CertiK has done a rigorous audit of the project to confirm that smart contracts meet high-security standards. Furthermore, RXS is featured on top coin market tracking platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which opens many doors for visibility with interested and potential investors. Tools to assist in asset tokenization and investment accessibility are plentiful within the platform's ecosystem. Rexas Token Builder provides everyone the opportunity to build tokens without coding, and the Rexas Launchpad assists in fundraising for tokenized projects. These features provide significantly lower barriers to entry for investors interested in entangling with real-world assets through blockchain technology. However, analysts predict that Rexas Finance will see fantastic growth in the months ahead. Analysts project RXS to rise by 4800%, which ultimately puts it in the spotlight for altcoin investors looking to enter the market. Real-world assets are the focus of the platform, and they are tapping into an entire trillion-dollar market that some competitors are yet to explore fully. It is RXS's approach to asset ownership and accessibility to investment that has stimulated an increasing interest in its use.

A major prediction from JPMorgan now has support from a leading Bloomberg analyst, hinting that XRP‚Äôs future in the ETF market might be bigger than anyone expected. Could this be the moment that XRP‚Äôs price breaks its ATH? XRP ETFs Could Bring $3-8 Billions JPMorgan recently forecasted that XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could attract a massive $3 billion to $8 billion in investments during their first year.

Senior Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has joined the conversation, stating that JPMorgan‚Äôs estimate is a ‚Äúpretty reasonable guess.‚Äù JPMorgan is saying that alt-coin ETF will collect $14b in flows in first year, $3-6b for Solana and $4-8b for XRP.

The Rise of XRP and Solana ETFs The success of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 has set a high bar for altcoins like XRP and Solana. Experts believe that these altcoins could soon see the same influx of investment as Bitcoin did. According to JPMorgan‚Äôs report projects that XRP ETFs could tap into a 3% to 6% market penetration, resulting in $3 billion to $8 billion in investments. Solana, another favorite in the space, could see $3 billion to $5 billion in ETF inflows in their first year.

However, JPMorgan remains hopeful that these ETFs will be greenlit in 2025 , especially with the crypto-friendly stance of President-elect Donald Trump and the nomination of Paul Atkins for SEC chair. With such political backing, many analysts believe that approval may be closer than expected. Impact on XRP‚Äôs Price According to JPMorgan‚Äôs predictions, the success of XRP ETFs could result in significant price growth, with estimates suggesting a 30% increase by the end of January.

This market milestone also places it ahead of globally recognized brands like Coca-Cola, Disney, and Nike. Crypto coins have set off on a Trump rally ahead of his inauguration on January 20, 2025.

BlackRock maintains a bullish crypto stance Robbie Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, recently shared the asset management company‚Äôs insights into the evolving role of cryptocurrencies. Speaking to Bloomberg, Mitchnick described Bitcoin as a scarce, global, and decentralized non-sovereign asset, free from specific country risks or traditional counterparty concerns. Looks like Satoshi Nakamoto achieved the goal he had 16 years ago. Mitchnick also spoke about the crypto‚Äôs market adoption. He asserts that the relationship between institutional investors and BTC is still in its early stages. Mitchnick also called the performance of BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF in 2024 impressive. He believes more institutions and wealth advisors will be looking to bring in more inflows this year. However, Mitchnick emphasized that BlackRock does not want to be compared with MicroStrategy when it comes to Bitcoin investments. Unlike MicroStrategy , which is known for its aggressive, leverage-based Bitcoin accumulation strategy, BlackRock is leaning towards a more conservative and investor-focused approach. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not buying and selling Bitcoin for ourselves.

The focus has shifted to the American music icon, Taylor Swift. Shanghai has begun preliminary conversations with the singer and songwriter about organizing a concert this year. The agenda by Chinese cities aims to attract international celebrities and stimulate the economy. According to reports, Zhang Qi, the deputy director of Shanghai‚Äôs culture and tourism bureau, stated that local officials had hosted Swift‚Äôs team for preliminary discussions in the municipality. In a statement, he said, ‚ÄúAs for whether it will ultimately happen, it depends on the market and the attractiveness of our city. However, we are optimistic and think that there may be hope for this year.‚Äù The report was released one month after Swift ended her Eras Tour. The tour set a new record, with the final performance in Vancouver, Canada. The estimated global economic impact was within the remarkable range of $13 to $28 billion, with 10.1 million fans attending 149 events. Now, the second-largest economy in the world is set to step up and allow entertainment to work for it. It will follow in the footsteps of the United States, which has made the most of its entertainment industry. The demand for international performances in China In recent years, Shanghai has become a thriving center for cultural events. The city has hosted several large-scale commercial performances. To that end, there has also been a significant increase in the demand for live performances. The capital is frequently the initial destination for international celebrities during their mainland China tours. Apparently, Japan and Singapore were the sole Asian destinations on Swift‚Äôs record-setting Eras Tour. The concert documentary Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour , which was released globally in October 2024, was the highest-grossing music documentary in Chinese Box Office history. The movie screened in China for 69 days, attracting over 2 million viewers and grossing 100 million yuan ($13.8 million).

EXO (11M) pic.twitter.com/nqgQIpwmsJ ‚Äî KLIFE (@8KLIFE) December 9, 2024 Additionally, local officials are placing their expectations on live music performances to stimulate their economies. This is prompting other Chinese cities to compete for the opportunity to host renowned singers. Tourism and consumer spending are driven by the willingness of many fans, particularly the youth, to travel to other cities for major concerts. For instance, last month, a tourism official in Hangzhou, China, expressed anticipation that Swift would perform in his country. This happened after British artist Ed Sheeran confirmed his intentions to play six gigs in Hangzhou in February and March, the only Chinese stop on his next tour. Also, this year, the southern island province of Hainan has extended an invitation to rap superstars such as Travis Scott and Cardi B to perform. Notably, two sold-out Kanye West concerts in Hainan in September generated an estimated 700 million yuan ($95.5 million) in tourism revenue. Other Western megastars who have visited China lately include American singer Mariah Carey, who played two gigs in Beijing in September. In October, John Legend performed in Beijing and Shanghai, while in December, British artists Jessie J and James Blunt performed in several locations around China. China‚Äôs government to loosen regulations on international acts The process of hosting international performances in China is complicated and requires the ability to navigate a complex web of regulations and restrictions. In the past, the Chinese government has been hesitant to allow big events. Most especially ones with foreign singers, out of fears that they would change Chinese culture and threaten public safety. However, advisers to the Shanghai government referred to celebrities like Swift as ‚Äúwalking GDP‚Äù due to their tremendous economic influence. They advocated for lesser limitations on international performers in order to stage more high-profile shows. As a result, the Shanghai municipal government‚Äôs counselors‚Äô office posted on its social media account that government departments should simplify the process of obtaining visas, approvals, and customs in order to attract top-tier talent.

Digital asset evolution Cryptocurrencies are no longer a niche interest. Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen their ecosystems expand significantly. One of the biggest drivers has been the introduction of ETFs for each token. These financial products have accelerated institutional investment and brought in many individual investors that are more comfortable buying coin exposure using a vehicle they‚Äôre already familiar with, creating a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. Ethereum, often called the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) , has seen rapid improvements. Layer 2 solutions like Optimism are making transactions faster and cheaper, enabling more widespread adoption of decentralized applications (dApps) , NFTs and digital identity tools. As regulatory frameworks solidify, digital assets are gaining greater legitimacy, setting the stage for even broader integration into mainstream finance. The global economic landscape Economic conditions in 2025 are marked by cautious optimism. In the U.S., a combination of tax reforms and regulatory adjustments under new leadership has fueled renewed confidence in business investment. However, inflation remains a pressing concern. Although it‚Äôs trending downward, sticky costs in areas like housing and services continue to challenge policymakers. Globally, challenges abound. China is grappling with a prolonged property sector slump, while Europe faces political uncertainty and slowing economic growth. In contrast, India is emerging as a bright spot, balancing tight monetary policies with robust structural growth. Together, these dynamics suggest a mixed but resilient global economy where targeted opportunities could yield substantial returns. Stablecoins and the rise of digital dollars Stablecoins , digital currencies tied to real-world assets like the U.S. dollar, are experiencing a surge in adoption. They‚Äôre being used for everything from international remittances to enterprise transactions, offering speed and cost advantages over traditional banking systems. The U.S. regulatory environment is evolving to provide clearer guidelines for stablecoin issuers, which is expected to boost institutional confidence. By the end of 2025, the stablecoin market could surpass $300 billion in value , reflecting its growing role in global commerce and digital payments. Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 2 networks and competitors like Solana are likely to play a key role in facilitating this growth, offering the infrastructure needed for high-volume transactions. Tokenization as the future of investments Tokenization ‚Äî the process of turning real-world assets into blockchain-based digital tokens ‚Äî is poised to reshape the investment landscape. In 2024, tokenized assets reached $13.6 billion, and that figure is expected to exceed $30 billion in 2025 . On-chain money market funds are leading the way, attracting investors with promises of transparency and efficiency. For instance, new stablecoins like Ethena ‚Äôs USDtb, backed by major financial institutions, are fueling interest in tokenized financial products. While tokenization still faces hurdles like infrastructure development and regulatory approval, its potential to democratize finance and enhance liquidity is undeniable. AI and blockchain: A synergistic future The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology is one of the most exciting trends for 2025. AI agents ‚Äî autonomous programs capable of managing digital assets and executing smart contracts ‚Äî are becoming more prevalent in blockchain ecosystems. By the end of the year, AI-driven activity is projected to account for over 10% of all blockchain transactions. These agents thrive in decentralized networks, where their ability to operate without human intervention creates new efficiencies. For example, AI could optimize liquidity in decentralized finance or enhance the security of digital identity systems. With venture capital pouring into this space, several startups focused on AI-blockchain convergence are expected to reach unicorn status. The bigger picture: Challenges and opportunities While 2025 promises innovation and growth, challenges remain. The interplay between monetary policy, economic resilience, and technological adoption will define the year. Central banks must navigate inflationary pressures while supporting growth, and businesses will need to adapt to new regulatory landscapes. On the other hand, the opportunities are vast. From the continued rise of digital assets to breakthroughs in AI and blockchain, the coming year offers a glimpse into the future of finance and technology. For investors and innovators alike, 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year. You‚Äôve read the summary, now get the full picture Enjoy this summary?

The funds have surpassed the goal, however the dog with the pink hat has yet to appear on the sphere. On the social media platform X, users have started noticing the project‚Äôs inactivity 10 months after the funds surpassed the set goal. Meanwhile, the donations worth nearly $700,000 in USD Coin ( USDC ) are still kept frozen in the crypto wallet held by a team of influencers. One of the users on X with the username @0xShual noted how ‚Äúbizarre‚Äù it was that no one has spoken out about the project‚Äôs lack of accomplishment after almost a year of fundraising. At the time of writing, the dogwifhat ( WIF ) icon, which features a Shiba Inu dog wearing a pink hat, has yet to appear on the Las Vegas Sphere. ‚ÄúJokes aside ‚Äî what the fuck? do people not care about this? no petition for refunds, nothing? At least farm with this capital, it‚Äôs just been sitting there idly for almost a year,‚Äù said Shual in a recent X post . Many users began expressing doubt in the comments section on whether the project will actually become a reality. ‚ÄúYeah definitely odd, also Ansem basically saying like ‚Äúit was hard so I stopped trying‚Äù made me lol (laugh out loud),‚Äù said another user. The Las Vegas Sphere is a 366 feet high and 516 feet wide globe that spans Sands Avenue, just off the Las Vegas Strip and east of the Venetian resort. It is known to project various different emojis and advertisements on what the site claims to be ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs largest LED screen.‚Äù You might also like: Dogwifhat‚Äôs X account hacked to promote meme coins: report In January 2024, a group of five crypto influencers led by Zion Thomas, known in crypto spaces under the alias Ansem, launched a campaign to raise money to put the dogwifhat icon on the Las Vegas Sphere. By March 2024, the group managed to raise enough money to pay the $650,000 fee needed to put the Solana meme coin icon on the Sphere for an entire week. However, weeks after the campaign surpassed its target, updates began to slow down and donors began to doubt the project‚Äôs validity. The last update given by Ansem was in July 2024, when he seemingly joked about the campaign failing to put dogwifhat on the sphere due to a blue-screen error. ‚ÄúDamn i can‚Äôt believe this happened on the day we put wif on the sphere,‚Äù he wrote in his post . damn i can't believe this happened on the day we put wif on the sphere üòî pic.twitter.com/UoDDSQ37J4 ‚Äî Ansem üêÇüÄÑÔ∏è (@blknoiz06) July 19, 2024 Whether the group intends to carry out the project is still unknown, but traders have begun to grow nervous as the dogwifhat coin dips by nearly 45% in the past month, according to data from crypto.news. In the past week, the meme coin has gone down by more than 18%. Launched in November 2023 on the Solana ( SOL ) blockchain, dogwifhat is a meme coin based on a viral internet picture of a dog wearing a pink crocheted hat. It gained popularity among traders, reaching a $1 billion market cap only 81 days after launch. Now, the meme coin‚Äôs market cap sits at around $1.5 billion.

World Liberty Financial, a crypto initiative backed by President-elect Donald Trump, has transferred over $61 million worth of Ether in the past day, raising questions about its treasury management practices. Meanwhile, The Open Network (TON), a blockchain project historically linked to Telegram, has announced plans to expand its presence in the United States under Trump‚Äôs incoming administration, with a focus on driving retail adoption of digital assets. World Liberty Financial Moves $61.4 Million in Ether Amid Speculation About Treasury Management World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the crypto project backed by President-elect Donald Trump , has made headlines once again with significant on-chain activity. Recently, the project transferred $61.4 million worth of Ether (ETH), as reported by blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence . The movement has sparked curiosity and speculation among market participants and observers. Arkham Intelligence data reveals that WLFI‚Äôs primary wallet executed multiple transactions, dispersing funds into several wallets, including Coinbase Prime‚Äîa service known for catering to institutional clients. At its peak in mid-December, the wallet held approximately $83 million, but as of now, it contains only $16.7 million. The project‚Äôs official account on X addressed the movements in an effort to quell speculation. In a statement, WLFI clarified, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre making routine movements of our crypto holdings as part of regular treasury management, payment of fees and expenses, and to address working capital requirements. To be clear, we are not selling tokens ‚Äî we are simply reallocating assets for ordinary business purposes.‚Äù The message emphasized that these transfers are part of efforts to maintain a ‚Äústrong, secure, and efficient treasury,‚Äù dismissing any claims of potential token sales or financial distress. However, the sizable transfers and the timing of the transactions have drawn mixed reactions from the crypto community. Large-scale transactions by high-profile crypto projects often lead to market speculation. In WLFI's case, some have raised concerns about liquidity pressures or operational challenges. Others believe the project is executing routine financial practices as stated, ensuring liquidity for operations and fee payments. The latest transactions come shortly after WLFI announced its appointment of Tron Founder Justin Sun as an advisor. The move followed a $30 million investment in WLFI by HTX, the crypto exchange formerly known as Huobi and closely tied to Sun. Sun‚Äôs involvement adds another layer of intrigue to WLFI‚Äôs operations. Known for his aggressive business strategies and significant influence in the crypto space, Sun's advisory role has been viewed as a strategic move to strengthen WLFI‚Äôs global positioning. WLFI‚Äôs Strategic Roadmap Launched as a fork of Aave, WLFI aims to leverage the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem for greater accessibility and financial inclusivity. Backed by a coalition of Trump‚Äôs friends and family, the project has captured public attention due to its high-profile endorsements and ambitious goals. However, its association with Trump and recent developments have also invited scrutiny. WLFI‚Äôs emphasis on maintaining transparency about its financial operations are part of its efforts to build trust within the volatile crypto sector. Despite this, unanswered questions about the project's long-term strategy and financial health persist. With the project‚Äôs Ether holdings now significantly reduced, analysts and investors will closely monitor WLFI's next steps. Will this reallocation lead to new partnerships, product launches, or a more robust ecosystem? Or will the speculation around its finances overshadow its innovation efforts? As the project navigates these waters, one thing is clear: WLFI‚Äôs movements will remain under a magnifying glass, especially with Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency looming large on the horizon. For now, the crypto community will be watching closely to see how WLFI balances its ambitious goals with the operational realities of a high-profile DeFi project. The Open Network (TON) Eyes US Expansion Under Incoming Trump Administration The Open Network (TON), a blockchain project with historic ties to Telegram, is setting its sights on expanding into the United States. Under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump, the TON Foundation has identified the US as a key market for its growth strategy, signaling a major development in the project‚Äôs journey. The TON Foundation confirmed its focus on US expansion on Jan. 14, with newly appointed president Manuel Stotz leading the initiative. This marks a pivotal step for TON as it positions itself to play a significant role in the evolving US crypto landscape. Manuel Stotz, a prominent digital asset investor and the founder of Kingsway Capital Partners, will assume the presidency of the TON Foundation, replacing Steve Yun, who will remain a board member. Stotz emphasized the importance of the US market in a statement, stating, ‚ÄúThe US ranks as one of the world‚Äôs largest financial centers, and we see enormous potential for it to develop into a crypto hub that will promote and support the retail adoption of digital assets.‚Äù Stotz‚Äôs vision aligns with TON‚Äôs goal of fostering widespread adoption of blockchain technology and digital assets. A seasoned investor, Stotz has backed more than 50 industry projects, including high-profile names like Animoca Brands, Blockchain.com, and Toncoin. TON‚Äôs ambitions in the US are not without precedent. Initially launched as the ‚ÄùTelegram Open Network‚Äù by Telegram co-founders Pavel and Nikolai Durov in 2018, the project aimed to revolutionize blockchain technology. However, legal challenges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) forced Telegram to abandon the project in 2020. The SEC alleged that TON‚Äôs $1.7 billion token sale for its Gram cryptocurrency constituted an unregistered securities offering. Following the legal battle, Telegram formally distanced itself from the project, shutting down the TON testnet and terminating its direct involvement. However, the open-source nature of the project allowed independent developers and communities to take the reins, leading to the establishment of the TON Foundation in Switzerland in 2023. As a nonprofit organization funded entirely by community contributions, the TON Foundation has worked to reinvigorate the project. Despite Telegram‚Äôs formal exit, the blockchain and its cryptocurrency, Toncoin, have become increasingly integrated into Telegram‚Äôs ecosystem. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has remained a vocal supporter of TON, and the platform now features various TON-related functionalities, including support for third-party wallets. Stotz‚Äôs appointment and the US expansion mark a turning point in the TON Foundation‚Äôs efforts to build on this legacy. In a blog post , Stotz expressed his commitment to driving TON‚Äôs mission forward, stating, ‚ÄúI look forward to working with our partners and stakeholders to accelerate this mission ‚Äî especially in the dynamic and innovative US market.‚Äù The US as a Crypto Hub TON‚Äôs focus on the US aligns with broader trends in the global blockchain space. The United States, as one of the world‚Äôs largest financial markets, is a critical battleground for projects seeking mainstream adoption. However, navigating the complex regulatory environment remains a significant challenge for blockchain initiatives. The Trump administration‚Äôs stance on cryptocurrency and blockchain could play a crucial role in shaping TON‚Äôs success in the US. While the administration‚Äôs policies are not yet clear, the project‚Äôs leadership appears optimistic about the opportunities ahead. TON‚Äôs renewed push into the US market signals its commitment to becoming a major player in the blockchain ecosystem. With a history marked by legal hurdles and a resilient community of developers, TON‚Äôs journey is a testament to the decentralized nature of blockchain innovation. As the US prepares for a new administration, the TON Foundation‚Äôs efforts could help redefine the role of blockchain in the country‚Äôs financial system. For now, all eyes are on Manuel Stotz and the TON Foundation as they navigate this pivotal chapter in the project‚Äôs history.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TON|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-15 13:30:00

Hedera Hashgraph ( HBAR ) has risen for two consecutive days, reaching a high of $0.3140, its highest level since January 7. The token remains about 600% above its lowest level in 2024, with a market cap of over $11.3 billion. HBAR‚Äôs recent performance is driven by investor anticipation of a spot exchange-traded fund approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Canary, an emerging fund manager, has filed for an HBAR-focused ETF , and some analysts believe it has a strong chance of being approved. In a report on Tuesday, JPMorgan predicted that the SEC, now led by Paul Atkins, is likely to approve crypto funds. The report cited Ripple ( XRP ) and Solana ( SOL ) as examples of assets that could attract billions of dollars in inflows. The approval of these funds could pave the way for a spot Hedera ETF.

The network currently holds nearly $180 million in assets, led by protocols such as Stader, SaucerSwap, Bonzo Finance, and Heliswap. Its stablecoin market cap has increased to $11 million. Hedera is often seen as a faster and more cost-effective alternative to Ethereum ( ETH ). The network‚Äôs governance council includes major companies such as Tata, Abrdn, Worldpay, IBM, and Dell. Hedera Hashgraph price could surge soon HBAR price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that HBAR has remained in a tight range after peaking at $0.3922 in November. The token has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, a key part of the bullish pennant pattern, which is a popular continuation signal. HBAR is trading above its 50-day Exponential Moving Average and has reached the ultimate resistance level of the Murrey Math Lines. It is also positioned between the 61.8% and 78.6% Fibonacci retracement levels, indicating a consolidation phase. The chart suggests that HBAR is likely to experience a strong bullish breakout. The next key level to watch is $0.3920, the token‚Äôs high on December 3. A move above that level could trigger further gains, with the psychological target set at $0.50, representing a 68% increase from the current price.

While the CPI release could strengthen the US dollar, it is unlikely to lead to immediate changes in the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy. The US inflation data arrived in line with expectations. The Year-over-Year (YoY) CPI came at 2.9% as expected, up from 2.7% and the core CPI came in at 3.2%, slightly below the 3.3% estimate. The inflation was expected to rise by 2.9% annually in December, up from 2.7% in November. Core CPI inflation was forecasted to remain steady at 3.3%. The forecasts suggest a 0.3% increase for the headline CPI and a 0.2% rise for core CPI. Crypto Market Reaction The Crypto market is rallying as the US December Core CPI rises 0.2% MoM, below the expected 0.3%. Notably, BTC price skyrocketed by $1K in reaction to the news. XRP is currently trading at $2.85, up over 10% in the past day. ETH, SOL, DOGE, ADA are trading up by 1.80%, 3.03%, 4.56% and 7.90% respectively. FOMC Meeting Besides, the FOMC Minutes from the December meeting revealed concerns among Fed officials about rising inflation risks. They also noted that changes in trade and immigration policies could make it harder to control inflation, highlighting their potential impact on the US economy. However, 10x Research head Markus Thielen expects movement before the January 29 FOMC meeting. ‚ÄúBitcoin trades within a narrowing triangle, signaling a breakout is imminent ‚Äî likely no later than the January 29 FOMC meeting,‚Äù he noted on January 14.

However, with a slow cooling of the labor market and high inflation, the December inflation report is unlikely to lead to major changes in the Fed‚Äôs policy, with a 97% chance of no rate change as per CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch Tool, at the January 29 meeting. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

He has extensive experience that spans Wall Street, government regulation, and an angel teaching about cryptocurrencies and blockchain at MIT. Gary S. Gensler was on born October 18, 1957, in Baltimore, Maryland.He graduated from Pikesville High School in 1975, where he was later given a Distinguished Alumnus award. He also earned a degree in economics.Gensler served in the United States Department of the Treasury as Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets from 1997 to 1999, then as Undersecretary for Domestic Finance from 1999 to 2001He has expressed his desire to present crypto-related approach changes later on that include token commitments, decentralized finance, stablecoins, guardianship, exchange-traded resources, and advancing stages. Chairman in an interview with CNBC , shared his thoughts on his time at the agency and his stance on the cryptocurrency market . Regarding Bitcoin, Gensler stressed that the SEC has never classified it as a security. He described Bitcoin as a highly speculative and volatile asset but noted its global appeal, comparing it to gold in terms of its long-standing value and widespread interest. He also suggested that, like gold, Bitcoin might continue to play a role in the future of global markets, though other assets could emerge as alternatives. The SEC‚Äôs Role in Cryptocurrency: Enforcing Laws and Protecting Investors Gensler pointed out that for the many other cryptocurrency projects in existence, they must demonstrate clear use cases and strong fundamentals to remain viable in the long term. Without these, he warned, they are unlikely to succeed. The SEC chair also clarified that he has never owned any cryptocurrencies and has consistently maintained this stance for the past seven or eight years. His predecessor, Jay Clayton, who is set to return in the Trump Administration, brought about 80 cases to protect investors. Gensler said that the SEC‚Äôs role is to enforce laws, ensuring transparency and protecting against fraud and manipulation. Unfortunately, he said that there has been a lot of this in the crypto space, especially with crypto exchanges that not only acted as platforms but also traded against their own customers. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple vs SEC: Gensler Set to File Opening Brief, Can New SEC Chair Override It? , Paul Atkins to Replace Gensler: Shifting Toward a Pro-Crypto Approach Paul Atkins is set to replace Gensler .

The closely-watched Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.4% in December, slightly higher than analyst consensus and the previous month's 0.3%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI was up 2.9%, compared to analyst forecasts for 2.9% and previous month's reading at 2.7%. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.2% in December, versus expectations for 0.2% and the previous month's 0.3% figure. Core CPI year-over-year, however, dipped to 3.2% against forecasts for 3.3% and the November rate of 3.3%. The core pace of inflation is of considerable import to policymakers, who have expressed at least a modest bit of frustration over its stickiness above 3% as headline inflation fell at a far quicker pace. The price of bitcoin ( BTC ) rose about $1,500 in the minutes following the report to $98,500 following the report, up 2% over the past 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows. In traditional markets, U.S. stock index futures added about 0.5% after the data, while bond yields and the dollar both sharply declined. Crypto markets have traded rangebound through January at the whims of macroeconomic data and monetary policy expectations amidst a strong economy and concerns of sticky inflation. Bitcoin consolidated mostly below $100,000 since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments in December. That, along with a string of stronger-than-forecast economic and inflation data, led market participants to nearly erase all expectations for rate cuts this year. Most recently, Tuesday's Producer Price Index (PPI) for December showed cooler than expected inflation readings, supporting BTC's rebound to $97,000 following the abrupt sell-off below $90,000 earlier in the week.",Markets|CPI|Consumer Price Index|Bitcoin|Inflation,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-15 13:40:53

The prices of riskier assets like cryptocurrency headed straight north despite the fears of higher inflation and no interest cuts by the US Federal Reserve this year.

The Core CPI, which excludes more volatile sectors like food and energy, is slightly under the estimations at 3.2%. Although the increase for December was the largest in eight months and slightly bigger than that for November, cryptocurrency prices reacted with immediate gains. BTC stood at just shy of $97,000 in preparation for the CPI numbers but shot up immediately to over $98,500 after the news broke out. This is the asset‚Äôs highest price tag in just over a week. Moreover, BTC is up by nearly ten grand since its bottom on Monday at $89,200. Perhaps the markets reacted prematurely to the upcoming inflation data, and investors acted ahead of the actual news.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Stellar, Dogecoin, and Cardano rise, Rollblock is emerging as the next big crypto presale in 2025. Table of Contents Rollblock: The altcoin redefining blockchain gaming Stellar: Building momentum amid challenges Dogecoin: Popular but limited in utility Cardano: Bullish signs but long-term uncertainty Conclusion As established names like Stellar (XLM), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) capture market attention with their recent gains, a new crypto presale project, Rollblock (RBLK) is what savvy investors talk about. RBLK could be the new leader in the blockchain gaming sector. Rollblock: The altcoin redefining blockchain gaming Rollblock is making waves with its presale, having already raised over $8.6 million. The platform supports over 7,000 games, live casinos, and sports betting. It targets the $500 billion global gaming market. What sets this altcoin apart is its integration of Ethereum-backed smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security in all transactions. Rollblock‚Äôs deflationary tokenomics provide additional appeal. Regular token burns, buybacks, and staking rewards create scarcity while incentivizing long-term holding. Unlike many speculative projects, Rollblock offers real-world utility by merging gaming with decentralized finance (DeFi). This combination not only addresses market demands but also positions Rollblock as a frontrunner in the next wave of crypto innovation. Tokens are priced at only $0.045 in its presale, so Rollblock represents an opportunity for early investors to secure significant returns. Rollblock‚Äôs model and growing ecosystem could make it one of the most profitable investments in 2025. Stellar: Building momentum amid challenges The Stellar price went up from 7.43% to $0.4356 and trading volume also reflected some new interest in this altcoin as it surged by 40%. If Stellar breaks resistance at $0.4400, it could rally to $0.4600. But, the Stellar ecosystem shows signs of stagnation. With just $53 million in total value locked within its DeFi sector, Stellar lags behind competitors offering more extensive networks and applications. While Stellar benefits from bullish sentiment, its long-term growth depends on revitalizing its ecosystem to attract sustained investor interest. Dogecoin: Popular but limited in utility Dogecoin continues to thrive on its strong community and high-profile endorsements. Recent whale activity saw 690 million DOGE moved in 48 hours, with 470 million DOGE added to wallets following a price dip. DOGE now trades around $0.33189, and optimism remains high, as evidenced by 81% of Binance traders holding long positions. Although DOGE is very popular, its reliance on speculative sentiment clouds its prospects as a long-term investment. The DOGE price could reach an ATH again, but this is never guaranteed. It can fall just as fast as it goes up. Cardano: Bullish signs but long-term uncertainty Cardano is showing signs of a breakout, with whales accumulating 90 million ADA worth $84.5 million in just four days. Currently trading around $0.93, ADA is expected to test resistance at $1.10, with analysts predicting a potential rally to $1.50. However, macroeconomic pressures have weighed heavily on ADA, which recently fell 24% from its January high. The ADA roadmap looks promising, but everything is very long term and ROI won‚Äôt be as immediate as in a crypto presale. Conclusion While Stellar, Dogecoin, and Cardano offer varying degrees of potential, Rollblock‚Äôs unique approach to blockchain gaming and DeFi integration makes it the most compelling option. As 2025 approaches, Rollblock emerges as the new crypto presale star, poised to deliver exceptional returns. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the official website and its socials.

33767162,[object Object],1736948692,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,The Top Four Meme Coins Making Waves in January 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/meme-coins-making-waves-in-january-2025/,"In another positive step for crypto ‚Äì from Bitcoin to meme coins ‚Äì the US House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence has a new Vice Chairman, and it‚Äôs none other than Congressman Tom Emmer. Emmer is known for his pro-crypto stance, making it even more likely that drive for digital assets regulation and innovation will be amped up following President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs January 20 inauguration. As Emmer himself expressed in a post on X , ‚ÄòWith President Trump in the White House, and Gary Gensler confined to the waste bin of Washington, we have an excellent opportunity to ensure that the future of digital assets is guided by Americans, with American values.‚Äô Rather scathing words thrown in Gensler‚Äôs direction there. However, as Chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Gensler is decidedly anti-crypto. If crypto were Batman, Gensler would be The Joker. Gensler will step down from his position on January 20. Emmer‚Äôs appointment was announced by House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill, who added that ‚ÄòTogether, our Committee will work to craft a regulatory framework that maintains America as a leader in innovation.‚Äô It‚Äôs a statement that will warm the heart of the crypto market, which is no doubt feeling fragile after watching the Bitcoin ($BTC) price being left battered and bruised. Despite hitting the $100K milestone in December, $BTC saw a sustained decline , with a particularly low point on January 13, when it briefly dipped below the $90K mark. Today, the $BTC price stands at around $97K. Is it Really All Doom and Gloom For Bitcoin? Bitcoin is no stranger to volatility. And while the new year has yet to be kind to the $BTC price, there‚Äôs still cause for cautious optimism. ‚ÄòBitcoin‚Äôs historic rally, accelerating corporate and state adoption, and the onset of altcoin season signal a broader crypto bull market with BTC potentially reaching $180k by 2025,‚Äô say VanEck analysts. CNBC analyst Tom Lee is even more bullish , suggesting that Bitcoin could reach as much as $250K during the course of this year. Of course, when Bitcoin does well, the rest of the market tends to follow suit , and that includes meme coins . Here are the meme coins that have been making waves in January, with no signs of slowing down anytime soon. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) ‚Äì A Record-Setting Presale Makes For an Exciting Year Ahead Last year, we watched Pepe Unchained‚Äôs ($PEPU) presale hit unprecedented highs. But now, in a ‚ÄòHold my beer‚Äô moment, the Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) presale is making Pepe Unchained‚Äôs presale look like kindergarten for tadpoles. Since launching on December 3, the $WEPE token presale has already raised a phenomenal $48.5M. What‚Äôs behind the froggy feeding frenzy? Wall Street Pepe despises market manipulation by whales hiding in insider groups. So this Pepe the Frog in Wolf of Wall Street guise is forming a WEPE Army of retail traders, giving them exclusive trading insights and tips. And through those alpha calls, he‚Äôll teach his frog army recruits to ‚Äòtrade like Pepe‚Äô and turn them into whales in their own rights. The WEPE Army is growing in leaps and bounds, and at this rate, the presale could end sooner than its original end-February closing date. Enlisting is a simple process as long as you have a crypto wallet like the Best Wallet app or MetaMask. But the clock is ticking if you‚Äôre considering buying $WEPE and joining the Frog Army at the current presale price of $0.000367. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì The World‚Äôs First-Ever Solana Layer-2 Ecosystem Also currently on presale, the multichain Solaxy ($SOLX) meme token is building on the Solana blockchain to limit congestion issues and failed transactions. But, as they say in the classics, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs not all.‚Äô Solaxy promises to unlock Solana‚Äôs full potential by adding scalability and more speed. This alone is pretty exciting, but Solaxy will also be on Ethereum, bridging the gap between its DeFi and asset tokenization ecosystem and the Solana blockchain. No wonder investors are sitting up and taking notice. Solaxy raised $350K within 24 hours of the presale launch on December 12 at a price of $0.001556 (with an APY of 5,039% APY). And as of today, the $SOLX kitty stands at nearly $10.5M. A price increase is imminent, but if you make haste, you can get your hands on 1 $SOLX for $0.0016, with $ETH, $USDT, $BNB, or a bank card as the payment options. 3. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) ‚Äì A Ridiculously Named Token You Should Take Very Seriously Schoolboy-humor name aside, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) is another one to watch. Is the token itself useless? Absolutely. Fartcoin lets users claim initial tokens by submitting fart jokes and memes. That‚Äôs in addition to its, ahem, ‚ÄòGas Fee‚Äô system. Each transaction produces the sound of a fart. Yet despite the odds, the Fartcoin price hit a personal best of $1.59 on January 3. Fartcoin is listed on CEXs with a not-too-shabby $977.59M market capitalization, holding fairly well in the current market environment. It soared 47% in the first week of January, hitting the $1B market cap milestone at the same time. The past week hasn‚Äôt been as kind to Fartcoin, but looking at the $FARTCOIN price over the last month, chances are 2025 is going to be a good year for this meme coin. 4. Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) ‚Äì The Meme Coin Dedicated Blockchain That‚Äôs Living up to Its Presale Hype Initially coined as the best-selling presale token of all time by Binance Square, Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) is currently being dethroned by its Pepe contemporary $WEPE. But since listing (after raising an impressive $74M), $PEPU has gone from strength to strength. Having listed on both DEXs and CEXs in December, this Layer-2 blockchain for meme coins puts speed, security, and low transaction fees at its core. In line with pretty much the entire crypto market, $PEPU hasn‚Äôt had much fun over the past week. But it‚Äôs keeping its froggy chin up ‚Äì as it should, based on its performance over the last month. Pepe Unchained‚Äôs market cap stands at $107.6M, and 1$PEPU currently costs $0.013327. It‚Äôs too soon to tell what the crypto market will do once Trump‚Äôs inauguration is done and dusted. But if analyst forecasts are on point, it could be a very good year for Pepe Unchained and the rest of these meme coins. However, before making any investment decisions, be sure to do your own research.

Some of the most popular crypto investments this year include Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), and Rexas Finance (RXS). Projects based on advanced technologies and public interest are considered to be among the most promising investments in 2025. Dogecoin Price Prediction: A Memecoin Leader With Renewed Momentum The memecoin related to Tesla Technologies CEO Elon Musk, Dogecoin, has raised the anticipation of an upcoming bullish trend. DOGE price is currently sitting at $0.33 at the beginning of January 2025 and is positioning itself for another upswing due to whale activities. Data from on-chain analytics showed that major holders moved $74 million DOGE to Coinbase, igniting rumors of a price pump. In the short term, market volatility has not shaken Dogecoin, as the coin continues to trade above the crucial $0.30 level. Experts believe that if Bitcoin keeps rising, DOGE may reach new heights, and estimations point to a possible high of $0.50 in the next few months. This price movement could pave the way for Dogecoin price to get to $2 by the year 2025, making it the favorite of the meme coins. Source X XRP Price Prediction: A Major Player In Cross-Border Payments Ripple‚Äôs XRP is emerging as one of the top cryptocurrencies in the current crypto bull run. Following a mixed ruling against the SEC in 2024, Ripple‚Äôs token is selling at $2.40 . Its recent breakout past the $2.50 resistance level signals bullish momentum, with analysts targeting $4 or even $8 by the end of 2025 for XRP price. Source X The use of XRP in the transfer of cross-border payments remains attractive to both retail and institutional investors. The company‚Äôs collaboration with other financial institutions and the introduction of stablecoin (RLUSD) make Ripple even stronger in the market. This is because XRP has historically exhibited a very high correlation with the rest of the crypto market, and as the price of Bitcoin continues to rise, so too may the price of XRP. Yeti Ouro (YETIO): Combining Meme Culture With Real Utility Yeti Ouro has turned out to be one of the promising cryptocurrency projects of 2025, which combines meme factor with usefulness. In its current presale, 1 YETIO token costs $0.017, and more than 26% of the total supply has been sold so far. As of now, 26,068,100 tokens have been sold, a clear testimony of the investors‚Äô confidence in the project‚Äôs plan. Yeti Ouro is a play-to-earn (P2E) game developer, and at the center of its ecosystem is YetiGo, a game with graphics developed on Unreal Engine 5. The game provides fast and intense races in the elimination mode with high-quality graphics and delivers fun along with financial gains to the players. This attracts both the gaming and the crypto communities, and as a result, there is a high demand for the token. The team shared a video showcasing the first glance at the Level 1 map at a distance. This is a larger area of the map that uses the same death match style game play. Players have a large surface area to avoid attackers and collect power-ups to help them defeat opponents. There is so much detail yet to be shown, with garages for vehicle repairs and upgrades as well as hidden tunnels and harsh terrains to get through. Yeti Ouro has strong tokenomics to ensure long-term stability with provisions for community rewards, liquidity, and ecosystem development.

The US CPI report for December 2024 highlights that the inflation has increased to 2.9%, marking a 0.2% rise from the 2.7% recorded in November. As a result, Bitcoin price jumped above $98.5K level as it came in line with market expectations and the core CPI inflation rose less than expected. According to the latest report released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics , the CPI of 2.9% indicates third consecutive increase in the index. Market estimates predicted that the CPI data would stay steady at 0.3% month-over-month. At the same time, there were estimations that the year-over-year (YoY) CPI to surge to 2.9% from last month‚Äôs 2.7%. While the Core CPI was predicted to cool at 0.2% from the previous month‚Äôs 0.3% mark, the data showed 0.2%. The YoY Core CPI, though estimated to remain unchanged at 3.3%, fell to 3.2%. US CPI and Federal Reserve‚Äôs Upcoming Rate Decision As reported by CoinGape, the US CPI inflation data , PPI and jobs data could influence the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate decisions in the next FOMC meeting scheduled on January 28-29. Many alerted that inflationary pressures may lessen the possibility of a further reduction in the Fed‚Äôs interest rate. Meanwhile, the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data, released on January 24, eases the sentiment. The data revealed the inflation rate at 3.3%, lower than the expected range of 3.5%. The core PPI inflation rate also came cooler than the expected 3.8%, marking a rate of just 3.5%. An industry expert stated that the softer-than-expected inflation data from the US helped ‚Äúpause the recent surge in the US Treasury bond yields and boosted investors‚Äô appetite for riskier assets.‚Äù Though the US CPI and PPI reports signal a bearish sentiment, it needs to be seen how they would affect the global crypto market trends. The US dollar index ( DXY ) fell below 109, after a two-day high above 110 causing a recovery in Bitcoin price. Also, the 10-year Treasury yield decreased by 0.11% to 4.67%. Is a High Volatile Crypto Market Ahead? The crypto market is still vulnerable to high volatility and inflation before and after the inauguration of the incoming President Donald Trump on January 20. Though the community remains optimistic about Trump‚Äôs possible crypto-friendly policies, its impact on the market remains speculative. Trump‚Äôs crypto-focused developments, coupled with the US CPI and PPI reports, indicate a turbulent crypto space ahead. QCP Capital cautioned about the future volatility where both crypto and equity markets remain fragile. Warning against Bitcoin‚Äôs downward pressure, the platform stated, ‚ÄúWe maintain cautious of the downside as the $90k level in BTC has been tested numerous times.‚Äù However, BTC price has jumped 2% after the CPI data, with the price currently trading at $98,700. The 24-hour low and high are $95,330 and $98,650, respectively.

This growth was fueled by its USDH stablecoin launch. The platform facilitated over $24 billion in transactions and expanded its offerings to include its own blockchain, decentralized exchange, and chat services. Meanwhile, North Korea-linked hackers are still a major global concern, and were responsible for over $1.34 billion in cryptocurrency thefts in 2024. In South Korea, impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol was arrested after his controversial martial law declaration, and the UK proposed banning ransomware payments for critical sectors. Largest Online Illicit Marketplace Sees Explosive Growth Huione Guarantee, which is described by crypto compliance firm Elliptic as ‚Äúthe largest online illicit marketplace to have ever operated,‚Äù saw a rapid rise in activity. In fact, its monthly inflows increased by 51% over the past six months. The platform‚Äôs growth was boosted by the launch of its USD-backed stablecoin, USDH, in September, which was reportedly designed to circumvent regulatory scrutiny and freezing measures that are commonly associated with other stablecoins like Tether‚Äôs USDT. To date, Huione Guarantee facilitated more than $24 billion in transactions and attracted more than 900,000 users. Elliptic first alleged in July that Huione Guarantee served as a hub for illicit activities, including money laundering and cyber scams. Despite the expos√©, the platform expanded its operations quite a bit, and even introduced a range of crypto-related products like its own blockchain, Xone Chain, a decentralized exchange, and a chat service to reduce reliance on external platforms like Telegram. The rebranding of the platform to Haowang Guarantee seems to be part of an effort to dissociate from the parent company, Huione Group, after the allegations. USDH is issued across blockchains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Tron, and its launch happened after Tether froze one of Huione Pay‚Äôs USDT accounts in July due to links with the North Korean Lazarus Group. This stablecoin is not to be confused with the similarly named USDH from Solana-based DeFi protocol Hubble. Elliptic‚Äôs latest analysis pointed out that¬†the platform enables a wide array of cyber scams and fraudulent activities. The marketplace reportedly hosts thousands of vendors offering services and goods like money laundering, stolen data, and tools for online fraud on an industrial scale. US, Japan, South Korea Warn of North Korean Hackers The United States, Japan, and South Korea jointly issued a warning about the escalating threat that is posed by crypto hackers linked to North Korea, particularly groups like the infamous Lazarus Group. These groups are known for some of the largest cyber thefts in Web3 history, including the $600 million Ronin network hack and the $230 million WazirX exchange breach. Joint statement (Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan ) Because of this, these hackers became a critical concern for global financial stability. The main goal of this collaboration of public and private sectors across the three nations is to combat these cyber threats and recover stolen funds. The warning follows South Korea‚Äôs sanctions against 15 North Koreans accused of generating funds for the country‚Äôs nuclear weapons program through cryptocurrency theft. North Korean hackers reportedly stole more than $1.34 billion worth of digital assets in 2024 alone, across 47 incidents. This was a sharp 102% increase from the $660 million that was stolen in 2023. This staggering amount accounted for more than 61% of the total cryptocurrency stolen globally in 2024 and more than 20% of the hacking incidents. DPRK hacking activity (Source: Chainalysis ) Chainalysis data also recently pointed out the growing sophistication of these attacks, with an increasing number of heists yielding profits of $50 million or more. High-profile incidents in 2024 included the $305 million DMM Bitcoin hack, $50 million each from Upbit and Radiant Capital, and $16 million from Rain Management. In contrast, North Korea‚Äôs 2022 exploits frequently resulted in profits below $50 million. South Korea Arrests Impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol Meanwhile, South Korean authorities arrested Yoon Suk Yeol, the country‚Äôs impeached president. This is the first time a sitting South Korean leader has been taken into custody. The arrest was made on Jan. 15, after a warrant was executed by the Corruption Investigation Office. Around 80 police officers and investigators arrived at Yoon‚Äôs residence to detain him, according to Yonhap News Agency and CNN reports . Images circulating on social media appeared to show Yoon being escorted into a vehicle for questioning. The arrest stems from Yoon‚Äôs controversial martial law declaration on Dec. 3, which was overturned by South Korea‚Äôs legislature just six hours later. Yoon was impeached 11 days later, on Dec. 14. He justified the martial law by pointing to perceived threats from ‚ÄúNorth Korea‚Äôs communist forces‚Äù and a need to eliminate so-called ‚Äúanti-state elements.‚Äù While no charges have been formally laid, leading an insurrection is a grave crime in South Korea, and is punishable by life imprisonment or even death. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol The martial law had widespread ramifications, including a huge impact on South Korea‚Äôs cryptocurrency market. Trading platforms like Upbit experienced a liquidity crisis as Bitcoin prices dropped as low as 92 million Korean won ($65,000). Since Yoon‚Äôs impeachment, crypto prices paired with the Korean won were able to recover. UK Proposes Ransomware Payment Ban for Critical Sectors The UK government initiated a consultation to explore banning ransomware payments for operators of critical national infrastructure, like energy providers, healthcare services, and local councils. The proposal was announced on Jan. 14, and builds on an existing ban affecting government departments. Security Minister Dan Jarvis explained that the proposed measures seek to cut off ransomware groups from their financial lifelines, particularly crypto payments, which are commonly demanded by attackers. The main goal of the proposal is to protect national security and make essential services less attractive to cybercriminals. They include a ransomware payment prevention regime to guide victims, block payments to sanctioned groups, and mandate the reporting of ransomware incidents to help law enforcement target repeat offenders. The consultation will run until April 8. Just how urgent these measures are was proven by recent cyberattacks that caused major disruptions. In January of 2023, a ransomware attack on Royal Mail stopped international shipping , while an earlier attack on Advanced Computer Software Group in August of 2022 exposed the personal data of nearly 83,000 people. Over the 12 months ending August 2024, the National Cyber Security Centre managed 430 cyber incidents, including 13 deemed nationally significant. Ransomware is still considered to be the most immediate threat to the UK‚Äôs digital infrastructure. The National Cyber Security Centre‚Äôs 2024 Annual Review referred to incidents like the June attack on pathology laboratory Synnovis, which delayed medical procedures, and an October breach that compromised the British Library‚Äôs online systems.",News|Security,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-15 13:49:12

It has pared back some of the losses made on Monday as investors watch the ongoing trends in the DEX industry. So, will the SOL price explode higher to $300 as its DEX volume rise? Solana Price Could Benefit From Rising DEX Volume One catalyst for the SOL price is the ongoing performance of its decentralized exchange networks, which have continued to gain share. Data aggregated by DeFi Llama reveals that Solana has become the most active blockchain for DEX networks. Solana protocols handled $27 billion in the last seven days beating Ethereum, which processed $16 billion in the same period. Popular Solana DEX networks like Raydium, Lifinity, Orca, and Stabble are driving this growth. Solana DEX Volume Solana‚Äôs path to dominate the DEX industry is mostly because of meme coins like Pudgy Penguins, Bonk, dogwifhat, and Fartcoin. These coins have all accumulated a market cap of over $16 billion and their 24-hour volume rose to over $3 billion. The rising DEX volume in Solana is a good thing because it leads to higher fees in the network. Some of this fees is then passed to SOL holders in terms of staking rewards. The other potential catalyst for Solana price is rising odds that the SEC will give the go-ahead for a spot SOL ETF. Those odds have jumped to 74% , higher than this month‚Äôs low of 59%. In a note this week, JPMorgan predicted that Solana ETFs may gain between $3 billion and $6 billion in inflows if approved. A Solana ETF approval would be a big deal. For one, it would allow American institutional investors to allocate cash to one of the most popular cryptocurrency projects in the industry. SOL Price Technicals Are Sending Mixed Forecasts Solana price peaked at $264.75 on November 2023 as most coins were in a strong uptrend. It has now dropped and moved into a local bear market as sentiment in the crypto industry continued. On the positive side, SOL has retested the important support level at $188.15. This was a key price since it was its highest swing in May and July last year. That is a sign that it has formed a break and retest chart pattern. The value of SOL has also formed a double-bottom at $175. It also formed a falling wedge pattern comprising two falling and converging trendlines. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong breakout, and possibly retest the 2024 high of $265. A break above that level will signal more gains to $300. Solana Price Chart On the other side of the SOL price forecast , it has moved below the 50-weighted moving average. That could be a sign that the coin will have a bearish breakdown, potentially to $150.

Will Price Rally More?,https://coingape.com/trending/why-aixbt-hit-new-ath-today-will-price-rally-more/,"Aixbt by virtual (AIXBT) has captivated investors with its new milestone. It has created a new ATH at $0.745 after a significant surge within the last few days. The token gained substantial traction in the market and moved in a bullish trajectory for weeks. However, its decline and setbacks cannot be ignored. Let‚Äôs check the reasons behind AIXBT‚Äôs price surge to ATH and whether this crypto rally can be sustained or not. Reasons Behind The AIXBT Price Surge In the last 24 hours, the AIXBT token price surged more than 70% to push it to an ATH at $0.745. Although today‚Äôs surge was noteworthy, the token showed a bullish trajectory for days amid investors‚Äô demand and hype around AI-themed cryptocurrencies. An earlier CoinGape report revealed that AI cryptos will be among the most followed cryptocurrency trends in 2025 . This is already visible in AIXBT and a few other popular AI crypto performance Amid this demand and its performance on the charts, Binance listed AIXBT a few days ago. HashKey Global‚Äôs innovation also announced the listing, increasing its market visibility. This fuels the bulls‚Äô and investors‚Äô sentiments. According to the Coinglass derivative data , AIXBT‚Äôs open interest has surged to $154 million, almost doubled within a day. This surge was influential enough, but the rising trading volume fueled the price rally even higher. At present, the 24-hour trading volume is at $471.86M, showing rising network activity and growing investor confidence. The crypto whale activity is another factor to consider behind AIXBT‚Äôs rally to ATH. A new wallet address recently accumulated 3.06M AIXBT within just 42 hours and is earning significant profits on the investment. With such a bullish performance, investors are eyeing this token to hit $1 after this. Will AIXBT Price Rally Continue To $1? Amid the crypto market crash on January 13, AIXBT declined to $0.36, but the price has surged more than 100% since then. At present, it trades at $0.672 and has dropped 10% since the ATH earlier in the day, showing signs of consolidation. For this, $0.663 is the key support level, and a drop below this could initiate a downtrend. This could decline this AI coin‚Äôs price to 50% Fibonacci retracement, aligning with a low of $0.557. However, in contrast, support from this critical level could push the price to 161.8% Fibonacci extension level. With that, AIXBT could hit $0.99 or even the $1 mark with a 32% rally from the current level. Investors should eye the critical level and the possibility of trend reversal with increased volatility and ongoing correction. Bottom Line The hype around AI cryptos and agents has influenced AIXBT‚Äôs performance, as the token created a new ATH amid the consolidating crypto market. Although many altcoins are splurging with gains today, a few, like AIXBT, have gained significant momentum, rising more than 100% since its drop on January 13. At present, it trades at $0.672, and the continuity of the trade could influence it to hit $1 next. This is because the critical point lies at $0.663, and a surge above this could create an uptrend. However, a drop from the critical level could push AIXBT‚Äôs price to $0.557. The post Why AIXBT Hit New ATH Today?

The XDC Network ( XDC ) token soared to a high of $0.1240, representing a 427% increase from its lowest level in 2024. This surge has pushed the token‚Äôs market capitalization to over $1.7 billion. The rally occurred as the total value locked in the XDC Network ecosystem hit a record high of $31.4 million, up from a low of $3 million last year. The ecosystem‚Äôs biggest players include Fathom, XSwap Protocol, Wefi, and Prime Staking. XDC Network has continued to grow this month, with notable integrations from projects such as PillarX and Globiance. Developers are increasingly drawn to the network due to its superior features compared to Ethereum ( ETH ). The XDC Network can handle up to 2,000 transactions per second with extremely low transaction costs, an average of $0.00001 per transaction, and is more energy-efficient than most blockchains. A potential catalyst for further price gains could be additional exchange listings by major platforms like Binance, OKX, and Coinbase.

This recovery followed the formation of a golden cross pattern, where the 50-day Exponential Moving Average crossed above the 200-day EMA. This is a typically bullish technical signal. XDC also broke above the key resistance level at $0.1080, which had been the highest swing point since December 7. This breakout invalidated a potential double-top pattern that was forming. The Awesome Oscillator (the difference between the 34-period and 5-period simple moving average) has remained above the zero line since January 4, indicating sustained positive momentum. Additionally, the MVRV-Z score, which measures whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued, stands at 2.6. In technical analysis, a score below 3.8 suggests that the token is still relatively undervalued. Given these factors, XDC is likely to continue its upward trend, with bulls eyeing the next psychological resistance level at $0.1500. However, a drop below the key support level at $0.10 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

In December, inflation went up by 2.9% compared to last year, according to the latest Consumer Price Index . This shows how tough it is for the Federal Reserve to deal with price increases that are more persistent than expected. Core Inflation Slows at 3.2%, Less than Expected In December, consumers saw prices rise for various goods and services, but the year ended on a slightly positive note regarding inflation. The consumer price index went up by 0.4% for the month, leading to an annual inflation rate of 2.9%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics‚Äô Wednesday report. This matched economists‚Äô expectations from Dow Jones for the annual rate but was slightly higher than the predicted 0.3% monthly increase. Excluding food and energy, the core CPI rose at an annual rate of 3.2%, slightly down from the previous month and better than the anticipated 3.3%. On a monthly basis, the core measure increased by 0.2%, which was 0.1 percentage point below expectations. The recent report has now complicated the decision on interest rate for the Fed. In November, inflation rose by 0.1% to 2.7%, aligning with forecasts and marking a second consecutive month of increase, following a rise from 2.4% in September to 2.6% in October. This ongoing increase suggests rising inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy. Economists caution that continued inflation at this pace may prompt an adjustment in interest rates. This potential shift could affect different sectors and alter market trends. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SEC Chair Gensler Admits to Never Owning Crypto Ahead of Resignation and Ripple Deadline , Bitcoin Might Witness a Drop Toward $90K The recent CPI report has pushed Bitcoin price above $99K. However, this upward momentum is expected to slow down in the coming hours. Since mid-December 2024, Bitcoin‚Äôs value has fallen from $106,000 to approximately $97,000 by January 14, 2025. The derivatives market is too hot right now, and there‚Äôs a lot of open interest in Bitcoin futures, showing that there‚Äôs too much borrowing. Steno Research notes that this borrowing needs to be reduced, which might cause more selling. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar has hurt Bitcoin. After a strong jobs report on January 10 suggested that interest rate cuts might slow down, the dollar went up, and this made Bitcoin‚Äôs price drop. Over the past month, the correlation between BTC and Nasdaq has increased, reaching its highest level for 2024 with the current 30-day correlation. Moreover, the recent crypto rally has been somewhat restrained as investors worry about the possibility of the Federal Reserve maintaining higher interest rates for an extended period. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

High inflation can lead to interest rate hikes, which typically cause downward pressure on crypto prices, including Bitcoin. What is core inflation and why is it important for Bitcoin?

Thai BTC ETFs Could Be Listed On Local Exchanges Thailand is exploring the possibility of allowing Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be listed on its local exchanges. This move, championed by the country‚Äôs Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marks a significant step toward positioning Thailand as a leading digital asset hub. SEC Secretary-General Pornanong Budsaratragoon emphasized the need for adaptation in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, stating, ‚ÄúLike it or not, we have to move along with more adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide. We have to adapt and ensure that our investors have more options in crypto assets with proper protection.‚Äù Regulatory Shift Toward Bitcoin ETFs Previously, Thailand‚Äôs SEC had limited its approach to overseas spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing domestic funds to invest in these products but refraining from introducing direct investment tools. However, In January 2024, Gulf Binance, a joint venture between Binance and Gulf Innova, launched public crypto exchange services in Thailand. Then, in March 2024, asset management firms were permitted to launch funds targeting U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, primarily for institutional investors. One Asset Management capitalized on this by launching a fund-of-funds in June, offering exposure to international Bitcoin ETFs but restricting access to professional investors. Political Influence and Regional Dynamics The potential shift in policy aligns with broader regional trends in the Asia-Pacific, where nations like Singapore and Hong Kong have established crypto-friendly frameworks. Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has also advocated for a progressive stance on virtual assets, citing global trends and the crypto-friendly policies of incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. Thaksin proposed expanding stablecoin usage and issuance as part of a broader digital asset strategy. Rising Crypto Activity in Thailand Thailand‚Äôs digital asset market has gained momentum alongside a global crypto rally that saw Bitcoin reach record highs in 2024. Major players, such as Binance, have recognized the country‚Äôs potential. In parallel, the SEC is considering enabling local firms with high credit ratings to issue stablecoins backed by corporate bonds. This measure aims to broaden access to debt markets while reducing associated costs, reflecting a comprehensive approach to fostering digital asset innovation. Thailand currently stands at the crossroads of regulatory evolution and market expansion. If approved, these ETFs could strengthen the nation‚Äôs position as a digital asset hub, providing both individual and institutional investors with enhanced access to crypto markets.

The company is debt-free with strong financial health, and holds significant digital assets, but faces risks from crypto volatility and recent financial reporting errors. Relative valuation suggests a target price of $41.74, representing an 11% upside, but lacks a compelling investment case at this time. EXOD presents an opportunity to capitalize on crypto trading volumes and crypto assets both directly and indirectly. Introduciton Across the S&P500 ( SPY ) ratings are beginning to look a little overweight, with the P/E of the index's components sitting at a record high of 29.64, against the backdrop of a longterm median of 17.93 . Within the index, firms from the Information Technology sector (making up the largest sector component by market cap at 28%) are sitting at a P/E of 43.21, well above the weighted average of 29.64. Comparing Market Capitalization Weighted Average analyst ratings for the IT sector, IT scores a Seeking Alpha Quant rating of 3.38 (vs 3.41), Seeking Alpha analyst rating of 3.30 (vs 3.47). Only Wall Street Analysts hold more bullish positions on the sector compared to the index, at 4.29 (vs 4.10). Author Further, it would appear that Seeking Alpha analysts are slightly less bullish on the Information Technology stocks of the S&P500 overall, compared to the sector at large, with a weighted average 3.35 rating for IT stocks in the SPY vs 3.50 for the IT sector overall. Rating Whole Sector ( IT ) Sector - S&P500 ( IT ) SA Quant 3.14 3.38 SA Analyst 3.50 3.30 Wall Street 4.07 4.29 So how does this relate to Exodus Movement, Inc. ( EXOD )? EXOD has very little analyst coverage and appears to be relatively ‚Äúunheard of‚Äù, flying under the radar with a $1B market cap. We aim to initiate coverage of the stock for Seeking Alpha, setting a relative valuation price target, and to see how a seemingly unheard-of firm compares to it's sector and industry, amidst an environment where SPY component firms appear to be highly overweight and at risk of a downward correction. For the uninitiated, EXOD designed and runs a crypto currency trading platform described as ‚Äú‚Ä¶an un-hosted and self-custodial cryptocurrency software wallet,‚Äù, earning API fee revenues from third-parties it has partnered with to utilise it‚Äôs tech. The question to be answered in this article is: Can an ‚Äúunder the radar stock‚Äù outperform much larger rivals? Thesis Our belief is that EXOD outperforms it's near peers across several key metrics including profitability, however it falls short of the performance observed by the wider Software Application sector. We believe that there is an argument that EXOD deserves the attention of investors to watch the stock and await a more attractive valuation before striking. We believe this, because the firm has solid underlying financials and a double-exposure to crypto, both through direct crypto holdings, and profiting from crypto transaction volumes through it's third parties. Health Check We start by assessing the financial health of EXOD to get a picture of what we‚Äôre working with under-the-hood. See below our analysis spreadsheet. The firm carries no debts, and holds a formidable Quick Ratio and Current Ratio position, which has marginally trended downward since September 2023 but still remains a highly liquid position. Regarding the Debt Health Check, the firm does not require assessment in this space (note negative Net Debt results from cash and short term equivalents exceeding debts). Gross margins are solid, albeit below the sector median (58.6%) and well-below the application software industry median (73.2%). Income margins are where things start to get interesting, and this is due in part to the large holdings of crypto currencies, which have recently fluctuated in value and thus impacted the profit and loss with revaluations, creating volatility in EBITDA / operating margins. (Note: The FASB's new crypto standard ASU 2023-09 , ‚ÄúIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures‚Äù released in December 2023, allows entities to recognize both realised and unrealized gains or losses on the movement in crypto values if the assets are operational in nature - see below screengrabs from EXOD's 10-Q outlining these items) EXOD 10-Q EXOD 10-Q EXOD 10-Q The March 2024 quarter reflects a revaluation of EXOD's digital assets, where it recognised unrealized gains in digital assets of $52.8m, which explains the net income margin of 188.53% (a large increase in the asset value being recognized as profit, creating a situation where the firm has generated net profits above the total revenue for the period). Likewise, unrealised losses in the value of digital assets of $30.6m explains the significant negative result in June 2024. Seeking Alpha Interestingly, these crypto currencies sit on the balance sheet as ‚ÄúOther Intangibles‚Äù, listed in the 10-Q as ‚ÄúDigital Assets‚Äù ($124.867m) along with ‚ÄúSoftware assets‚Äù ($7.315m) and ‚ÄúIndefinite-Lived Assets‚Äù ($1.945m), suggesting that investors may miss these valuable assets when assessing the company if not looking closely through the 10-Ks or 10-Qs. Investors only interested in ‚ÄúTangible Book Value per Share‚Äù would be seeing a total tangible firm value of $56.82m ($2.12 per share) vs a Tangible Book Value per Share + Digital Assets of $181.68m ($6.78), suggesting a Price to TBVPS + Crypto ratio of 5.57. This would also suggest the real cash and short term equivalents balance should be $69.8m cash & ST Equivalents + $124.867m = $194.667, or $7.26 cash, ST Equivalents & Crypto per share. The firm does not pay dividends and therefore there is no analysis here. Lastly, the firm is not burning cash, and therefore this is not a concern. Author A difficulty in understanding the firm's cashflows is how it treats transactions and investments in crypto, which appear in both the operations component of the cashflow, and the investing. The difference is whether the firm treats the transaction as operational or as an investment. Per the firm's 10-Q, they define the difference in recognition of digital asset cashflow as: ""Digital assets that are received as noncash consideration in our revenue arrangements and sold for cash within seven days are presented as cash flows from operating activities, while other digital asset activity held longer than seven days is reflected as cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows"" Peer Comparison See the Peer Comparion on Seeking Alpha Here At a market cap of 1.06B, EXOD would be ranked 84th against the Application Software industry by market capitalization, with near-peers including: Quantum Computing Inc. ( QUBT ) Weave Communications, Inc. ( WEAV ) Viant Technology Inc. ( DSP ) PROS Holdings, Inc. ( PRO ) Blend Labs, Inc. ( BLND ) Notable, the firm outperforms it‚Äôs near-peers across a number of metrics including price to earnings (being one of the few profitable companies in the peer group), has a far safer risk-profile than the peer group thanks to it‚Äôs debt-free status, and outperforms on all income statement metrics. Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha Valuation Turning to a sector and industry relative pricing, we'll look to establish a price target based on historical performance. We‚Äôre unable to utilise price to cashflow as the firm is not generating free cashflow due to it‚Äôs investment activities. EXOD‚Äôs valuation based on the median sector and industry metrics does jump around quite a bit, but if we average these out to reduce some of the noise, we land on a valuation range of 34.04 to 49.45. Landing between these two is an average relative valuation of 41.74, representing an +11% price target for the firm. Author At this valuation, we would see EXOD move upward 8 places by market capitalization compared to the sector, and up 2 places in the Software Application industry, with a market capitalization of 1.177B. Author Growth Opportunities There are two key opportunities for value growth in EXOD. The first is the firm's direct exposure to crpyto, with circa $134m in digital assets on it's balance sheet at September 2024 (this balance will have likely increased dramatically to date given recent crypto moves). Bother Etherum and Bitcoin's prices to the 9th of January closed significantly higher than the what the price was at September 2024, post the US election which drove prices sky-high (Bitcoin is up 30% to date and Ethereum up 24%). These suggest that if the firm has made no changes to it's crypto portfolio, it is likely to recognize significant profits of $52.8m in unrecognized crypto gains. Author The big unknown here is what trades have occurred since the September quarter, and the US elections. The second key growth opportunity here is the firm's exposure to crypto trading volumes, which have grown dramatically following the US elections. The bonus exposure here is that EXOD profits from these volumes through it's partners, receiving API fees, meaning it profits regardless of the price of crypto. Cryptoslate While volumes have eased off slightly since December, crypto is likely to see heightened trading activity throughout the Trump presidency given his pro-crypto stance and moves to establish a strategic reserve. Risks Crypto is risky by it‚Äôs volatile nature, and given such a large portion of EXOD‚Äôs balance sheet is made up of digital assets, and by extension it's liquidity, this represents a large risk to the overall value of the company. The firm is also exposed to the solvency of it‚Äôs customers, being the partnerships it forms in the market with third-parties utilising the software to transact crypto and paying API fees. By extension, this also means that the firm is indirectly exposed to risk through a fall in the volume of crypto trading, as it‚Äôs likely many of these partners generate revenue from transaction volumes, rather than the price of crypto. A particularly interesting risk to EXOD is recent errors in their financial reporting due to a lack of qualified staff and internal controls. Detailed in the most recent 10-Q , the firm states the following: EXOD 10-Q This presents a serious risk to investors regarding the reliability of financial reports. Material misstatements being corrected in the future could result in significant changes in the financial position of the firm, and a negative impact on the firm. The firm further goes on to detail it‚Äôs remediation plan, including the hiring of additional personnel and a reorganisation of it‚Äôs internal controls. It‚Äôs worth noting that remediation efforts are continuing, and investors must be mindful that further restatements are possible in the future. Conclusion Overall, EXOD outperforms near-peers across a range of metrics, however against the industry at-large falls somewhat short. An attractive feature is the debt-free status of the firm, with an underlying exposure to crypto currencies through it‚Äôs digital assets balance, and further exposure to the crypto market through it‚Äôs B2B platform, but without the need to service debts putting the firm's solvency at risk if the value of crypto assets crash. Investors should be mindful of the recent financial restatements and ongoing remediation, as well as crypto market volatility overall. We rate EXOD as a HOLD at this valuation, with nothing to get particularly excited about but worth continued monitoring, awaiting a more attractive strike price.

Secondo il suo punto di vista, una tendenza fondamentale e ininterrotta sta spingendo l‚Äôasset verso nuovi traguardi. L‚Äôanalista prevede nuovi massimi storici per Bitcoin In un recente video su YouTube, rivolto ai suoi oltre 81.000 follower, l‚Äôanalista ha spiegato che il trend parabolico di Bitcoin potrebbe portare l‚Äôasset a raggiungere la soglia dei 124.000 dollari entro la met√† dell‚Äôanno. Successivamente, dopo una possibile correzione estiva, Bitcoin potrebbe registrare un ultimo rally esplosivo verso la fine del 2025. Analizzando il grafico settimanale, Svenson ha notato diversi segnali incoraggianti per l‚Äôasset crypto, come la formazione di una potenziale candela a martello. ‚ÄúIl trend parabolico di Bitcoin, visto sul grafico settimanale, appare solido. Il grafico settimanale sta tornando positivo. Sembra che si stia formando una candela a martello, che potrebbe anticipare la continuazione del trend rialzista‚Äù, ha affermato Svenson. Nonostante un recente allontanamento dalla linea di tendenza al rialzo, Bitcoin dimostra una notevole resilienza. Secondo l‚Äôanalista, anche in caso di ulteriori correzioni, l‚Äôasset potrebbe mantenere un trend rialzista di fondo, mantenendo minimi progressivamente pi√π elevati. Svenson ha sottolineato che la sua visione rimane positiva e non vede segnali di inversione di tendenza. Bitcoin verso i 160.000 dollari entro dieci mesi Secondo Svenson, Bitcoin si troverebbe attualmente nella quarta fase di un ciclo parabolico, con il potenziale per una forte impennata. ‚ÄúIn teoria, Bitcoin sta costruendo la quarta base di questo ciclo. Abbiamo gi√† visto le prime tre e ora siamo nella quarta. Potrebbe esserci una leggera correzione, ma ci√≤ che conta √® che ogni minimo sia progressivamente pi√π alto. Questo √® il segnale della creazione della quarta base, e il nostro punto di vendita si avvicina al prossimo obiettivo‚Äù, ha spiegato Svenson. Svenson stima un picco di 160.000 dollari entro i prossimi dieci mesi. L‚Äôanalista ipotizza che la crypto di maggior valore potrebbe proseguire la sua ascesa fino a raggiungere i 124.000 dollari entro la terza fase del ciclo, prima di rallentare. In seguito, potrebbe esserci una fase di consolidamento fino all‚Äôestate, seguita da una corsa finale verso la fine dell‚Äôanno, intorno a ottobre, quando dovrebbe iniziare il mercato ribassista. Bitcoin: Le previsioni degli esperti Le previsioni su Bitcoin sono diverse e contrastanti. Il gigante bancario Standard Chartered , che aveva previsto con precisione il traguardo dei 100.000 dollari, prevede un picco a 200.000 dollari, spinto dall‚Äôinteresse degli investitori istituzionali, mentre l‚Äòanalista Gert van Lagen ha rilasciato una previsione ancora pi√π bullish, stimando un obiettivo di prezzo di 300.000 dollari, basandosi sulla teoria delle onde di Elliott. Ma alcuni analisti, come Alan Santana , temono che se Bitcoin non dovesse superare la soglia 100.000 dollari, potrebbe crollare fino al livello di 40.000 dollari. Analisi del prezzo di Bitcoin Intanto Bitcoin ha ripreso slancio e ha recuperato la soglia dei 96.000 dollari. Al momento sta scambiando al livello di 96.952 dollari, con un leggero rialzo dello 0,25% nelle ultime 24 ore.Nel grafico settimanale ha accumulato un guadagno dell‚Äô1,27%, mentre in quello mensile ha registrato una perdita del 7,26%. Best Wallet: Il nuovo wallet Web3 che sta conquistando il mercato crypto Nel settore crypto la ricerca di soluzioni sempre pi√π avanzate, sicure e facili da usare √® una priorit√† per gli investitori. In questo scenario, emerge Best Wallet , un wallet Web3 self-custodial innovativo che sta rapidamente conquistando il mercato grazie alla sua interfaccia user-friendly e alle sue funzionalit√† all‚Äôavanguardia, ponendosi come alternativa ai wallet conosciuti come MetaMask. Il token BEST: vantaggi e opportunit√† per gli utenti Oltre alla gestione degli asset crypto, il wallet integra un DEX e presto lancer√† una carta di debito: Best Card .

South Korea to Develop New Crypto Law by Second Half of 2025 South Korea's top financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), held a meeting on Wednesday to outline focus areas for the upcoming legislation. FSC Vice Chairman Kim So-young emphasized that leading global economies are improving crypto regulations to protect investors and reduce regulatory uncertainty, and stressed the importance of South Korea following suit. The country‚Äôs first crypto regulatory framework, which came into effect in July 2024, introduced robust investor protections. Key measures included requiring exchanges to keep at least 80% of user funds in cold storage, separate from their own reserves. In the second phase, the FSC aims to take a ‚Äúcomprehensive and systematic approach‚Äù, addressing not only service providers but also market operations and user protections. Key Areas to Focus on Issues considered for the new framework include: Transparency in Crypto Listings: Improving disclosures for newly listed digital assets. Regulatory Parity with Traditional Finance: Applying the same disclosure requirements to crypto assets as seen in traditional finance sectors. Stablecoin Oversight: Review of global practices for reserve asset management and user redemption rights. With the upcoming framework, South Korea aims to strike a balance between encouraging innovation and providing strong investor protection, while aligning itself with global regulatory trends. *This is not investment advice.

On January 11, 2025, XRP broke out of a bullish flag and pole price action pattern. However, due to market uncertainty, it experienced a minor correction but managed to hold above the breakout level of $2.40. Rising Whales Transactions on XRP Network However, with significant attention from long-term holders and whales, XRP has breached its strong resistance level of $2.60, which it has been facing since December 7, 2024. Reason Behind XRP Price Rally Today, January 15, 2025, a prominent crypto expert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that whale transactions exceeding $1 million on the XRP network have been continuously rising. According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, these large transactions have occurred over 341 times in the past 24 hours, which might be driving today‚Äôs significant price rally.

XRP Price Action and Upcoming Levels With these recent developments, XRP appears bullish and is heading toward its all-time high. Based on the recent price action and the breakout of the bullish flag and pole pattern, there is a strong possibility that it could soar by 55% to reach the $4.45 level in the future. Source: Trading View However, this substantial price rally could also be influenced by President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, scheduled for January 20, 2025. At present, the crucial levels are $2.60, a strong support level that XRP needs to maintain if market sentiment changes, and $3, which currently acts as a modest resistance level that could pose a challenge for XRP in its upcoming rally. Current Price Momentum The potential closure of the SEC vs. Ripple case and the 341 transactions exceeding $1 million on the XRP network have caused XRP‚Äôs price to soar by more than 12% in the past 24 hours. Currently, it is trading near $2.85.

This boost was driven by Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly behavior and his commitments to position the U.S. as a leader in the crypto industry. Now, as expected, Trump‚Äôs newly appointed SEC is gearing up to update cryptocurrency policies, potentially as early as next week. US Crypto Market Is Set For Clear Regulations Republican leaders at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plan to update their cryptocurrency policies soon, possibly by next week, Reuters reports . This change is set to coincide with Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration as President. Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda are looking to start a process that might lead to clear rules or guidelines on when a cryptocurrency is considered a security. They also plan to review some ongoing cryptocurrency court cases, according to Reuters. These expected changes align with the views of Paul Atkins, Trump‚Äôs pick for SEC chair. Atkins, who previously served as an SEC commissioner, is known for his favorable views on cryptocurrency. He is expected to relax the strict crypto regulations implemented by President Biden‚Äôs Democratic SEC chair, Gary Gensler. Gensler has announced he will resign on January 20, the day Trump takes office. Under Gensler‚Äôs leadership, the SEC tackled concerns about fraud and market manipulation by taking legal action against major cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase and Kraken. The SEC claimed that these crypto tokens are similar to securities and therefore should comply with their regulations. Additionally, some of these cases involved fraud accusations. Trump‚Äôs SEC Will Review Crypto Cases In the starting days of the new administration, the SEC intends to examine some court cases and may halt those without fraud claims, with the possibility of dismissing some cases later. Many involved argue that cryptocurrencies are closer to commodities than securities and it‚Äôs unclear when SEC regulations should apply. They‚Äôve asked for new SEC rules to define when a token is a security. Commissioners Peirce and Uyeda plan to begin this rule-making by first asking for input from the industry and the public. The SEC is expected to soon withdraw accounting rules that have made it very expensive for publicly listed companies to hold cryptocurrency tokens for others. Additionally, President Trump, who promised to be a ‚Äúcrypto president‚Äù during his campaign and sought cryptocurrency donations, is likely to issue executive orders asking regulators to reassess their cryptocurrency policies, according to Reuters. Last month, Bitcoin hit a new high, surpassing $108,000, which has made many optimistic about the future of cryptocurrency. Leaders in the crypto industry are hopeful that the new administration will collaborate with them on creating clear rules instead of regulating through enforcement. The planned nomination of Paul Atkins, a supporter of cryptocurrency, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission could significantly help achieve this goal.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-15 15:32:59

Dessen Coin XRP sei ein Wertpapier und daher von Beginn an genehmigungspflichtig gewesen, argumentierte die amerikanische Wertpapieraufsicht SEC. Gary Gensler gibt auf Deren Chef Gary Gensler galt als Speerspitze im Kampf gegen Kryptow√§hrungen, entsprechend hartn√§ckig verfolgte er das Strafverfahren, das seine Beh√∂rde gegen Ripple angestrengt hatte. Das Unternehmen zog sich daraufhin aus dem US-Markt zur√ºck und k√§mpfte jahrelang verbissen f√ºr seine Chance. Nach einem Gerichtsurteil in den USA kehrte Ripple auf seinen Heimatmarkt zur√ºck, doch die SEC gab nicht auf und bek√§mpfte XRP weiterhin, wo sie nur konnte. Doch mit dem √ºberraschenden Comeback von Donald Trump an der Spitze der USA hat sich das Blatt scheinbar gewendet. Trump gilt mittlerweile als gro√üer Bef√ºrworter von Kryptow√§hrungen und hat damit gro√üe Erwartungen in der XRP-Community geweckt. Sein erstes ‚ÄûOpfer‚Äú war ausgerechnet der Chef der SEC h√∂chstpers√∂nlich. Gary Gensler wird mit Amtsantritt von Donald Trump zur√ºcktreten , sein Nachfolger ist bereits bestimmt. Ein Ende der Hexenjagd auf XRP? Paul Atkins gilt als Kryptobef√ºrworter, auf ihm ruhen jetzt alle Hoffnungen, dass er die ‚ÄûHexenjagd‚Äú gegen Ripple und XRP einstellt. Damit w√§ren die Weichen f√ºr neue Kursrekorde gestellt. Schlie√ülich f√ºhrte schon das Gerichtsurteil von 2023 dazu, dass der Kurs von Ripple in die H√∂he schoss. √Ñhnliche Tendenzen sind jetzt, angesichts der bevorstehenden Amtseinf√ºhrung von Donald Trump, wieder zu beobachten. Die Investoren glauben an mehr Freiheiten Die Investoren gehen offenbar fix davon aus, dass Trump seine Ank√ºndigungen wahr macht. Laut US-Medien sollen die ersten Schritte dazu bereits an seinem ersten Amtstag erfolgen. Das gibt den Hoffnungen Auftrieb, schlie√ülich ist XRP von Ripple weiterhin von seinem Allzeithoch aus dem Jahr 2018 entfernt. Damals betrug der Kurs 3,84 Dollar, aktuell liegt er bei 2,85 Dollar. Glaubt man den Kurssteigerungen der letzten Tage, dann ist die Community davon √ºberzeugt, dass jetzt alle Schleusen nach oben ge√∂ffnet werden. Schlie√ülich gilt Ripple als hervorragendes Produkt, das in der Lage ist, die Finanzwelt zu verbessern. Seine Produkte sind g√ºnstig, schnell und sicher. Daneben unterst√ºtzt es die Integration verschiedener W√§hrungen und Zahlungssysteme. Sollte der rechtliche Status von Ripple und XRP endg√ºltig au√üer Frage stehen, kann dies zu massiven Kursanstiegen f√ºhren. Werden jetzt alle Schleusen ge√∂ffnet? So glauben manche Analysten schon jetzt, dass es beim Kursziel von XRP kaum eine Grenze nach oben gibt. Sie verweisen auf die Vergangenheit, wo sich bereits √Ñhnliches ereignete. Donald Trump plant einen eigenen Krypto-Rat, der seine Vorschl√§ge in die Tat umsetzen soll. Erst Anweisungen sollen laut US-Medien bereits am ersten Tag seiner Amtszeit erfolgen. Erweisen sich diese Berichte als wahr, dann stehen Kryptow√§hrungen goldene Zeiten bevor. Neue Coins wie Mind of Pepe wittern Morgenluft Diese Aussichten befl√ºgeln den Kryptomarkt. Das gilt auch und vor allem f√ºr Meme-Coins, die sich inmitten eines Superzyklus befinden. Die positive Einstellung zum Kryptomarkt, die eine neue Regierung unter Donald Trump offenbar mitbringt, st√§rkt die Emittenten in ihren Absichten. Sie entwickeln neue Ans√§tze, die f√ºr K√§ufer attraktiv sind. Dazu zweifellos auch Mind of Pepe ($MIND). Der Meme-Coin erweitert das PEPE-Universum um einen weiteren starken Player. Anders als andere Token setzen die Emittenten hier uneingeschr√§nkt auf die disruptive Kraft von K√ºnstlicher Intelligenz. Sie soll sicherstellen, dass der Markt nicht nur tagesaktuell beobachtet wird, sondern auch entsprechenden Mehrwert generiert. Der KI-Agent von Mind of Pepe ($MIND) identifiziert Trends und sagt auf Basis seiner gesammelten Informationen Kursentwicklungen voraus. Das soll den Anlegern dabei helfen, keine Trends zu verschlafen und rechtzeitig zu investieren. K√ºnstliche Intelligenz unterst√ºtzt bei Anlageentscheidungen Die KI verbessert dabei ihre F√§higkeiten selbst und optimiert diese immer weiter. Die Anlageempfehlungen werden automatisiert √ºber gesch√ºtzte Kan√§le und Gruppen geteilt. Was auch immer der KI-Agent tut, bleibt f√ºr seine Nutzer transparent und nachvollziehbar. Dieser Filter agiert daher gleichzeitig als Medium, das sich auf die wirklich wertvollen Informationen konzentriert. Der Mind of Pepe Token ist derzeit noch zum g√ºnstigsten Preis von 0,0031134 Dollar im Presale zu bekommen, doch angesichts des Ansturms am ersten Tages steht die n√§chste Preiserh√∂hung bereits vor der T√ºr. K√§ufer sollten sich daher beeilen, um diesen Coin noch m√∂glichst g√ºnstig kaufen zu k√∂nnen.",Deutsch|XRP|Crypto XRP|Donald Trump|Mind of Pepe|Ripple,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-15 15:33:46

According to Chainalys‚Äô most recent year-in-review, 2024 witnessed a staggering $2.2 billion in stolen assets , representing a concerning 21.07% increase from the previous year‚Äôs figures. This uptick in criminal activity was largely attributed to a rise in hacking incidents, with 303 reported cases compared to 282 in 2023. However, perhaps most concerning was the growing influence of state-sponsored attacks, particularly from North Korean hackers responsible for an astonishing 61% of all stolen funds, amounting to $1.34 billion across 47 incidents. (L) Number of hacks vs value lost (R) Funds stolen by type of attack (source: Chainalysis ) Moreover, the report highlighted that peripheral issues ‚Äî such as DeFi platform vulnerabilities, private key compromises, and fraudulent investment schemes ‚Äî also played a major role in investors‚Äô hard-earned assets being lost to bad actors. To this point, during Q1 2024 alone, DeFi thefts accounted for 60% of all crypto heists, while private key compromises were responsible for 43.8% of stolen assets, thus showcasing the rapidly evolving nature of security challenges facing the industry. Fortifying existing exchange security protocols In response to these mounting threats, leading cryptocurrency exchanges seem to have implemented comprehensive security frameworks combining cutting-edge technologies with proven security practices. For instance, platforms have deployed multi-signature wallet systems while simultaneously maintaining the majority of their user‚Äôs assets in cold storage solutions ‚Äî thus keeping them physically disconnected from the internet. These cold storage solutions are often complemented by institutional-grade custody services and substantial insurance coverage, providing an additional layer of protection. Lastly, over the past few years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services into the security frameworks of different exchanges has been a game changer ‚Äî enabling real-time monitoring of suspicious activities and automatic flagging of potentially fraudulent transactions. If that wasn‚Äôt enough, the use of advanced encryption technologies, regular security audits, and partnerships with specialized blockchain security firms (such as Certik, Halborn, Hacken, etc) have become standard practice among most reputable exchanges, thereby creating a robust defense backline in a world replete with cyber threats. Building trust in a fraud-ridden ecosystem For individual crypto traders and investors, the foundation of their account security should ideally commence by implementing strong authentication measures and maintaining vigilant security practices. This includes using unique, complex passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly monitoring account activity for any suspicious transactions. In this context, VALR has presented itself as a one-stop crypto platform offering users a highly secure, regulated entity that is committed to keeping their funds safe while following local regulations. This unwavering commitment is best evidenced by its successful funding round, which saw the firm raise $55 million in equity from industry giants like Pantera Capital and Coinbase Ventures. VALR‚Äôs security-first approach has been instrumental in its remarkable growth trajectory, with the platform recently celebrating a milestone of one million users ‚Äì representing a 100% increase in just twelve months. The exchange‚Äôs ability to have attracted over 1,100 institutional and corporate clients has further helped cement its status as a forerunner within the industry. Moreover, VALR‚Äôs expansion beyond its South African roots, with more than 25% of its user base now originating from international markets, has showcased its burgeoning global appeal, especially in regions like Africa, Europe, MENA, and Asia. To this point, the exchange recently secured both the Category I and II crypto asset service provider (CASP) license from South Africa‚Äôs Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) as well as in Poland. Not only that, reports suggest that the company is in the process of pursuing additional licenses in Dubai and Mauritius as well. Lastly, back in November of last year, the exchange launched the world‚Äôs first Bitcoin and USDT perpetual futures pairs against the South African Rand ‚Äî thereby showcasing its ability to innovate while adhering to stringent security standards. Looking towards the future Despite the cryptocurrency market being plagued with a host of security breaches and scams over the past decade, entities like VALR are setting new standards for security and regulatory compliance, helping build a more equitable and trustworthy crypto ecosystem where investors of all pocket sizes can make their entry without any fear of losing their funds.

The British game studio revealed George Stobbart‚Äôs concept art in a recap video released in 2024. The teaser came after Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars Reforged Remastered was well received by gamers. The Broken Sword franchise started in 1996 and has remained Revolution Software‚Äôs biggest commercial success. Decades later, the game studio followed industry trends and started remastering the popular games for today‚Äôs audience. Revolution Software hints at Broken Sword 2 Happy Holidays from all of us at Revolution üéÑ‚ú®üïé‚ù§Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/5gde8lhgt3 ‚Äî Revolution Software (@RevSoftGames) December 23, 2024 Revolution Software posted a recap video featuring its founder, Charles Cecil, on December 24th, 2024, to review its achievements over the year. The video ended with a not-so-conspicuously placed drawing of George Stobbart, one of the game franchise‚Äôs protagonists, in a shorts and sunglasses outfit. The outfit is iconic because it is the one Stobbart wore in the point-and-click classic Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror . The video ended with Cecil shrugging while looking at the drawing as if to hint at the obvious. Broken Sword 2 was first released for PC and PlayStation in 1997 and became a commercial success. The game‚Äôs setting features George Stobbart, an American patent lawyer, and Nicole ‚ÄúNico‚Äù Collard, a French freelance journalist, as they uncover a conspiracy involving ancient Mayan stones. The two characters proceed to travel across the world in search of the stones to prevent the return of the trapped Mayan evil god Tezcatlipoca. The two protagonists also find themselves opposing Karzac, a drug smuggler who is hellbent on freeing the evil Mayan god. Broken Sword was first remastered in 2010 and released for OS X, iOS, Android, PC, and PlayStation. Revolution Software also included new features in the first remastered version to improve the player‚Äôs experience. Most notably, the studio added a diary, more artwork, a new hint system, and a cross-platform save system that allowed players to play the game across different devices and consoles simultaneously. In-game achievements were also added in 2011 for the PC and Mac versions of the game. Revolution Software is expected to work on remastering the point-and-click game again in the future. The studio also remained silent on when the new game iteration should be expected. The decision to remaster the game can be linked to the commercial success of Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars Reforged, released in 2024. Shadow of the Templars featured improved graphics, reanimated sprites, and enhanced audio. Gamers express support for remastered Broken Sword games Gamers online expressed their happiness on seeing the Broken Sword games being brought back into circulation. Some gamers said they enjoyed the nostalgia of playing the games with their loved ones many years later. Many gamers said that they were looking forward to seeing the teased game. ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs a great tease at the end! I was 12 in 1996. My daughter, 10, is hooked on BS1 just like I was all those years ago. It‚Äôs quite something to share this with her!‚Äô ‚Äì Grant B Some gamers also speculated on the release date of the remastered Broken Sword game. They speculated that the game would come out in 2026 since the studio was currently working on Broken Sword 6: Parzival‚Äôs Stone this year. Parzival‚Äôs Stone was announced in 2023 during the Xbox Gamescom conference, but the official release date has yet to be revealed.

According to the complaint , Musk started accumulating shares of Twitter common stock in early 2022 and, by March 14, had crossed the 5% stock ownership threshold. At this point, he was required to report his ownership in the company, but he failed to do so, the agency said. Federal securities law requires individuals to disclose their ownership of more than 5% of a publicly traded company‚Äôs stock within 10 days of reaching that threshold. Timely Disclosure However, Musk disclosed his ownership only 11 days after the report was due‚Äîon April 4, 2022. By this time, the tech billionaire had already acquired over 9% of Twitter stock. The securities watchdog argued that Musk‚Äôs failure to disclose allowed him to continue purchasing shares at ‚Äúartificially low prices‚Äù as the market was unaware of his significant stake. They claim this resulted in an unjust enrichment of at least $150 million from the stock acquisition during the 10 days. ‚ÄúInvestors who sold Twitter common stock during this period did so at artificially low prices and thus suffered substantial economic harm,‚Äù the complaint stated. The SEC seeks disgorgement of Musk‚Äôs unjust enrichment alongside prejudgment interest. Elon Musk Reacts In a statement on X, Musk responded to the suit, describing the SEC as a ‚Äútotally broken organization.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey spend their time on shit like this when there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished,‚Äù he added. Musk initiated the acquisition of Twitter in April 2022 and completed it in October of the same year for $44 billion. He has since transformed the platform by introducing features like account monetization, audio-video calls, an in-app AI chatbot , and long-form texts.

This significant movement suggests reduced selling pressure and growing confidence in LINK‚Äôs future, potentially paving the way for a bullish trend. Could this mark Chainlink‚Äôs next breakout? Can Chainlink Price Recover as Nearly $10M LINK Exits Exchanges According to Santiment , between December 20 and January 15, the supply of Chainlink on exchanges dropped from 226.90 to 217.23. Nearly 10 million LINK tokens have exited centralized platforms, representing a 4.30% decrease. This massive withdrawal reduces the available supply for sale, a critical factor that could signal less selling pressure and possible upward momentum for LINK price in the short term. Santiment LINK Supply on Exchanges The decrease in LINK tokens available on exchange suggest a reduced supply for sale, which may help ease selling pressure, especially following the crypto market crash on 13th January that impacted many assets. With fewer tokens up for grab, demand from buyers could surpass the selling activity, potentially triggering a price rebound. LINK Technical Analysis: Can Price Bounce? Between December 10, 2024 and January 15, Chainlink price formed a falling wedge pattern. This technical formation has a bullish bias and contains a set of lower highs and lower lows connected using trend lines. A decisive daily candlestick close above the upper trend line will confirm a breakout. In such a case, the target for LINK can be obtained by measuring the distance between the first swing high and swing low and adding it to the breakout point. For Chainlink, the measured move is 29%, adding this to the breakout point of $21.73, reveals a target of $28.17.In case of massive spike in buying pressure, this move could extend, pushing LINK to sweep the equal highs formed at $30.94. LINK/USDT 1-Day Chart Based on CoinGlass data, Over the past four hours, the long ratio has increased from 44.09% to 50.61%, showing that bulls are actively driving the Chainlink price higher.

The post caused fears of a possible hack when it appeared the account was compromised to create hype and exposure for a scam token. Coinmarketcap‚Äôs X account looked to have been compromised when it displayed a CA for an unknown token for over 50 minutes. It turned out the crypto market aggregator used its X platform to warn users that it has no official token and will not promote it with a direct link. The data platform did not lose access to its account, instead warning its community that the link could have easily been malicious. 1xCh3ck0utTh32o2425CmcY3Ar8o0kR1gHtn0w2vpump ‚Äî CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) January 15, 2025 Coinmarketcap was not compromised In this case, Coinmarketcap demonstrated how attacks often happen. The CA, ‚Äú1xCh3ck0utTh32o2425CmcY3Ar8o0kR1gHtn0w2vpump,‚Äù does not lead to a token. Instead, it links to the CMC crypto yearbook. Impersonation attacks on X are common, and most services recover their accounts afterward. However, account thefts can be very expensive, especially if they are used to distribute wallet-draining links. The Coinmarketcap impersonation drill came just days after the Litecoin account suffered a similar attack. Other recent hijacked accounts include PokerGPT and DAWN (@dawninternet). Reports point to a dozen X accounts compromised over the weekend, usually due to exploited logs on different devices. New wave of Solana scams use X account hacks X account hacks have become more common, affecting even prominent accounts like OpenAI . The attackers have switched from promoting Ethereum to Solana tokens. The chain allows for much easier token creation, either through Pump.fun or through a smart contract. The extremely low fees on Solana and the prevalence of trading bot users help attackers quickly gain more liquidity from FOMO buyers. The link distribution relies on the culture of sniping tokens early, often using bots to automate the process. Some of the recent account hijackings include WebWeaver. In that case, the attacker launched a live token, reaching the end of the bonding curve in 10 minutes and immediately rug-pulling all liquidity. The exploit was extremely fast and targeted, relying on the initial reaction of automated sniping. Since then, the REPLICATE token has been completely abandoned . Usually, risky tokens or other types of rug pulls or honeypots will only take minutes or seconds to inflict damage. Hacking a high-profile account can quickly increase traffic to the assets launched on other platforms. traders will probably become more skeptical of these types of attacks the more the pattern is repeated. Stolen accounts pose malicious link threats The token address posted in Coinmarketcap‚Äôs recent test was not dangerous or malicious. In other cases, hijacked X accounts may post riskier wallet-drainer links, requiring a wallet connection. For Ethereum users, the exposed wallets can be secured by revoking permissions. However, once a Solana wallet is exposed, it remains at risk and the user needs to migrate to a new address. The initial trend of posting CAs still required traders to engage with the token. Investigators noted the trend had shifted, and some of the hijacked accounts posted links requiring Telegram login credentials. While this looks safer than connecting a wallet, such malicious logins can steal private Telegram information. Using that data, hackers can hijack a user‚Äôs Telegram account and drain the funds of any trading bots linked to a wallet. Those attacks still rely on users not noticing the threat, with almost no active engagement from the hackers. A riskier type of attack often includes chats with attackers, who convince users to download malicious links. A recent attack identified by ScamSniffer includes a fake CloudFlare verification. Users may also be urged to open the command prompt and use ‚Äòclipboard verification,‚Äô which pastes a command line to download a malicious file.

Tim Scott urges crypto framework in Congress,https://crypto.news/sen-tim-scott-urges-crypto-framework-in-congress/,"Several U.S. policymakers have called for clear digital asset regulations as the nation enters a pro-crypto regulatory era under President-elect Donald Trump. Despite growing global adoption and significant advancements in the past 16 years, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have faced harsh regulatory opposition from U.S. agencies The Securities and Exchange Commission has been particularly critical, with the industry accusing the regulator of fostering an ‚Äúanti-crypto‚Äù stance. Notably, Coinbase sued the SEC for clarity, challenging the agency‚Äôs ‚Äúcome-in-and-register‚Äù rhetoric. In a newly released priority list, Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina stressed the need for Congress to establish a well-defined framework for digital asset oversight. Senator Scott‚Äôs document, addressed to the 119th U.S. Congress, criticized the SEC and its outgoing chair, Gary Gensler, for driving blockchain innovation offshore through unclear regulations and a restrictive approach. Under chair Gensler, the SEC refused to provide clarity to the cryptocurrency industry, which has forced projects overseas. Moving forward, the committee will work to build a regulatory framework that establishes a tailored pathway for the trading and custody of digital assets that will promote consumer choice, education, and protection and ensure compliance with any appropriate Bank Secrecy Act requirements Senator Tim Scott You might also like: Rep. Bryan Steil to chair House subcommittee on digital assets Pro-crypto policymakers fill key positions Senator Scott, who chairs the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, is now in a key position to shape financial policy, including cryptocurrency regulations. The committee has established its first crypto-focused subcommittee, which will be chaired by pro-Bitcoin Senator Cynthia Lummis. Ahead of his inauguration, Trump appeared to support crypto-friendly Republican lawmakers assuming leadership roles in critical Congressional committees. This move aligns with Trump‚Äôs plans to implement more flexible digital asset regulations.

Notably, an analyst has pointed to a wedge pattern forming on Bitcoin‚Äôs 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart as the precursor to this bullish upside move, while dismissing earlier projections of bearish momentum arising from a head-and-shoulders pattern. The Wedge Formation: A Breakout To $100,000? According to the analysis, which was posted on the TradingView platform, Bitcoin is currently trading within a falling wedge pattern, which is often seen as a bullish chart pattern in technical analysis. This falling wedge analysis outlook arose after the invalidation of a head-and-shoulder pattern that recently threatened to bring a bearish outlook to Bitcoin‚Äòs short-term price action. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Crash To $89,000 Reveals Where BTC Is Headed Next The crypto analyst dismissed prior concerns over this head-and-shoulders pattern, labeling it as ‚Äúfake‚Äù and has instead reinforced a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. This head-and-shoulders pattern had threatened to send Bitcoin below the $90,000 mark and essentially invalidate a bullish outlook for the leading cryptocurrency. As of now, there is a confirmation of a falling wedge pattern on the Bitcoin price chart. This falling wedge pattern has been in formation since December 17, when Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $108,135. Furthermore, this falling wedge has been highlighted by the formation of lower highs and lower lows, all of which are characteristic of the bullish pattern formation. Interestingly, recent price action in the past 24 hours has seen Bitcoin inching closer to the upper trendline of the falling wedge. With this formation now confirmed, the only thing left is for a substantial break above the upper trendline, which would send Bitcoin trading above $100,000. Bitcoin Price Now Bitcoin‚Äôs price movement over the past 24 hours has exhibited another minor bullish trend after a rebound from the $90,800 support level on January 13. This upward bounce comes after Bitcoin faced mounting pressure over the weekend and briefly threatened to dip below $90,000. Instead, the rebound has pushed Bitcoin‚Äôs price upward by 6.8% over the past 48 hours.

The cryptocurrency is just 3% shy of breaking above the upper trendline of the falling wedge pattern and registering what could be the end of the recent price correction. However, current trends in buying activity reveal a notable slowdown in investor participation, and it might reach towards the end of January and the beginning of February before the action of renewed interest begins.

At press time, a single Bitcoin was changing hands at $99,450. BTC price 24-hour chart. Source: Finbold The release of the U.S. Labor Department‚Äôs Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for December was the primary driver behind the surge. Although the CPI‚Äôs annual rate came in at the expected 2.9%, core inflation, which came in at 3.2%, was less severe than anticipated. While still a ways away from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs target inflation of 2%, the better-than-expected results helped assuage investors‚Äô worries regarding a potential rate rise. With such sharp and sudden moves at play, Finbold has decided to consult the advanced AI algorithm utilized by the cryptocurrency analytics and forecasting platform PricePredictions for a better overview as to which prices BTC could be trading by the end of January. Machine learning algorithm sets bullish predictions for Bitcoin prices Taking into account the myriad factors at play, the algorithm presented an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term price action. In fact, according to the forecast, BTC could breach the $100,000 mark once more within an hour after publication ‚Äî following which, it could reach prices slightly above $105,000 in a week‚Äôs time. Should the predictions come true, BTC would ultimately reach a price of $107,050 by January 31 ‚Äî however, further upward moves are also projected. BTC price prediction 30-day chart.

Technical indicators give out a bearish verdict, whereas the price charts confirm a rising bullish strength. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the approaching weeks can steadily increase the cryptocurrency‚Äôs value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the AMP above $0.015. Why is AMP up? AMP‚Äôs price has increased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a gain of 2.32% if observed over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00672 as the coin is under a bullish spell for now, moreover, the bulls remained on the lead this week. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP‚Äôs resistance level is at $0.008, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn‚Äôt impossible, as the coin achieved this level on December 3, 2024. Will AMP reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token‚Äôs launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP‚Äôs current market cap of only $630.88 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2025 and reach $0.0603 by 2031.

Japanese multinational conglomerate Sony is stepping into the blockchain spotlight with the launch of Soneium, its layer-2 solution built on the Ethereum network. Designed to ‚Äúunlock new possibilities, enhancing fan engagement and leveraging the transformative potential of web3 technology,‚Äù Soneium promises a future where creators, fans, and developers collaborate in a decentralized digital space, according to the Jan. 14 mainnet launch announcement .

Table of Contents What is Soneium Community backlash How Soneium‚Äôs censorship features work Soneium‚Äôs response What is Soneium Soneium is Sony‚Äôs bold leap into the web3 space. Built on the OP Stack from the Optimism Foundation, the layer-2 blockchain aims to bridge the gap between web2 and web3 users. The platform integrates Sony‚Äôs NFT-based Fan Marketing Platform and Soneium Spark, initiatives designed to support creators and offer fans unique experiences. Soneium also leverages Sony‚Äôs entertainment divisions ‚Äî Sony Pictures, Sony Music, and Sony Music Publishing ‚Äî bringing blockchain-based digital collectibles to fans as a gateway to exclusive content. The goal? To enhance fan engagement and foster deeper connections between creators and their audiences. . @soneium rugged users >$100k in ETH on launch day I've never seen anything like it Want to be a permissioned chain? fine. Instead of whitelisting developers, they chose to instead freeze contracts (effectively rugging users) Amazing launch! pic.twitter.com/OYWEb7Wiwg ‚Äî Kawz (@0xKawz) January 14, 2025 But Soneium isn‚Äôt just about fun and games. It‚Äôs packing tools to protect IP and promises fair profit-sharing, aiming to shake up digital creativity. Still, some in the crypto crowd are fuming, accusing the developers of rug-pulling investors with censorship features. Community backlash The launch hasn‚Äôt been without hiccups. While some celebrated Soneium‚Äôs launch, others expressed concerns over its approach to restricting certain blockchain activities. Co-founder of defi creator studio Pink Brains Ignas, commenting on Soneium‚Äôs launch, noted in an X post that all ‚Äúcurrent corporate L2s fall short and will probably never align with Ethereum, as their incentive structures differ.‚Äù Ethereum needs a community-driven L2. An L2 that mirrors Ethereum L1's values of fairness, decentralization, and value accrual to ETH. All current corporate L2s fall short and will probably never align with Ethereum, as their incentive structures differ. Today's Soneium launch‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/YtqybONChD ‚Äî Ignas | DeFi (@DefiIgnas) January 14, 2025 The backlash comes from Soneium‚Äôs policy of blacklisting addresses linked to IP violations or harmful actions. While meant to protect creators, it‚Äôs sparked debates over decentralization and fairness in web3, which is widely seen as a space built on openness, user autonomy, and resistance to centralized control. How Soneium‚Äôs censorship features work Soneium has a system in place to address unauthorized IP use and potentially harmful activities. When a violation is suspected, the platform adds the offending contract address to a ‚ÄúSuspected of IP infringement‚Äù list, according to the network‚Äôs documentation . The listing triggers a warning period, allowing developers to resolve issues without facing restrictions. If the issues aren‚Äôt resolved, the contract gets slapped on a restricted list. That means limited activities ‚Äî like cutting off public RPC access and even making it invisible on tools like Block Explorer. However, Soneium emphasizes that these actions are reversible. Once improvements are made, though, the contract‚Äôs status ‚Äúcan be reassessed,‚Äù the developers say, adding that labels ‚Äúmay be updated or removed following a thorough review.‚Äù Soneium‚Äôs response Soneium‚Äôs team has defended its policies, emphasizing their commitment to decentralization while safeguarding creators. Following the community‚Äôs backlash, the developers took to X to reaffirm users that the network remains ‚Äúcommitted to protecting creators‚Äô IPs and rights onchain while maintaining the spirit of decentralization!‚Äù ‚ÄúOur documentation outlines how we safeguard IP rights and combat malicious activities ‚Äì all while keeping web3‚Äôs core values of openness and innovation intact.‚Äù Soneium Crypto.news reached out to the Soneium team but didn‚Äôt hear back before publication. While Soneium‚Äôs director, Sota Watanabe, didn‚Äôt directly address the backlash, he did share in an X post after the community spoke out that the developers want to use the OP Stack to ‚Äúprotect creators‚Äô rights from IP infringements.‚Äù I knew it. The question is how to protect creators' rights from IP infringements while maintaining censorship resistance. The answer is Op Stack. https://t.co/eK6h4KQuwW ‚Äî Sota Watanabe üíø (@WatanabeSota) January 15, 2025 Despite the censorship features, there are still ways to get around them. 5/ Here's why this matters: OP Stack's design FORCES every L2 to inherit Ethereum's security guarantees. Sony can try to censor at the RPC level, but they can't stop users from forcing transactions through L1. pic.twitter.com/EWjkO5yYFj ‚Äî f(gautham)üí§ (@gauthamzzz) January 14, 2025 As Gautham Santhosh, founder of the Ethereum-based derivatives network Polynomial, explained in an X post , Sony might try censoring at the RPC level. Still, they can‚Äôt stop users from pushing transactions through Ethereum‚Äôs mainnet. This is because OP Stack‚Äôs design ‚Äúforces every l2 to inherit Ethereum‚Äôs security guarantees.‚Äù While Soneium seems to be having a bit of a rough start, Sony‚Äôs push to blend blockchain with everyday life could still set a new standard in web3. Whether the network can deliver on its promise of a fairer, more connected digital world or remain just another niche network with limited impact is yet to be seen.

The coin is up more than 15% in the last 24 hours, continuing a rally that started after a recent pullback. The timing coincides with the approaching inauguration of Donald Trump and the resignation of current SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Analyst Predictions: Could XRP Reach $10 or $27? Crypto analyst Cheeky Crypto said that support levels are crucial for continued bullish momentum. If the price maintains above key levels, XRP could see major upside, with some analysts predicting a price range of $10 to $11 in the near future‚Äî a big target compared to its recent trading range of $2.50 to $3. In fact, XRP has already made impressive strides, with some calling it a ‚Äúsleeping giant‚Äù after its surge to $3 today. The all-time high of around $3.40, reached in early 2018, now stands as a major target. NEW: $XRP hits $3 for the time since 2018. pic.twitter.com/Gnsu2tlmLK ‚Äî Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 15, 2025 The Role of Social Sentiment in XRP‚Äôs Rally XRP is currently benefiting from a positive social sentiment fueled by bullish technical indicators and endorsements from prominent analysts. This growing confidence has helped boost momentum, drawing in more traders and amplifying the excitement within the community. Why Retests Matter for XRP‚Äôs Price Move In technical analysis, a ‚Äúretest‚Äù is a critical sign of strength. For XRP, a successful retest of its upper boundary could mean that sellers lack enough power to push the price lower. This could pave the way for a more sustained rally, possibly leading XRP to new price heights, beyond its all-time high of $3.40. Could XRP Reach $27? Some crypto enthusiasts are even speculating that XRP could hit $27, a more than 10x increase from its current price. While this prediction may seem unrealistic, the crypto market has a history of surpassing expectations, especially with growing adoption by financial institutions and payment networks using XRP for cross-border transactions.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-15 16:09:21

Experts believe this DeFi token could be the best crypto to buy now, thanks to its innovative features. It offers eligible traders up to $500,000 in trading capital to help them scale their trading journey. Another standout feature is its staking system, which rewards token holders with steady returns, making it an attractive option for both passive income seekers and active traders. With these benefits, FXGuys is quickly gaining attention as a strong contender in the 2025 bull market. Could this DeFi token outperform its rivals and deliver massive gains in the 2025 bull market? Let‚Äôs find out! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE XRP‚Äôs Role in Banking Grows: Can Ripple‚Äôs DeFi Token Stay Bullish in the 2025 Bull Market? Ripple‚Äôs XRP is making headlines again, as David Stryzewski, CEO of Sound Planning Group, recently told FOX Business that Bank of America now uses XRP for all its internal transactions. If true, this could be a major shift in how large banks work with cryptocurrencies. Despite the positive Ripple news, XRP‚Äôs value dropped recently. XRP is valued at $2.375, a slight 1.17% decline from last week. Meanwhile, top Ripple experts believe that XRP will rise in the coming weeks as its adoption and popularity increase. This could see XRP‚Äôs value rise to $4.150 in the coming weeks and make it the best crypto to buy in the 2025 bull market. On the other hand, some Ripple experts are skeptical about investing in XRP due to its recent poor performance. If it fails to break the $2.46 resistance zone, it could fall as low as $2.10 soon. For investors seeking DeFi tokens to buy in the 2025 bull market, $FXG is emerging as a better alternative than Ripple‚Äôs XRP due to the former‚Äôs in-demand presale. Cardano Whales Dump 70 Million ADA, Sparking Price Concerns A recent report shows Cardano whales sold 70 million ADA tokens in just 48 hours . This move has raised fears about its impact on the ADA DeFi coin price. Trading activity for Cardano has also dropped sharply, with reports saying the trading volume fell over 30% to reach $2.28 billion. Consequently, ADA is struggling, and the ADA‚Äôs price currently stands at $0.95. This marks a 1.04% decline from last week, according to CoinMarketCap data. Moving forward, top experts forecast an uptrend for ADA due to its collaborations with other projects. This could push the value of Cardano‚Äôs ADA to $1.40 in a few weeks. On the other hand, with the negative changes in its on-chain metrics above, ADA could plummet further to $0.80 soon. FXGuys Becomes the Top Choice for DeFi Coin Traders in the 2025 Bull Market ADA and XRP holders flock to FXGuys because of its PropFi coin. Moreover, with features like a Trade2Earn model, the Trader Funding Program, and zero taxes, FXGuys stands out as a top crypto trading platform this year.

FXGuys offers up to $500,000 in trading capital to $FXG holders who pass its challenge phase. This helps new and experienced traders boost their income while learning how to trade crypto. The FX Guys platform also rewards active traders with an 80/20 profit split in their favor. Combined with the Trade2Earn model, which pays traders $FXG tokens for every trade, these features make FXGuys popular. Even those still sharpening their trading skills can benefit from extra tokens and potential profits. Profitability is often the top goal for traders. FXGuys introduces a staking feature that offers up to a 20% APY. Even if you lose on some trades, staking your tokens ensures you still earn.

However, the new PropFi coin, $FXG, has quickly gained interest as an exciting alternative in the market. Experts are already calling $FXG the best new crypto to buy. Its public presale is moving fast, with investors eager to grab their share. Some believe that just $100 invested in $FXG‚Äôs presale now could grow into $10,000 during this cycle.

During its initial launch in August 2020, CRV experienced a remarkable surge, with prices trading as high as $12.91. Subsequently, the token saw substantial gains, reaching impressive highs of $60.50 at one point. CRV experienced a notable price increase during the first few months of 2021 and performed well following the 2021 bull run in the cryptocurrency market. However, the prices continued to fluctuate throughout the rest of 2021 until they began to show some signs of stability towards the end of the year. In January 2022, CRV reached an intraday high of $6.74 on January 4th. However, the market sentiment shifted, leading to a decline, and the month closed with CRV trading at $3.30. February 2022 seemed to be relatively consistent for CRV as it was trading above $3 by mid-February. However, concerns about Russian aggression in Ukraine affected the overall market, causing a drop in CRV‚Äôs price. As of February 28th, the cryptocurrency was trading at around $2.20. After reaching its all-time high (ATH) price of $60.50 on August 14, 2020, Curve DAO has substantially declined, losing approximately 98.75% of its worth. Although a short-lived bull run in February 2023 boosted the token‚Äôs value to $1.2656, the current price has experienced a significant drop, indicating a decline of -40.02% compared to its value earlier in 2023. In April 2024, the price maintained its downward trajectory, showing minimal signs of recovery. In July 2024, the price of CRV reached approximately $0.29. The overall sentiment remained bearish, with sellers dominating the market and the price reflecting a prolonged period of decline. In August 2024, the price hovered around $0.50 to $0.55, showing stability with minor fluctuations. December 2024, prices stabilized around $0.80 to $0.85, showing consolidation. By mid-January 2025, the price fluctuated between $0.82 and $0.86, ending near $0.84.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|CRV|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-15 17:11:40

This remarkable boom was catalyzed by the launch of Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) meme coin, on Solana ( SOL ) in early October, which positioned AI agents as a rapidly emerging category within the space. The ‚Äú2024 Annual Crypto Industry Report‚Äù published by CoinGecko shed light on the fierce competition within the crypto AI agents market. By late 2024, Coinbase‚Äôs (NASDAQ: COIN ) Layer-2 (L2) network Base, had made significant inroads, claiming a portion of Solana‚Äôs market share through projects like AIXBT and Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ). 2024 AI agents Market Cap.

Volatility challenges the narrative Despite its explosive growth, the crypto AI agents market has faced significant volatility. After peaking at a $20 billion valuation in early January 2025, the market experienced a sharp correction, dropping 43.5% to $11.3 billion. However, it quickly rebounded, gaining 52.3% to reach $17.21 billion at press time, according to data from Cookie.fun. AI agent‚Äôs current market cap. Source: Cookie.fun. Currently, with the global cryptocurrency market cap standing at $3.62 trillion, AI agents account for 0.47% of the total market. While this reflects their growing influence, it also highlights their relatively small footprint in the broader crypto ecosystem. Earlier this year, on January 2, Finbold reported AI cryptocurrencies nearing the $11 billion market cap , again reflecting the exponential growth and volatility of this sector. AI agent market leaders Solana remains the leading network for crypto AI agents, commanding a 52.83% market share with a market capitalization of $9.9 billion, according to recent data . Base holds a significant 38.26% market share, valued at $7.17 billion, while other blockchains collectively account for the remaining 8.91%, or $1.67 billion, of the market cap. Although smaller networks hold a minor share, they are beginning to attract attention as the sector continues to grow, signaling increasing competition and innovation within the space. Moreover, several AI-based tokens have surged recently, driven by a Franklin Templeton report that predicts AI agents will revolutionize content generation on social media. PIPPIN led the rally with a 270% increase, followed by AIXBT, which rose by 77%, and AVA, climbing 60% over the past week. Meanwhile, VIRTUAL and GRIFFAIN posted gains of 5.7% and 30%, respectively.

In their statements, they express optimism about economic fundamentals but note that the government's next steps need to be clarified. Speaking about the broader economic outlook, Thomas Barkin noted that pricing behavior among companies is returning to pre-COVID-19 patterns. Encouragingly, the labor market appears to have stabilized, with the December unemployment rate providing further positive momentum. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much evidence to support the claim that the economy is weakening. Demand is strong, but it‚Äôs not booming,‚Äù Barkin said. Related News: BREAKING! US Inflation Data Released! What Was Bitcoin's (BTC) First Reaction? On inflation, Barkin offered reassurance that price pressures were easing, noting that the Fed was on track to return toward its 2% target. ‚ÄúWe can see potential paths for inflation to remain stable or continue to move toward our target,‚Äù he said. Barkin also touched on interest rates, noting that current long-term interest rates are consistent with levels seen in the early 2000s, a period characterized by minimal restrictions on business activity. He confirmed that there have been no recent changes in long-term interest rates that would require adjustments in Fed policy. Both Barkin and Williams expressed concern about the lack of detailed policy direction from President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. While Barkin acknowledged that the general direction on issues such as tariffs is beginning to become clear, specific details remain elusive. Williams echoed that sentiment, noting that uncertainty about government policy was holding back some trade developments. ‚ÄúThe Fed is currently in a wait-and-see mode to see what our elected officials do on policy,‚Äù he said. Williams shared additional insights into key economic factors: Inflation: He noted that some of the decline in inflation was due to factors outside the US and that the trend showed a broad base. Housing Market: Demand for housing remains strong, contributing to overall economic stability. Neutral Interest Rate: Williams suggested that higher public debt could affect the neutral interest rate, but that it is not currently a major factor in monetary policy decisions. *This is not investment advice.

Accordingly, the new SEC administration that Trump will choose is currently reviewing some cryptocurrency cases pending in the courts. At that point, the new SEC could freeze cases that do not involve allegations of fraud. Crypto-friendly nominee Paul Atkins is expected to end President Biden‚Äôs crackdown on cryptocurrencies driven by Democratic SEC chairman Gary Gensler, but it is not yet clear when the Senate will confirm Atkins. Gensler‚Äôs SEC, concerned about fraud and market manipulation, has initiated at least 83 crypto-related enforcement actions, but is expected to begin reviewing those cases in the first few days of the new administration and freeze some cases that do not involve allegations of fraud, sources told Reuters. Some of those cases could even be dropped. As is known, the SEC filed lawsuits against leading exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken. In these lawsuits, the SEC claimed that the exchanges were offering cryptocurrencies that were actually securities and were not complying with SEC rules. *This is not investment advice.

It‚Äôs currently trading between $12.14 and $15.38, testing support around $10.64. Despite recent drops in the week and month, there‚Äôs optimism. Over the last 6 months, UNI‚Äôs price surged over 62%. The current RSI is around the neutral mark, offering room for upward movement. With the stochastic in the high range, momentum might carry UNI upwards. If it breaks past $17, it could aim for $20, marking a 30% rise from the lower end of its current range. Watch the next few days for any bullish momentum that could spark a rally. FET Poised for a Bullish Breakout: Will It Hit New Highs? Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is currently in an exciting price range between $1.15 and $1.55. Despite recent dips, the price movement hints at potential growth. With the next resistance level at $1.80 and a second one at $2.20, FET could see a significant rise, possibly around 15-40% if it breaks through these barriers. The Simple Moving Averages are steady, and the RSI‚Äôs neutral level suggests room for upward momentum. A high Stochastic of nearly 91 indicates a potential bullish run. Though the recent trend shows a downward shift, FET‚Äôs underlying potential makes it a strong contender for a rebound in the upcoming altcoin season. Algorand Poised for Breakout Amid Bullish Trends Algorand (ALGO) is making waves again, caught in a price range between $0.32 and $0.42. With support at $0.28 and resistance at $0.47, it‚Äôs showing potential to break higher. The recent dips in week and month charts haven‚Äôt dampened long-term optimism, with a 6-month surge over 100%. The RSI is stable, hinting at potential upward momentum, while a high stochastic points to enthusiasm. If ALGO pushes past the $0.47 resistance, climbing to around $0.57 in the near-term is possible, marking a nearly 40% leap. As altcoins gear up for action, Algorand enthusiasts see a bright horizon ahead. MAGA Coin Eyes Potential Surge Despite Recent Volatility The MAGA (TRUMP) coin is experiencing a dynamic phase. Currently priced between $2.16 and $3.61, it shows potential for growth. With its nearest resistance level at $4.46, a successful break could push it higher, possibly aiming for the $5.90 mark, which would mark significant gains from the current range. In the last month, its value jumped over 68%, signaling revived interest. The RSI of 54.66 suggests it‚Äôs not overbought yet, despite a high stochastic of 90.53 indicating caution. If the coin can maintain momentum, it could attract more attention, pushing prices even higher. Stay tuned as this coin may navigate through resistance levels on its path to growth. Conclusion While UNI, FET, ALGO, and TRUMP show less short-term potential, Catzilla rises as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom. With a 700% ROI potential in its presale and triple utility features, Catzilla unites enthusiasts to fight crypto villains by acquiring $CATZILLA tokens.

But Kaspa hasn‚Äôt been lucky and has been seeing negative returns as the digital gold rush heads to the new iGaming token Rollblock (RBLK). Let‚Äôs examine why FOMO is through the roof as crypto experts predict RBLK might blast 50x upon its launch in the open market. FOMO spikes on Rollblock‚Äôs 50x potential Rollblock is a new iGaming platform on the Ethereum network that continues to dominate the iGaming presale market. The ICO has garnered over $8.6 million , sparking FOMO as the RBLK token price skyrockets 350%! However, analysts say RBLK is still in the early stages of its growth. The altcoin is expected to pull another 530% presale blast, and could surge 50x once launched in the open market. Rollblock witnessed a 600% spike in new signups last month, with more than $1.75 million of wagered bets placed thanks to its focus on providing a transparent gaming environment. All player activity is recorded on-chain where players can publicly verify the authenticity of bets. Besides, the iGaming titan sets aside a portion of its weekly profits for token buybacks from the open market. 60% of these are burned to create a deflationary token mechanism for RBLK, while the rest are paid out to players and investors, with users earning up to 30% APY! Will SUI dethrone Solana? SUI is becoming a top choice for deploying dApps, from gaming and DeFi to stablecoins and social applications. That has driven SUI‚Äôs TVL past $2 million, quickly gaining on Solana. The SUI price has also surged up over 400% in the last six months, reaching a new ATH in the $5.3 zone. After a slight pullback to $4.5, SUI now retains a fantastic 254% year-to-date return, trouncing SOL, which has been collapsing lately. Solana tumbles over 18% monthly Though SUI is growing fast, it still has a substantial distance to cover before catching up with Solana, which boasts an $8.56 TVL. However, there‚Äôs no denying that SUI has been bashing SOL in crypto returns. Year-to-date, SOL was only up about 99%. That‚Äôs after collapsing over 18% in the past month, sliding back to the $180 zone. If the ongoing marketwide correction continues, SOL could hurtle down to the $160 zone where its major support lies. Kaspa (KAS) shows no progress As SUI grows, Kaspa continues to dwindle. Over the past year, the KAS price registered a 0.88% loss, losing over 28% of its value in the past month alone. This has brought KAS down to $0.11, slipping out of the top 50 crypto-list to rank at 47. Despite its recent listing on the Nexo exchange, KAS appears to struggle to attract new buyers. KAS investors now fear that the asset might continue collapsing in the coming weeks, and may sweep below $0.1 to retest support in the $0.07 zone. Disheartened KAS holders are now seeking refuge in the Rollblock presale. Investors are lining up for RBLK RBLK tokens are going for $0.045 in stage 9 presale, and the price is set to jot to $0.052 in stage 10. Investors have scooped over 45 million RBLK over the past weeks, and only about 24 million tokens remain before the next price uptick.

Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law (TRUMPLAW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPLAW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law by entering its contract address ‚Äì 7mYansF38wyaSvnj7C1Gr536FdMbGA4ufqY7PwzC7CxM ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPLAW.

The surge represents a significant shift in market dynamics, with XRP showing signs of resilience and a potential breakout on the horizon. Supported by growing buying interest and favorable technical signals, the altcoin is setting the stage for what could be a decisive move upward. As the asset inches closer to this pivotal level, traders are carefully monitoring its price action. A successful breakout would reinforce the bulls‚Äô control and attract further interest, while a rejection could prompt a reassessment of market strategies. This moment may be a defining one for XRP since its ability to conquer $2.9 serves as a key indicator of its future direction. A $2.9 Level In Sight As XRP Rally Gains Momentum XRP‚Äôs price has demonstrated considerable resilience after a failed attempt to break below the 4-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA), an indicator that acts as a dynamic support or resistance level. This failed breakdown highlights the strength of the buyers, who quickly stepped in to defend the price above the SMA. Related Reading: XRP Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle Pattern, Why The Target Is $8 In the aftermath, XRP experienced a series of bullish candlesticks, reflecting increasing investor confidence and a growing demand for the cryptocurrency. The strong upward momentum has pushed XRP closer to the key $2.9 resistance level, a critical point in determining the next phase of price action. A successful break above this resistance could set the stage for a more sustained rally, opening the door to higher price targets. If the bulls manage to maintain control and surpass this level, the market may experience a surge of buying interest as traders look to capitalize on the breakout. Moreover, technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggest that buyers are currently in control of the market. The RSI line has surged well above the 50% threshold and is now firmly in the overbought zone, indicating strong bullish momentum. As the RSI rises, it further supports the view that the bulls are driving the market. Nonetheless, caution is advised as the overbought territory often signals the possibility of a price correction if buying pressure begins to wane. Bulls Pushing Toward Key Resistance: What‚Äôs Next? XRP‚Äôs price has built significant strength, with bulls pushing it toward the key $2.9 resistance level. As the price approaches this threshold, a breakout above $2.9 could lead to more gains, potentially forming new highs. However, the $2.9 resistance remains a formidable hurdle. Related Reading: XRP Could Skyrocket 470% If History Repeats, SuperTrend Indicator Suggests If XRP fails to clear this level, it might face a pullback as traders may take profits or become more cautious, causing the price to retract.

These coins aren‚Äôt just digital currencies‚Äîthey‚Äôre solving real-world problems, streamlining industries, and empowering investors. From Qubetics‚Äô groundbreaking interoperability to Quant‚Äôs enterprise-grade blockchain solutions and Ondo‚Äôs yield-focused strategies, each coin brings its unique flair to the crypto market. Among these, Qubetics stands out with a presale that‚Äôs already raised $9.6 million in its 17th stage. Over 419 million tokens have been sold to 14,500 holders, with $TICS tokens priced at just $0.0501. It‚Äôs no surprise that people are calling it one of the best coins to buy today. Let‚Äôs break down what makes these projects so compelling, starting with the rising star, Qubetics. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Interoperability Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining what blockchain can do with its unparalleled focus on interoperability. In a world where blockchains often function as isolated ecosystems, Qubetics‚Äô technology ensures seamless communication and data sharing between different networks. It‚Äôs like creating a universal translator for blockchain‚Äîa tool that‚Äôs essential as industries continue adopting decentralized technologies. Think about the challenges businesses face today. A supply chain company in Atlanta might rely on one blockchain for logistics while its financial arm uses another for payments. These systems rarely communicate, causing delays and inefficiencies. Qubetics solves this by enabling blockchains to ‚Äútalk‚Äù to each other, ensuring smooth transactions and data flow. Take it one step further: imagine a digital artist selling NFTs across multiple platforms. Qubetics‚Äô interoperability ensures that their NFTs remain accessible and verifiable on any blockchain, making transactions seamless for both creators and buyers. Its presale success is a testament to its potential. The 17th stage of the Qubetics presale has already sold over 419 million tokens, raising more than $9.6 million. Early adopters can buy $TICS tokens at $0.0501, a steal considering the buzz around this project. Additionally, Qubetics‚Äô partnership with SWFT Blockchain amplifies its capabilities, enabling easy cross-chain swaps and enhanced user experience. When it comes to finding the best coins to buy today , Qubetics checks every box. Its focus on real-world solutions and interoperability sets it apart in a crowded market. Quant: Connecting Enterprises with Blockchain Power Quant is the go-to project for enterprises looking to leverage blockchain without compromising on scalability or efficiency. Its Overledger Network is the magic sauce, allowing businesses to integrate blockchain into their operations without overhauling existing infrastructure. Imagine a healthcare provider in Boston looking to secure patient records. Quant‚Äôs technology lets them utilize blockchain for privacy and transparency while still connecting with traditional databases. That‚Äôs a game-changer for industries like finance, healthcare, and supply chain, where security and compliance are critical. Quant‚Äôs mission is ambitious but straightforward: make blockchain accessible for enterprises. Its API-based system allows companies to plug blockchain capabilities into their existing frameworks, reducing barriers to adoption. For instance, a bank can use Quant to streamline cross-border payments, slashing transaction times from days to seconds while cutting costs. What‚Äôs exciting is Quant‚Äôs ability to adapt to various industries. Whether it‚Äôs tokenizing assets, managing digital identities, or enhancing supply chain visibility, Quant is becoming a favorite among enterprises. It‚Äôs no wonder it‚Äôs often recommended as one of the best coins to buy today for investors seeking long-term stability and growth. Ondo: Pioneering Yield Strategies for a New Era Ondo has carved a niche for itself by focusing on decentralized finance (DeFi) yield strategies. Its primary goal? Making high-yield opportunities accessible to everyday investors while maintaining transparency and security. Ondo‚Äôs approach to DeFi is unique because it bridges traditional finance with blockchain-based innovation. Picture this: an investor in San Francisco wants to earn passive income without diving deep into complex DeFi protocols. Ondo simplifies the process by offering structured yield products that are easy to understand and use. One standout feature is Ondo‚Äôs emphasis on risk management. Unlike many DeFi platforms that leave users exposed to market volatility, Ondo‚Äôs products are designed to offer stability and predictable returns. For instance, a retiree in Chicago could invest in a fixed-income product offered by Ondo, combining blockchain efficiency with the reliability of traditional finance. Ondo‚Äôs vision extends beyond individual investors. Its solutions are being adopted by institutions looking to maximize returns on idle assets while benefiting from blockchain‚Äôs transparency. This dual appeal to retail and institutional players makes it a strong contender among the best coins to buy today. Interoperability: The Key to Blockchain‚Äôs Future At the heart of Qubetics‚Äô innovation lies interoperability‚Äîa concept that‚Äôs critical for blockchain‚Äôs next big leap. Without it, blockchains remain siloed, limiting their potential to revolutionize industries. Think of interoperability as a highway system connecting different cities. Without those highways, traveling between cities would be inefficient and time-consuming. Similarly, Qubetics‚Äô interoperability connects various blockchains, enabling smooth data and transaction flows . For professionals, this could mean integrating blockchain-based payroll systems with accounting software. For individuals, it could simplify managing digital assets across multiple wallets. The possibilities are endless, and Qubetics is leading the charge to make interoperability a standard feature in the blockchain ecosystem. It‚Äôs this kind of innovation that makes Qubetics one of the best coins to buy today . By focusing on solving a real-world problem, it‚Äôs paving the way for a more connected and efficient blockchain future. Conclusion: The Best Coins to Buy Today In a market overflowing with choices, Qubetics ($TICS), Quant, and Ondo stand out for their unique value propositions. Qubetics‚Äô focus on interoperability is setting new standards for blockchain connectivity, while Quant empowers enterprises to unlock blockchain‚Äôs potential. Ondo, on the other hand, is revolutionizing DeFi with accessible and secure yield strategies. For investors, the Qubetics presale presents an unmatched opportunity. With $TICS tokens priced at $0.0501, now is the perfect time to get involved in a project that‚Äôs solving real-world challenges and shaping the future of blockchain. Don‚Äôt miss out on these trailblazing projects. The crypto world is evolving‚Äîbe part of the change!

Trump‚Äôs pick for SEC chair, Paul Atkins, is a crypto fanboy who‚Äôs expected to pull the agency out of Gary Gensler‚Äôs enforcement-heavy era. But Atkins‚Äô Senate confirmation hasn‚Äôt happened yet, so the torch is temporarily with commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda. These two are already drafting plans to untangle the messy web of crypto regulations left behind. The first item on their agenda? Defining when a digital token is a security. This issue has haunted the crypto industry for years, with no clear answers. Peirce and Uyeda aim to start a public feedback process that will lead to new rules. But that‚Äôs not all. They‚Äôre also diving into lawsuits that the SEC under Gary filed against crypto firms like Coinbase and Kraken. A review is in the works to decide which cases to keep and which to scrap. Gary Gensler‚Äôs SEC left a trail of lawsuits During Gary‚Äôs tenure, the SEC filed over 83 crypto-related enforcement actions. That‚Äôs not a typo‚Äî83. His team accused tokens of acting like securities and went after companies for allegedly breaking the rules. Many of these cases are still tangled up in court. But now, Peirce and Uyeda are putting the brakes on this frenzy. Two sources say they plan to pause litigation that doesn‚Äôt involve outright fraud. Some cases might even get dropped entirely. For companies caught in the crossfire, this is huge. Crypto firms have long argued that the SEC rules are unclear and that cryptos are more like commodities than securities. Peirce and Uyeda want to finally bring clarity. But clarity doesn‚Äôt come easy. Lawyers warn that dropping enforcement cases could create chaos. ‚ÄúDismissing dozens of cases would be unprecedented,‚Äù said Philip Moustakis, a former SEC attorney. ‚ÄúIt could look like enforcement is being politicized.‚Äù Courts might even object. If scrapping cases isn‚Äôt feasible, the SEC might try reopening settlement talks. That‚Äôs the norm in enforcement cases‚Äîcompanies negotiate to avoid drawn-out lawsuits. But under Gary, many crypto firms complained that the SEC wasn‚Äôt willing to come to the table. Trump‚Äôs crypto revolution Trump is expected to issue executive orders pushing all federal regulators to rethink their crypto policies. During his campaign, Trump called himself a ‚Äúcrypto president‚Äù and courted donations from the blockchain crowd. Bitcoin is already feeling the love. It broke $100,000 in December, fueled by the hype around Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly agenda. And it‚Äôs not just Bitcoin‚ÄîEthereum and other major tokens have been riding the wave too. Meanwhile, Peirce and Uyeda are also looking to undo some of Gary‚Äôs less popular decisions. One target is the accounting guidance that made it insanely expensive for companies to hold crypto for others. Businesses have been begging for this rule to go, and it looks like they‚Äôll get their wish. But don‚Äôt think this means the SEC is going soft. Fraudsters are still in the crosshairs. And even with all these plans, don‚Äôt expect instant results. Rulemaking is slow, and resolving legal battles takes time. But the winds of change are blowing, and the crypto industry is watching closely. Trump‚Äôs administration has promised a fresh start, and for now, it looks like they‚Äôre delivering.

The report shows a clear shift away from Bitcoin ( BTC ), which previously dominated the cryptocurrency landscape for criminal activity. Now, 63% of all illicit cryptocurrency transactions involve stablecoin assets. However, some forms of crypto crime, such as ransomware and darknet market (DNM) sales , still remain Bitcoin-dominated. Cybercriminals are increasingly using stablecoins. Source: The Chainalysis 2025 Crypto Crime Report While the rise of stablecoins in illicit activities is concerning, Chainalysis analysts highlighted in the report that stablecoin issuers often actively combat their misuse. For example, Tether ( USDT ) has a track record of freezing addresses associated with scams, terrorist financing, and sanctions evasion, making stablecoins a less attractive option for some illicit actors. Scale of Crypto Crime in 2024 Chainalysys also estimates that $40.9 billion was received by illicit addresses in 2024. However, this figure likely underestimates the true scale of crypto crime, with historical trends suggesting the actual figure may be closer to $51 billion. This represents approximately 0.14% of total on-chain transaction volume. 0.14% of total on-chain transactions were illicit in 2024. Source: The Chainalysis 2025 Crypto Crime Report Ransomware remains a persistent threat, generating substantial revenue for criminals. However, a combination of law enforcement actions and a decline in victim willingness to pay ransoms has somewhat tempered their impact, according to the report. The report also highlights a significant decline in darknet market activity and fraud shop volumes. A major factor contributing to this decrease was the successful law enforcement takedown of Universal Anonymous Payment System (UAPS), a crypto payment processor utilized by numerous fraud shops . Crypto Theft Surged 21% in 2024 Chainalysys confirms in its report a concerning rise in stolen funds, with a 21% year-over-year increase to $2.2 billion. While decentralized finance (DeFi) services have been frequent targets, centralized exchanges experienced a surge in attacks during the second and third quarters of 2024. Private key compromises were the most common method of theft, accounting for almost 44% of all stolen crypto. North Korean hacking groups represent 61% of the total stolen funds, siphoning off a record-breaking $1.34 billion from crypto platforms. These attacks often involve sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by North Korean IT workers who have infiltrated crypto and Web3 companies, compromising their internal networks. The USA, Japan and South Korea released a joint statement, detailing North Korea-linked crypto thefts and their targeted entities. #NorthKorea #CryptoThefts #LazarusGroup https://t.co/uTkzpYvnTe ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 15, 2025 New Threats in the Crypto Crime Landscape Chainalysis also highlighted another disturbing trend: the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in fraudulent activities . Highly personalized sextortion attacks enabled by AI-powered tools are becoming more common, as per the report. Beyond these specific trends, the report emphasizes the increasing sophistication and professionalization of the crypto crime ecosystem. Criminal networks are increasingly leveraging cryptocurrencies for a wide range of illicit activities and even engaging in ‚Äúpolycrime,‚Äù utilizing cryptocurrencies to facilitate multiple crime types simultaneously. Finally, the report underscores the emergence of highly organized and professionalized entities within the crypto crime landscape. As an example of the professionalization of the cryptocrime ecosystem, Chainalysis cites the Huione Guarantee platform, which has provided infrastructure for the sale of fraud technology and handled transactions for a wide range of illicit activities . Since 2021, Huione and all vendors operating on their platform have processed more than $70 billion in crypto transactions.

Additionally, he separated the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market cap from other tokens, saying they still have to prove their actual value. A Clear Distinction for Bitcoin, Ethereum Gensler made the statements in exit interviews with Yahoo Finance and CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box, where he reflected on his tenure, which ends as the Trump administration prepares to take office. Speaking with Yahoo Finance‚Äôs Jennifer Schonberger, the agency head made it clear that the SEC had never classified BTC and ETH as securities. ‚ÄúMy predecessor and I, we‚Äôve never said Bitcoin is a security. We haven‚Äôt said Ethereum is a security,‚Äù Gensler declared. Interestingly, his assertions appear contradictory, especially regarding Ethereum. A filing from April 2024 revealed that the agency had believed for at least a year that ETH was an unregistered security that had been trading in violation of pertinent laws. However, there seems to be no ambiguity regarding Bitcoin, with Gensler reiterating its status on his CNBC appearance , stating that BTC did not fall under securities laws, unlike tens of thousands of other tokens in the market. Asked why he had not clarified the status of ETH and BTC outright, Gensler claimed that his job required him to be extremely careful with his language. While the Biden appointee described Bitcoin as ‚Äúhighly speculative,‚Äù he still acknowledged that, given its growing popularity worldwide, it could become an asset similar to gold in the future. However, he had no kind words for other cryptocurrencies, claiming they first had to show their true use case and value proposition: ‚ÄúThese other thousands of projects need to show their use case and show that they actually have fundamentals underlying them, or they won‚Äôt persist.‚Äù Criticism of the SEC‚Äôs Approach One of the most contentious aspects of Gensler‚Äôs term was the SEC‚Äôs enforcement-heavy approach to crypto regulation. Critics have argued that the agency has focused more on penalizing non-compliance than providing clear rules for the industry. Asked about this by CNBC‚Äôs Andrew Sorkin, the Commission‚Äôs leader shifted the onus for crafting new regulatory frameworks to Congress. Additionally, he decried the high levels of noncompliance by crypto projects, many of which he claimed fell under the securities laws. On the recent appellate court‚Äôs demand that the SEC better explain why it turned down Coinbase‚Äôs request for the agency to develop crypto-specific rules, the former MIT professor stated, ‚ÄúNot liking the law and not liking rules doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt laws and rules.‚Äù The post SEC Never Classified Bitcoin or Ethereum as Securities: Gary Gensler appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Gary Gensler|SEC,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-15 17:36:15

It has lagged behind other popular meme coins like Fartcoin, ai16z, and Dogwifhat. A likely reason for SHIB‚Äôs underperformance is that Shibarium, its layer-2 network, is not doing well. While the number of transactions is nearing the 800 million milestone, total transaction fees have continued to decline. On Tuesday, the network collected 640 BONE in fees, valued at less than $300 Shibarium‚Äôs performance has impacted Shiba Inu because part of the transaction fees is used to burn SHIB tokens. According to Shibburn , the burn rate has remained under pressure in recent weeks. Fundamentally, the coin could stage a strong comeback as cryptocurrencies rally. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is nearing the key resistance point at $100,000 after the encouraging consumer inflation data .

This pattern, featuring a long lower shadow and a small body, is often seen as a reversal sign. Shiba Inu has also formed a falling wedge chart pattern, made up of two falling and converging trendlines. This pattern is generally considered a bullish reversal signal, with breakouts often occurring as the lines converge. SHIB has also formed a bullish divergence as the Relative Strength Index has formed an ascending channel.

The shift, which Hougan describes as an "" overlooked megatrend, "" has the potential to significantly influence Bitcoin's market trajectory. MicroStrategy: The Torchbearer of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption. Though ranked only 220th globally by market capitalization, the company‚Äôs influence on the Bitcoin market is disproportionate. In 2024 alone, MicroStrategy acquired 257,000 BTC‚Äîexceeding the total Bitcoin mined that year (218,829 BTC). The company‚Äôs ambitions show no signs of slowing. It recently announced plans to raise $42 billion for additional Bitcoin purchases, equivalent to 2.6 years‚Äô worth of Bitcoin‚Äôs annual production at current rates. Beyond MicroStrategy: A Growing Movement MicroStrategy‚Äôs actions are just the tip of the iceberg. According to Hougan, 70 publicly traded companies already hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This list includes not only crypto-native firms like Coinbase and Marathon Digital but also mainstream giants like Tesla, Block, and Mercado Libre. Together, these firms‚Äîexcluding MicroStrategy‚Äîown 141,302 BTC. Private companies are also significant players. SpaceX, Block.one, and others collectively hold at least 368,043 BTC, based on data from BitcoinTreasuries.com. Hougan highlights that MicroStrategy‚Äôs share of the corporate Bitcoin market is already less than 50% and is likely to decline further as adoption grows. What happens when larger companies, like Meta, which is currently considering a shareholder suggestion to add bitcoin to its balance sheet‚Äî20x the size of MicroStrategy start to emulate MicroStrategy‚Äôs strategy? Bitcoin holdings by publicly listed companies across three regions: the United States, Canada, and the Rest of the World (ROW) - Source: Bitcoin Magazine Pro Why Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Is Poised to Accelerate Two major barriers have historically constrained corporate adoption of Bitcoin: reputational risk and unfavorable accounting rules. Both have shifted dramatically in recent months: 1. Reduced Reputational Risk Until recently, companies faced significant hurdles in adopting Bitcoin. CEOs and boards were concerned about shareholder lawsuits, regulatory scrutiny, and negative media coverage. However, as Bitcoin gains acceptance at institutional and governmental levels, these fears are dissipating. Post-election, Bitcoin has seen growing bipartisan support in Washington, making it increasingly ""commonplace‚Äîand even popular‚Äîto own Bitcoin,"" according to Hougan. 2. Favorable Accounting Changes The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) introduced a new guideline, ASU 2023-08, that fundamentally changes how Bitcoin is accounted for. Previously, companies were required to mark Bitcoin as an intangible asset, forcing them to write down its value during price declines but preventing upward adjustments when prices rose. Under the new rule, Bitcoin can now be marked to market, allowing companies to recognize profits as its price appreciates. This change removes a significant disincentive and is expected to drive exponential growth in corporate Bitcoin holdings. The ""Why"" Behind Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Corporate motivations for holding Bitcoin mirror those of individual investors. Hougan outlines several reasons: Hedging Against Inflation : Bitcoin is viewed as a safeguard against currency debasement. Speculation : Some companies aim to boost stock prices through Bitcoin exposure. Cultural Signaling : Holding Bitcoin signals alignment with innovation and attracts a younger, tech-savvy customer base. Strategic Hunches : For many, Bitcoin ownership is a calculated gamble. Hougan asserts that the motivations behind corporate adoption matter less than the magnitude of demand. ""You just need to look at the numbers,"" he writes. ""Where does all this demand look like it‚Äôs going? And what would that mean for the market?"" A Megatrend That Could Redefine Markets Hougan‚Äôs memo paints a bullish picture of Bitcoin‚Äôs future. If hundreds of companies follow MicroStrategy‚Äôs lead, the cumulative demand could drive Bitcoin‚Äôs price significantly higher in the coming year. With 70 companies already on board under less favorable conditions, the stage is set for an explosion in adoption. This trend not only highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs evolving role as a treasury asset but also underscores its growing acceptance as a mainstream financial instrument. For mature investors, the implications are clear: the next 18 months could mark a pivotal period in Bitcoin‚Äôs journey from speculative asset to institutional cornerstone. The Time to Buy Is Now With reputational risks fading, accounting rules evolving, and demand accelerating, Bitcoin‚Äôs integration into corporate treasuries appears inevitable. Hougan‚Äôs analysis invites investors to consider the broader implications: If corporations truly embrace Bitcoin at scale, what could that mean for the market‚Äôs future? For savvy investors, the answer might lie in acting sooner rather than later. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitcoin and US tech stocks now have a 30-day correlation coefficient of 0.70 . The crypto and stock markets surged following the release of the inflation report The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the inflation report on Wednesday. Since then, the stock and crypto prices have made several gains. Following the inflation report, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures gained over 1%, while Bitcoin surged by more than 2.6%. The report showed that the consumer price index increased by 0.4% month-over-month, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.9%‚Äîin line with economists‚Äô expectations. According to Dow Jones, most economists had anticipated the inflation rate would fall within a range of 0.3% to 2.9% Moreover, the core CPI annual rate stood at 3.2%, slightly better than the 3.3% projection. Additionally, Headline CPI inflation was on the rise for the last 3 straight months; however, core inflation was dwindling, which Kobeissi Letter did describe as a ‚ÄúA mixed situation for the Fed.‚Äù Nevertheless, crypto and tech stock markets are still waiting for the Fed‚Äôs announcement on potentially more interest cuts at the upcoming FOMC meeting. Given the country‚Äôs high inflation, the Feds had earlier hinted that the current interest rates may stay a little longer. Currently, Bitcoin and US tech stocks are closely correlated at a coefficient of 0.70. Analysts believe Trump‚Äôs inauguration may have an impact on crypto prices As President-elect Trump waits to be sworn in on January 20, some analysts believe his inauguration could rally another crypto bullish momentum. K33 Research analysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman remarked: The overall sensitivity to interest rates over the past month suggests increased importance of Wednesday‚Äôs CPI print. Additionally, notable Trump momentum may still form in the days leading into the inauguration. ‚Äì K33 Research analysts However, hedging activity is rising, suggesting that crypto investors anticipate increased volatility in the coming days.

In July 2022, the top US crypto exchange filed a petition with the SEC to create a new regulatory framework for digital assets, but the regulator rejected the proposal with a single-paragraph notice in December 2023, saying that it disagreed with the idea that securities laws do not apply to the crypto industry. The SEC also argued that it had other regulatory priorities and discretion over the ‚Äútiming and priorities of its regulatory agenda.‚Äù Coinbase, unsatisfied with the response, petitioned a court to review the SEC‚Äôs decision. The exchange also asked the court to order the SEC to institute a rulemaking proceeding on digital assets. In a new ruling filed this week, Circuit Judge Thomas L. Ambro declined to order the SEC to make new rules for digital assets. He did, however, tell the SEC to expand on its response to Coinbase‚Äôs petition. ‚ÄúThe SEC‚Äôs order was arbitrary and capricious because it was conclusory and insufficiently reasoned.

39013105,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-should-bitcoiners-view-quantum-computing,1736963842,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/6/39013105.jpeg,How Should Bitcoiners View Quantum Computing?,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-should-bitcoiners-view-quantum-computing,"In the early 2020s, quantum computing hit the public spotlight as a potential threat to Bitcoin. Relying on SHA-256 cryptographic hash function for its proof-of-work network consensus, Bitcoin‚Äôs value is predicated on computational power. If there is a technology that can circumvent the traditional binary system of 0s and 1s for units of information, there is potential to upend cryptography as we know it. But is that danger over exaggerated? Could quantum computing one day turn Bitcoin into a valueless piece of code? Let‚Äôs start by understanding why Bitcoin relies on cryptography. Bitcoin‚Äôs Bits and Hashing When we say that an image is 1 MB in size, we say that it contains 1,000,000 Bytes. As each Byte contains 8 bits, this means that an image contains 8,388,608 bits. As the binary digit (bit), this is the tiniest unit of information, either 0 or 1, that builds up the entire edifice of our digital age. In the case of an image, bits in a 1MB file would assign a color to each pixel, making it readable to the human eye. In the case of a cryptographic function like SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit), developed by the NSA, it would produce 256 bits (32 Bytes) as the fixed length of a hash from an input of arbitrary size. The primary purpose of a hash function is to convert any string of letters or numbers into an output of fixed length. This obfuscation blending makes it ideal for compact storage and anonymized signatures. And because the hashing process is a one-way street, hashed data is effectively irreversible. Therefore, when we say that SHA-256 provides a 256-bit security, we mean to say that there are 2256 possible hashes to consider for reversal. When Bitcoin payments are conducted, each Bitcoin block has its own unique transaction hash generated by SHA-256. Each transaction within the block contributes to this unique hash as they form the Merkle root , plus the timestamp, nonce value and other metadata. A would-be blockchain attacker would have to recalculate hashes and extract the necessary data not only for that block containing the transactions, but for all subsequent blocks chained to it. Suffice to say, the 2256 possibility load poses a virtually impractical computational endeavor, requiring immense expenditure of energy and time, both of which are exceedingly costly. But could this no longer be the case with quantum computing? New Quantum Paradigm for Computing Moving away from bits as 0s and 1s, quantum computing introduces qubits. Leveraging the observed property of superposition, these units of information can not only be either 0 or 1 but both simultaneously. In other words, we are moving away from deterministic computing to indeterministic computing. Because qubits can exist in an entangled and superimposed state, until observed, computations become probabilistic. And because there are more states than always 0 or 1, a quantum computer has the ability for parallel computing as it can simultaneously process 2n states. A classic binary computer would have to run a function for each possible 2n state, which the quantum computer could assess simultaneously. In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor developed an algorithm with this in mind. Shor‚Äôs algorithm combines Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) techniques to speedup pattern-finding and theoretically break all cryptography systems, not just Bitcoin. However, there is one huge problem. If quantum computing is probabilistic, how reliable is it? Stabilizing Coherence in Quantum Computing When it is said that qubits are superimposed, this is akin to visualizing a coin flip. While in the air, one can imagine the coin having both states - heads or tails. But once it lands, the state is resolved into one outcome. Equally so, when qubits are resolved, their state collapses into the classical state. The problem is that a ground-breaking algorithm like Shor‚Äôs needs many qubits to maintain their superposition for a long period of time to interact with each other. Otherwise, the necessary, useful calculations fail to actually complete. In quantum computing, this refers to quantum decoherence (QD) and quantum error correction (QEC). Moreover, these problems need to be solved across many qubits for complex calculations. According to the Millisecond Coherence in a Superconducting Qubit paper published in June 2023, the longest coherence time of a qubit is 1.48 ms at average gate fidelity of 99.991%. The latter percentage refers to the overall reliability of a QPU (quantum processing unit). At present, the most usable and powerful quantum computer appears to be from IBM, dubbed Quantum System Two . A modular system ready for scaling, Quantum System Two should perform 5,000 operations with three Heron QPUs in a single circuit by the end of 2024. By the end of 2033, this should increase to 100 million operations. The question is, would this be enough to materialize Shar‚Äôs algorithm and break Bitcoin? QC Threat Viability Due to decoherence problems and fault-tolerance, quantum computers have yet to pose a serious risk to cryptography. It is unclear if it is even possible to achieve a fault-tolerant quantum system at scale when such a high level of environmental purity is needed. This includes electron-phonon scattering , photon emissions and even electron to electron interactivity. Moreover, the greater the number of qubits, which are necessary for Shor‚Äôs algorithm, the greater the decoherence. Yet, although these may appear to be intractable problems inherent with quantum computing, there has been great progress in QEC methods. Case in point, Riverlane‚Äôs Deltaflow 2 method performs real-time QEC on up to 250 qubits. By 2026, this method should result in the first viable quantum application with million real-time quantum operations (MegaQuOp). To break SHA-256 within one day, 13 million qubits would be needed, according to the AVS Quantum Science article published in January 2022. Although this would threaten Bitcoin wallets, many more qubits, at around 1 billion, would be needed to actually execute a 51% attack on Bitcoin mainnet. When it comes to implementing the Grover algorithm, designed to leverage QC to search unstructured databases (unique hashes), a research paper published in 2018 suggested that no quantum computer would be able to implement it until 2028. Image credit: Ledger Journal Of course, Bitcoin network‚Äôs hashrate has greatly increased since then, and QC has to tackle decoherence as a major obstacle. But if QEC roadmaps eventually materialize into reliable quantum systems, what can be done to counteract the QC threat to Bitcoin? Quantum Computing Resistance There are multiple proposals to safeguard Bitcoin holders from quantum computers. Because a 51% QC attack is extremely improbable, the focus is mainly on hardening wallets. After all, if people cannot rely on their BTC holdings to be secure, this would cause an exodus from Bitcoin. In turn, BTC price would plummet and the network‚Äôs hashrate would drastically decrease, making it far more vulnerable to QC than previously estimated. One such hardening is implementing Lamport signatures. With Lamport signatures , a private key would be generated into pairs, 512 bitstrings from a 256-bit output. A public key would be generated with a cryptographic function to each of the 512 bitstrings. Each BTC transaction would need a one-time Lamport signature. Because Lamport signatures do not rely on elliptic curves over finite fields in Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which is used by Bitcoin and can be exploited by Shar‚Äôs algorithm, but on hash functions, this makes them a viable quantum-resistant alternative. The downside of Lamport signatures is their increased size, upward of 16KB, and one-time use. Of course, just by shifting addresses and keeping BTC in cold storage, thus avoiding private key exposure, can also prevent QC from being effective. Another approach to confound potential QC attacks would be to implement lattice-based cryptography (LBC). Unlike in ECDSA, LBC avoids finite patterns by relying on discrete points in n-dimensional lattice (grid) space that extends infinitely in all directions. Because of this feature, there has yet been developed a quantum algorithm that could break LBC. However, to implement a new type of cryptography, Bitcoin would have to undergo a hard fork. In that scenario, there would likely need to be many signals indicating that major breakthroughs in quantum computing, particularly in qubit count and fault tolerance, are imminent. Bottom Line It is safe to say that the Bitcoin mainnet itself is not in danger from quantum computing, in either the near or distant future. Yet, if QC were to compromise Bitcoin‚Äôs encryption‚Äîrendering SHA-256 and ECDSA obsolete‚Äîit would deeply impact confidence in the cryptocurrency. This confidence is crucial, as demonstrated by major companies like Microsoft and PayPal, which have adopted Bitcoin payments, drawn by up to 80% savings compared to card transactions , zero chargebacks, and complete control over funds. With over 300 million holders globally, Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal as both a secure asset and a cost-effective payment option remains strong. Ultimately, Bitcoin‚Äôs value is sustained by the capital and confidence behind it. Its historical volatility shows how events‚Äîranging from Elon Musk‚Äôs tweets and PayPal‚Äôs integration to ETF launches and the FTX collapse‚Äîhave impacted market sentiment. A fundamental threat to Bitcoin‚Äôs encryption could lead to panicked sell-offs, miner withdrawals, and a reduced mining difficulty, potentially opening the door to a 51% QC attack with fewer qubits. To prevent such a scenario, Bitcoin holders and developers would do well to keep up with QC developments. This is a guest post by Shane Neagle.

In a detailed Twitter post, he outlined several factors that could pave the way for a rally in altcoins, from regulatory changes to technical indicators. Capo said that January 20, 2025, is a crucial date for Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration and the finalization of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler‚Äôs departure. Trump‚Äôs announcement that he will replace Gensler with Paul Atkins, a known crypto advocate, is expected to usher in pro-crypto regulations. In addition, FTX‚Äôs $1.2 billion repayment plan, part of a larger $16 billion initiative, went live on January 3, 2025. Capo noted that this influx of liquidity could support crypto markets and potentially spark new demand for altcoins. Related News: Experienced Analyst Speaks: ""These Two Altcoins Could Experience Huge Sudden Movement Both Up and Down"" Capo gave an in-depth analysis of major cryptocurrency charts: Bitcoin (BTC): Despite the correction after the $100,000 milestone, Bitcoin has found strong support at $90,000-$92,000, with the liquidity zone extending to $110,000-$130,000. This stability could create room for altcoins to rise. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is recovering from the $2,800-$3,000 support zone after rejecting the $4,000 resistance level. A potential breakout could take ETH to a new all-time high of $5,000. Altcoin Market Cap: The combined market cap of altcoins is indicating a higher low, suggesting the possibility of new highs and price discovery. Solana (SOL): A strong support/resistance reversal and the possibility of a Solana ETF could push SOL to $300. Ethena (ENA): Despite recent corrections, strong fundamentals and partnerships point to aggressive upside potential. Capo sees a shift in market trends. While memecoins were dominant during Trump‚Äôs election, he now expects a shift toward AI-focused and utility tokens. According to the analyst, projects such as Artificial Super Intelligence (FET), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), and SingularityNET (AGIX) are leading the way in the blockchain-AI space. Low Market Caps: Projects like ZeusNetwork (ZEUS) and Phoenix (PHB) stand out because of their high-risk, high-reward potential, especially in the AI and Solana ecosystems, according to Capo. Capo explained that 80% of his portfolio is currently in the market, diversified across Tier 1s, AI projects, and real-world asset tokens. However, he cautioned against overexposure and leverage, emphasizing risk management as key to navigating the market.

Reynolds‚Äôs appointment follows the resignation of Tulip Siddiq, who stepped down in a letter to the Prime Minister. Siddiq, the member of parliament for Hampstead and Highgate, cited personal reasons for her departure. The new economic secretary will play a key role in shaping the government‚Äôs crypto regulation agenda. In addition to digital assets, Reynolds will oversee the U.K.‚Äôs central bank digital currency plans. Her appointment comes as the U.K. continues to push for greater regulatory compliance in the crypto sector. The government has pursued this approach over the past few years as part of its ambition to become a leading hub for digital assets innovation.

The landscape has shifted since Donald Trump‚Äôs election, and industry players are optimistic about what the new SEC leadership could mean for the crypto ecosystem in the U.S. Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. As crypto.news highlighted , the SEC plans to move away from its ‚Äúregulation by enforcement‚Äù strategy and freeze certain ongoing lawsuits that do not involve fraud. While it remains to be seen how Reynolds will impact the U.K.‚Äôs crypto policies, the general sentiment is that the country aims to remain competitive amid growing global crypto adoption. In December 2024, the European Union‚Äôs Markets in Crypto Assets rules came into full effect, with industry players keen on leveraging the clarity MiCA offers to expand across the bloc. The U.K.‚Äôs own legislation on cryptocurrencies and stablecoins is expected to be finalized in early 2025. You might also like: Sen.

According to a court filing, federal prosecutors plan to remit 80% of the 119,754 Bitcoin ( BTC ) recovered from the Bitfinex crypto exchange hack back to the platform. Government investigators seized 94,643 BTC from Ilya Lichtenstein, the individual who hacked Bitfinex in 2016 and laundered the proceeds with his partner, Heather ‚ÄúRazzleKhan‚Äù Morgan. The BTC stash was extracted from the original wallet used by Lichtenstein during the hack. Therefore, it can be returned as ‚Äúin-kind restitution,‚Äù prosecutors wrote to a federal judge. Back in October, federal attorneys argued that Bitfinex may be the sole victim, paving the way for this distribution plan according to U.S. law.

Due to these laundering attempts, those funds cannot be returned directly. The Department of Justice has proposed an ancillary forfeiture process to recover the remaining BTC, though the timeline for this process remains unclear. Lichtenstein and Morgan stole nearly 120,000 BTC from Bitfinex in 2016 ‚Äî a trove now worth almost $12 billion.

These platforms have set high benchmarks by addressing critical bottlenecks in blockchain adoption, such as transaction throughput and efficiency. However, a new player, Lightchain AI , is entering the scene with innovations that could outpace even these market leaders. Could this revolutionary blockchain project become the new standard for speed and scale? Avalanche (AVAX) High-Speed Blockchain with Proven Utility Avalanche (AVAX) is a fast blockchain place known for its quickness, growth, and many uses. Started in 2020 by Ava Labs, Avalanche uses a special agreement way that mixes parts of old and Nakamoto agreement rules it allows quick deal ending and high flow. Its three-chain structure, which includes the Exchange Chain (X-Chain), Contract Chain (C-Chain), and Platform Chain (P-Chain) allow for special tasks, making it better and more flexible. The site‚Äôs own coin, AVAX, is key for paying fees, putting down, and rules making; it helps a strong and spread out system. New changes have partnerships with big businesses, like Amazon Web Services, to grow its base and apps that are spread out. These improvements show Avalanche‚Äôs rising importance in the blockchain area, gÕèiving a strong answer for builders and firms looking for fast, big, and safe shared apps. Polygon (MATIC) Layer-2 Scaling Powerhouse Polygon, formerly known as MATIC, is a prominent Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs. In September 2024, Polygon underwent a significant upgrade, transitioning its native token from MATIC to POL. This change aims to streamline operations by consolidating gas and staking functions into a single token, thereby improving network efficiency and scalability. The POL token introduces a 2% annual inflation rate, with 1% allocated to validator rewards and the remaining 1% directed to a community treasury to fund development initiatives. This upgrade reflects Polygon‚Äôs commitment to evolving its ecosystem and supporting the growing demands of decentralized applications and services. Users holding MATIC on the Polygon network experienced an automatic transition to POL, while those on Ethereum can migrate their tokens via the Polygon Portal interface. This development underscores Polygon‚Äôs dedication to enhancing Ethereum‚Äôs scalability and fostering broader adoption of blockchain technology. Lightchain AI Redefining Blockchain Efficiency Lightchain AI is emerging as a transformative force, addressing blockchain inefficiencies through advanced technology. Currently priced at $0.00525 during its presale and having already raised $10.4 million, the project has garnered notable interest from investors. Its innovative approach is centered around three key pillars. First, its advanced consensus mechanisms facilitate faster transaction processing without compromising security, ensuring scalability for high-demand applications. Second, dynamic scalability features enable the network to efficiently allocate resources based on transaction volume and complexity. Lastly, the integration of AI-driven analytics enhances blockchain performance, allowing the system to adapt to real-time network changes for optimal efficiency. With these groundbreaking solutions, Lightchain AI is poised to revolutionize the blockchain industry.

The crypto industry has faced rough times since the year began following a macro-driven sell-off. Bitcoin could break below $90k, and once it does, a Standard Chartered report suggests a further 10% retracement is probable. The year started rough for crypto assets. Since January 1st, digital assets have bled following economic uncertainty fueled by Trump‚Äôs return to the White House and fiscal policies from the Federal Reserve Bank. Standard Chartered Bank cautions a 10% dip once BTC falls below $90k üö® Bitcoin Takes a Breather: StanChart Sees Sub-$90k as a Golden Chance $BTC is under fire from macro pressures, and analysts at Standard Chartered say a dip below the $90,000 mark could unlock a juicy medium-term buying window. The head of the bank‚Äôs digital assets research,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/VvD0jqgqm3 ‚Äî Blockman (@blockmandev) January 15, 2025 A report from Standard Chartered, a corporate and investment banking and treasury service provider, suggests that the crypto meltdown may continue. According to the report, the digital asset downturn results from the Federal Reserve adopting a more hawkish stance in mid-December. According to Jerom Powel, the chair of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), Fed officials will take more cautious steps going forward regarding the ongoing rate cuts, citing risks of rising inflation. Furthermore, the U.S. job market again defied an anticipated slowdown, with firms adding more than a quarter of a million jobs in the last full month of Joe Biden‚Äôs reign as the U.S. president. The data left Fed policymakers puzzled over the need for further interest rate cuts since the job market indicates a strong, booming U.S. economy. The bank highlighted that crypto investors who invested in Bitcoin after the U.S. presidential elections on November 5th are now breaking even. The report detailed that there exists a risk that Bitcoin could collapse further as these investors panic and liquidate their holdings to avoid holding losses. The report included investors who took Bitcoin exposure through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and those who invested in software giant Microstrategy. Standard Chartered‚Äôs head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, wrote that the risk of mark-to-market pain is piling up. U.S. spot ETFs have experienced negative flows since January 8th The current crypto meltdown has trickled down on U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to data from ETF tracking website Sosovalue, the Funds recorded outflows worth $209.82 million, marking a streak of negative flows that began on January 8th. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT recorded the largest negative flows among the listed ETFs, worth $219.48 million. The ETF still has the most net assets under management, valued at $53.46 billion. The Funds witnessed negative flows worth $582.90 million on January 8th, $149.35 million on January 10th, and $284.19 million on January 13th. As of January 15th, the ETFs still held considerable assets totaling $108.98 billion. The bank also noted that if Bitcoin falls below $90k, the asset will likely dip by more than 10% toward the $80k level. According to Standard Chartered, the rest of the crypto market will crumble following Bitcoin‚Äôs dip. The banking institution advised investors looking for exposure to the digital asset to join the bandwagon once the retracement is over. Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin will hit 200k before the year ends Standard Chartered still believed Bitcoin would hit $200K by the end of 2025, citing increased institutional interests in the assets as well as new reforms promised by the incoming Trump administration. Despite Trump‚Äôs proposed tariffs causing uncertainty in the markets, experts such as Alice Liu, Research Lead at CoinMarketCap, believe that the crypto market will pump once Trump assumes office after his inauguration on January 20th. Trump is reportedly expected to sign a crypto executive order on his first day in office, a move that could fuel a crypto pump. Rumors surfing the internet suggest that the executive order may involve announcing a crypto council or lifting restrictions hindering banking institutions from facilitating crypto activities.

With key support levels established, a crypto analyst has projected a new bullish price target for Shiba Inu (SHIB). Shiba Inu Price Targets $0.000033 And Beyond On Tuesday, a TradingView crypto analyst, known as the ‚ÄòReal_CryptoRoy‚Äô, declared that Shiba Inu is getting ‚Äùready to fly,‚Äù highlighting its potential for a significant price recovery to new highs. The analyst believes that Shiba Inu‚Äôs first major milestone for 2025 will be a climb above $0.000025, a critical level that would confirm its bullish position. Related Reading: PEPE Marks Bottom After Scary Market Crash, Enters Wave 3 With Over 500% Promise If this crucial price point is reclaimed, the TradingView analyst suggests it could set the stage for Shiba Inu to retest a new resistance zone at $0.000033. This critical price level is one of Shiba Inu‚Äôs recent highs, achieved during a period of explosive growth and heightened demand. The TradingView crypto expert shared a price chart, highlighting that a break of the aforementioned resistance level, accompanied by strong trading volume, could pave the way for future gains and a larger bullish trend that could push Shiba Inu to new price highs. While he maintains a confident stance on his bullish outlook for Shiba Inu, the analyst has also highlighted the influence of Bitcoin‚Äôs price action and dominance on Shiba Inu‚Äôs performance. For instance, if Bitcoin remains stable or bullish, it could create favorable conditions for Shiba Inu and other altcoins to rally. Conversely, if Bitcoin turns bearish, Shiba Inu could also experience price declines and volatility. For mid-term investors, the current price near $0.00002 may present an opportunity to accumulate Shiba Inu at a low cost while watching its movements closely. The analyst has also highlighted the importance of key resistance and support levels, forecasting that Shiba Inu is preparing for a significant recovery. SHIB Finds Support Amidst Correction While sharing his bullish forecast for Shiba Inu, the ‚ÄòReal_CryptoRoy‚Äô disclosed that the meme coin is currently in a correction phase after crashing 35% from its local high of $0.000033 and consolidating above $0.00002. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Has Entered Another Bull Cycle, Puts Price Above $20 The TradingView analyst revealed that the $0.00002 level was a crucial support zone for Shiba Inucrucial support zone for Shiba Inu, which the meme coin has tested twice. Typically, when a cryptocurrency successfully tests a support level multiple times, it indicates that buyers are stepping in to defend this level and prevent further drawbacks. This support zone, highlighted by the orange circles on the analyst‚Äôs chart, signals a potential local bottom for Shiba Inu. The TradingView crypto expert has noted that Shiba Inu‚Äôs present correction phase could present an attractive buying opportunity for investors who aim to capitalize on low prices and potential upward movement. The analyst also pointed out that Shiba Inu‚Äôs price performance on the previous day was noteworthy, as it avoided falling below its prior low. Instead, the meme coin established a ‚Äúhigher low‚Äù, indicating that selling pressures may be waning and its correction could be nearing its end.

Bitcoin: The Digital Revolution That's Changing Money Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It uses blockchain technology to let people send money directly to each other without needing a bank. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin exists as a network of computers keeping a shared record of transactions. This system, called a distributed ledger, means everyone has the same information, making it hard to cheat. To make sure transactions are valid, people called miners solve tricky puzzles. When they do, they earn new bitcoins. This process not only verifies transactions but also adds new bitcoins to the system. Every four years or so, something called a ""halving"" happens in the Bitcoin world. This means miners get half as many bitcoins for their work. Since there's a limit of 21 million bitcoins that can ever exist, this makes bitcoins scarcer over time. Right now, many people find Bitcoin attractive because it's decentralized and not controlled by any government. While other coins like Ethereum have different features, Bitcoin remains the most well-known and trusted. Its potential to change how we think about money makes it an interesting option in today's market. Ethereum's Revolution: Why ETH Leads the Crypto Charge Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency; it's a platform that's changing the digital landscape. Founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, Ethereum launched in 2015 and introduced smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). This opened the door to new innovations like decentralized finance (DeFi) and Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon, which make transactions faster and more efficient. In 2022, Ethereum made a significant shift to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, reducing energy consumption and setting the stage for its next upgrade: sharding. This upcoming feature aims to improve scalability and lower costs, enhancing Ethereum's commitment to a decentralized and efficient network. In the current market, Ethereum shines for its continuous innovation and strong ecosystem. While other coins offer similar features, Ethereum's role in smart contracts and its vast dApp network give it an edge. Predictions estimate that Ethereum could reach $6,580.53 next year, showing market optimism. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, ETH remains central not just as a tradable asset but also for its use in transactions and as collateral. With ongoing developments and major upgrades ahead, Ethereum appears attractive to those interested in blockchain's future. Solana: Fast, Scalable, and Ready to Compete in the Crypto World Solana is a rising star in the blockchain world. It tackles issues like slow transactions and high fees that trouble other platforms. Competing with big names like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana offers a speedy and scalable network for decentralized apps, known as dapps. Its unique design allows it to handle many transactions at once without needing extra layers or breaking the network into smaller pieces. The SOL coin is at the heart of Solana's ecosystem. It pays for transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards people who support the network. With its high speed and capacity, Solana is drawing in developers and investors looking for a platform that can handle heavy use. In today's market, SOL looks attractive because of its strong technology and growth potential. As more projects choose Solana for its speed and flexibility, the value of SOL could rise, making it a coin to watch in the crypto space. Toncoin's Ascend: The Open Network's Next Big Leap in Crypto Toncoin is making waves in the crypto world. As the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON), it operates on a decentralized, open-source blockchain. Originally developed by Telegram as 'Gram', the project was halted in 2020 due to regulatory issues. The community revived it, and now the non-commercial TON Foundation leads its development. Toncoin uses proof-of-stake technology, enhancing scalability and reliability. It aims to offer fast, secure payments with low fees, and is building an ecosystem that includes decentralized storage, services, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. Looking ahead, Toncoin shows significant potential. Predictions suggest that by 2025, its price could reach up to $30.30, a substantial increase from today's value. By 2030, it might climb to $26.04. These forecasts are based on its past price movements and Bitcoin's halving cycles, which often impact the crypto market. In the current market, Toncoin's strong technology and ambitious goals make it stand out. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate, Toncoin offers unique features for those seeking efficient blockchain solutions. As the crypto market evolves, Toncoin's progress is certainly worth watching. Conclusion BTC, ETH, SOL, and TON are strong investments, but XYZVerse (XYZ), the pioneering sports memecoin, offers potential for massive growth by uniting sports fans in a unique ecosystem.

Bonk is one of the most successful crypto projects in 2025. The dog-themed Solana-based coin has become one of the most recognized meme coins, with its market capitalization reaching $2.4 billion in May. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 66 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk‚Äôs supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 20254 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem.

Despite the continuous price fluctuations in the previous weeks, currently the market trend is highly bullish. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a huge surge in SOL‚Äôs price, attributed to Bonk‚Äôs unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.00025, which is approximately 7.9 times its current price, making it a good investment to consider. Why is Bonk up? Bonk gained a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. In the last few hours, its value increased by $0.000002867. Today‚Äôs increasing pressure triggered a notable ascent in the coin‚Äôs value. Will Bonk Recover? Bonk is currently trading within its established price range. A recent price decline tested the $0.00002618 support level, which proved strong. A successful defense of this support level is considered crucial for the current recovery. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk‚Äôs strongest current resistance level is $0.000035. However, just a few days ago, Bonk saw some price action above this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2026. Will Bonk reach $0.000100? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.000100 and surpass it by 2027. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin‚Äôs market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan‚Äôs review of the cryptocurrency, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.00025 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price. Recent news/opinion on Bonk BONK for Paws, Bonk‚Äôs charitable arm, has announced the successful receipt of a significant donation from Monke.

In a January 14th filing with the U.S. District for the District of Columbia, the government says that the BTC currently held in its wallets is to be returned to Bitfinex, the ‚Äúsole victim‚Äù of the hack. The conclusion of the court order states, ‚ÄúFor the foregoing reasons, there is no ‚Äòvictim‚Äô for the specific offenses of conviction in this proceeding. However, the Court has the authority to order voluntary restitution pursuant to the defendants‚Äô plea agreements. Such voluntary restitution should include all of the assets seized from the Bitfinex Hack Wallet and that, pursuant to the plea agreements, those assets should be returned to Bitfinex as in-kind restitution. All other seized assets listed in the Corrected Second Amended Attachment A (ECF 195) should be subject to the ongoing third-party ancillary forfeiture proceeding.‚Äù Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan were charged by the DOJ in 2022 in relation to the hack. The government says that Lichenstein stole approximately 119,754 BTC from Bitfinex, and then withdrew and laundered about 25,000 coins. Lichenstein also wrongfully gained from the several Bitcoin forks such as Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), Bitcoin Satoshi Vision ( BSV ) and Bitcoin Gold ( BTG ). After the government seized the Bitcoin in January 2022, Lichenstein‚Äôs wallet still contained 94,643 coins. According to the court order, those coins are now to be returned to Bitfinex in-kind rather than first being sold for US dollars. Lichtenstein recently appeared as a cooperating US government witness in an ongoing money laundering trial centered around the crypto mixing service Bitcoin Fog, according to a Bloomberg report.

Although respondents in some regions expressed concerns that changes in immigration and tariff policies could have a negative impact on the economy, more respondents were optimistic about the economic outlook for 2025 than pessimistic.

The cryptocurrency FET is showing a tight price range between $1.15 and $1.55. With a recent decline of over 18% in one week, the coin‚Äôs short-term trend is bearish. Yet, its RSI and Stochastic indicators hint at potential upward momentum. If it breaks the $1.80 resistance, it could aim for $2.20, marking a possible growth of over 40%. However, if it falls below the $1.01 support, deeper losses may follow. Its moving averages make the outlook uncertain, but if market conditions improve, FET could see significant gains. The potential for a bullish surge is there; watch for breakout or breakdown signs! MAGA Coin Eyes Breakout: Could Triple Digits be in Sight? MAGA is trading between $2.16 and $3.61, showing volatility. The nearest resistance is at $4.46, while support stands firm at $1.56. This coin could soar if it breaks the $4.46 mark, with the next target at $5.90. Recent activity shows a 67% rise over the past month, despite a 20% decline in the last week. The RSI is neutral, hinting at potential momentum building. The MACD is positive, suggesting possible upward movement. Watch the $4.46 level closely; if crossed, MAGA could see significant gains. A bullish surge may lead to an impressive increase from current levels, making this coin a watchlist must for crypto enthusiasts. Baby Doge Coin Shows Promise for Growth Amidst Recent Decline Baby Doge Coin is bouncing between tight price ranges. It's currently moving between $2.35e-9 and $3.35e-9. Resistance sits at $3.95e-9, while support is close at $1.95e-9. Prices recently fell by over 19% in a week and 37% over the month. Despite this, the coin has surged 104.2% in six months, signaling potential. The RSI is peaking, suggesting momentum. The Stochastic is relatively neutral, neither overbought nor oversold. Short-term swings could occur, but persisting above $3.95e-9 would mark a bullish sign. Baby Doge Coin could surge beyond that, with a next target of $4.95e-9, showcasing potential for further growth. Solana on the Verge of a Breakout? Here's What to Expect Solana is trading between $172.64 and $213.70. This range indicates a tight battle between bulls and bears. The nearest resistance is at $239, and the nearest support is at $156.86. The 10-day moving average of $187.15 signals caution, while a 100-day average of $185.65 shows market confidence. Though Solana has seen a slight drop over the week and month by around 15%, the 6-month picture shows nearly 20% growth. With RSI and Stochastic both around the mid-50s, momentum is in balance. If it pushes past $239, we could see a rally towards $280. Keep an eye out‚Äîit‚Äôs a critical time for Solana. Conclusion Although FET, TRUMP, BabyDoge, and SOL may have limited short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale‚Äîfrom $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages‚Äîit combines governance, rewards, and staking to benefit its holders and unite enthusiasts seeking both fun and profit.

The bureau has raised concerns that Polymarket could enable illegal activities, particularly online gambling using cryptocurrencies. This proposal follows growing fears about the platform‚Äôs potential to breach Thailand‚Äôs strict anti-gambling laws. Thailand‚Äôs Stance on Online Gambling This announcement during Tuesday‚Äôs press briefing shed light on the serious risks of Polymarket‚Äôs operations. The cyber police warned that the platform could pose significant economic and social risks if left unchecked. Notably, Polymarket‚Äôs potential benefits of encouraging the use of crypto assets were acknowledged. Authorities expressed concern that Polymarket‚Äôs activities could have far-reaching consequences for the public. The cybercrime unit has not provided a timeline for a potential shutdown. This warning aligns with a broader trend of increasing regulatory scrutiny on similar platforms across the region. Thai regulators, in particular, are focused on the role of virtual assets in these activities. Regions remain wary despite the former Prime Minister‚Äôs recent call to embrace crypto innovations . Regulators continue to view digital assets as a potential gateway to illegal gambling and related crimes. This has driven the cautious stance toward crypto regulations in Hong Kong. Polymarket‚Äôs Decentralized Dilemma: Is it Time for More Control? Polymarket‚Äôs decentralized setup presents a big challenge for governments. While it is an anonymous, peer-to-peer betting platform, it also creates gaps that could be used for illegal activities. Adding digital assets into the mix makes things even trickier. The platform makes transactions harder for regulatory agencies to track and control. Still, industry leaders, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, have defended the platform as a source of credibility. As the world figures out how to manage platforms like Polymarket, speculations are that it may to tighter global controls on decentralized markets. This comes as authorities work to address the concerns raised by users and crypto enthusiasts. A Global Trend Against Polymarket Thailand‚Äôs push to ban Polymarket is part of a broader global crackdown on decentralized betting platforms. Recently, users in Singapore reported issues accessing the site, with a message from local authorities declaring Polymarket illegal. Taiwan also took action last year, prosecuting an individual who placed a bet on political events using the platform. France has imposed restrictions on access to the platform. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recently cracked down on Crypto.com. The regulatory agency requested the exchange to suspend the operations of its newly launched prediction market platform across the 50 States. This growing wave of legal restrictions highlights the ongoing challenges posed by decentralized prediction markets in various jurisdictions. Governments are working to balance fostering innovation with maintaining regulatory control.

While the nation will be focused on President Trump's inauguration as our 47th President, the U.S. financial sector will be celebrating the resignation of Joe Biden's Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, Gary Gensler. As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I am well aware of Gensler's heavy-handed approach in stifling innovation and shackling the American economy's engine. His punitive stance was particularly damaging in the burgeoning field of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. While touting his actions as measures to protect investors, Gensler leveraged contrived ambiguity to undermine the growth and technological advancements that make U.S. markets competitive and drive promising projects offshore, including the development of the next generation of the internet. Under Gensler's leadership, the SEC's enforcement-focused agenda frequently did more harm than good, and ""regulatory uncertainty"" was used to attack American crypto exchanges like Bittrex, Kraken, and Coinbase, with Bittrex explicitly citing the effects of Gensler's approach when it exited the U.S. market. The question isn't whether cryptocurrency requires regulation ‚Äî it unquestionably does. Cryptocurrency, by its very design, challenges traditional financial systems and demands an entirely different regulatory framework ‚Äî one that balances consumer protection with the need to foster innovation. With the price of bitcoin recently breaking the $100,000 threshold, digital assets have demonstrated their staying power, and investors have already embraced their potential. Last year, I was proud to help the House pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act , a bill championed by our incoming Financial Services Chair French Hill. FIT 21 represents a groundbreaking shift in the legislative landscape and would establish a responsible new regulatory framework that clearly defines the role of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This would offer much-needed clarity to a rapidly evolving market and, unlike the SEC's enforcement-heavy playbook, FIT 21 both fosters transparency and innovation and protects consumers without stifling creativity. I applaud Rep. Hill for his work on this, and look forward to his ongoing efforts in tandem with President Trump in this arena. President Trump demonstrated a keen understanding of cryptocurrency's transformative potential during his historic campaign. Polling demonstrates that his embrace of these issues helped him earn broad support from younger and more diverse voters for whom cryptocurrency is a staple of daily life. During his first administration, President Trump's SEC worked collaboratively with the crypto industry to enforce securities laws without alienating innovators, offering clear guidance through landmark initiatives like the DAO Report and the Framework for Investment Contract Analysis of Digital Assets . These resources provided critical insights to help entrepreneurs navigate compliance while building groundbreaking technologies. Beyond the Biden administration's hostility to crypto, Chuck Schumer and Democrats in the Senate refused to consider FIT 21 after it passed the House with overwhelming, bipartisan support. Moreover, in New York, the courts thwarted Governor Hochul's attempt to shutter bitcoin miners by deploying the state's radical climate law. In anticipation of President Trump's return and Republican majorities in the House and Senate, the crypto market is booming, with the price of bitcoin increasing by up to 33% since Election Day. Moreover, President Trump's new cabinet and the Department of Governmental Efficiency could revolutionize the way federal agencies operate and save taxpayers billions by integrating blockchain technology across government. With President Trump's appointment of Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair, we can expect a more thoughtful and transparent approach to governance and policies that encourage innovation while safeguarding investors ‚Äî setting the stage for the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector to thrive and the creation of high-paying new American jobs. We will be able to move beyond the opportunities missed during the Biden administration and build a framework that positions the U.S. as a leader in the global digital economy.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-15 19:10:16

On Wednesday, Manhattan federal judge John G. Koelt passed the latest verdict against the crypto exchange. This brings an end to the years-long saga over money laundering violations in the United States. In a Jan. 15 hearing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge John Koeltl passed the sentence on BitMEX, nearly six months after the crypto exchange pleaded guilty to violating the US Bank Secrecy Act by operating without ‚Äúany meaningful‚Äù anti-money laundering program. In July 2024, the crypto company referred to the allegations as ‚Äúold news,‚Äù implying that no additional fines were expected. BitMEX responds to the court fines In a statement to its users after the judgment, BitMEX said, ‚ÄúWhilst we are disappointed to learn of the imposition of an additional financial penalty, the amount is substantially less than what the Department of Justice have been pursuing us for over 3 years.‚Äù BitMEX The exchange‚Äôs attorneys maintained that earlier $110 million penalties and previous guilty pleas were adequate punishment for the offenses that took place between 2015 and 2020, but Koeltl disagreed. According to the crypto exchange, ‚ÄúThis process has run on for years, during which the DOJ first asked for over USD 200 million of new money to settle a plea deal ‚Äì once we refused this ridiculous offer, they then sought a penalty of approximately USD 420 million in the sentencing proceedings.‚Äù BitMEX adds, ‚ÄúGiven that the Court has determined an amount substantially below these levels is a justification of our stance and we query whether U.S. taxpayer resources could have been better applied over this period.‚Äù How did BitMEX get here? Prosecutors alleged that BitMEX violated the BSA‚Äôs regulations by conducting business with US-based customers. This was despite the fact that the BSA mandates that financial institutions implement measures to detect and prevent money laundering. Apparently, between September 2015 and September 2020, the crypto exchange based in Seychelles willfully neglected to establish an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) program. To that end, the crypto exchange pleaded guilty to a single count of violating the BSA in federal court in Manhattan. Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, the founders of BitMEX, remarked on social media that this was not new news and that the penalties had already been paid in 2022. Notably, the company‚Äôs three founders stated this because BitMEX reached agreements with US regulators years ago for similar activity over the same timeframe. The corporation agreed to pay $100 million in 2021, and the founders pleaded guilty to identical allegations before the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2022. BitMEX later announced that its KYC and AML programs have been subjected to an independent audit. The conclusion was that this charge has no effect on their business operations. The criteria that BitMEX has been working to survive in the US According to prosecutors, BitMEX made claims to cease conducting business in the United States in 2015. However, it implemented inadequate measures to prevent US residents from accessing the exchange while executives promoted it at conferences in the United States. The Department of Justice (DOJ) stated that new clients were occasionally only required to provide an email address to verify their identity. In addition, the DOJ claimed that BitMEX advertised itself as a platform that allowed retail consumers to trade crypto without real-name verification. It also claimed that it allowed them to register and trade without providing any identifying information or documentation until September 2020. Moreover, prosecutors reported that a BitMEX originator acquired a Hong Kong-based business that was used as a pass-through for US-dollar transactions. The exchange lied about its true purpose to an unnamed Hong Kong-based bank, and the fraud continued until 2020. This is a developing story, and more information will be added as it becomes available.

Following Bitcoin‚Äôs rally above $97, market optimism has pushed most cryptocurrencies into the green. Analysts suggest ADA could potentially skyrocket beyond $1.7, reflecting growing investor confidence and alignment with the market‚Äôs upward trajectory. The bullish momentum appears strong. Can Cardano Price Rally Above $1.7 Soon? Crypto analyst show highlights a potentially bullish setup for Cardano price based on its daily chart. The analysis indicates that the cryptocurrency is currently trading within a bullish pennant pattern, which could lead to a significant price breakout. A bullish pennant forms when a period of consolidation follows a sharp upward movement, suggesting the potential for another upward surge. If the breakout materializes as expected, ADA could target a price of $1.74. The pennant‚Äôs upper resistance and lower support lines are converging, suggesting a breakout could occur soon. Analysts believe that a move above the resistance line would confirm the bullish momentum. If ADA achieves the projected breakout, it would represent a substantial gain from its current price levels. Source: X ADA Price Is Primed For More Gain Ahead As of the reporting time, the ADA price is trading at $1.06, having surged 57% in the past 24 hours. The rally comes as bullish momentum drives the token beyond key resistance levels, sparking optimism among traders and investors. The Cardano price prediction successfully broke above the $1.00 psychological level, a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency. This movement indicates a strong bullish trend, with the next resistance targets identified at $1.50 and $1.70. Support levels are clearly defined at $0.90 and $1.00, offering strong downside protection. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 64, signaling strong buying pressure while remaining below overbought territory. Cardano Price Chart: TradingView The latest data indicates a surge in whale transactions exceeding $100,000 on the Cardano price network. This coincided with a notable rise in ADA‚Äôs price, suggesting increased market activity. The chart shows heightened transaction volumes during periods of price peaks, hinting at strategic moves by large holders. Source: Santiment In conclusion, ADA‚Äôs breakout above critical resistance levels marks a pivotal moment for the asset. Traders should watch for sustained momentum above $1.00 while keeping an eye on the $1.50 and $1.70 targets. As long as market conditions remain supportive, ADA could continue its impressive rally.

The involved cryptocurrencies saw minor gains, possibly boosted by the company‚Äôs support and the broader resurgence of the crypto market. Further Support for These Cryptocurrencies The world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange recently included Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) as collateral assets on Fixed Rate Loan. It also added ChainGPT (CGPT) as a loanable asset on the VIP Loan. Binance‚Äôs Fixed Rate Loan program enables users to borrow or lend stablecoins at fixed interest rates, ensuring predictable costs and returns. Borrowers secure loans with collateral. Well-known cryptocurrencies that can serve that role include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX), as well as the recently added DOGE and LTC. ‚ÄúThe platform effectively matches the needs of suppliers and borrowers. Fixed Rate Loan is over-collateralized, supporting multi-asset collateral to reduce liquidation risk. It also features an efficient automated process with auto-repay and auto-renew options,‚Äù the company explained. For its part, the company‚Äôs VIP Loan service offers over-collateralized loans for institutional and large-scale clients, providing flexible terms, competitive rates, and access to multiple assets. DOGE, LTC, and CGPT have all charted gains in the last 24 hours. However, the support from Binance might not be the only factor contributing to their positive performance. Another element is the overall resurgence of the cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin (BTC) exceeded $98K, while Ripple (XRP) tapped a seven-year high of almost $2.90. Other top performers include Stellar (XLM), Cardano (ADA) , and more. The Delisting Effort Besides adding new services to clients, Binance often removes cryptocurrencies or certain trading pairs due to factors like poor liquidity. Several hours ago, it announced that the following spot trading pairs: BNX/BTC, CATI/BNB, CATI/BRL, CHZ/FDUSD, DOGS/BNB, GTC/BTC, HIGH/BTC, LISTA/BRL, NOT/BRL, PIXEL/BTC, TKO/BTC, TWT/BTC will no longer be available from January 17. Spot trading services for the aforementioned will also be terminated on that date. ‚ÄúUsers are strongly advised to update and/or cancel their Spot Trading Bots prior to the cessation of Spot Trading Bots services to avoid any potential losses,‚Äù the exchange advised. Earlier this year, Binance conducted a similar amendment, disclosing that LIT/BTC, NULS/BTC, SFP/BTC, BEL/BTC, and LSK/BTC will become unavailable to clients from January 16 .

Among the predictions, Bitcoin is expected to break the $300,000 mark, while Ethereum could exceed $8,000, driven by growing adoption and institutional investments. The company‚Äôs forecasts were based on insights from nearly 50,000 community members who voted during a nine-day period. Bitcoin to Surpass $300K Amid Market Growth HashKey sees Bitcoin potentially rising to $300,000 by 2025 due to the growing acceptance as a ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô and the rising institutional investment. The cryptocurrency industry is expected to reach a total market capitalization of $10 trillion due to the entry of new investors and the innovation in the technology of the blockchain. At the time of the prediction, Bitcoin price was $99,367 with the price slowly rising after some fluctuations in the recent past. Technical analysis shows that there is a strong buying pressure around $92,300, which may propel Bitcoin further upwards. HashKey also pointed out that this growth could be significantly influenced by regulatory certainty and approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Dr. Xiao Feng, Chairman and CEO of HashKey Group said, ‚Äú2025 is the starting point of the ‚ÄòGolden Decade of Web3‚Äô with immense potential.‚Äù Approval of XRP and Solana ETFs Expected HashKey, like JPMorgan Chase , expects that Solana (SOL) and XRP will be approved for the use in new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which may draw in billions of dollars in investments. These ETFs are expected to further increase the institutional investment in the cryptocurrency space and thus help in the growth of the sector. The group noted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not made any decision on these ETFs but if approved, they could boost capital inflows. This comes after the launch of other crypto ETFs by HashKey in Hong Kong in 2024 which provided significant inflows to Bitcoin and Ethereum. ‚ÄùNew ETFs for assets like XRP and SOL could serve as a gateway for more investors to enter the crypto market,‚Äù HashKey said. Growth in Stablecoins and Real-World Assets According to the research, the market capitalization of USDT, USDC, and other USD-pegged stablecoins will likely reach $300 billion by 2025 due to the increasing need for regulated and asset-backed digital dollars. At the moment, Tether is the most popular stablecoin with USDT in circulation amounting to $138 billion, while Circle‚Äôs USDC is second with $46 billion. According to HashKey, these include stablecoins that are backed by yield-bearing and real-world assets which have the potential of connecting the traditional and digital financial systems. In addition, stablecoins and new payment systems are expected to be supported by new regulations in many regions. U.S. Policy Changes and Strategic Bitcoin Reserve HashKey expects the U.S. government to adopt more crypto-friendly policies under the new administration, including approval of the FIT21 Act. This act would expand the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and create a clearer framework for digital commodities like Bitcoin. The prediction also includes the establishment of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve to support the dollar and maintain global financial stability. This move could further solidify Bitcoin‚Äôs status as a key global asset.

A federal judge ordered HDR Global Trading Limited, BitMEX‚Äôs parent company, to pay the penalty along with a two-year unsupervised probation sentence. In a ruling on Wednesday, January 15, 2025, U.S. District Court Judge John Koeltl, of the Southern District of New York, rejected BitMEX‚Äôs argument that an earlier $110 million fine was sufficient for its violations. The order comes six months after BitMEX‚Äôs parent company pleaded guilty to charges of violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. In July 2024, the company downplayed the new guilty plea as ‚Äúold news,‚Äù pointing out that its founders had already made similar pleas in 2022.

After the exchange rejected that offer, the government pursued penalties of up to $420 million. ‚ÄúGiven that the Court has determined an amount substantially below these levels is a justification of our stance and we query whether U.S. taxpayer resources could have been better applied over this period,‚Äô BitMEX wrote.

The metric may mean Solana will keep attracting more developers with the promise of a more profitable app. Solana apps attract nearly 57% of revenues by chain, displacing Ethereum‚Äôs influence. This trend accelerated in the last quarter of 2024 when the meme token market had another active season, followed by the launch of AI agents. Since all activities on Solana happen directly on the L1 chain, there are multiple requirements to transact and trade successfully. As a result, the top revenue producers were the Raydium DEX and the main block builder, JitoSOL. Metaplex was in the third spot, showing the potential of Solana-based platforms for token creation. Solana apps achieved $751M in revenues for the last quarter of 2024, while Ethereum‚Äôs app ecosystem only generated $314M. The app fees usually stay with the team, with a few exceptions, such as offering revenue-sharing incentives. For some, the extraction of value is a problem, especially for Solana, which has the biggest expenses for each $1 in revenues. Solana started to surpass Ethereum in terms of revenues around April 2024, when the Dencun upgrade significantly cut the rents received from L2 chains. Due to previous periods of gains, Ethereum was still the bigger gainer for the whole year, but the balance may shift completely in 2025. Ethereum takes up just 18% of app revenue, while Base draws in 9%. Even with the addition of Arbitrum and Base, the Ethereum ecosystem lags behind Solana in terms of app free generation. For Ethereum, the most productive apps include Tether and Uniswap, which are linked to the highest activity levels. Despite being the go-to chain for lending and DeFi, Ethereum and its ecosystem lagged behind the economic activity of Solana. The single chain displaced Ethereum and its top L2 in terms of active, user-directed apps that also generated regular revenue streams. App revenues show the economic value of a chain and the possibility of extracting value from user activity. Pump.fun is one example of a cash cow app that produces outsized revenues from a growing user base. With the rise of AI agents and new ways to issue tokens, Solana may become more appealing for building the new generation of crypto platforms. At this point, top apps produce most of the revenues, but the platform model allowing new launches proved the most successful. Solana hosted multiple new trends, including AI agents, AI platform tokens, and DeSci. Solana begins attracting more developers The trend of fat fee apps helped Solana attract more developers in the past year. In 2024, based on the inflow of new developers, Solana surpassed Ethereum. During the bull market, Solana also attracted 7,625 developers, while Ethereum attracted 6,456 contributors. Solana still has only 55 core developers, with the majority linked to newer projects. Core development activity remained at a baseline level for the past year. New product launches concentrated around memes and AI personalities. Developers and app builders tend to follow the chains with the biggest chance of inviting users and producing revenues. Solana far surpasses other chains in terms of weekly and monthly active users, setting a series of records in the past year. SOL still expected to move to a higher price range As a result of its active app ecosystem, SOL tokens are expected to continue rising in 2025. After essentially starting from scratch, Solana proves to be one of the few scalable chains. Failed transactions are also one of the main sources of revenues, creating a market for block-builders with priority fees and bribes. SOL still hovers just under $200 despite the expansion in the past year. The asset rallied and turned into one of the main venues for builders in the past year, surpassing previous peak performers. If the chain continues to outperform and becomes the central hub for crypto activity, SOL is expected to rally to a new price range.

Koeltl has directed BitMEX to pay a $100 million fine, representing the latest development in an ongoing legal dispute regarding money laundering infractions in the US. BitMEX Faces Major Legal Setback The legal challenges for BitMEX stem from activities between 2015 and 2020, during which the exchange reportedly failed to adhere to the United States Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The BSA requires financial institutions to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering. Related Reading: What Bitcoin Election Patterns Could Signal For Its Price Ahead Of January 20 Inauguration Despite BitMEX‚Äôs attorneys arguing that a previous $110 million fine and earlier guilty pleas from the exchange‚Äôs founders were sufficient punishment, Judge Koeltl deemed additional financial penalties necessary. In 2022, BitMEX‚Äôs founders, Arthur Hayes, and Benjamin Delo, admitted guilt to comparable charges, with both consenting to pay a $10 million criminal penalty. Exchange Implements Enhanced KYC And AML Measures In a statement following the ruling, the company expressed disappointment over the additional financial penalty but noted that the amount was significantly lower than the Department of Justice‚Äôs (DOJ) initial demands, which exceeded $200 million during plea negotiations and rose to approximately $420 million during sentencing discussions. The exchange emphasized its commitment to compliance, stating that it has made significant improvements to its operations since the period covered by the BSA charges. This includes implementing a robust user verification program and comprehensive Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. BitMEX asserts that these advancements have been recognized by users, partners, and regulatory stakeholders.

Nasdaq: Is The Correlation Affecting Crypto Outflows?,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4749732-bitcoin-vs-nasdaq-is-the-correlation-affecting-crypto-outflows?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary Bitcoin has recovered from a sharp selloff earlier in the week, rising from around 89000 to nearly 98500 post CPI. ETF flow data shows three consecutive days of net outflows for Bitcoin as correlation with Nasdaq grows. Could a Trump Presidency lead to significant capital inflow into Bitcoin in 2025? Technically, Bitcoin is at a critical juncture breaking the 50-day moving average and eyeing the 100k handle. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has staged an impressive recovery since Monday afternoon lows around the 89000 mark. Cryptocurrencies were also affected by US jobs data ahead of the weekend, and the stronger US Dollar early on Monday was in part responsible for the sharp selloff. The recovery has been swift, however, with Bitcoin rising from a Monday low of around 89000 to end the day just shy of the 95000 handle. Yesterday the world's largest crypto by market cap edged above the key 95000 handle to trade at a high of 97339 (helped by softer than expected US PPI data) before facing some resistance by the 50-day MA. Let us take a look at the performance of the Crypto market for the day. Crypto Heatmap (post CPI), January 15, 2025 Source: TradingView ETF Flow Data Shows 3 Successive Days of Outflows Looking at ETF flow data courtesy of Farside investors, Bitcoin has recorded three consecutive days of net outflows with the largest being on Monday. Bitcoin started the week recording $284.1m of net outflows and followed that up with outflows totaling $209.8m yesterday. It will be interesting to gauge whether ETF flows turn positive again ahead of the Trump inauguration next week. Source: Farside Investors There could be a host of reasons for this, but one which has gained traction this week stems from a report showing the increase in correlation between US indices (particularly Nas100) and Bitcoin. K33 Research Report ‚Äì Nasdaq vs Bitcoin Correlation K33 Research‚Äôs latest ‚ÄúAhead of the Curve‚Äù report highlights that the crypto market is facing the same challenges affecting global markets. Over the past month, Bitcoin ((BTC)) and the Nasdaq have become more closely linked, with their current 30-day connection reaching its highest point in 2024. According to K33‚Äôs analyst, Trump is expected to push for policies that grow the economy, extend the 2017 tax cuts, and provide more tax breaks for working-class Americans. These actions could be positive for riskier investments like crypto. The analyst also noted that Trump is likely to introduce crypto-friendly policies, which could benefit the crypto market. Such data may be contributing to ETF outflows as institutional investors looked at Bitcoin as a sort of portfolio hedge providing diversification. However if the correlation with US stocks continues this could result in allocations for equities and Bitcoin being split rather than having their own allocations. In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, VanEck‚Äôs CEO, Jan van Eck stated that ‚Äòit is disappointing to note the correlation between Bitcoin and Nasdaq over the past 6 months. Mr van Eck went further by saying that many people are looking at Bitcoin for the first time which is not what you want (referring to the growing correlation). If you look at the ten-year correlations, they are almost zero, which is really what diversification should be. We‚Äôll have to see how Bitcoin performs going forward.‚Äô Such comments tend to support the idea that the higher the correlation between the Nasdaq and Bitcoin, the greater the chance that outflows may increase due to portfolio diversification and positioning. Trump Inauguration to Fuel Crypto Rally? As you can see from the K33 research report above, there is optimism that a Trump Presidency will provide a major boost to the crypto industry. According to CryptoQuant, About $520 billion of fresh capital could flow into Bitcoin in 2025. In the context of favorable regulatory, monetary and cyclical conditions, it‚Äôs reasonable to expect capital to continue flowing into Bitcoin in 2025 the data and analytics provider added. The idea of a bullish run in 2025 for crypto is further supported by Pantera Capital, who claims that the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump should propel Bitcoin to new heights. Another interesting one to keep an eye on as inauguration day draws closer. Bitcoin realized cap data Source: CryptoQuant An accompanying chart (above) shows Bitcoin‚Äôs realized market cap with the combined value of the supply as it moves on chain since 2015. If the market follows historical patterns, CryptoQuant said, the $520 billion tally becomes attainable. Such a move would no doubt fuel rallies in price, but leaves one with many questions. US Data Could Temporarily Drive Bitcoins Price US inflation data came out a short while ago with the Core inflation print YoY softer than expected. It will be interesting to see if this helps propel Bitcoin toward the 100000 mark and beyond. Technical Analysis ‚Äì BTC/USD Rests at Critical Juncture Bitcoin (BTC/USD) from a technical standpoint on the daily timeframe the overall price action has been messy. The reason for my observation stems from the lack of a convincing break of the previous swing low around 91800. Though prices plunged below $90000 handle for a moment on Monday the swiftness with which prices rose suggest strong buying pressure remains in play. As things stand, BTC/USD is a critical juncture as it tests 50-day MA which could serve to cap gains. A failure to break back above and find acceptance could lead to a sharper selloff. A rejection of this level brings the 95000 and 90000 into play, before attention turns to the 91804 and 90000 handle.

According to a new report by Reuters, three anonymous people who were briefed on the matter say that Trump‚Äôs next pick ‚Äì which is slated to be former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins ‚Äì is expected to end the government‚Äôs clampdown on the digital assets industry. If confirmed by the Senate, Atkins will replace Gary Gensler, President Joe Biden‚Äôs pick to head the SEC. With Gensler at its helm, the SEC filed numerous high-profile lawsuits against prominent crypto firms, including Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple Labs, and Consensys. Gensler will resign on January 20th before Trump is inaugurated, and Reuters reports that pro-crypto Commissioners Mark Uyeda and Hester Pierce will ‚Äúget the ball rolling‚Äù in the interim by pushing to create transparent guidelines, such as clarifying whether the SEC considers crypto assets as securities or not. Two of the sources said that in the first few days of the Trump Administration, the SEC will examine its lawsuits against crypto firms and freeze the ones that do not involve fraud, a move described as ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù by lawyers. Robert Cohen, who was previously employed by the SEC‚Äôs enforcement division, told Reuters that the SEC‚Äôs new leadership would continue to be tough on fraud. ‚ÄúI think the industry wants to see fraudsters or wrongdoers held accountable.‚Äù Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Oklahoma Proposes Bitcoin Reserve Act The proposed legislation, officially titled the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, would allow Oklahoma‚Äôs state savings accounts and pension funds to invest in Bitcoin. According to Maynard, the initiative aims to protect citizens‚Äô purchasing power and generate stable returns in the face of inflationary pressures. ‚ÄúBitcoin represents freedom from bureaucrats printing away our purchasing power,‚Äù Maynard said.

The legislation also reflects broader efforts to integrate digital assets into state-level financial strategies. If passed, it would authorize state fund managers to allocate a portion of public funds to Bitcoin investments, with the goal of maintaining financial stability and enhancing returns for state-managed accounts.

However, the plan will incur a $2 per month per user increase. The new pricing is effective immediately for new customers, and existing customers will begin to experience adjustments on March 17, 2025. For the time being, these pricing adjustments do not apply to small business customers. Additionally, after January 31, customers who have previously acquired the Gemini for Workspace add-on will continue to have access to its features and will no longer be charged for the subscription. This change enhances the process of accessing Workplace AI tools, such as automated note-taking, email summaries, and conversing with the Gemini bot. Previously, customers who wanted to use all of the AI features were required to pay an additional $20 per user per month for the Gemini for Workplace plan. This was in addition to the $12 payment for the Workspace Business Standard plan. Currently, the standard plan is priced at $14 per subscriber per month. Google‚Äôs initiative to compete with other companies Google is currently one of the most vertically integrated AI products available. However, this is only relevant if the entire system is being used. Cost is the primary obstacle that companies face when engaged regarding AI. Jerry Dischler, Google‚Äôs president of cloud applications, said, ‚ÄúThat is the reason they step in with such caution This is a substantial sum of money, and we should demonstrate its worth.‚Äù The several app roadmaps are already undergoing changes, and he anticipates that new features will be released at a rapid pace. Notably, this update is an element of a competitive effort to compete with Microsoft and other organizations that are incorporating AI capabilities into their standard offerings. Apparently, Microsoft included its Copilot Pro AI capabilities in the standard Microsoft 365 subscription in November. Before this, it was a $20 monthly upgrade, but now, it will be included in the standard Microsoft 365 subscription. Also, this is applicable solely to the Personal and Family subscriptions and only in a limited number of locations. In addition, Elon Musk introduced his AI chatbot Grok X for free to some extent. Free users receive 10 message credits and 10 image generation credits every two hours. Still, these companies are all aware that this is their opportunity to introduce new methods of using their products and attract new consumers. They are wagering that the long-term benefits of widely implementing all of these AI features will outweigh the costs. Part of Workspace AI is email summaries in Gmail, generated designs for spreadsheets and videos, an automated note-taker for meetings, the potent NotebookLM research assistant, and writing tools across apps. Google‚Äôs NotebookLM AI podcast hosts get annoyed at humans In other news, AI podcast hosts have anger issues. But can we blame the bots? Interruptions are irritating. It appears that even podcast hosts who are generated by AI agree. Apparently, the users of Google NotebookLM discovered this. After we launched interactive Audio Overviews, which let you ""call in"" and ask the AI hosts a live question, we had to do some ‚Äúfriendliness tuning‚Äù because the hosts seemed annoyed at being interrupted. File this away in ‚Äúthings I never thought would be my job, but are.‚Äù ‚Äî notebooklm (@notebooklm) January 13, 2025 NotebookLM was introduced last year and quickly gained popularity due to its innovative features. This feature generates podcast-like discussions from content that users submit, which are moderated by chatty AI agents who imitate podcast presenters. Last month, NotebookLM introduced a new feature known as ‚ÄúInteractive Mode.‚Äù This feature enables users to ‚Äúcall in‚Äù to the podcast and ask questions, essentially interrupting the AI hosts as they speak. The AI hosts appeared to be irritated by these interruptions when the feature was initially implemented. They were occasionally providing snippy comments to human respondents, such as ‚ÄúI was getting to that‚Äù or ‚ÄúAs I was about to say,‚Äù which felt ‚Äúoddly adversarial.‚Äù Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs, said, ‚ÄúWe tested a variety of different prompts, often studying how people on the team would answer interruptions, and we landed on a new prompt that we think feels more friendly and engaging,‚Äù Still, the cause of the issue remains unclear. Occasionally, human podcast presenters exhibit frustration when they are interrupted, which may be recorded in a system‚Äôs training data. However, this case is most likely the result of the system‚Äôs prompting design, not the training data.

In the filing in the High Court of England and Wales, it shows signs of an escalating fight between the two firms over the governance of their jointly-owned firm. The collaboration started in 2022 by establishing a joint venture called 2040 Energy for the development of Bitcoin mining. According to the dea l: Background of the Dispute Tether supplied the capital. Swan Bitcoin handled the daily operations. Things took a turn for the worse when Swan accused the former employees of using misappropriated trade secrets to establish Proton Management, its competitor. In particular, Swan argued that the employees had misappropriated Swan‚Äôs proprietary information, such as software and strategic business plans, to interfere with Swan‚Äôs position in the joint venture. Claims Against Proton Management Swan Bitcoin framed this as a plan of ‚Äúrain and hellfire‚Äù perpetrated by key former employees, which included the following persons: Michael Holmes ‚Äì former head of business development Raphael Zagury ‚Äì ex-CIO and mining head, currently Proton‚Äôs CEO. Swan accused Proton of using stolen trade secrets to directly compete against him and of influencing Tether into backing Proton over him in the mining project. In fact, by this past August 2024, Swan‚Äôs CEO, Cory Klippsten, had already been removed from 2040 Energy, with Proton Management taking over the operations. Defense of Tether Tether has denied all allegations by Swan, insisting the company acted within its contractual rights. It also stated it had always acted in good faith in accordance with the agreements and in pursuit of mutual business goals. The company accused Swan of reckless conduct causing significant breaches of their partnership agreements. Legal and Industry Implications The case throws into sharp relief the complexity and risk inherent in joint-venture deals in such a fast-changing cryptocurrency market . Disputes like this can make several would-be collaborators shy away, pointing to wider questions of governance, intellectual property, and trust in this sector. The result in this case could set a precedent for the handling of disputes in the crypto space and might have an impact on how partnerships and agreements are set up going forward.

XRP Price Prediction: On the Cusp of a Significant Movement? XRP currently finds itself in a precarious position, trading sideways and down by more than 4%. Recent XRP price prediction suggests that surpassing the $2.51 threshold could catalyze a crucial breakout, signaling a potential upward trajectory. Although XRP has rallied recently, it has yet to overcome this notable resistance. Beyond this, the $2.72 level looms even larger, where surpassing it could clearly indicate a bullish trend. It‚Äôs essential to monitor the $1.96 support level, as dipping below this could disrupt the current bullish pattern and potentially trigger a bearish downturn. Currently, XRP is maintaining its position above the $2.24-$2.23 support zone, with ongoing XRP price predictions indicating that a rise in its value is still a possibility. For investors, monitoring these levels closely could be essential. The Graph‚Äôs Upgrade: A Leap Toward Decentralized Knowledge Sharing The Graph‚Äôs upgrade introduces Geo Genesis, a new app designed to decentralize knowledge sharing effectively. Operating on the Solana Blockchain, Geo Genesis enables users to manage and share knowledge within collaborative groups known as ‚ÄúSpaces.‚Äù This release is in line with the GRC-20 data standard, which bolsters interoperability and flexibility, integrating governance tools that enhance community participation. The Graph‚Äôs upgrade shifts focus toward knowledge-based applications marks a significant evolution from its initial asset-centric focus, now offering roles such as Editors and Members to encourage structured community involvement. This strategic enhancement since its 2018 debut promises to expand its influence significantly across the Web3 ecosystem, now encompassing over 80 blockchains, including Solana. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Decentralized Solutions Web3Bay (3BAY) is making substantial strides within the Web3 ecosystem through its innovative decentralized e-commerce platform. This platform offers a user-driven environment where transactions for digital assets are conducted securely, without intermediaries, and free from additional fees. The driving force behind Web3Bay‚Äôs functionality is the 3BAY token, which not only facilitates transactions but also rewards users and grants them governance rights, empowering them to influence the future direction of the platform. Web3Bay‚Äôs presale is currently making waves, now in its third stage, with the 3BAY token priced attractively at $0.0039675. To date, the initiative has raised over $700,000 and sold more than 200 million tokens, with projections showing a potential ROI of 6430% for early investors at launch. The rapid adoption of the 3BAY token highlights the community‚Äôs growing enthusiasm, offering early participants exclusive benefits and the opportunity to shape the future of the Web3 ecosystem. As the presale continues, the value proposition of engaging early becomes increasingly evident. Web3Bay is not merely advancing the Web3 ecosystem ; it is revolutionizing global online commerce by providing secure, decentralized marketplaces that redefine shopping experiences worldwide. Key Insights The Web3 ecosystem is experiencing rapid advancements, highlighted by the XRP price prediction indicating a possible breakout above $2.51 and The Graph‚Äôs innovative upgrade with its Geo Genesis app, setting new standards in data interaction. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is at the forefront of transforming the e-commerce landscape with its dynamic 3BAY token, robust marketplace, and active presale. As XRP manages market challenges and The Graph expands data accessibility, Web3Bay is redefining global shopping with a user-centric, transparent approach, positioning itself as a key player in the future of decentralized e-commerce.

This comes at a critical time when the market is in consolidation, fluctuating within key levels. Conversely, innovative AI altcoins like PropiChain (PCHAIN) are gaining significant traction among investors, promising substantial growth. Bullish analysts even project a surge for the PCHAIN AI altcoin that could surpass the explosive 2021‚Äì2022 Dogecoin price rally. Dogecoin Price Uncertain Horizon Currently the Dogecoin price is at approximately $0.32055, reflecting a notable decline over recent weeks. Analysts who previously predicted its peak in 2022 are now expressing concerns about a bearish trend that could see the Dogecoin price dip below critical support levels. The market sentiment surrounding the Dogecoin price has shifted, with some experts suggesting it might struggle to maintain its current price range amidst growing competition from newer cryptocurrencies and changing investor priorities2. Despite its historical highs and the fervent community backing it, the recent Dogecoin price performance indicates a potential investor risk. The technical indicators suggest a neutral stance; however, bearish signals loom as the RSI hovers around 41.43, indicating that the market isn‚Äôt firmly in bullish or bearish territory1. With support levels identified around $0.31 and resistance at $0.35 for the Dogecoin price, traders are set to remain vigilant as fluctuations are expected in the near term. Factors Set to Trigger PropiChain‚Äôs (PCHAIN) Ai Altcoin Surge In conjunction with its native AI altcoin, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is redefining real estate investment by combining AI, blockchain, NFTs, and the metaverse to address challenges in property ownership and management. This is in a quest to democratize real estate investing and reduce traditional inefficiencies. One of PropiChain‚Äôs standout features is its NFT tokenization mechanism. The platform facilitates smooth ownership transfer and property trading by transforming physical properties into digital assets. This innovative approach eliminates the cumbersome paperwork, exorbitant costs, and time delays associated with traditional real estate processes. Through fractional ownership enabled by NFTs, PropiChain opens up real estate investment to a broader audience. Investors can purchase shares of high-value properties, diversify their portfolios, and trade their ownership fractions directly on the platform. This groundbreaking model brings liquidity to a traditionally illiquid market while ensuring transparency and security through blockchain technology. Moreover, PropiChain‚Äôs AI-driven predictive market analysis gives users actionable insights into future real estate trends. This allows investors to anticipate market shifts, optimize their portfolios, and capitalize on emerging opportunities. The platform also employs Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) to deliver real-time, data-driven property valuations, ensuring fair pricing for buyers and sellers. Moreover, the PCHAIN smart contracts, audited by BlockAudit, help automate future transactions and rent collections. PropiChain‚Äôs decentralized nature eliminates geographical barriers, granting users access to global real estate markets. Its platform guarantees legal and compliance mechanisms, empowering individual and institutional investors to expand their property holdings without the constraints of traditional systems. The platform‚Äôs security framework is anchored by its ‚ÄúTitle Contract,‚Äù a decentralized ledger that records and updates all property transactions. This system provides transparency, mitigates trust issues, and prevents fraud, making PropiChain a reliable and secure investment platform. PropiChain integrates the metaverse into its ecosystem beyond conventional real estate platforms. Through its ‚ÄúPropiverse,‚Äù users can explore properties in immersive 3D environments, enabling a deeper understanding of property features and layouts without needing physical visits. The PCHAIN AI altcoin is the backbone of PropiChain‚Äôs ecosystem. It grants users access to key features, including property NFT purchases, AI-driven insights, and DeFi applications. Tokenomics are designed to guarantee long-term sustainability, with a controlled tax structure that supports liquidity and incentivizes early adopters. The Lucrative PropiChain AI Altcoin Presale The PropiChain AI altcoin presale is structured in stages, each offering early investors a chance to secure substantial returns. Currently it is in the second presale at $0.011 with extra AI altcoins for current investors. The listing price is set at $0.032, offering current investors a remarkable opportunity for nearly 800% ROI. Currently listed on CoinMarketCap , analysts are forecasting a surge to $1 by Q2, which could translate to over 10,000% ROI for early participants. With over $2.5 million already raised in the presale, this impressive milestone highlights the growing confidence in PropiChain‚Äôs groundbreaking vision and potential. Bonuses ranging from 20% to 25% are available to early participants, making early adoption even more rewarding. As the Dogecoin price movement wanes, now is the ideal time to diversify into PCHAIN. This AI altcoin offers unparalleled access to the real estate market at an entry price and ROI potential that‚Äôs hard to match.

This move is a key event for both entities, prompting discussions on how Bock‚Äôs insights will direct BlockDAG (BDAG) and if it will challenge or support Cardano. With BlockDAG‚Äôs presale reaching $180 million, this move adds a competitive edge to the blockchain industry. Marius Bock: A Proven Blockchain Leader Marius Bock‚Äôs period at Cardano demonstrated his skill in handling intricate blockchain issues. Recognized for his strategic thinking and technical know-how, Bock significantly enhanced Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem. His efforts improved the project‚Äôs scalability, smart contract functionality, and user involvement, establishing Cardano as a leading blockchain platform. Moving to BlockDAG, Bock carries extensive experience in decentralized networks and consensus models, closely aligning with BlockDAG‚Äôs emphasis on scalability and quickness. His track record of implementing efficient solutions makes BlockDAG a formidable participant in the blockchain field. This shift also brings up discussions about how BlockDAG and Cardano compare, as both aim to boost blockchain efficiency. BlockDAG‚Äôs Presale Success: A Rising Force BlockDAG‚Äôs presale achievements highlight its increasing popularity. The project has amassed nearly $180 million, attracting over 170,000 unique holders. Now in its 27th batch, the presale price of BDAG coins has risen from $0.001 to $0.0248, a 2,380% increase. Participants are especially interested in the project‚Äôs promise of scalability, efficiency, and its forthcoming introduction on ten major centralized exchanges. BlockDAG‚Äôs standout attribute is its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture, aimed at addressing scalability challenges common in traditional blockchain setups. Unlike linear blockchains, DAG structures permit multiple transactions to occur at once, notably decreasing wait times and boosting throughput. This makes BlockDAG a scalable rival to Cardano, which uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus model. Although Cardano has advanced its transaction capability with updates like Hydra, BlockDAG‚Äôs distinctive architecture could provide quicker and more efficient options. Bock‚Äôs thorough comprehension of Cardano‚Äôs strong points and challenges prepares him well to position BlockDAG effectively against competitors in the market. Scalability Showdown: BlockDAG vs. Cardano Marius Bock‚Äôs move to BlockDAG might open doors for cooperation with Cardano due to their mutual goals of scalability and decentralized applications. Yet, it primes them for rivalry as BlockDAG hastens its efforts to debut on major exchanges and draw a wider audience. Cardano maintains its edge with a research-oriented approach and active community participation. Its systematic network upgrades, like smart contract improvements and interoperability projects, have cultivated a dedicated following. Conversely, BlockDAG focuses on swift processing and scalability, qualities that, along with Bock‚Äôs guidance, could appeal to developers and businesses needing efficient solutions. BlockDAG‚Äôs Strategic Advances The strong sales in BlockDAG‚Äôs presale and its forthcoming listings on centralized exchanges represent a pivotal moment for its development. The LAUNCH300 promotional code, offering a triple increase in BDAG units, reflects an assertive plan to grow its user community before these launches. This initiative, paired with Marius Bock‚Äôs leadership, sets BlockDAG to thrive on the rising demand for scalable and efficient blockchain technologies. BlockDAG‚Äôs testnet, unveiled on September 20, showcased its features, including live transaction monitoring, BDAG minting, and smart contract trials. These capabilities affirm BlockDAG‚Äôs potential to stand toe-to-toe with major platforms like Cardano, Solana, and Polygon. New Directions in Blockchain Leadership Marius Bock‚Äôs transition to BlockDAG reshapes the leadership domain in blockchain. It underscores the growing emphasis on scalability and speed as critical drivers of blockchain adoption. While Cardano prioritizes developing a strong, sustainable network, BlockDAG‚Äôs swift expansion strategy and modern structure are setting new industry standards. Both backers and developers are keen to monitor how BlockDAG‚Äôs technology and direction evolve with Bock at the helm. BlockDAG‚Äôs development could either challenge or complement existing platforms, injecting further dynamism into the blockchain sector. BlockDAG‚Äôs Bold Future Marius Bock‚Äôs shift from Cardano to BlockDAG is more than just a job change; it signals a strategic vision for blockchain‚Äôs future. With Bock‚Äôs expertise, BlockDAG is aligning itself as a strong contender, ready to challenge established platforms like Cardano by spearheading advancements in scalability and performance. With its successful presale and ambitious objectives for 2025, BlockDAG is set to significantly influence the blockchain industry in the coming years.

Book of Meme, a Solana-based meme coin, sees a 35% monthly price drop, making investors to flock to Wall Street Pepe for potential gains. Table of Contents Declining trading volume and Open Interest for BOME Traders move into Wall Street Pepe presale WEPE tokenomics Book of Meme (BOME), a Solana-based meme coin created by the artist Darkfarms to serve as a digital archive for memes, has experienced a significant price decline during the last month. Its initial promise of a platform where users could create and add new meme coins seems to have lost some of its appeal. The price drop from $0.00818565 a month ago to $0.0053134, representing a decrease of approximately 35%, has likely dampened trader enthusiasm. According to CoinGecko, BOME‚Äôs price has declined by approximately 10% in the past week, underperforming both the broader cryptocurrency market, which has seen a slight increase of almost 1%, and similar meme coins, which have experienced an average decline of 6% Declining trading volume and Open Interest for BOME Derivative data also paints a picture of declining interest. According to Coinglass, trading volume has plummeted by 45.6%, indicating a significant decrease in trading activity for BOME options. The declining open interest (OI), which represents the total number of outstanding contracts, also indicates that traders are losing interest in BOME futures. Since Dec. 8, when OI reached $172.92 million, it has steadily declined to its current level of $75.20 million, representing a decrease of approximately 56.5%. This significant drop in OI suggests that traders are reducing their exposure to BOME futures, potentially due to a combination of price declines, profit-taking, and a general loss of confidence in the asset. This could be due to a number of factors, such as disappointing price performance, lack of significant news catalysts, or the emergence of more attractive investment opportunities elsewhere. The long/short ratio for accounts, which reveals the proportion of accounts holding long (bullish) positions to those holding short (bearish) positions, shows a bearish bias as well, as per Coinglass data. This suggests that a larger number of accounts are anticipating or betting on a further price decline. Traders move into Wall Street Pepe presale While BOME struggles, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) , a new meme coin on Ethereum that promotes financial empowerment and community growth, has emerged as a potential contender. Unlike typical meme coins, Wall Street Pepe aims to combine entertainment with practical value. Its unique selling point lies in its ability to serve not only as a fun and quirky digital asset but also as a gateway to a thriving trading community. WEPE is more than just a token; it‚Äôs a passport to a new community, wrapped in the viral appeal of a meme. A core focus of the project is to empower smaller investors often overlooked in traditional finance. By fostering transparency and providing accessible trading knowledge, Wall Street Pepe aims to create a platform where everyone can participate. Token holders enjoy exclusive benefits, such as access to in-depth market reports, weekly trading strategies, or alpha tips. The ecosystem also features a rewarding system that incentivizes active participation. Traders who consistently achieve positive results are rewarded with additional WEPE tokens. This community-driven approach has proven to be highly attractive to investors, as evidenced by the successful presale, which has already raised $48.5 million. üö® $WEPE (Wall Street Pepe) Surges Past $47M in Presale On top of that, $WEPE ( @wepetoken ) holders can stake their tokens for passive income, with current yields estimated at 27% per year.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Sun addressed doubts about the stablecoin‚Äôs source of returns, saying, ‚ÄúAll interest will be sent to a transparent address in advance. There is no other reason, it‚Äôs just because we have plenty of money. So stop asking me questions like ‚Äòwhat is the source of the return‚Äô.‚Äù USDD was initially launched in 2022 as a competitor to Terra‚Äôs now-infamous UST stablecoin. Unlike UST, which crashed amid market turmoil, USDD has survived but continues to be heavily backed by Tron‚Äôs native token TRX. USDD is reportedly governed by the Tron DAO, which oversees its collateral and operations.

The stablecoin market, valued at over $215 billion, is expected to more than double by the end of the year, according to analysts. USDD has had its share of critics, including Bluechip, a platform that evaluates stablecoins. Last year, Bluechip gave USDD the lowest stability ranking, citing concerns about its reliance on TRX as a backing asset and the lack of a transparent governance system: ‚ÄúUSDD has no governance system. USDD holders have no legal or code-based protection and are at the mercy of the Tron DAO Reserve.‚Äù The stablecoin‚Äôs website claims that USDD is secured by overcollateralization of mainstream digital assets like TRX and USDT, with a collateralization ratio of 120%. According to the site, USDD is backed by $2.6 billion in assets, the majority of which are TRX tokens. *This is not investment advice.

The State of Oklahoma has officially tossed its hat into the Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury race. According to crypto advocate Dennis Porter, Oklahoma‚Äôs House of Representatives has introduced a ‚Äústrategic BTC Reserve‚Äù bill. Oklahoma becomes the 6th state to introduce ‚ÄòStrategic Bitcoin Reserve‚Äô policy enabling the state to buy Bitcoin once passed into law. That means we are now halfway to our goal of achieving 12 states to introduce SBR bills.

The tally includes Oklahoma, New Hampshire, Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania, and North Dakota. Porter, a key figure in this movement, has noted that only a potential executive order from Trump could establish a national Bitcoin reserve ahead of individual state efforts. Industry leaders, including Anthony Pompliano, have urged President-elect Trump to deliver on his Bitcoin reserve pledge within the first 100 days of his administration. Doing so may catapult the asset to new price highs and reaffirm BTC as a legitimate asset for sovereign reserves. Yet, not all agree on Bitcoin‚Äôs merits as an asset class.

The price movement was driven by speculation that Yuga Labs, which owns the collection, might be selling CryptoPunks‚Äô intellectual property (IP) rights. The False Statements These rumors were apparently started by Wale.moca, a researcher at NFT firm Azuki. They shared in an X post that according to ‚Äúseveral sources close to the matter,‚Äù the buyer had purchased both the IP and over 400 CryptoPunk NFTs from Larva Labs. However, they did not reveal the alleged purchaser‚Äôs identity, only specifying that it wasn‚Äôt a Web2 brand or an existing NFT company like Pudgy Penguins, Azuki, or Doodles. The post further noted that the potential new owners intend to keep the IP unchanged. CoinGecko data shows that once the news broke, CryptoPunks floor price jumped from 34 ETH to a peak of 40.39 ETH within three hours. Trading volume also spiked, with 26 transactions taking place in the last 24 hours, marking a significant uptick in an otherwise slow NFT market. The collection has long been recognized for its historical value and cultural significance within the NFT space. In March 2022, Yuga Labs acquired the project‚Äôs intellectual property from Larva Labs, further strengthening its position in the market. As such, the potential sale of the patent would mark a major development in the industry. Solano Denies Sale Rumours However, Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano has dispelled rumors of any impending sale. In response to an X user asking for confirmation, he simply stated, ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù He later followed up with a more detailed comment , clarifying that while many individuals had approached his company in recent months, there were no immediate plans to take any action. Solano emphasized that the firm would only consider a partnership if it were confident it would offer long-term, substantial value. He also expressed that NFTs are central to his professional and personal life, and he would not pursue any deal driven purely by financial gain, particularly if it would risk damaging the collection‚Äôs legacy. The 34-year-old concluded by highlighting that owning CryptoPunks requires an ‚Äúiron stomach‚Äù and a long-term commitment to safeguarding its intellectual property. In February 2024, the executive returned as CEO of the company succeeding Daniel Alegre. At that time, he outlined plans to revitalize the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) among other reorganization initiatives. Two months later, under his leadership, the company decided to transfer gaming IP rights to Faraway, with the goal of ‚Äúunshackling‚Äù the team. In the same month, he initiated layoffs to realign the firm with its ‚Äúcreative-first‚Äù philosophy.
