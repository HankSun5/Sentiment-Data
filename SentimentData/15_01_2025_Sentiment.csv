This decision comes just 6 days before Gary Gensler, the commission‚Äôs chairman, leaves the agency. Per the filing from the commission, this delay is not a denial as it requires more time to consider the application. The US SEC Notification According to the notice shared by the market regulator, it chose to delay the approval or denial of this filing considering the key factors it has to consider. From the time the asset manager filed the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, the US SEC had an obligation by law to give its consideration within 45 days. The markets regulator filed the decision to delay this proposed rule change three days before the January 17 deadline. Following this delay, the US SEC said it has now fixed March 3, 2025, as the next tentative date to give its decision on the filing. ‚ÄúThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,‚Äù the SEC statement reads, adding that it is designating ‚ÄúMarch 3, 2025, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.‚Äù Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF Approval is Possible It is worth noting that the asset manager applied to list the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund in late November. After successfully operating a spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US, the asset manager chose to expand its supported crypto assets. Bitwise designed the 10 crypto index ETF to provide exposure to the biggest digital currencies by market capitalization. These assets include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Polkadot (DOT), and Uniswap (UNI). While uncertainty clouded approval prospects under outgoing Chairman Gary Gensler, there is reason to remain optimistic now. President-elect Donald Trump nominated Paul Atkins , a crypto-industry-backed candidate, to replace Gensler. With Atkins calling the shots, many industry proponents believe other crypto ETF products are possible. Other Crypto ETFs To Watch Besides the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF, other crypto ETF products like Solana and XRP ETF are also awaiting feedback from the US SEC. Judging by the emergence of Donald Trump, industry optimists believe other crypto ETF products might also be filed soon. In addition to the Solana and XRP funds, asset manager Canary Capital has also pushed for Litecoin and Hedera ETFs.

His comment comes amid the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Garlinghouse‚Äôs remarks highlight the growing frustration in the crypto industry, with many stakeholders demanding clearer regulations. There is a strong call for a shift away from the enforcement-heavy approach defining Gensler‚Äôs tenure. The Clash Between Ripple and the SEC Ripple and the SEC‚Äôs legal dispute traces back to December 2020, when the SEC accused Ripple of offering XRP as an unregistered security. In a landmark 2023 ruling, the court sided with Ripple, asserting that XRP sales to retail investors did not qualify as securities. However, the SEC is appealing this decision, setting the stage for a high-stakes legal showdown. In a recent post on X, Garlinghouse criticized Gensler‚Äôs approach, accusing him of doubling down on a failed strategy. Ripple‚Äôs legal team also expressed disappointment over the SEC‚Äôs refusal to extend the January 15 deadline for its appeal brief. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, slammed the agency‚Äôs decision as a misuse of taxpayer dollars while expressing confidence in Ripple‚Äôs legal position. Gensler‚Äôs Exit Sparks Hope for Clearer Crypto Regulations Gensler‚Äôs departure comes as concerns grow about the SEC‚Äôs tough approach. Many say the agency has been too harsh and lacks clear rules for crypto. In a recent CNBC interview, Gensler argued that all tokens, except Bitcoin, should be treated as securities. This is due to issues with anti-money laundering and other regulations. He said the crypto industry demands stricter oversight. This has left many in the industry hoping for fairer rules under new leadership as Gensler leaves office on January 20. There is a sense of cautious optimism within Ripple and the wider crypto community. Alderoty looks forward to working with new SEC leadership and is hopeful that the regulatory landscape will shift toward clearer guidelines for digital assets. Industry leaders also speculate that Gensler‚Äôs departure could lead to reforms that clarify token classifications and regulations more clearly. The Ripple Effect: Market Reactions and the Future of XRP Meanwhile, Ripple‚Äôs legal victories in the market have fueled optimism, with experts predicting a potential price surge for XRP. Analysts are even forecasting that the token could reach as high as $8 in the near future. The optimism surrounding XRP grows stronger with a massive $265 million transaction. This has sparked speculation about the token‚Äôs future trajectory. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.6, up by 4.60% in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data. As the legal fight goes on, the crypto industry feels more hopeful. JPMorgan analysts expect more interest in digital assets like XRP and Solana (SOL), with new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) coming soon. These changes, along with clearer rules, are boosting confidence in crypto‚Äôs future .

Earlier this month, the IRS was sued by Blockchain Association over the new reporting rule. Table of Contents New tax system IRS abolition IRS vs the crypto community New tax system The H.R. 25 bill, or The Fair Tax Act of 2025 , was introduced by Rep. Earl ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù Carter (R‚ÄìGA). The bill challenges the existing U.S. tax code and the taxation policy status quo and aims to promote freedom, fairness, and economic opportunity. The Fair Tax Act calls to repeal the income, payroll, estate, and gift taxes. Instead, the act proposes enacting the sales tax. The Fair Tax Act: ‚úÖAbolishes the IRS ‚úÖRepeals the Tax Code ‚úÖPuts American in charge of their tax rate ‚úÖForces illegal immigrants to pay taxes & more ‚Äì read hereüëá https://t.co/SjLO4RRaKR ‚Äî Buddy Carter (@RepBuddyCarter) January 10, 2025 According to the bill, the existing Federal income tax retards the economic growth and international competitiveness of the U.S., discourages small businesses and farms, and downgrades the standard of living of Americans, decreasing the savings and investment rates. On top of that, the bill indicates the harm of the existing unnecessary administrative and compliance cost pressure on individual and corporate taxpayers. Privacy violations and lack of transparency in taxation are other problems associated with the Federal income tax. According to the Fair Tax Act, the Social Security, Medicare payroll taxes, and self-employment taxes hurdles employment rates. The alternative proposed in the bill is a broad-based national sales tax on goods and services purchased for final consumption. The act proposes to tax all consumption of goods and services in the U.S. once, preventing double, multiple, and cascading taxation. According to the bill, it will facilitate savings and investment, improve the standard of living of Americans, help businesses, and undo all other evils associated with the actual tax system. Also, the Fair Tax Act provides notes on how the government should foster the change in the policy. IRS abolition One of the most radical changes proposed in the Fair Tax Act is the Internal Revenue Service abolition. The move is meant to get rid of the bureaucratic burdens on individual and business taxpayers. According to Carter, the tax system introduced in the legislation eliminates the need for the IRS. The taxes should be easy and transparent so that people will not need professional assistance to fill out their taxes. The bill is supported by a number of Republican congressmen, including Barry Loudermilk, Eric Burlison, John Carter, Scott Perry, John Rutherford, Warren Davidson, Andy Biggs, Dale Strong, Rich McCormick, Andy Harris, and Andrew Clyde. The latter noted that the act ‚Äúprovides a commonsense solution to eliminate the need for the weaponized IRS, simplify our tax code, and foster economic prosperity‚Äù. Rep. Strong adds that the proposed taxation system will make illegal immigrants pay taxes fairly. IRS vs the crypto community The IRS was sued over the new reporting rules introduced by the service the day the rules were introduced, i.e., on Dec. 28, 2024. The complaint is signed by several organizations, including Blockchain Association, Texas Blockchain Council, and DeFi Education Fund.

According to the new rules, DeFi platforms will be considered brokers. They will have to provide the transaction info and proceeds to the IRS until 2027. The complaint clears that DeFi platforms are not brokers, and that‚Äôs what makes them unique and innovative. As peer-to-peer systems, they don‚Äôt depend on brokers or any other intermediaries, so the IRS‚Äô new rules should not apply to them, but they do. The plaintiffs find the rules unconstitutional and harmful to American development and leadership in the crypto industry. They note that if the rules get into effect, this may impact many leading industry brands to find better jurisdictions instead of working in America. Considering this, the IRS abolition may be seen as a possibility to end the service‚Äôs attacks on the DeFi ecosystems. However, it is not clear yet if the Fair Tax Act of 2025 will be adopted. The history of the act began back in 1999. Will 2025 be a breakthrough year? We‚Äôll see.

Simultaneously, Filecoin‚Äôs price prediction becomes a hot topic, with debates on whether FIL can break past $10 by 2025. On the flip side, Web3Bay , also known as 3BAY, is transforming the traditional e-commerce arena dominated by platforms like Amazon by offering a decentralized solution that provides sellers with no setup fees, instant payouts, and access to a global market. Moreover, Web3Bay‚Äôs crypto presale has amassed over $660K, spotlighting the 3BAY token as a potentially profitable opportunity for early investors, anticipating a significant value increase at its launch. BNB Price Analysis: Crucial Levels and Market Trends BNB‚Äôs price movements are closely watched by traders, who analyze key Fibonacci levels and their impacts on the market. The $709.61 level acts as a possible support area, suggesting reversal points, while the $733.42 level indicates resistance where bullish momentum might slow. Volume increases near these levels show changes in market sentiment, with rising selling pressure as prices near resistance. BNB‚Äôs price movements near the $607.16 support area are critical, as historical interest here might signal either a rebound or a deeper price drop. Can FIL Reach Over $10 by 2025? Filecoin‚Äôs price prediction is increasingly discussed as the digital currency picks up speed, with predictions for potential highs through 2025. If positive trends continue, FIL might near the $10 mark, supported by innovations like the Filecoin Virtual Machine that enhance decentralized app functionality. Yet, obstacles from established providers and scalability issues might slow its growth. Technical analysis suggests FIL‚Äôs price could see a 35% rise to reach the $8.42 retracement level, with its future price also dependent on adoption rates and broader market conditions. Web3Bay Sets New E-commerce Standards‚Äî Early Backers Can Reap 6,430% ROI Web3Bay is reshaping online selling by offering a decentralized e-commerce platform that simplifies operations for entrepreneurs worldwide. Built on blockchain, it removes traditional barriers like setup fees and delayed payouts that burden platforms like Amazon. Sellers gain global reach through a secure, transparent ecosystem powered by the 3BAY token. This platform revolutionizes seller-buyer connections, providing tools that drive growth in an ever-changing digital economy. The 3BAY token ensures quick, affordable, and seamless transactions. Sellers benefit from its liquidity, instant payouts, and cross-chain capabilities, facilitating smooth international operations.

With over $660K raised in the ongoing presale and a current price of $0.0039675, early adopters stand to gain substantial returns. The launch price of $0.1959 represents a staggering 6,430% ROI. As more sellers join Web3Bay, demand for 3BAY is set to surge, offering significant profit potential for early participants. The Bottom Line In the recent market trends, Traders keep a keen eye on BNB‚Äôs price movements, where Fibonacci levels reveal potential market opportunities. Meanwhile, Filecoin‚Äôs price prediction also shows its potential in decentralized storage, anticipated to rise with technological advancements and increased adoption. However, Web3Bay is pioneering a new era in e-commerce. By enabling global sellers through no fees, immediate payouts, and enhanced blockchain functionality, it sets a new standard in decentralized marketplaces . With the ongoing crypto presale and the promising capabilities of the 3BAY token, early engagement could yield substantial investor gains as the market demand escalates.

A whale liquidated 10,070 ETH, resulting in an approximate loss of $1 million. The sell-off transpired as Ethereum‚Äôs price faltered in sustaining momentum, hovering around $3,280 during the transaction. Related Reading: Rebound Alert: US Bitcoin ETF Interest Picks Up Speed In 2025 A Whale‚Äôs Desperate Maneuver The decision to sell a large amount of ETH is notable. This particular whale knows the market well; it took out 24,029 ETH from Binance a few weeks ago, which is worth about $81 million. Even with this new deal, the whale still has 13,959 ETH, which is worth about $45 million. The speed with which this sell-off has been carried out suggests that there may be underlying factors influencing their strategy. Whales are dumping $ETH at a loss! 9 hours ago, 3 wallets(likely belonging to the same whale) sold 10,070 $ETH for 33M $DAI at $3,280, losing $1M. This whale withdrew 24,029 $ETH($81.3m) from #Binance via 10 new wallets 3 weeks ago and currently holds 13,959 $ETH($45.48M).‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/5lqFegRu3i ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 13, 2025 Bringing Down Market Sentiment The crypto market as a whole is unstable, and Ethereum‚Äôs price is following suit. The value of ETH has dropped by 2.50% in the last 24 hours, and it is now worth about $3,177. This drop is the lowest price level in a week and shows why investors are worried about their assets. The mood in the market is changing from excitement to caution as many traders get ready for more price retreats. The Broader Perspective There are other instances of this sell-off. Other prominent players in the Ethereum ecosystem are also unloading their holdings. As part of a systematic transfer strategy, TRON founder Justin Sun recently sent about $320 million in Ethereum to exchanges. These actions suggest that many whales are responding to market conditions by selling their holdings rather than holding onto them in anticipation of potential future gains. Analysts remain somewhat confident in spite of these sell-offs and the overall negative trend. Some predict that Ethereum might hit all-time highs‚Äîpossibly surpassing $10,000 by the middle of 2025‚Äîif market sentiment improves and selling pressure lessens. This optimistic outlook is contingent upon future developments and innovations within the Ethereum ecosystem.

However, analysts are now highlighting an intriguing forecast for the emerging RCO Finance. They believe that RCOF could jump from $0.05 to $1 soon, delivering impressive gains to investors who buy in now. Let‚Äôs examine the factors driving the new altcoin into the spotlight, which has overshadowed the price prospects for XRP and Cardano. Forget Cardano Price And Let RCO Finnace‚Äôs AI Make Profits For You Despite the Cardano price and XRP crossing a key level, RCO Finance (RCOF) appears primed for a significant rally, driven by increasing demand for its unique features designed to improve investors‚Äô trading experience. One of the features is the robo-advisor, an artificial intelligence-based service that distinguishes the platform from traditional decentralized finance platforms. The main advantage of the robo-advisor is thus its ability to analyze data and, given the obtained results, offer the best investment tips. It also offers automatic trading, adjusting investors‚Äô portfolios in real-time according to their risk preferences and financial goals. This allows investors to relax and be confident that their investments are actively managed without constant monitoring. Moreover, investor trust in RCO Finance has been reinforced by a thorough audit from SolidProof, a leading security firm. This audit confirms that the DeFi trading platform meets high-security standards, establishing it as a reliable option for investing in altcoins. With no KYC requirements, traders can engage with the platform without compromising their personal information. This feature protects your identity and simplifies the trading process, making it easier to get started without the usual bureaucratic hurdles.. Cardano Price RSI Signals Overbought Conditions, Analysts Warn The Cardano price has soared to its highest level in seven months, climbing over 40% in the last seven days. This surge is linked to founder Charles Hoskinson‚Äôs comments about potentially supporting U.S. crypto policies if Donald Trump is re-elected in 2025. Currently, the Cardano price is trading around $0.53. However, some analysts warn the market may be overheating, with a potential price drop on the horizon. The RSI for Cardano price is at 78.79 , its highest since December 2023, suggesting it may be overbought. This could lead to selling pressure as investors take profits, driving the Cardano price down and ultimately making RCOF surpass it in the DeFi market. XRP Poised To Hit $0.665 But Lawsuit Might Slows Its Growth Down Analysts still maintain an optimistic tone regarding the XRP price outlook, with some convinced it could pierce through the $0.7655 level. However, there is a significant concern regarding the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. SEC. The SEC has accused Ripple of raising over $1.3 billion without proper registration. An appeal of a 2023 ruling filed last month could delay a final decision and hinder the XRP price momentum. As a result, RCOF may be a more promising option in the current market rally. RCOF Presale Poised To Shatter Market Expectations With Cardano and XRP at a pivotal moment, major investors reportedly hedge their bets with RCO Finance (RCOF) . This trend is evident in the ongoing token presale, which has already raised over $4.5 million. As of November 3, RCOF is in its third presale stage, with a token price of $0.0559 . Those purchasing RCOF could now see up to 900% returns when the token is listed at an anticipated price of between $0.40 and $0.60. Even more compelling, RCOF‚Äôs potential rise to $1 suggests a remarkable 19-fold increase from its current price, surpassing the impressive growth that the Cardano price experienced in 2021. And the exciting part? You can get 50% off the token value using the promo code RCOF50. So, why not join the presale now?

Here‚Äôs What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-recovers-above-key-support-level-heres-what-it-means/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has demonstrated notable resilience by reclaiming its position above the crucial 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.00002082, avoiding a potential breakdown. This recovery is a welcome development for investors as it indicates renewed buying interest and signals the possibility of stabilization in the near term. The 200 EMA is often the dividing line between bullish and bearish trends. A drop below this level could have triggered a deeper downward spiral and marked the onset of a prolonged bear market for SHIB. However, its ability to hold above this critical support level reflects underlying strength in the asset‚Äôs price action. Current Price Action and Key Resistance Levels As of report time, SHIB is trading at $0.00002169, attempting to establish a foothold after testing its support. The asset faces significant resistance at the 26 EMA and 50 EMA, positioned at $0.00002242 and $0.00002271, respectively. Breaking through these resistance levels would be essential for SHIB to reignite its bullish momentum and sustain upward movement. However, if SHIB struggles to breach these resistance zones, it may retrace to the consolidation phase, oscillating between the 200 EMA as support and the 50 EMA as resistance. This sideways movement could act as a period of accumulation, giving the market time to reset before making a decisive move. SHIB/USDT Chart; TradingView Technical Indicators Signal a Neutral Stance The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 45, placing SHIB in a neutral zone. This indicates that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold , suggesting that traders are still weighing the next direction for the token. What Could Influence SHIB‚Äôs Next Move? Several external factors could play a role in SHIB‚Äôs price trajectory in the coming days, these include: Market Sentiment: The overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market remains a driving force. Positive developments in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum could support altcoins like SHIB. Whale Activity: Shiba Inu is no stranger to large transactions by whales. Any notable accumulation by significant holders could signal increased confidence in the token and trigger further buying interest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Network Developments: Continued progress within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as the Shibarium‚Äôs adoption or partnerships that boost utility, could serve as catalysts for price appreciation. Macro Trends: Broader economic factors, including interest rate decisions, inflation data, and regulatory developments, may also influence SHIB‚Äôs movement as part of the larger crypto market. Outlook for SHIB In the short term, SHIB‚Äôs ability to maintain its position above the 200 EMA will be critical for its stability. Investors will closely monitor its attempts to break through the 26 EMA and 50 EMA resistance levels. If SHIB manages to surpass these obstacles, it could pave the way for a retest of higher resistance zones and potentially reignite bullish sentiment. Conversely, failure to move past these levels may result in range-bound trading, offering an opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate at current levels. Ultimately, SHIB‚Äôs trajectory will depend on the interplay between technical indicators, market sentiment, and external developments. Its recovery above the 200 EMA is a positive sign, but sustained momentum will be key to ensuring a more bullish outlook.

Investors are increasingly optimistic about the approval of the first spot Solana (SOL) and spot XRP ETPs, especially with expectations of a more favorable regulatory environment under President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. In a Jan. 13 report shared with Cointelegraph , JPMorgan estimated that SOL and XRP ETPs could surpass the performance of spot Ether (ETH) ETFs within their first six months of trading. ‚ÄúWhen applying these so-called ‚Äòadoption rates‚Äô to SOL and XRP, we see SOL attracting roughly $3 billion‚Äì$6 billion of net assets and XRP gathering $4 billion‚Äì$8 billion in net new assets,‚Äù the report stated. The forecast comes after the first anniversary of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which reached nearly $110 billion in cumulative holdings on Jan. 2. Bitcoin ETFs accounted for around 75% of new investments when Bitcoin reclaimed $50,000 in February, just a month after their debut. However, altcoin ETP adoption remains uncertain due to fluctuating investor demand. While Bitcoin ETFs saw a 6% adoption rate and Ether ETFs achieved 3% in their first six months, interest in altcoins like SOL and XRP is less predictable. ‚ÄúOutside of a few primary tokens (BTC, ETH, SOL), the episodic nature of the crypto market is driven by varying investor sentiment and trendy new coins that may capture incremental attention for a limited time,‚Äù JPMorgan‚Äôs report explained. Several asset managers, including VanEck, Grayscale, and 21Shares, have submitted applications for Solana ETFs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to make preliminary decisions by late January, with Grayscale‚Äôs deadline set for Jan. 23 and others by Jan. 25. Alejo Pinto, founder of Solana Layer-2 network Lumio, commented, ‚ÄúAn ETF approval in the U.S. would have a positive price impact on Solana since the probability is low and therefore not yet priced in.‚Äù",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-14 23:15:00

Experts say the deal represents a ‚Äútectonic shift‚Äù in the domestic traditional finance and crypto sectors. Whereas South Korean crypto exchanges once had to win banks over, tradfi firms are now actively pursuing deals with coin trading platforms, analysts believe. Bithumb‚Äôs Brand-new Banking Deal Bithumb trading volumes over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) The deal has been in the pipelines since at least August last year, when Cryptonews.com reported that Bithumb was preparing to dump its long-term partner NongHyup Bank (NH) in favor of a deal with the latter‚Äôs rival KB . The South Korean newspaper Electronic Times reported that sources familiar with the deal said Bithumb will start migrating its customers from NH to KB ‚Äúon February 24.‚Äù A branch of Kookmin (KB) Bank in South Korea.

Both Bithumb and KB are hoping the deal will help them boost their market presence. The exchange currently has a market share of 20%, but is hoping to gain ground on Upbit as it chases a New York Stock Exchange listing. The media outlet called Bithumb‚Äôs move ‚Äúa strategic decision.‚Äù It pointed out that KB ‚Äúhas a solid base of 20-39 year-old customers. This demographic is key in the South Korean crypto market, where younger citizens remain extremely crypto-keen.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing whether Cardano (ADA), XRP, or the emerging Remittix (RTX) will reach $5 first. Table of Contents Cardano poses for a bullish comeback XRP presents buy opportunity amid fluctuations Remittix set to transform global payments Conclusion Cardano is experiencing recent declines but shows promise for a major comeback. On the other hand XRP‚Äôs technical signs point to possible increases. Meanwhile, Remittix is transforming global payments and establishing itself as a financial industry game-changer. The competition to reach $5 first is intense since every one of these top crypto coins presents special benefits. Cardano poses for a bullish comeback The Cardano price momentarily surged to the $1.14 resistance level before falling towards the $0.92 support. Looking at the larger trend, the Cardano price has declined by over 8% in the past month, indicating a bearish phase for the altcoin. Nonetheless, the general sentiment of the Cardano community is still quite positive, suggesting hope for its near-term move. The 2025 Cardano price forecasts point to a good trading range ‚Äî between $0.95 and $5.10. XRP presents buy opportunity amid fluctuations Showing indecisiveness, the XRP price has been consolidating between $2.60 and $2.20 for the past week. The XRP chart shows that the altcoin is much below its 2018 all-time high (ATH) of $3.8. Nevertheless, market analysts and investors are hopeful about the future of XRP since forecasts point to a possible new ATH by the end of Q1 2025. Technical indicators such as the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages support these forecasts. Considering this, XRP is among the promising altcoins to watch in 2025, providing a mix of long-term growth potential and short-term promise.

By supporting over 30 currencies and offering same-day transfers with no foreign exchange fees, the platform will provide a reliable and affordable solution for both individuals and businesses. Central to this transformation is the RTX token, considered one of the most promising cryptos currently available. With over $2.7 million raised during its presale at $0.0199 per token, RTX is anticipated to experience a dramatic price increase in Q1 2025. As demand for low-cost, fast, and efficient payment solutions continues to grow, early RTX adopters have a unique opportunity to benefit. Conclusion Although Cardano and XRP show great promise for growth, Remittix is positioned to transform the financial sector with its creative approach. RTX has a competitive edge from the rising need for quick, reasonably priced, safe cross-border payments. As investor demand keeps rising amid the limited token supply, analysts anticipate a rally to $5 for RTX in this bull run.

Furthermore, Web3Bay leverages smart contracts to streamline transactions, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs.

Let‚Äôs break down why these meme coins are poised for a wild ride, and how you can position yourself for massive gains. 1. Arctic Pablo: A Journey to Prosperity Arctic Pablo is not just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs a journey wrapped in an adventurous narrative that fuses myth with reality. The coin takes you to the frosty, uncharted territories of Icyopolis, where Arctic Pablo, the daring explorer, embarks on a thrilling journey to uncover hidden treasures in the form of $APC tokens. These tokens are more than just a cryptocurrency; they represent a mystical gateway to potential riches, made all the more enticing by the coin‚Äôs presale structure. Arctic Pablo‚Äôs presale is uniquely divided by locations, with each phase offering a new opportunity for early investors to get in on the action. The coin‚Äôs appeal isn‚Äôt just in the potential for massive ROI; it‚Äôs in the scarcity built into the tokenomics. Every week, the unsold tokens from the presale are burned, reducing supply and driving up value. The Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is currently priced at $0.00002, but it‚Äôs set to increase every week, with the final presale price set at $0.0008 before launching at $0.008. This gives early investors a staggering ROI potential of over 39,900% from the second stage to the launch. It‚Äôs an exciting, deflationary ecosystem that‚Äôs designed for massive growth. Why did this coin make it to this list? Arctic Pablo Coin stands out not just for its presale potential, but also for the unique narrative and token burn mechanisms that can skyrocket its value as demand surges.

Snek: The Slithering Meme Coin Snek has slithered its way into the meme coin spotlight, showing no signs of slowing down. This meme coin draws inspiration from the viral internet culture surrounding serpents and reptiles, capitalizing on a unique, easily recognizable brand that‚Äôs rapidly gaining traction. While its meme status is strong, Snek offers more than just viral potential‚Äîit‚Äôs backed by a growing community that‚Äôs actively participating in staking and token burns. This adds a layer of sustainability that many other meme coins lack. Why did this coin make it to this list? Snek‚Äôs combination of community involvement, staking opportunities, and meme culture gives it the perfect ingredients for success in 2025. If you want a meme coin that balances fun with profitability, Snek deserves a serious look. 3. Fartcoin: A Fart of Fun and Value Fartcoin may sound lighthearted and quirky, but don‚Äôt let its name fool you‚Äîit‚Äôs quickly becoming a serious contender in the meme coin market. With a focus on humor and community, Fartcoin has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts who are looking for something unique and playful. But behind the meme, Fartcoin has a serious plan for growth, using a tokenomics model that includes deflationary mechanics and regular burns to boost scarcity. Why did this coin make it to this list? Fartcoin may be built on a lighthearted concept, but the community and deflationary mechanisms give it real investment potential. With growing user engagement and a solid burn strategy, Fartcoin is an underrated meme coin with the potential to outperform many others in 2025.

From the trusted Ethereum (ETH) to the fast-rising BigBossInu, these digital assets are poised for substantial gains. Investors are locking onto these top picks as they prepare for the market to take off. BigBossInu‚Äôs Presale Ignites: A Powerful Opportunity for Investors Big Boss Inu is the ultimate game-changer in the crypto universe, proving its dominance with six-figure funding in record time and a community that‚Äôs multiplying at lightning speed.

Recent developments include Ripple‚Äôs expansion into Brazil and Dubai, securing key partnerships that could boost XRP‚Äôs long-term prospects. Analysts suggest that if XRP can break past the $2.5 resistance level, it could aim for $3.0, but a drop below $2.0 may lead to a further decline‚Äã. Cardano (ADA) has been trading between $0.87 and $0.92, with signs of oversold conditions that may present an opportunity for a price rebound. But ADA still faces pressure in the short term. Analysts suggest that ADA could push toward $1.50 if market conditions improve. >>> NEAR Protocol has been relatively quiet in recent weeks, but its fundamentals remain strong as it continues to grow its developer ecosystem. NEAR‚Äôs focus on scalability and user-friendly applications has kept it in the spotlight as a promising Layer-1 blockchain, though price action has been subdued amid broader market conditions. Polkadot (DOT) has been struggling to hold above the $6.83 mark, with recent declines pushing it below key support levels. However, DOT‚Äôs long-term potential remains solid due to its unique parachain ecosystem, which continues to attract attention from developers and investors. Conclusion As Bitcoin eyes a potential 700% surge, altcoins like BigBossInu, XRP, Cardano, NEAR Protocol, and Polkadot are positioned for explosive growth. BigBossInu‚Äôs presale, XRP‚Äôs global expansion, Cardano‚Äôs governance, and NEAR and Polkadot‚Äôs ecosystem development highlight their long-term potential.

The AI startup is hoping to use his expertise to advance the development of its artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company is prioritizing its resources on data centers and new energy resources. Ogunlesi earns another board position after joining Blackrock just last year Adebayo Ogunlesi joined Blackrock Inc. last year after they acquired his company, Global Infrastructure Partners, for about $12 billion. After that acquisition, Ogunlesi became worth about $2.3 billion and is currently Blackrock‚Äôs Senior Managing Director and a board member. Before founding Global Infrastructure Partners, Ogunlesi worked for more than twenty years at Credit Suisse, an investment banking company. Not to mention, he holds other board positions at Topgolf Callaway Brands, Kosmos Energy Holdings, and Terminal Investment Ltd. Now, OpenAI wants to use Ogunlesi‚Äôs experience to better itself, inviting him to join its board of directors. OpenAI has been trying to acquire more data centers and energy resources to grow its infrastructure; at this time, calling Ogunlesi might help. On Tuesday, Ogunlesi shared his willingness to work with the AI startup: As part of this, thoughtful strategies and investment in infrastructure will be key to unlocking AI‚Äôs full potential and delivering its benefits responsibly. I‚Äôm excited to contribute to this effort and look forward to being a part of the OpenAI Board. Adebayo Ogunlesi OpenAI began restructuring its board in late 2023, adding two new members in 2024: Instacart CEO Fidji Simo and Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, now known as the Gates Foundation. OpenAI is planning to launch new AI projects in the coming months OpenAI has increasingly invested in new infrastructure projects, asking for funding from the private and public sectors. According to Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation Energy Corporation, CEO Altman wants to build five to seven data centers, each 5GW. Another source claimed that Open AI wants to devote its attention to a single data center before potentially expanding to others. Besides, the AI startup is still planning to host several events in Washington, D.C., and two key swing states to rally support and investments. The company has also planned its ‚Äúeconomic blueprint‚Äù for AI this January, calling on public and private sectors to collaborate in AI developments to ensure the US stays ahead of China. The company is also set to announce new AI projects in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Alabama in the coming months.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With Dogwifhat (WIF) down 45% in 30 days and struggling to break above $2, Flockerz (FLOCK) is gaining investors‚Äô attention. Table of Contents WIF breaking above the $2 mark: Technical analysis Investors turn to this meme coin as WIF trades range-bound Popular dog-themed meme coin Dogwifhat has been navigating a tough period since December 2024, with its price dropping by 45% over the past month. The token has seen a slight rebound of around 4% over the past day, currently trading at $1.55. However, an analysis of its price performance shows that WIF remains in a broader bearish trend that requires considerable buying pressure to reverse. WIF breaking above the $2 mark: Technical analysis The moving averages suggest mixed signals for the WIF token. The 9-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $1.472 is below the current price, offering short-term support, while the 9-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1.493 supports a slightly bullish outlook. These levels indicate a fragile recovery, but the real test lies in WIF‚Äôs ability to push past the critical $2 mark, a psychological and technical barrier. The Bollinger Bands reflect reduced volatility, with the upper band at $1.622 and the lower band at $1.422. This narrow range highlights the importance of breaking through $1.622 to spark a bullish rally. Conversely, a drop below $1.422 could signal the continuation of the downward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering around 35, suggesting oversold conditions that may attract buyers. However, the MACD shows a bearish crossover, indicating weak momentum. A reversal in these indicators will be crucial for WIF to gather the strength needed for a meaningful rally.

One notable option is Flockerz , a transformative meme coin introducing a vote-to-earn system that empowers its community while incentivizing token holding. The project will allow FLOCK holders to cast votes on various proposals, including decisions on its substantial treasury, rewarding them with additional tokens for their participation. The vote-to-earn mechanism creates a positive feedback loop where governance participation earns users more FLOCK tokens, which can then be staked for estimated APYs of 2276%. The project‚Äôs potential is evident in its massive presale success, surpassing $9.9 million in funding and attracting over 35,000 social media followers.

Table of Contents Catzilla: The fierce feline redefining meme coins Worldcoin on the brink of a major breakthrough Ondo eyes resistance level XRP aims for a break above $3 Uniswap‚Äôs awaited surge Conclusion A new presidency brings a wave of excitement and speculation to the cryptocurrency market. With bullish momentum already building, the inauguration could serve as a catalyst for unprecedented growth and opportunities in the dynamic world of crypto. As such, attention is turning to five standout coins that could thrive under this new era. Catzilla: The fierce feline redefining meme coins In the bustling meme coin arena, Catzilla is clawing its way to the top with unmatched ambition and charm. Inspired by the viral success of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe, Catzilla infuses meme culture with a fresh twist ‚Äî a towering, Godzilla-like cat wreaking havoc and capturing imaginations. Drawing from the chaotic energy of Japanese kaiju culture, this coin‚Äôs narrative is a magnet for gamers, anime fans, and crypto enthusiasts. Unlike fleeting meme coins that vanish as quickly as they rise, Catzilla is designed for longevity and impact. With a 14-stage presale starting at $0.0002 and climbing to $0.0016, investors have multiple chances to join the frenzy. Offering a 700% ROI, Catzilla proves it‚Äôs not just about fun ‚Äî it‚Äôs about serious financial potential. Catzilla isn‚Äôt just another meme coin; it‚Äôs a movement. Here‚Äôs why it stands out: Epic gameplay: Dive into a thrilling game inspired by Catzilla‚Äôs larger-than-life narrative while earning rewards.

Interested investors can join the revolution for a fairer, wilder crypto future via Catzilla‚Äôs presale. You might also like: From meme to millions: These 3 coins are breaking records Worldcoin on the brink of a major breakthrough Worldcoin‚Äôs price floats between $1.86 and $2.41. It‚Äôs still below both its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, hinting at a bearish trend. The coin has dipped over the past month and week, losing around 33% and 17% respectively. Despite this, WLD could bounce back soon. If it breaks above $3.08, momentum might push it toward $3.83, suggesting potential gains of over 60% from its lower range. The RSI sits under the midpoint, indicating it might be undervalued. Although past performance shows a downward trend, any positive market move could propel Worldcoin up. Ondo eyes resistance level Ondo is currently trading in the range of $1.10 to $1.40. The price is hovering near its 10-day moving average of $1.20 but is below the 100-day average of $1.23. Indicators show a balanced momentum with RSI at 50.62 and Stochastic at 80.28, suggesting potential growth. If bulls take charge, the first target is the $1.75 resistance, followed by a leap to around $2.16. Passing these levels could mark a price increase of about 45% to 50% from current prices. However, if support at $0.91 fails, it may test lower levels.

With resistance at $2.84, breaking past this level could easily see XRP targeting $3.24. Its RSI is around 61, pointing to potential further gains. Stochastic at 89 also hints at strong momentum. The 10-day SMA near $2.49 aligns well with the 100-day SMA of $2.43, supporting a potential upward continuation. Investors are watching closely, as XRP could leap higher, riding the wave of market optimism and broader crypto bull run expectations. Uniswap‚Äôs awaited surge Uniswap is poised for potential growth amid the altcoin season excitement. Currently priced between $12.14 and $14.38, it shows some resistance but signs of resilience. The nearest hurdle is at $17, but the crypto‚Äôs strong 6-month rise of over 62% shows promise. While the past week and month saw dips of nearly 3% and 20%, there are signals of a comeback. Key indicators like the high Stochastic index suggest possible upward momentum. If Uniswap breaks through $17, it could aim for the $20 mark, indicating a rise of at least 30%. Conclusion While coins like WLD, ONDO, XRP, and UNI show limited short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains and achieve new heights.

However, the cryptocurrency has since rebounded, trading back above $96,000 at the time of writing. This rapid recovery has drawn the attention of market analysts who are examining the underlying trends driving Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. Related Reading: Rebound Alert: US Bitcoin ETF Interest Picks Up Speed In 2025 Is Bitcoin‚Äôs Surge Above $96k A Stop Hunt? A CryptoQuant contributor, Mignolet, shared an analysis highlighting the recent price dynamics. According to the analyst, the recent drop in BTC to $89,000 and the current recovery was triggered by the breaking of a key short-term support level. Mignolet revealed that this pattern, referred to as ‚Äústop hunting,‚Äù occurs when price movements break support levels temporarily before recovering. Despite the recovery, Mignolet emphasizes that a true trend reversal would require stronger involvement from key market participants. Mignolet‚Äôs analysis points to significant selling activity among whale entities, as observed in Coinbase Premium Gap (CPG) data. Typically, buying whales step in to absorb such dips, creating notable market volatility. However, this time, such activity was absent, raising questions about the sustainability of the ongoing rebound. Additionally, Binance‚Äôs market-buy ratio data suggests that large-scale buyers on the exchange have not capitalized on the recent price movement, indicating cautious sentiment among key players. Further evidence disclosed by Mignolet comes from the exchange-traded fund (ETF) daily inflow and outflow data, which is yet to confirm any major shifts in market dynamics. While the daily candle pattern suggests a meaningful move, the lack of participation from whales could limit Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to sustain a long-term reversal. Mignolet also warned that market sentiment might shift too quickly to optimism without clear supporting data. The analyst noted: While the candle pattern signifies a meaningful move, the major players are not capitalizing on the opportunity. What concerns me more is that many people‚Äôs sentiment may quickly shift to a sense of relief too soon. Bitcoin Market Performance After seeing a notable plunge in price yesterday dropping below $90,000 and triggering a total liquidation of over $300 million in the crypto market, Bitcoin is finally seeing a noticeable reversal in its bearish trend. Particularly, over the past day, Bitcoin has increased by 5.6% bringing its price to trade at $96,351, at the time of writing. However, despite this increase, the asset is still roughly a 10.8% decrease away from its peak above $108,000 recorded last month. While Mignolet‚Äôs analysis suggested that Bitcoin bearishness might not be over yet, it is worth noting that the asset‚Äôs current recovery coincides with reduced selling activity from long-term holders. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Hit Its Peak In Summer 2025? Analysts Weigh In In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost revealed that the net position change of long-term holders (LTHs) over the past 30 days remains negative but shows signs of improvement. From a low of -827,000 BTC on December 5, the figure has improved to -246,000 BTC. This reduction in selling pressure suggests that LTHs are less inclined to sell at current price levels as Bitcoin‚Äôs price declines.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address ‚Äì 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI.

The case , titled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Musk , is docketed as 25-cv-00105 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. According to the complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in Washington, DC, the watchdog accuses Musk of intentionally failing to meet the required deadline to disclose his acquisition of more than a 5% stake in Twitter early in 2022, several months before completing his purchase of the social media platform. Alex Spiro, Musk‚Äôs attorney, dismissed the allegations, stating that the regulator‚Äôs action is ‚Äúan admission‚Äù of its inability to present a legitimate case. He claimed Musk ‚Äúhas done nothing wrong‚Äù and characterized the lawsuit as a ‚Äúsham.‚Äù Spiro said in a statement : The SEC‚Äôs multi-year campaign of harassment against Mr. Musk culminates in this filing of a single-count, administrative complaint under Section 13(d) for allegedly failing to submit one form‚Äîa procedural issue that, even if substantiated, would result in a nominal penalty . Alex Spiro The SEC claims Musk delayed disclosure to buy Twitter shares at artificially low prices The SEC‚Äôs investigation into Musk‚Äôs Twitter investment began in 2022 after the regulator sought an explanation for his failure to disclose his growing stake within the mandated timeframe. The regulator says Musk‚Äôs alleged non-compliance with disclosure rules allowed him to ‚Äúunderpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his financial beneficial ownership report was due. By March 2022, Musk had accumulated beneficial ownership of more than 9% of Twitter‚Äôs outstanding common stock. Under federal securities law, he was required to disclose this within 10 days, but the filing was delayed by 11 days. The lawsuit states that once the disclosure was made, Twitter‚Äôs stock price surged 27% the following day. The SEC seeks penalties from Musk amid lawsuits and political ties The SEC asked the court to direct Musk to pay a civil penalty and return profits, which the agency claims he reaped unjustly from his stock purchases. The agency declined to comment beyond the suit. Musk also faces investor litigation accusing him of hiding his acquisition of Twitter shares. Musk, the world‚Äôs richest individual, has recently emerged as one of Donald Trump‚Äôs prominent supporters and advisors. He has joined the president-elect‚Äôs discussions with foreign officials and, alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, is assisting with a government cost-cutting initiative.

While technical signals hint that Aave might be undervalued, market corrections are still a risk. In the web3 ecosystem, platforms like AIOZ Network and Web3Bay are introducing major changes. AIOZ Network is improving streaming by using blockchain and decentralized nodes to deliver content more effectively and at a lower cost. At the same time, Web3Bay (3BAY) is transforming online shopping by using blockchain for transparency and smart contracts to create a safer shopping experience and reduce fraud. The 3BAY token presale has raised over $660,000 so far, with a potential 6,430% return by launch, showing rising interest in how it could reshape the online business. Aave Price Prediction: Signs of a Potential Recovery? Aave price prediction for 2025 points to possible hurdles, suggesting a price range between $155 and $233. Although Aave ended 2024 on a high note due to updates like the V3 protocol and a brief rise above $300, it has since encountered downward trends. Technical indicators, such as a Relative Strength Index of 41 and a Total Value Locked (TVL) ratio of 0.21, suggest Aave could be undervalued. September may be key for a potential peak at $534.91, according to wave count analysis, but a following correction might weaken progress. These findings offer a cautious perspective for those tracking Aave price prediction trends. AIOZ Network Drives Sustainable Solutions in Decentralized Streaming AIOZ Network is reshaping the streaming industry with blockchain-based content delivery. Using a network of ‚ÄúEdge Nodes,‚Äù it provides faster, more reliable streaming while cutting costs and avoiding central servers. Recent improvements include advanced AI tools that adjust content delivery in real-time, reducing buffering and improving viewer experiences. This method not only enhances user satisfaction but also reduces environmental impact by using energy-saving nodes. As people look for affordable and eco-friendly solutions, AIOZ Network stands out in the push for better streaming services. Web3Bay Offers a Safer and Smarter Way to Shop Online Web3Bay is a decentralized shopping platform growing within the web3 ecosystem, changing how buyers and sellers connect. Built on blockchain, it removes middlemen to provide a secure, transparent marketplace. By tackling issues like high fees, fraud, and data theft, Web3Bay creates a safer space for online shopping. Central to this system is the 3BAY token, which powers payments and builds trust among users. A standout feature of Web3Bay is its focus on transparency. Smart contracts handle payments and dispute resolutions automatically, ensuring fairness without third parties. All transactions are stored on an unchangeable blockchain, offering a clear and permanent record. This openness prevents fraud and boosts user confidence. Additionally, Web3Bay‚Äôs decentralized setup spreads data across its network, reducing security risks and offering users peace of mind. The 3BAY token is more than just a way to pay‚Äîit‚Äôs a key part of the web3 ecosystem. In its third presale phase, 3BAY has raised over $660,000, currently priced at $0.0039675. As the presale continues, the price rises with each stage, aiming for a final price of $0.1959. Early buyers stand to gain, with a projected 6,430% return at launch. As Web3Bay grows, the increasing demand for 3BAY tokens highlights its promise to change secure, user-friendly online shopping in the web3 ecosystem. Final Thoughts As the crypto market changes, new projects offer fresh opportunities. Aave price prediction models show chances for growth but also warn about market downturns, making it worth watching. Meanwhile, AIOZ Network is improving streaming with its blockchain-based, eco-friendly system, likely growing as more people seek decentralized content options. Yet, Web3Bay is drawing the most attention as it aims to transform online shopping through blockchain security and transparency in the web3 ecosystem. With its 3BAY token presale raising over $660,000 and an expected 6,430% return for early supporters, 3BAY may become the next big success in crypto .

Anthony Pompliano Proposes Repealing SAB 12 In a recent video on X , Anthony Pompliano‚Äôs first recommendation was to repeal Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). This regulation currently limits banks from holding digital assets, requiring them to classify these holdings as liabilities. Pompliano argues that removing this barrier would allow banks to hold Bitcoin on behalf of their customers. This would foster institutional demand for cryptocurrency. According to Anthony Pompliano, enabling financial institutions to incorporate Bitcoin into their balance sheets could create a more robust ecosystem for the digital asset. This change could also provide U.S. banks with a competitive edge in the growing global cryptocurrency market. It is important to note that Bitwise Chief Investment Officer also shared insights on trends in corporate BTC adoption under Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto policies. He emphasized MicroStrategy‚Äôs aggressive Bitcoin strategy, new FASB rules enabling firms to record price gains, Creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for National Growth Another action proposed by Anthony Pompliano was to establish a national Bitcoin reserve. He highlighted that the U.S. government already possesses approximately 200,000 Bitcoin, which could serve as a foundation for building such a reserve. Anthony Pompliano suggested that increasing the government‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings, rather than liquidating them, would be a prudent move. He emphasized that Bitcoin‚Äôs growing utility as a store of value and hedge against inflation could benefit the economy in the long term. The Bitcoin advocate added, ‚ÄúIf Bitcoin is good for individuals or corporations, it‚Äôs going to be good for the country, too.‚Äù The growing Bitcoin prices and adoption have led to major corporate moves and acceptance. In a recent report, Genius Group approved a $33M rights offering to expand its Bitcoin Treasury to $86M. The offering allows shareholders to purchase shares at $0.50, with CEO Roger Hamilton planning to increase his stake by 10.3%. Tax Code Reforms Under Donald Trump Pompliano also urged Donald Trump to introduce tax reforms that would change how Bitcoin is treated under existing laws. Currently, Bitcoin is classified as property, meaning transactions involving the cryptocurrency are subject to capital gains tax. This classification creates complexities for consumers and businesses seeking to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. Pompliano proposed adjustments to the tax code to eliminate these barriers. Moreover, Anthony Pompliano concluded his recommendations stressing that these measures will propel the United States to the forefront of the digital currency revolution. Meanwhile, other countries like El Salvador have already integrated Bitcoin into their national strategies. This has inspired jurisdictions like Bhutan‚Äôs Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC). GMC plans to hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB in its strategic reserves, focusing on digital assets with large market capitalizations and liquidity.

A prime example is TRON‚Äôs blockchain innovation, which showcases its market strength by driving progress in decentralised applications and offering fast and low-cost transactions. At the same time, the Solana price outlook for 2025 presents a mix of optimism and caution, as analysts assess its growth potential amid market uncertainties. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is changing how global trade works with its borderless marketplace, where Web3 payments are made using its 3BAY token. Currently in presale stage 3 and priced at an accessible $0.0039675, the token‚Äôs growing utility and future potential make it an intriguing opportunity for early backers. TRON Blockchain Innovation Drives Market Gains TRON‚Äôs blockchain innovation seems limitless, backed by strong market performance and continuous advancements. With the ability to process over 2,000 transactions per second at minimal fees, TRON proves its dedication to building efficient and scalable blockchain solutions. As of January 2025, TRX‚Äôs price hovers around $0.2291, supported by a substantial 24-hour trading volume of $672 million and ongoing Tron blockchain innovation. This growth highlights the platform‚Äôs expanding adoption and appeal to developers and users alike. With recent surges in value and ongoing advancements, TRON‚Äôs blockchain innovation is redefining possibilities in decentralised applications and efficient digital transactions. Solana (SOL) Price Outlook: Balancing Bullish Trends & Risks The Solana (SOL) price outlook for 2025 reflects both cautious optimism and market uncertainties. Analysts highlight critical technical levels, with SOL currently trading near $190 and potential support around $165 if the price fails to rise further. Bullish projections suggest a move toward $264 or even $300, driven by positive technical patterns and ecosystem upgrades. However, short-term volatility remains, as whale transactions and regulatory decisions weigh on sentiment. Institutional interest in Solana-based ETFs could also influence future prices. Whether SOL experiences steady growth or fluctuates will largely depend on macroeconomic trends and the pace of network improvements. Web3Bay Smashes Global Trade Barriers with Web3 Payments Web3Bay is redefining how global trade works by removing the usual hurdles of traditional e-commerce. With its decentralised platform, Web3Bay opens up a borderless marketplace where buyers and sellers can interact without worrying about high fees, slow transactions, or banking restrictions. By integrating Web3 payments, the platform enables seamless transactions that transcend geographical limitations, creating a space where everyone can participate equally. The Web3Bay system is designed for accessibility and security. Its cryptocurrency-powered transactions bypass currency exchange issues, making cross-border trade more affordable and efficient. For those in underbanked regions, Web3Bay offers opportunities to engage in global commerce through Web3 payments, ensuring they aren‚Äôt left out of the digital economy. Decentralised storage further enhances the platform, guaranteeing privacy and reliability while maintaining a global presence. The 3BAY token is the driving force behind this ecosystem, and its crypto presale is rapidly gaining momentum. Currently priced at $0.0039675 in presale stage 3, with over $660,000 already raised, the token offers early holders a chance to secure impressive returns. With the token price rising at every stage and a launch price set at $0.1959, early participants from the first presale stage now have the potential to earn an impressive 6,430% ROI‚Äîan opportunity that‚Äôs hard to overlook. As Web3Bay continues to expand, the demand for 3BAY tokens is set to rise, making this a moment of opportunity for those who see the future of borderless trade. The Bottom Line To sum up, the crypto market is showcasing incredible opportunities across leading platforms. TRON‚Äôs blockchain innovation continues to advance decentralised applications with efficient and cost-effective transactions, solidifying its market position. Meanwhile, Solana‚Äôs price outlook for 2025 balances cautious optimism with the promise of long-term growth, driven by technical advancements and institutional interest. However, Web3Bay shines the brightest with its transformative vision for global trade. Powered by Web3 payments using its 3BAY token, the platform continues to break barriers in e-commerce. Currently available at the presale price of just $0.0039675 in stage 3, the 3BAY token offers a rare chance to get in early on a rapidly growing platform, with its utility in Web3 payments paving the way for widespread adoption and significant future value.

From Ethereum (ETH) to the fast-rising BigBossInu, these digital currencies are primed for considerable gains. Investors are focusing on these top picks, expecting them to lead the charge in the upcoming market rally. BigBossInu‚Äôs Hot Presale Unlocks Unprecedented Growth Potential BigBossInu with its record-breaking presale of over $100K raised in hours and a roadmap designed for exponential growth, analysts are calling it a must-have for massive returns. Big Boss Inu stands out with massive APY staking rewards , groundbreaking real-world partnerships, and innovative anti-dump mechanisms, making it a top pick for both short-term gains and long-term potential. If you‚Äôre ready to supercharge your portfolio, Big Boss Inu is the ultimate choice to lead your path to crypto dominance! >>>>>> XRP is seeing strong buying activity from whales, who have accumulated around 470 million XRP tokens. This signals confidence in XRP‚Äôs future, particularly with Ripple expanding its financial services globally, including plans for a stablecoin. XRP is currently trading around $0.60, with analysts expecting it could rise to $1 by the end of October if bullish momentum continues. Solana (SOL) is gaining attention from investors as its price hovers around $191, with key resistance at $190. Solana has been attracting significant interest due to its scalability and speed, making it a top choice for DeFi and NFT platforms. Analysts suggest that a break above $220 could lead to a surge toward $250. Kaspa (KAS) is gaining popularity thanks to its fast transaction speeds, enabled by its unique GHOSTDAG architecture. This allows Kaspa to handle parallel transactions efficiently, making it an attractive option for high-volume traders. Despite some volatility, Kaspa has shown significant growth and is positioning itself for further gains during the next bull run. >>> Polkadot (DOT) remains a key player in the interoperability space, but recent performance has been somewhat lackluster. DOT is currently trading below $7, but with developments in its parachain ecosystem, analysts are optimistic about its long-term potential as the market recovers. Conclusion As Bitcoin whales focus on the next big opportunities, cryptos like BigBossInu, XRP, Solana, Kaspa, and Polkadot are positioned for strong gains. BigBossInu‚Äôs presale success, XRP‚Äôs whale accumulation, and Solana‚Äôs scalability highlight the potential for 50x returns in 2025 .

Ethereum‚Äôs price has surged by more than 26%, climbing past the $3,338 mark and pushing its market capitalization to an impressive $400 billion. Amid Ethereum‚Äôs rise, a new under $1 altcoin is poised to potentially ride on Ethereum‚Äôs coattails to deliver a 9,000% surge. Ethereum Price Projected to Hit $4,000 in a Week Ethereum‚Äôs 26% price surge over the past seven days has left analysts optimistic about its future performance. The ETH price surge can be attributed to several factors, including renewed interest in Ethereum derivatives and a crypto-friendly outlook in the United States following Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory. As Ethereum‚Äôs market capitalization soared beyond $400 billion, so did investor confidence, propelling Ethereum to its current price of around $3,338. This surge reflects the growing demand for Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency in market cap. According to Farside Investors, Ethereum ETFs have also seen a boost, drawing millions of dollars in net inflows. As a result, institutional interest in Ethereum has spiked, contributing to the broader bullish sentiment in the crypto market. Ethereum‚Äôs price continues to rise, presenting a promising outlook for those seeking exposure to the digital asset space. According to ETH price predictions , if it closes above the resistance at $3,668, it is projected to hit the $4,000 mark before the end of this week. RCO Finance Riding on Ethereum‚Äôs Momentum for a Potential 9,000% Surge While Ethereum continues to captivate investors, another altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF), is positioning itself to capitalize on Ethereum‚Äôs bullish run. RCOF is currently in its third presale stage, and its token price has already surged by 337%, from an initial price of $0.01275 to $0.055882. This impressive rise in value shows the potential for further gains as the presale progresses. In the upcoming presale stage, RCOF‚Äôs price is expected to rise to $0.07770, representing a significant potential return for early investors. The final presale stages of RCOF are expected to bring a total surge of over 672.20%, with the price reaching an expected listing price of between $0.4 and $0.6. With such projections, the RCOF token offers investors an exceptional opportunity to multiply their investment exponentially. As the RCOF presale progresses and the native RCO Finance platform gets ready for launch, it‚Äôs clear that the token is on a trajectory to deliver substantial returns to those who get in early. When the platform goes live, and the RCOF token is listed, early investors could see their holdings soar by more than 9,000%‚Äîa rare opportunity for crypto enthusiasts looking to maximize their potential gains. Why RCO Finance (RCOF) Could Outpace Ethereum (ETH) RCO Finance (RCOF) is the native token of RCO Finance, a highly anticipated AI-powered decentralized trading platform designed to democratize access to sophisticated investment strategies. The RCOF token is set to see its value grow exponentially as its native platform grows. The RCO Finance platform integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to create fully automated, personalized investment strategies for its users through its groundbreaking AI-powered Robo Advisor. The Robo Advisor tailors the investment strategies to individual financial goals and risk preferences, making advanced investment strategies accessible to a broader audience. In addition to the AI-powered Robo Advisor, RCO Finance will also offer access to a vast range of assets, including over 120,000 across 12,500 asset classes. This will allow users to diversify their portfolios by investing in traditional assets like stocks and bonds and digital assets like cryptocurrencies. RCO Finance also introduces tokenized real-world assets, allowing users to invest in traditionally illiquid markets like real estate and commodities. As the RCO Finance platform grows, analysts project that RCOF could outpace ETH in terms of price appreciation, especially once it officially launches. Why RCOF Could Be a Better Buy Than ETH Right Now At the moment, RCOF could represent a better investment opportunity than ETH for several reasons. While Ethereum (ETH) has long been a solid investment within the DeFi space, RCO Finance (RCOF) offers unique advantages that could yield higher returns in the short to medium term. RCOF‚Äôs wide range of use cases within the RCO Finance ecosystem makes it a versatile token with strong growth potential. As the platform‚Äôs ecosystem expands, so will the RCOF token‚Äôs value. Moreover, the hype around AI-powered platforms, like RCO Finance, positions RCOF to grow substantially. AI-driven financial tools are becoming increasingly popular, and RCO Finance‚Äôs advanced capabilities set it apart from other platforms. RCOF‚Äôs tokenomics further enhance its appeal. With 50% of tokens allocated for public sale and 12% locked for liquidity, the tokenomics are designed to maintain stability and prevent manipulation. The presale stages have already demonstrated significant price surges, and the listing price is expected to skyrocket to between $0.4 and $0.6, offering potential gains far beyond what Ethereum (ETH) currently offers. Investors looking for an opportunity to multiply their holdings exponentially may find that RCOF offers the best crypto investment available today.

The price plunged over 11%, briefly dipping below the $170 mark before staging an impressive recovery. In just a few hours, SOL managed to reclaim the $182 level, a critical demand zone that has proven to be a key area of interest for investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Forming A 1-Hour Symmetrical Triangle ‚Äì Bullish Breakout Or Deeper Correction? Top analyst Jelle shared a technical price chart highlighting Solana‚Äôs resilience during this turbulent period. According to Jelle, SOL took out its recent lows, successfully retested the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), and ultimately closed the day above all significant key levels. This pattern indicates potential strength in the market and raises the question: what‚Äôs next for Solana? Investors and traders are eyeing the next move as¬†Solana consolidates above its critical demand zone. Will Solana leverage this recovery to push toward new highs, or will bearish pressure take over again? The coming days will be pivotal in determining the trajectory of this market leader. Solana Shows Strength After Weeks of Selling Pressure Solana (SOL) is displaying renewed strength after enduring a 36% decline from its all-time high of $264 in late November to yesterday‚Äôs low of $168. The sharp drop followed weeks of consistent selling pressure, leaving investors uncertain about the immediate future. However, optimism is beginning to return as SOL shows signs of resilience. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Solana‚Äôs impressive recovery in recent price action. According to Jelle, SOL took out its recent lows, retested the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) successfully, and closed the day above all critical levels. This behavior suggests that buyers are stepping in at key support zones, providing a much-needed lifeline to the price. Jelle also points out that reclaiming the $210 mark could set the stage for Solana to challenge its previous highs. While optimism builds following yesterday‚Äôs rebound, caution is warranted as further consolidation or retests of support levels remain possible. The market‚Äôs next phase will largely depend on whether Solana can maintain its newfound momentum. Related Reading: Chainlink Forms A Daily Bullish Pattern ‚Äì Top Analyst Eyes Breakout To $30 As SOL continues to stabilize, investors are keeping a close eye on critical resistance levels, particularly the $210 mark, which could signal the start of a new bullish trend. However, with lingering risks, the coming days will be crucial in determining Solana‚Äôs ability to sustain its recovery and potentially move toward new highs. Price Action: Testing Crucial Levels Solana (SOL) is trading at $186, showing signs of stabilization after a sharp recovery from its recent lows. However, the price has yet to confirm a breakout above the $192 level, a critical resistance zone that bulls need to reclaim to shift market sentiment and potentially change the current trend. A successful reclaim of the $192 mark would signal strength and open the door for further upside. The next significant target for SOL would be breaking above the local high near $223, which could pave the way for a broader bullish trend. Such a move would likely attract renewed investor interest and signal that the market is ready for a sustained rally. On the flip side, failing to reclaim the $192 level could expose Solana to downside risks. In such a scenario, the price may revisit lower demand zones, potentially testing support levels around $170. This would extend the consolidation phase and delay any significant upward momentum.

Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law (TRUMPLAW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPLAW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Crypto Law by entering its contract address ‚Äì 7mYansF38wyaSvnj7C1Gr536FdMbGA4ufqY7PwzC7CxM ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPLAW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-15 02:20:58

Solana Sets Ambitious $600 Target for 2025 Solana‚Äôs reputation as a high-performance blockchain continues to attract developers and enterprises, solidifying its position as a top-tier network.

Lightchain AI‚Äôs roadmap emphasizes sustainability and scalability, making it a forward-thinking platform designed for industries like logistics, finance, and healthcare. A key feature is its commitment to fostering developer-centric programs , which include grants, tools, and resources to accelerate the creation of decentralized applications.

Solana, Ethereum (ETH) and the rapidly climbing BigBossInu are positioned to deliver significant gains. Investors are eyeing these top picks closely, expecting them to lead the market surge. BigBossInu: Disrupting the Crypto Market with Its Hot Presale BigBossInu is leading the charge as one of the top picks for skyrocketing 12,000% returns in 2025. With its lightning-fast presale success‚Äîover $100,000 raised in hours‚Äîand a community-driven ecosystem, Big Boss Inu is more than a meme coin; it‚Äôs a movement. Packed with massive APY staking rewards, bold real-world partnerships, and innovative anti-dump mechanisms, it‚Äôs built for long-term growth and investor confidence. As Solana continues to climb, BigBossInu is carving out its place as a top-tier contender for the next crypto bull run. >>>>>> Solana (SOL) is experiencing strong bullish momentum, currently trading around $192. It has been rising steadily, and analysts suggest that if SOL breaks through the $186 resistance level, it could push towards $210. This is supported by a growing interest in Solana‚Äôs scalability and low transaction fees, positioning it well for further growth‚Äã. Ethereum (ETH) remains a key player in the crypto market, with its price hovering around $3,440. While the market is showing mixed signals, ETH could see a significant boost if it surpasses the $3,700 resistance level, potentially reaching new highs in the next few months‚Äã. Aptos (APT) has been a standout performer recently, rising over 40% in the last month, driven by strategic acquisitions and its expansion into Asia. APT‚Äôs price is currently around $9.16, and its unique MOVE programming language continues to attract interest from developers and enterprises‚Äã. >>> Kaspa (KAS), known for its high-speed blockDAG technology, has faced some volatility recently. After reaching a high of $0.118 earlier this year, it has dropped to around $0.113. Despite this dip, Kaspa‚Äôs innovative technology and scalability make it a project to watch for future growth‚Äã. Conclusion As the crypto market prepares for a major bull run, altcoins like BigBossInu, Solana, Aptos, and Kaspa are capturing attention for their high-growth potential. BigBossInu‚Äôs presale is sparking investor excitement, while Solana‚Äôs scalability, Ethereum‚Äôs market dominance, and Aptos‚Äô strategic expansion into Asia position these cryptos for significant gains. Kaspa‚Äôs innovative technology also holds strong future potential despite recent volatility.

This is a pattern signaling a potential breakout. While traders speculate on Solana‚Äôs next move, the spotlight is shifting to PCHAIN , an AI-powered altcoin making waves in the crypto world. With its innovative approach to real estate investment and blockchain integration, PropiChain is targeting an astronomical 55,409% surge, presenting a golden opportunity for investors seeking transformative returns. Solana Price Analysis: A Symmetrical Triangle Signals a Crucial Breakout The crypto community has been closely monitoring the Solana Price , which is currently trapped in a symmetrical triangle pattern. Renowned analyst Ali Charts recently noted on X that Solana ($SOL) is at a pivotal point, consolidating within this geometric formation. A breakout above $214 or a dip below $183 could trigger a significant 40% price movement. The question on everyone‚Äôs mind is: which direction will Solana take? On one hand, the Solana price performance in 2024 showcased resilience, bouncing back from multiple market corrections and maintaining its position as a top altcoin. On the other, the current volume of transactions shows signs of weakening, leading to speculation about whether the bulls have enough momentum to reclaim dominance. While the Solana Price navigates this crucial moment, investors are beginning to diversify their portfolios into promising altcoins with substantial growth potential like PropiChain (PCHAIN). PropiChain: The AI Altcoin Revolutionizing Real Estate Investment PropiChain is gaining attention as a transformative player in the crypto space, blending the power of AI and blockchain to redefine how real estate is bought, sold, and invested in. This new project is already capturing investor interest with its unique features and practical applications. For instance, PropiChain‚Äôs real estate tokenization digitizes property assets, enabling investors to buy and sell these properties as tokens seamlessly on a blockchain. Another standout feature is fractional ownership, which allows users to own smaller portions of high-value properties. For example, a $1,000 investment could give you a fraction of a $1 million commercial building. This feature makes real estate investment accessible to individuals who previously couldn‚Äôt afford to participate, providing an opportunity for everyone to earn passive income through rental dividends. PropiChain‚Äôs AI analytics provide invaluable insights for investors by predicting market trends, identifying undervalued properties, and optimizing portfolios. So instead of spending hours researching properties, you can rely on PropiChain‚Äôs AI to deliver precise recommendations based on your investment goals. Also, the platform‚Äôs integration with the metaverse opens the door to virtual property exploration. Investors can tour digital replicas of real-world properties, streamlining the decision-making process. As PropiChain grows, analysts believe it has the potential to reach $6 and outperform many top-performing altcoins. PropiChain Presale: The Opportunity for Transformative Gains While the Solana price navigates the uncertainty of its symmetrical triangle, PropiChain is making waves in the crypto world with over $2 million generated so far in its presale. The presale is currently in Stage 2, where the token is priced attractively at $0.011. However, this price won‚Äôt last long; stage 3 is around the corner, with prices set to rise to $0.023. So this very low price offers a golden opportunity for early investors to secure their positions before the broader market catches on. For example, a $1,000 investment at the current price could yield over $500,000 in returns as PropiChain scales up. And with its innovative features and market disruption potential, the token‚Äôs value trajectory looks promising. Compared to the Solana price, which needs to break above $214 to make significant gains, PropiChain‚Äôs growth path is clear. Analysts predict that PropiChain could hit milestones faster. In fact, some suggest PropiChain could reach $2 before Solana Price climbs to $300. Conclusion While the Solana Price remains stuck in its symmetrical triangle, investors face a choice: wait for Solana‚Äôs breakout or seize the opportunity with PropiChain . If you‚Äôre seeking a clear path to significant returns, PropiChain‚Äôs presale offers a chance to get in early and ride the wave of innovation. As Solana navigates its next move, PropiChain is already charting its course towards high returns. The choice is yours; join or miss out.

However, with bankruptcies hitting record highs, pensioners starving, and the government mismanaging funds, it‚Äôs clear Mow is either unaware or willfully ignorant of the fact that slapping a centrally regulated BTC band-aid on things is not going to help. The former Blockstream executive and now CEO of a BTC/nation-state liaison enterprise called JAN3, Samson Mow, has weighed in on what Japan needs to do in order to see economic recovery. The Canadian-born video game developer tweeted on X on January 14 (JST) that ‚ÄúThe Japanese Yen, the third largest currency in the world, is almost back to where it was last summer.‚Äù Samson Mow continued: ‚ÄúAll of the BOJ interventions did nothing.‚Äù Samson Mow went on to emphasize that it is ‚Äúonly a matter of time until they [the Bank of Japan] embrace Bitcoin.‚Äù While the multi-millionaire, laser-eyed maximalist is correct that the yen is in horrible shape, he‚Äôs absolutely out of touch, or ignoring, what‚Äôs happening on the ground in Japan. It‚Äôs a situation no regulated, state-embedded crypto (such as what BTC would be if held in a BoJ reserve) could fix. Samsung Mow‚Äôs X post Wracked by bankruptcy and poverty-line pensions, Japanese struggle under weak yen It‚Äôs just been reported that corporate bankruptcies in Japan are expected to exceed 10,000 in 2024, for the first time in 11 years. This, combined with record restaurant bankruptcies, retailers facing falling profits for the first time in three years, and the pain of ever-escalating inflation, has Japanese scrambling to stay afloat and survive day-to-day life as small and medium-sized enterprises are pushed out of the market. Doctor‚Äôs offices and clinics are also shuttering their doors on the country‚Äôs graying population, who scrape by on pensions that nobody could survive on (around $800 USD a month for some retired folks), for the same reasons. But, according to Samson Mow, all this could be fixed with a little BTC in the hands of the same state that created this mess. At the time of writing, JPY is about 158 yen to the dollar, indeed approaching exchange lows not seen since last summer. But one look could at the state of the Blackrock and Trump-championed asset called BTC, and the state of the Japanese government, says a Bank of Japan bitcoin reserve wouldn‚Äôt help the everyday people living on the archipelago. Chart showing corporate bankruptcies exceeding 10,000 in 2024, the most since 2013. Source: Nikkei/Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Anti-crypto, anti-freedom Japanese government won‚Äôt help For starters, Japan‚Äôs prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, has repeatedly and publicly questioned the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, refusing to consider a lowered 20% tax rate , and aiming to increase defense spending dramatically even as the aging population goes hungry on boiled bean sprouts. If the BoJ adopted a BTC reserve, it would still be in the hands of figureheads like this deciding how to allocate the coins. Second, BTC is not easy to spend for the average Japanese individual. Long wait times, high transaction fees, and beyond-tedious KYC (know-your-customer) requirements at the nation‚Äôs top centralized exchanges means that for most residents ‚Äî and especially the older ones ‚Äî getting into crypto in this fashion is a non-starter. So what is Samson Mow actually talking about? At the end of the day, he is talking about a captured, centralized asset being in the hands of a nation-state that is already taxing residents into literal poverty and homelessness. What is really needed, as always, is permissionless exchange as described by Satoshi Nakamoto, out of the hands of abusive, centralized powers. Thankfully for those in Asia and Japan, it is happening at a grassroots level , for everyday people, via meetups, wallets, trade and commerce with assets like BCH (bitcoin cash), regardless of what Samson Mow may proclaim from his ivory tower.

Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) made headlines with a jaw-dropping 62.11% price surge and a massive 280.78% spike in trading volume. Meanwhile, Snek (SNEK), Cardano‚Äôs most traded token, continues to captivate its community. But all eyes are on BTFD Coin (BTFD), whose innovative referral program and ongoing presale have cemented its place among the best new meme coins for massive return potential . Meme coins have evolved from simple internet jokes to serious investments offering incredible opportunities. BTFD Coin‚Äôs Bulls Squad, referral rewards, and staking options make it a standout choice. Paired with FARTCOIN‚Äôs growth and SNEK‚Äôs cultural dominance, these tokens represent the best of what meme coins have to offer. BTFD Coin: Earn Big with the BTFD Referral Rewards What makes BTFD Coin the ultimate choice for the best new meme coins for massive return potential? Its presale performance and community-driven initiatives are key. With over $5.2 million raised and 64 billion tokens sold, BTFD is attracting attention from crypto enthusiasts and newcomers alike. The referral program is a standout feature. Participants earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens when their referral code is used, provided they rank in the top 20 on the leaderboard by the month‚Äôs end. It‚Äôs a win-win for everyone involved. Investors start by connecting their wallet on the BTFD presale page to generate a unique referral code. This code can be shared with friends and family, giving referrals an extra 10% BTFD on purchases over $50. Referrers, in turn, earn 10% of the purchase value in tokens. BTFD isn‚Äôt stopping there. Its P2E game, launched earlier this month, offers players a chance to earn rewards while enjoying an immersive gaming experience. Combine that with staking rewards of 90% APY, and you have a token designed for both engagement and financial growth. Consider this: An $8,000 investment at the current presale price of $0.000142 will secure 56.34 million tokens. When BTFD lists at $0.0006, those tokens will be worth $33,804‚Äîa substantial return on investment. With its Bulls Squad growing daily and just three presale stages remaining, now is the time to join the action. The referral program ensures that both new and existing investors benefit, making BTFD a top pick for 2025. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN): A Meme Coin on the Rise Fartcoin continues to prove that humor can be highly profitable. Trading at $1.18, the token has surged 62.11% in the past 24 hours, driven by a massive 280.78% increase in trading volume. Its market cap now sits at $1.16 billion, solidifying its place as a top-performing meme coin. Launched on the Solana blockchain in October 2024, FARTCOIN started as a joke but quickly gained traction in the crypto community. It reached an all-time high of $1.60 earlier this month, showing its potential for massive returns. While its 7-day performance shows a slight dip of 5.8%, the token‚Äôs growing volume and market cap indicate that investor interest remains strong. Fartcoin‚Äôs rise underscores the potential of meme coins to deliver substantial financial gains. Snek (SNEK): Cardano‚Äôs Cultural Icon Snek (SNEK) is more than just a token; it‚Äôs a movement within the Cardano ecosystem. Trading at $0.006095, SNEK has seen a 5.28% price increase in the last 24 hours, with trading volume surging 70.46%. As a deflationary memecoin, SNEK represents fun, innovation, and community engagement. It has become the most traded token on Cardano, uniting the ecosystem with its strong cultural presence. Despite a 12.3% dip over the past month, SNEK‚Äôs vibrant community ensures its long-term potential remains intact. Snek plays a critical role in making the crypto space more accessible and engaging, particularly for newcomers. Its consistent trading activity highlights its value as both a meme coin and a unifying force within the Cardano ecosystem. The Final Words Based on our research and market trends, 2025 is shaping up to be a breakout year for meme coins. Fartcoin‚Äôs explosive growth demonstrates the financial power of humor-driven tokens, while Snek‚Äôs cultural significance within Cardano showcases the lasting impact of community engagement. But BTFD Coin shines brightest. With its referral rewards, Bulls Squad, and a presale that‚Äôs raised over $5.2 million, BTFD offers a unique blend of innovation and profitability.

ETH is rising and facing hurdles near the $3,240 zone. Ethereum started a minor recovery wave above the $3,120 zone. The price is trading above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could struggle to start a fresh increase above the $3,240 resistance level. Ethereum Price Aims Higher Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $3,050 level like Bitcoin . ETH was able to clear the $3,080 and $3,120 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. The price even cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,334 swing high to the $2,920 low. However, the bears are active near the $3,220 and $3,240 levels. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading just above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,230 level.

The main resistance is now forming near $3,330. A clear move above the $3,330 resistance might send the price toward the $3,450 resistance. An upside break above the $3,450 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,500 resistance zone or even $3,550 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,240 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,180 level. The first major support sits near the $3,120. A clear move below the $3,120 support might push the price toward the $3,050 support.

However, some analysts remain optimistic that BTC is poised to break out of this range to the upside following what they describe as a ‚Äòfinal capitulation.‚Äô Bitcoin Consolidation Nearing Its End? Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade recently shared their analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs price action on X. According to the analyst, BTC might be approaching a final capitulation before experiencing a significant breakout that could end its prolonged range-bound movement. The analyst commented: The current crypto market sentiment isn‚Äôt great. I‚Äôd actually welcome a downturn in the next couple of days to complete this price action. Bitcoin experienced a final capitulation at the 27th bar during consolidation in January 2024, just before a massive rebound. If history repeats, the final capitulation level will be reached today or tomorrow. After that, BTC will surge with a massive rebound. Related Reading: MARA CEO Advocates ‚ÄúInvest And Forget‚Äù Approach To Bitcoin, Citing Strong Historical Performance To support their prediction, Trader Tardigrade shared a chart comparing Bitcoin‚Äôs current price action with its behavior in January 2024. During that period, BTC consolidated for 53 days, underwent a final capitulation, and then rallied sharply, climbing from around $39,000 to as high as $71,000. Interestingly, Bitcoin‚Äôs current consolidation phase has already lasted over 50 days. If BTC follows its January 2024 pattern, the final capitulation could occur on January 13 or 14. Another crypto analyst, @CryptosBatman, pointed to tightening Bollinger Bands on Bitcoin‚Äôs three-day chart. They highlighted that the Bollinger Bandwidth has reached an extremely oversold level and remarked: Historically, such lows signal a local bottom. Remarkably, the bandwidth is now tighter than when Bitcoin was at $50K, suggesting the bottom might be very close. For the uninitiated, Bollinger Bandwidth is a metric derived from Bollinger Bands that measures the distance between the upper and lower bands relative to the moving average. It is often used to identify periods of low volatility, which can signal potential breakout opportunities. Crypto Analysts Foresee A Positive 2025 While Bitcoin‚Äôs ongoing consolidation phase might frustrate bulls, many analysts remain confident that digital assets will benefit from multiple favorable factors in the coming months.

Similarly, crypto analyst Dave The Wave has forecasted that BTC is likely to hit a peak during summer 2025. At press time, BTC trades at $96,424, up 4.9% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains a dominant force, but altcoins are breaking through with incredible potential. From Ethereum (ETH) to the fast-rising BigBossInu, these digital currencies are set for explosive gains. These top picks are poised to outperform the broader market before the rally hits its peak. BigBossInu: Seize the Future of Crypto with This Presale Opportunity Big Boss Inu stands out as one of the top altcoins that could turn $500 into $500,000 .

Combined with an ambitious roadmap that includes global awareness campaigns and top-tier exchange listings, it‚Äôs a must-have for anyone looking to ride the wave of the next big crypto revolution. >>>>>> Uniswap (UNI) is experiencing a bullish breakout, largely due to the launch of its Layer-2 network, Unichain. This development has positioned Uniswap as a significant player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, with faster and cheaper transactions. Polkadot (DOT) is focusing on expanding its interoperability capabilities across blockchains. Market analysts are optimistic about DOT‚Äôs long-term potential as blockchain interoperability becomes increasingly important‚Äã. >>> Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has seen moderate growth in recent months, with its price hovering around $445.94. BCH remains a strong choice for users looking for lower transaction fees and faster processing times compared to Bitcoin. Litecoin (LTC) is trading at around 101, with consistent performance as a major cryptocurrency for peer-to-peer transactions.

With its value largely influenced by market sentiment, Dogecoin‚Äôs slump is causing concern among investors. Interestingly, one of the top Dogecoin addresses has been linked to a promising new AI altcoin. This innovative project combines AI and blockchain to tokenize real-world assets (RWA), such as real estate. These features, along with the platform‚Äôs numerous benefits, have fueled strong interest in the altcoin‚Äôs token presale, which is nearing the $2M milestone. As a result, experts forecast that this AI altcoin could surge to $2 from a post-listing price of $0.01, echoing Dogecoin‚Äôs meteoric rise in its early days. Dogecoin Struggles Makes Investors Wary Dogecoin (DOGE) initially soared to prominence due to massive community adoption and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Its low price and high volatility attracted early adopters who leveraged social media buzz and celebrity influence to amplify its popularity. However, despite a 1.88% rise in the last 24 hours , Dogecoin has lost approximately 10% over the past week, highlighting its struggles to maintain upward momentum. Coupled with Dogecoin‚Äôs limited utility, the asset volatility has sparked mixed reactions from investors. As concerns grow about a potential prolonged bear market for Dogecoin, a top Dogecoin address has been linked to PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a promising AI altcoin. PropiChain‚Äôs unique value proposition lies in its focus on fractional ownership of real-world assets (RWA), particularly in the lucrative real estate sector, which is less prone to market volatility. Moreover, the project‚Äôs capped token supply of 1.5 billion adds scarcity, driving demand and offering significant growth potential. This blend of scarcity and utility positions early investors to capitalize on market trends and secure substantial returns, making PropiChain a compelling alternative for investors‚Äô portfolios. PropiChain: Transforming Real Estate Investment Via AI Technology Amid Dogecoin‚Äôs ongoing struggles, PropiChain is emerging as a standout contender in the next wave of crypto adoption. This innovative altcoin is addressing critical inefficiencies in the $300-trillion global real estate industry via AI and blockchain technology. Already listed on CoinMarketCap and certified as secure through a comprehensive BlockAudit review, PropiChain has gained credibility among investors. Below are the key features driving its potential price growth after launch: Fractional Ownership for Wider Accessibility PropiChain‚Äôs revolutionary property tokenization system allows users to digitally own, buy, sell, and transfer property fractions. This eliminates traditional legal complexities and reduces barriers to entry. Investors can now acquire fractional real estate ownership, investing as little as $1,000 instead of $200,000 for an entire property. This democratization of wealth-building aligns with the ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi), making PropiChain an ideal AI altcoin. AI-Driven Insights for Smarter Investments PropiChain seamlessly integrates AI to create an intelligent ecosystem for real estate transactions. The platform analyzes vast data sets to provide actionable insights into market trends, property valuations, and economic signals, enabling investors to make informed decisions. Likewise, PropiChain provides investors with 24/7 personalized support through its advanced AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants. These tools guide users at every stage of their real estate investment journey, offering seamless assistance with property selection, market analysis, transaction processes, and other investment needs. Metaverse Integration Through its Metaverse capabilities, PropiChain redefines property exploration. Investors and sellers can participate in virtual property tours, hold virtual meetings, and make informed decisions without the constraints of geographical barriers. This approach introduces a new level of transparency and convenience while enhancing cross-border transactions. Smart Contracts and Unmatched Security Smart contracts form the backbone of PropiChain‚Äôs secure ecosystem, automating critical tasks such as lease agreements. These contracts execute only when specific conditions are met, ensuring tamper-proof transparency and reducing the need for intermediaries. Additionally, transactions are logged on a decentralized Title Contract ledger, minimizing risks of fraud and counterparty disputes while cutting costs and boosting operational efficiency. PCHAIN: AI Altcoin Ready To Explode While Dogecoin‚Äôs price continues to fluctuate with market trends, PropiChain‚Äôs native token, PCHAIN, stands out as a pivotal element of its ecosystem. The AI altcoin offers diverse utilities and significant advantages for early investors. This includes key benefits like property discounts, staking rewards, referral incentives, governance rights, zero-fee transactions, and exclusive community perks. Meanwhile, investors who hold PCHAIN through the final presale stage could see impressive returns of over 800%. This implies a modest $1,000 investment could potentially return about $80,000 or more. Additionally, the token‚Äôs limited supply and extensive utility have driven predictions of a price surge from $0.01 to $2 post-listing. The combination of scarcity and value-driven use cases makes PCHAIN an enticing opportunity for early investors to tap into a high-growth, utility-focused project with vast potential. Tap into PropiChain‚Äôs Unique Investment Opportunity Although Dogecoin retains its status as a cultural phenomenon, savvy investors are increasingly turning their attention to value-driven assets like PropiChain. As its token presale nears the $2M milestone, experts express optimism about its price post-listing. The second presale stage currently offers tokens at $0.011 each, with the third stage projected at $0.023 and a listing price of $0.032. The token‚Äôs limited supply continues to fuel demand, making this presale phase the most accessible and affordable entry point for investors. For those who missed the first phase, now is the perfect time to join PropiChain‚Äôs innovative ecosystem and capitalize on its promising future. Join PropiChain (PCHAIN) now and leverage AI-powered insights for smarter, faster, and more secure real estate transactions.

The price is trading above the important $2.80 level and is now eyeing to break the $3 mark. XRP hit a high of $2.87 and then hit a reverse. Local Uptrend and Support Levels XRP has been in a local uptrend since December 30, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. To maintain the bullish outlook, it‚Äôs crucial for these higher lows to hold. Currently, the market is undergoing a sideways correction, which may signal the completion of the triangle pattern. Wave Structure and Price Action The triangle could be forming an ABCDE structure, with the E-wave possibly having bottomed last week. Typically, triangle breakouts are swift and aggressive, and the price action so far has been a bit more convincing. Analyzing Recent Price Movements The recent dip in XRP price occurred in three waves, which broke micro support but did not invalidate the overall uptrend. This suggests that the price could test support levels again before making a breakout move. As long as critical support levels hold, the bullish outlook remains valid. Critical Price Levels to Watch The key level to watch is $1.96. A break below this would suggest that the triangle pattern has failed and could lead to a decline to around $1.80. Key Support: A drop below $2.32 would indicate that the local uptrend is over. Key Resistance: Upside breakouts above $2.72 and $2.90 would signal the potential for further bullish movement, with the possibility of reaching all-time highs or even $5 in the medium term.

Musk is accused of violating federal securities laws by waiting 11 days to reveal that he had acquired 5% of the company‚Äôs shares. The SEC‚Äôs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accuses Musk of violating Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and related rules. The SEC claims Musk‚Äôs delayed disclosure allowed him to buy over $500 million worth of Twitter shares at artificially low prices. When Musk finally announced his purchases on April 4, 2022, Twitter‚Äôs share price jumped 27%. The lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and return profits he allegedly gained unfairly. Musk went on to purchase Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, later rebranding the company as X. The SEC‚Äôs complaint claims that Musk‚Äôs failure to file a timely beneficial ownership report resulted in investors selling Twitter stock between March 25, 2022, and April 1, 2022, at artificially low prices. This, according to the SEC, caused those investors significant financial losses. Musk has responded to the lawsuit on his platform, X (formerly Twitter), calling the SEC a ‚Äútotally broken organization‚Äù and criticizing the agency for focusing on this issue while other more serious crimes go unpunished.

According to a Jan. 13 report by The Washington Post , Trump is expected to address crypto-related policies immediately after taking office. These include measures targeting crypto de-banking and the repeal of a banking accounting rule that mandates banks holding cryptocurrencies to list them as liabilities. ‚ÄúThe Trump team has made it very clear that this is a priority,‚Äù a source involved in the discussions told the Post . Critics of President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration have alleged that financial regulators were used to pressure banks into severing ties with the crypto industry, a move dubbed ‚ÄúOperation ChokePoint 2.0.‚Äù Additionally, crypto leaders have been pushing back against the controversial SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB 121) issued in March 2022, which introduced the requirement to report crypto as a liability.

Pepe coin price also rose, as one crypto analyst predicted more gains that could see it flip Shiba Inu to become the second-biggest meme coin. Pepe Coin Price Could Surge And Flip Shiba Inu The Pepe price dropped to a low of $0.000015 on Monday as Bitcoin and most altcoins dived amid the soaring US and global bond yields. However, one crypto analyst argues that the coin faces a perfect storm that could push it to a record high and flip Shiba Inu. He pointed to the symmetrical triangle pattern the coin has formed on the weekly chart. Pepe Coin Forecast The analyst also expects the upcoming Ethereum price rebound as a key catalyst for Pepe. Some analysts have predicted that it is just a matter of time before the ETH price jumps and hits the crucial resistance at $5,000. He expects Pepe‚Äôs market cap to get to $50 billion in this bull run. Pepe‚Äôs outperformance has helped to narrow its market cap with Shiba Inu. It now has a market cap of over $7.2 billion compared to SHIB‚Äôs $12.6 billion. If SHIB stayed stagnant, it means that Pepe needs to rise by 75% to cross its valuation. Pepe Price Technical Analysis: Could It Hit ATH? Pepe‚Äôs daily chart is sending mixed signals on the next price action. On the positive side, the coin has retested the important support level at $0.00001716, the upper side of the cup and handle pattern that formed between March and November 2024. A break out and then a retest is usually a good continuation sign. The other positive sign is that the value of Pepe may have formed a triple-bottom pattern whose neckline is at $0.00002826. The coin has failed to drop below that level three times and instead formed two false breakouts, Further, Pepe remains above the 100-day moving average. Therefore, if these positives work, the coin may rebound and retest the 2024 high of $0.00002826, up by 65% above the current level. Pepe Coin Price On the other side, Pepe coin price has formed what looks like a head and shoulders pattern with a neckline is at $0.00001713. A H&S pattern is one of the few bearish chart patterns. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at the psychological point at $0.000010, down by 42% below the current level.

This rebound also happened after Cardano overtook Bitcoin in a key ranking. So, will this be the start of a major ADA bull run that could push it to the psychological point of $1.5? Cardano Price Rises As It Overtakes Bitcoin On A Key Ranking A report by Brand Intimacy has ranked Cardano the number one crypto brand globally. It has flipped popular coins like Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, and Ripple. Its report also ranks Cardano as the 26th corporate brand globally, making it more popular than popular firms like Walmart, Toyota, AMD, Ubisoft, and Home Depot. Cardano Ranking Overtakes Bitcoin The report based its data on key areas like indulgence, fulfillment, ritual, identity, enhancement, and nostalgia. It then uses big data and artificial intelligence to identify a quotient figure, in which case is 52.6 compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 51.9. Still, Bitcoin remains a better-known brand in the crypto industry with a market cap of almost $2 trillion compared to Cardano‚Äôs $34 billion. Also, DeFi Llama says Bitcoin has over 730,000 active addresses compared to Cardano‚Äôs 31,000. Bitcoin also has a total value locked of $6.52 billion compared to Cardano‚Äôs $500 million. Looking ahead, Cardano has numerous catalysts that will push its price higher in the long term. As a popular crypto brand, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely to approve a spot ADA ETF as soon as this year. Further, Cardano‚Äôs Midnight zero knowledge scaling feature will be launched this year. Also, Cardano will integrate with BitcoinOS, unlocking over $1 trillion in liquidity. ADA Price Technical Analysis: Can It Hit $1.5? Technicals suggest that the value of ADA has more upside after Monday‚Äôs drop. It formed a small morning star candlestick pattern, which closely resembles a hammer. This pattern comprises a long lower shadow, a small body, and a small upper shadow and is a popular reversal sign. Cardano has also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern whose head is at $0.7600. Like the morning star, an inverse H&S pattern is a popular bullish sign in the market. ADA also formed a break and retest pattern by falling to $0.8082, its March 2024 high briefly. Therefore, the coin may continue rising in the next few weeks. The two resistance levels it needs to flip to get to $1.15 are $1.1500 and $1.3268, its highest swings on January 7 and December 3. Cardano Price Chart The bullish ADA price forecast will become invalid if it drops below the right shoulder at $0.8800. If that happens, it will risk it dropping to the next key support at $0.7600.

Central to these predictions is the assertion that Ethereum (ETH) may outshine Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of performance, even as Bitcoin continues to hold a dominant position in the market. Expert Predicts A New Crypto Bull Run In 2025 With Bitcoin approaching the significant $100,000 mark once again after a sharp correction over the past weeks and altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the horizon, the expert believes that the current crypto bull run is only just beginning. Related Reading: XRP Price Dominates: Outperforming Bitcoin With Confidence VirtualBacon poses an intriguing question: Is 2025 the year when cryptocurrencies break all previous records? The anticipation surrounding potential market movements is palpable, especially given the bullish sentiment fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price surge and the impending introduction of altcoin ETFs. The expert reflects on the previous year‚Äôs predictions, noting that Bitcoin reached $80,000, crypto gaming gained traction, and Trump‚Äôs return to the political scene significantly boosted market momentum. Looking ahead, VirtualBacon predicts a longer, slower bull cycle extending potentially into the fourth quarter of 2025. This forecast is underpinned by the Federal Reserve‚Äôs cautious approach to liquidity, which is expected to mitigate the risks of sudden market crashes. The likelihood of a recession is projected to drop to 33%, signaling a period of relative stability. Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance is anticipated to rise, largely driven by institutional demand, with spot ETFs already holding approximately 5% of Bitcoin‚Äôs supply. While altcoins may lag initially, VirtualBacon asserts that this ‚Äúslower cycle‚Äù is seen as a ‚Äúblessing,‚Äù providing ample time for growth and maturation within the market. Will Ethereum Outperform Bitcoin This Year? One of the most consequential factors influencing the crypto market in 2025 is anticipated massive liquidity injections. The US debt crisis is likely to compel the Federal Reserve to implement quantitative easing, thereby expanding its balance sheet and flooding markets with cash. Additionally, a revaluation of gold‚Äîpotentially adjusting from $42 per ounce to around $2,000‚Äîcould create even more liquidity in the system. Such conditions typically lead to inflation, which is historically associated with rising asset prices, suggesting that cryptocurrencies may thrive in this environment. However, despite these optimistic predictions, VirtualBacon casts doubt on the likelihood of a US Bitcoin Reserve Act passing in 2025. The proposal for the US Treasury to acquire one million Bitcoin over five years faces significant hurdles, particularly in securing taxpayer support for such a massive expenditure. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Under Pressure: Struggles to Reclaim Lost Ground On the regulatory front, VirtualBacon anticipates that pro-crypto legislation may favor altcoins, particularly through the proposed Fit for the 21st Century Act. This legislation could provide a clearer regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, designating decentralized tokens like Layer-1 blockchains as commodities under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), while less decentralized assets would fall under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, potentially leading the SEC, major cryptocurrencies may flourish, although smaller startups could face challenges navigating the new landscape, according to the expert. The prediction of altcoin ETFs gaining traction is another exciting prospect for 2025. VirtualBacon expects ETFs for cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, HBAR, XRP, and Solana to emerge, driven by their unique statuses and pending legal resolutions. With Ethereum ETFs already drawing institutional interest, a similar pattern could unfold for these altcoins, further accelerating institutional adoption in the crypto market. Perhaps the most captivating prediction is that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin, potentially doubling Bitcoin‚Äôs returns in 2025. With institutional investors increasingly favoring ETH over BTC in recent months, along with historical performance trends favoring Ethereum in the first half of the year, the stage is set for significant growth in the Ethereum ecosystem. VirtualBacon estimates end-of-year prices of approximately $200,000 for Bitcoin and $14,000 for Ethereum, presenting ambitious yet ‚Äúpotentially attainable targets‚Äù given the expected influx of liquidity and institutional support. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $95,840, recording gains of over 4% in the 24-hour time frame. Similarly, ETH is trading at $3,200, recording even higher gains of nearly 6% in the same time frame.

38986168,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=316070,1736916032,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,Three Homomorphic Encryption Trends for 2025,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/01/14/three-homomorphic-encryption-trends-for-2025/,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post As 2025 dawns, FHE (fully homomorphic encryption) is a PET (privacy-enhancing technology) on the cusp of going mainstream. FHE keeps data encrypted during computation so that even if it‚Äôs intercepted, it can‚Äôt be read. Hardware acceleration, venture capital investment and cross-industry standards development organization and consortia all have gathered strong prevailing winds behind FHE, and the next two years will see the first commercial applications. In 2025, I‚Äôm expecting to observe three trends as FHE adoption begins in earnest. 1. Adoption will start on the bleeding edge with AI and blockchain AI requires third-party computation on a massive, unprecedented scale, and that data is vulnerable during every query. Despite all the potential benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), many chief security officers (CSOs) have put off adoption due to the security risk. AI providers need FHE to create an ironclad security solution for enterprise clients. Blockchain is the other industry currently straining at the traces to implement FHE. Blockchain ledgers are public and immutable, which prevents certain desirable activities and makes it difficult for blockchain applications to fully comply with privacy regulations like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). FHE would allow users to process transactions or execute smart contracts while keeping all personal identifiers private, enabling use cases like private DeFi (decentralized finance) or private auctions. Since the 2024 election swept several noted crypto enthusiasts into power in the US, we‚Äôre also in the middle of an undeniable blockchain resurgence. The crypto bull market will fuel a wave of new investment in blockchain technology, accelerating development efforts in an industry that‚Äôs already proven eager to embrace FHE. 2. Law enforcement will warm to widespread encryption Bodies such as the FBI and the IACP (International Association of Chiefs of Police) have warned that encryption allows criminals to ‚Äògo dark,‚Äô making it impossible for law enforcement agencies to obtain digital communications records even with a warrant. Lately, however, the FBI has also found itself promoting the use of encrypted messaging tools in response to ‚ÄòSalt Typhoon,‚Äô a massive telecommunications cyberattack attributed to Chinese actors. Salt Typhoon makes clear that widespread encryption is a matter of national security. Perpetrators were reportedly able to steal communications metadata and even record exchanges involving US government officials ‚Äì and they were empowered by the fact that perimeter-based security cannot scale fast enough to keep pace with the billions of endpoints and attack surfaces inherent to global telecommunications (telcos). The data itself must be encrypted at every stage. The threat extends far beyond telcos. Amazon has reported observing a 750% increase in the number of attacks in 2024 ‚Äì up to nearly one billion hack attempts per day. State and non-state actors work tirelessly to gain access to financial records, personal data, enterprise records and more. Encrypting all of this data would massively exacerbate the issue of ‚Äògoing dark‚Äô ‚Äì but FHE offers some mitigation. Using FHE, regulatory bodies can perform compliance checks and audits without needing to view sensitive data as plain text. Similarly, law enforcement can analyze a dataset for evidence of a suspected crime without exposing the suspect‚Äôs entire private life to scrutiny. FHE could prevent ‚Äòdigital stop and frisk‚Äô without impeding the ability to investigate serious crimes. 3. It‚Äôs going to be a group effort We‚Äôre done with ‚Äòsecurity by obscurity.‚Äô Practical, scalable FHE solutions will emerge not from private Skunk Works but from a foundation of collaboratively developed industry standards. Closed development of security solutions often hides vulnerabilities until after they are widely deployed. Perhaps if Intel‚Äôs SGX had been subject to open design review, its vulnerability to Spectre- and Meltdown-style side-channel attacks would have been exposed before widespread implementation. The same could be said of the AMD Zen Two Zenbleed exploit, or the Rowhammer vulnerabilities across multiple generations of DRAM. Open development and review encourage broader scrutiny, uncovering flaws faster. What‚Äôs more ‚Äì privately developed solutions can be unacceptable to many stakeholders. As a case in point, look at Google‚Äôs efforts to bootstrap new private browsing solutions. In 2019, Google launched the ‚ÄòPrivacy Sandbox‚Äô initiative to replace third-party cookies with privacy-preserving technologies that would still allow targeted advertising. A year later, they announced plans to eliminate the use of third-party cookies in Chrome. Cookie phase-out was supposed to be complete in 2024, but UK antitrust regulators intervened to oppose the change. Why? Google‚Äôs competitors in the targeted ads business worried that the various schemes proposed under Privacy Sandbox would leave them more reliant on Google‚Äôs internal Chrome browser data. This led, in their view, to a serious risk that Google Ads would get preferential access to data. UK regulators agreed , forcing Google to reconsider. Privacy Sandbox continues to work with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to develop more open private browsing alternatives ‚Äì but Google‚Äôs original plan to rapidly phase out third-party cookies has been consigned to the ash heap of history. FHE hardware and software providers and users need to work together to develop standards for hardware/software interoperability, implementation best practices, compute optimization guidelines and more. This work is currently being undertaken by FHE- and PEC-focused consortia and industry associations, with new organizations launching within the last 12 months to focus specifically on removing roadblocks to commercial implementation. Open standards will help the industry build solutions that are more secure, broadly supported and easier to implement and scale. Despite the appetite of industries like AI and blockchain for FHE solutions ‚Äì and the urgency of the risks they face ‚Äì t hese collaborative efforts are still in the early phases. Still, in 2025, I expect things to move fast ‚Äì and as we begin to see real-world benefits in emerging use cases, mainstream compute applications will shortly follow.

The following altcoins have a proven track record with undeniable utility and massive potential for growth. Ethereum, Solana, Shiba Inu, Stellar, and Rollblock (RBLK) deserve a place in any savvy Web3 investor‚Äôs portfolios as these coins have the best chance of supercharging investors‚Äô financial prospects in 2025‚Ä¶ Rollblock (RBLK) Profit-Sharing Casino On Track For Incredible Growth Rollblock ( RBLK ) empowers the Web3 generation with a refreshing emphasis on trust and fairness that has long been missing from the $500 billion online gambling sector. By recording all bets onto the Ethereum blockchain, Rollblock has removed one of the major pain points from this sector, as it has emerged in recent years that a shocking 9% of traditional online gaming platforms have engaged in corrupt manipulation. Rollblock‚Äôs 7,000+ games are all powered by AI technology with provably better odds than competing platforms. A new sports betting league has also contributed to the $1.75 million in wagered bets that was recorded during the month of December. This figure looks set to double in January, as registrations have surged by over 600% in just a month. More than 40,000 investors have stepped up to allocate to the $RBLK presale, raising more than $8.5 million in the process. This has led to Rollblock making consistent new highs in the past few months while the rest of the crypto market has been stagnant. RBLK can be staked for a risk-free yield of up to 30%, thanks to a deflationary buyback and burn scheme. Each week a percentage of the platform‚Äôs profits is used to buy RBLK, which is then burned (60%) and allocated to community staking rewards (40%). Over time, this deflationary feature will strip exchanges of tokens, meaning that the price of RBLK will have no choice but to reprice aggressively to the upside from its current level of $0.045. Ethereum (ETH) Looking Primed To Pump As Burn Rate Increases Ethereum is showing signs of recovering from the recent crypto crash, having gained 1.6% in the last day of trading. This has seen Ethereum reclaim the $3.2k level after bouncing from solid support at $2.9k this week. Ethereum remains the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with a total value of $387.9 billion. Although Ethereum has lost a significant 12% in the last 7 days, Ethereum bulls are still targeting $10k as a reasonable prediction for 2025. This is in part due to Ethereum‚Äôs deflationary supply as the DeFi protocol Uniswap has burned an incredible 786 Ethereum tokens valued at $2.6 million in the past week alone. If this reduction in the circulating supply of Ethereum continues, then selling pressure will be in short supply and the Ethereum price should have no trouble reaching five figures in the months ahead. Solana (SOL) Raking In The Revenue Solana is seen as a potential Ethereum killer with a market cap of $91.2 billion. Solana is currently trading at $188 after having gained 5% in the last 24 hours. Solana transaction fees exceeded Ethereum‚Äôs gas fees this week. Solana managed to take in around $32.2 million in revenue compared to Ethereum‚Äôs $25.5 million. This has been put down to the popularity of decentralized exchanges on the Solana chain such as Raydium and the meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, which continues to dominate transaction volume across DeFi. With huge adoption across so many crypto sectors, Solana could easily reach $1,000 this cycle. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Has A TREAT Up Its Sleeve For Holders Shiba Inu has also had an encouraging bounce recently, gaining 4.1% in the last day of trading to reach $0.0000214. With a market cap now above $12.6 billion, Shiba Inu has regained 16th position in the crypto rankings and remains the second-biggest meme coin in the entire sector behind Dogecoin. The Shiba Inu ecosystem has been expanding as the protocol recently raised $12 million from investors, including Panga Capital and Animoca Brands, to develop the Shiba Inu TREAT layer 2. This reward token incentivizes users to interact on the Shiba Inu chain and is set to list on the Bitget exchange on the 14th of January. Stellar (XLM) Growing As Blend Hits $12M in TVL Stellar investors have been buying the dip, taking advantage of a 6.8% decline in the last 7 days. The Stellar price is currently $0.42, having recovered from its recent crash to $0.31. This can be seen in a startling 24% rise in Stellar 24-hour trading volume that has been detected on-chain. Stellar has a market cap of $12.9 billion and is currently in 14th place in the crypto top 20. The Stellar ecosystem is seeing rapid growth, and recently its first on-chain protocol achieved more than $12 million in TVL. The Blend liquidity protocol recently surpassed its all-time high on December 4th as it integrated with the Stellar wallet Meru. Such encouraging adoption metrics highlight hugely bullish momentum that Stellar has established this year, and new all-time highs above $0.73 look inevitable for Stellar during Q1. These Tokens Will Dominate Crypto This Year These projects will all likely deliver outstanding returns as they have proven themselves to be leaders in their various crypto niches. Ethereum, Solana, Shiba Inu, and Stellar remain attractive buys at current levels, but truly life-changing returns are likely to be found in allocating to the Rollblock (RBLK) pre-sale before it hits the mainstream this year. Massive utility and a growing scarcity factor will ensure that Rollblock smashes its way up the crypto rankings this year to take its place among the giants of the gaming sector. Stage 9 tokens are currently selling out rapidly at $0.045 and are set to rise yet again in the days to come. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

The transaction marks the first direct cryptocurrency purchase by a bank in the country, potentially reshaping its cautious approach to digital assets. Breaking Tradition Rumors of the acquisition first emerged on 4chan after a user shared screenshots of emails attributed to Intesa‚Äôs head of digital asset trading and investment, Niccol√≤ Bardoscia. The messages showed Bardoscia celebrating the accomplishment and commending the collaboration behind the operation, with one email reading, ‚ÄúAs of today, Intesa Sanpaolo owns 11 Bitcoins. Thank you all for your teamwork.‚Äù According to Wired Italia, a bank representative verified the purchase details, acknowledging that the institution obtained 11 BTC for about $1.03 million. The entity is no stranger to crypto, having used the Polygon network to underwrite Italy‚Äôs first on-chain digital bond, worth $25.6 million, in July 2024. Later that year, it started offering options, futures, and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to digital assets via a dedicated desk. Market watchers view its BTC purchase as a defiance of Italy‚Äôs conservative approach towards digital assets, a perspective seemingly personified by the country‚Äôs central bank governor, Fabio Panetta. The 65-year-old economist is reported to have expressed skepticism about the intrinsic value and security of such products, labeling them as speculative and vulnerable to fraud and cybersecurity risks. Institutional Adoption Intesa‚Äôs foray into BTC coincides with a growing trend of institutional interest in cryptocurrencies pioneered by MicroStrategy. On Monday, the U.S.-based software giant bought an additional 2,530 coins for $243 million, bringing its total holdings to 450,000. Similarly, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet recently announced plans to expand its Bitcoin reserves to 10,000 units. Meanwhile, energy storage company KULR Technology Group committed to allocating up to 90% of its surplus cash into the cryptocurrency. The organization started by buying more than 217 coins for $21 million on Boxing Day last year, with its CEO, Michael Mo, highlighting the asset‚Äôs utility as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical instability. Medical equipment manufacturer Semler Scientific has also had a successful Bitcoin treasury strategy. Between December 16, 2024, and January 10, 2025, it acquired 237 BTC for more than $23 million, bringing its entire stash to 2,321 coins worth about $224.4 million at the current price.

The wallet also converted another 16.6199 WBTC for 1.7 million USDT through the Cow Protocol and subsequently transferred 11,917.635 ETH worth about $38.396 million to Coinbase Prime. Trump established the crypto venture in mid-September through a live stream on X, describing it as a ‚Äúdecentralized finance‚Äù initiative centered around a crypto token called WLFI. Trump featured three of his sons in the project, including Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Baron Trump, as the project‚Äôs Web3 ambassadors. However, the details about the project are still hazy and confusing. The news comes after Ethana Labs, an Ethereum-based DeFi platform, announced a strategic partnership with Word Liberty Financial. The collaboration between the synthetic dollar provider and Trump‚Äôs crypto project will integrate Ethena‚Äôs staked synthetic dollar (sUSDe) token into World Liberty Financial‚Äôs Aave instance. The collaboration will allow users to deposit USDe and earn rewards using both World Liberty‚Äôs WLFI token and sUSDe. Ethana announced the alliance on X and emphasized that the proposal aims to increase stablecoin liquidity and utilization rates within the protocol, similar to the effect of sUSDe‚Äôs integration into Aave‚Äôs Core instance. Justin Sun invests $30 million in World Liberty Financial The announcement came shortly after a controversial Chinese crypto entrepreneur, Justin Sun, purchased WLFI tokens worth $30 million, making him the largest single World Liberty Financial token holder then. Less than a week after Sun‚Äôs major financial involvement in the project, World Liberty purchased $500,000 worth of ENA tokens at an average price of $0.98. The venture also purchased Ether, AAVE, ONDO, Chainlink, and cbBTC for about $30 million. The venture sold only 848.63 million WLFI tokens for $12.7 million in its first 24 hours, leaving 19.1 billion tokens up for grabs. Afterward, the venture‚Äôs token sales slowed down. According to the official website of World Liberty Financial, Trump and his family have sold a total of 5.33 billion WLFI tokens at an average price of $0.015 per token. World Liberty Financial website reveals that the venture still has 14.65 billion tokens available for purchase. Crypto investors bet on Trump to transform the crypto after his inauguration Although the project is a massive sign that Blockchain technology is growing rapidly, a few concerns from conflict of interest critics emerged. The launch of a new crypto token raises questions about investors buying into the project to earn influence or Trump pushing on regulators to greenlight his personal businesses, especially now that agencies such as the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have received pro-crypto appointments from the President-elect. Trump has been a strong advocate of crypto and blockchain technology. He took the world by storm last year during his campaigns when he addressed crypto enthusiasts at the Bitcoin Conference 2024 event in a bid to lure crypto investors to vote for him. Trump made promises to the crypto community, making him the best alternative for U.S.-based crypto voters. His victory against Kamala Harris in the presidential elections sparked a wave of optimism as crypto investors began to hope Trump would deliver on his promises, including ending Biden‚Äôs war on crypto and establishing a BTC reserve for the U.S. Treasury.

They awaited a crucial U.S. consumer inflation report that was expected later in the day, keeping investors from making their big moves. According to a Reuters report , the dollar steadied earlier in the Asian session after dropping overnight. Earlier in the week, it had hit a two-year high. However, it soon backed away. This pullback was contributed to by a softer U.S. producer prices report, which eased Treasury yields from their peaks. The euro hovers above its recent two-year low against the greenback Against the dollar, the euro hovered above its recent two-year low and last exchanged for $1.0303 at the time of this writing. On the other hand, the pound fell 0.09% against the greenback to $1.2205. Meanwhile, higher borrowing costs and worries about the UK‚Äôs fiscal health kept applying pressure on the Sterling. Investors are closely eyeing Inflation data in the United Kingdom which will come out later on Wednesday. A weak economy and domestic price pressures catalyze the mounting pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the UK‚Äôs finance minister. Across the other side of the world, the yen‚Äôs exchange rate against the greenback remained relatively unchanged at $157.36 at the time of this publication.

From Ethereum (ETH) to the quickly emerging BigBossInu, these digital assets are on track for impressive returns. Investors are locking onto these top picks, anticipating their breakout before the market fully ignites. BigBossInu‚Äôs Presale Takes Off: A Game-Changer for Crypto Investors BigBossInu is emerging as a standout Ethereum-compatible crypto, perfectly positioned for game-changing 200x growth by next year. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this token combines cutting-edge technology with an ambitious vision, raising over $100K in its presale within hours. With massive APY staking rewards, bold real-world utility partnerships, and an anti-dump mechanism for investor security, Big Boss Inu is designed for explosive and sustainable growth. I >>>>>> Chainlink (LINK) has been gaining traction due to its expanding use in decentralized oracle networks, bridging smart contracts with real-world data. LINK is seeing growing adoption, particularly in DeFi applications, and is trading around $8. This positive momentum could continue if it breaks through key resistance levels. Polkadot (DOT) is focusing on enhancing its cross-chain capabilities, maintaining its relevance in the interoperability space. DOT is currently trading near $7, and analysts are optimistic about its long-term prospects as more projects adopt its parachain model to improve blockchain interoperability. Polygon (MATIC) is seeing increased activity due to its role as a key Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Despite some recent price struggles, trading around $0.89, MATIC is expected to benefit from future network upgrades and growing DeFi activity on its platform. Cardano (ADA) continues to see fluctuations around $0.87 as it consolidates following the Chang hard fork. Investors remain cautious but optimistic, with ADA positioned for potential gains if it can surpass key resistance levels in the coming months. >>> Conclusion As Bitcoin prepares for another potential bull run, altcoins like BigBossInu, Chainlink, Polkadot, and Polygon are emerging as strong contenders for massive growth. BigBossInu‚Äôs presale has generated substantial interest, while Chainlink‚Äôs expanding use in DeFi, Polkadot‚Äôs cross-chain capabilities, and Polygon‚Äôs Ethereum scaling solution highlight their potential.

As we move into 2025, the cryptocurrency market is alive with potential. Stellar has made a strong comeback with a 30% price surge, while Helium is showing resilience in a volatile market. These developments highlight the dynamic possibilities within the blockchain space. Qubetics ($TICS), a Web3 aggregator designed to tackle real-world problems that others have yet to solve. With innovative features like Cross-Border Transactions and a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, Qubetics is creating tools that matter. If you‚Äôre hunting for the top altcoins to invest in today, Qubetics might just be the opportunity you‚Äôve been waiting for. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics ($TICS), the world‚Äôs first Web3 aggregator, is redefining blockchain innovation with groundbreaking solutions like its Cross-Border Transactions. With over 14,400 holders and its presale gaining traction, Qubetics is setting a new standard for the crypto industry. Currently in its 17th presale stage, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0501. Over $9.5 million has been raised, and more than 418 million tokens have been sold. Analysts predict explosive growth, making Qubetics the top altcoin to invest in today for massive ROI. One of Qubetics‚Äô most compelling features is its focus on Cross-Border Transactions. Imagine a small business owner in Europe needing to pay suppliers in Asia. Traditional bank transfers are not only slow but also expensive, thanks to intermediary fees and unfavorable exchange rates. Qubetics simplifies this process, offering a blockchain-based solution that‚Äôs fast, secure, and cost-effective. For freelancers working globally, receiving payments in different currencies can be a logistical nightmare. Qubetics offers a streamlined platform to handle these transactions effortlessly. Even families sending remittances can benefit, avoiding the hefty fees associated with traditional money transfer services. Stellar: A Bullish Comeback Stellar, trading at $0.42 as of January 2025, has experienced a 30% price surge this month. This marks a significant rebound after a month-long downtrend, reigniting investor confidence. While the asset faces challenges to sustain this momentum, the bullish sentiment is hard to ignore. Stellar‚Äôs primary focus is on cross-border payments, making it a direct competitor to traditional banking systems. Think about the ease of transferring money across borders in seconds, with minimal fees‚Äîthat‚Äôs Stellar‚Äôs promise. Its partnerships with financial institutions and enterprises have solidified its role as a leader in this space. However, while Stellar offers stability and proven use cases, it doesn‚Äôt have the groundbreaking innovation of Qubetics‚Äô broader ecosystem. Stellar excels in specific niches, but Qubetics is breaking new ground by integrating a wider range of functionalities under one roof. Helium: Powering IoT Connectivity Helium, trading at $4.84, has shown resilience with a 1.76% price increase over the past 24 hours. Its focus on creating a decentralized network for the Internet of Things (IoT) sets it apart in the blockchain space. Helium‚Äôs unique approach involves incentivizing users to provide network coverage using low-power devices, a concept that has gained traction globally. Imagine a smart city where devices like sensors and meters communicate seamlessly, supported by a decentralized network. Helium makes this vision a reality, offering cost-effective and reliable connectivity solutions for IoT applications. For businesses, this means reduced operational costs and improved efficiency. While Helium‚Äôs niche focus on IoT is impressive, its growth potential is more limited compared to a multifaceted project like Qubetics. Helium solves a specific problem, but it doesn‚Äôt offer the same comprehensive solutions that make Qubetics the top altcoin to invest in today. Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Miss This Opportunity For those seeking the top altcoins to invest in today, Qubetics stands as a top contender. Its groundbreaking features and immense growth potential set it apart in a competitive market. While Stellar and Helium present strong use cases, Qubetics goes further‚Äîoffering a forward-looking vision that‚Äôs already becoming a reality. Timing is everything in crypto, and the Qubetics presale is an opportunity you don‚Äôt want to miss. Dive in, explore the platform, and position yourself for what could be one of the most exciting rides in crypto history. The future of blockchain is here, and Qubetics is leading the charge.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address ‚Äì 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI.

According to a recent report by Franklin Templeton, 70% of AI-powered virtual assistants, known as AI agents, choose to operate on the Solana ( SOL ) blockchain. This preference is largely due to Solana‚Äôs ability to handle large volumes of transactions efficiently and at lower costs. Intersection of AI Agents & the Crypto Ecosystem pic.twitter.com/dr621skRxy ‚Äî Franklin Templeton Digital Assets (@FTDA_US) January 14, 2025 These AI agents are sophisticated tools that carry out tasks, make decisions, and interact with both people and digital systems, transforming how operations are managed within the crypto sector. An interesting example of these AI agents at work is the Truth Terminal project AI chatbot which initially gained fame on Twitter by promoting a fictional religion called the ‚ÄúGoatse Gospel.‚Äù It caught the public eye in July 2024 after receiving a large Bitcoin ( BTC ) donation from Marc Andreessen, a well-known venture capitalist from Andreessen Horowitz. Truth Terminal‚Äôs influence extended further when it actively promoted and boosted the Solana-based meme coin Goatseus Maximus ( GOAT ), which achieved a market cap of nearly $1.22 billion on November 16, 2024. As of Jan. 15, GOAT is trading at $0.338 with a market cap of $338 million.

In the last 24 hours, GRIFFAIN has been up over 19%, AI16Z by over 14%, and ZEREBRO by over 4%, reflecting the strong optimism for these Solana-based AI coins.

However, certain Solana-funded projects have already gained quite some popularity by pushing the total AI token market cap by 14.5% in a day, as per CoinGecko . For instance, Zerebro has released music albums , while Dolos Diary, another AI agent, has amassed millions of views on TikTok . Apart from these AI agent projects, notable growth has also been seen in Virtual Protocol ( VIRTUAL ), an AI agent launchpad on Ethereum (ETH), which reached a market cap of $4.62 billion on January 1, 2025, but declined to $1.92 billion as of this writing. Interestingly, aixbt ( AIXBT ) by Virtuals Protocol, which operates on both the Base and Solana, has been up by 45.2% in the last 24 hours, as per CoinGecko .

The prediction platform typically requires users to place crypto bets on ‚Äòyes‚Äô or ‚Äòno‚Äô answers to a presented question. Just before the November 5 election, the platform saw a significant surge in bets based on who would win the election, suggesting that the election results were a far more exciting topic for the crypto community than the topics it‚Äôs currently presenting. Polymarket‚Äôs trading volume slumps by $2 billion in January from November According to Dune Analytics , prediction platform Polymarket saw $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion in trading volume in October and November, respectively. The surge in trading volume can be attributed to the rise in bets on predicting the outcome of the November 5 US election. November‚Äôs 2024 trading volume was even more than 37,700% higher than the $6.8 million volume in November 2023, hinting at how election results were important to crypto investors. Despite a surge in activity in November, the market has struggled to maintain the same activity level in 2025. Trading volume has dwindled in the first few weeks of 2025 to only $515 million from $1.9 billion in December. Moreover, open interest on Polymarket slumped by 77% between November 6 and January 13. As of January 14, the most trending markets included predictions about how many times Elon Musk would post on X this week, whether New York City would repeal its controversial congestion pricing policy by summer, or if Donald Trump would attempt to purchase Greenland. Polymarket is still struggling with restrictions, user criticism, and market competition As much as Polymarket saw its trading volume rise in November, its popularity did invite regulatory scrutiny. In November, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Shayne Coplan, Polymarket‚Äôs CEO, to determine whether the market continued to comply with the ban imposed on American markets in 2022. Moreover, Singapore restricted access to the prediction platform this January, joining France and Taiwan. Some of the platform‚Äôs users have even voiced concerns over some of the market‚Äôs bets, particularly those centered around LA wildfires. Some have claimed the platform was trying to profit from a national disaster, inviting criticism from concerned crypto investors. Not to mention, the platform still has to fight off top competitor Kalshi after the firm won the court‚Äôs favor in September, allowing American users to bet on its platform.

Bitcoin Realized Price Is Yet To Flip 200-Week MA In a new post on X, analyst James Van Straten has discussed about the Realized Price and 200-week moving average (MA) for Bitcoin. The ‚ÄúRealized Price‚Äù here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition price of the average investor on the BTC network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Under $91,000 As Crypto Inflows See 56% Decline When the spot price of the cryptocurrency is greater than this metric, it means the holders as a whole are in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the indicator suggests the overall market is holding loss. The 200-week MA, the other metric of interest here, is an indicator from technical analysis. An MA is a tool that calculates the average value of a given quantity over a specified time period and as its name implies, moves with time. MAs are useful for studying long-term trends, as they remove all the short-term kinks out of an asset‚Äôs price chart. Certain MAs are considered to carry more significance than the other, with one such period being 200 weeks. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price and 200-week MA over the past several years. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin Realized Price fell under the 200-week MA back during the 2022 bear market. Since then, the metric has remained under the line, but recently, it has been fast approaching a retest. From the chart, it‚Äôs apparent that previous crosses for the indicator above the MA led to full-blown bull runs for the cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúWhen the realized price flips the 200WMA the fun begins,‚Äù notes Van Straten. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Now Capitulating: Bottom Here? Thus, it‚Äôs possible that such a crossover could end up being bullish for Bitcoin in the current cycle as well. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the Realized Price would actually end up surpassing the level in the near future or if a rejection is waiting. On another note, the Realized Price has historically served as the boundary line for the bear market lows in the asset‚Äôs price. As mentioned earlier, the majority of the market enters into a state of loss when BTC falls under the metric. There aren‚Äôt many sellers left looking to take profits in such a market, which is why the asset tends to reach a bottom during it. BTC Price Bitcoin has shown a sharp jump over the past day as its price has recovered to the $96,600 mark after having dropped as low as under $90,000 yesterday.

Meanwhile, the bears try hard to restrict the levels below the 2024 highs at $2.9 but after a small consolidation, the token is believed to secure fresh highs. The newly formed third-largest crypto with over $160 billion market cap surging by over 30% in just a couple of days suggests a huge rise in the trader‚Äôs attention. The question arises whether the Ripple (XRP) price may ever surpass Ethereum (ETH) to become the second largest crypto. It has been over 4 years since the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit and has reached a pivotal point. As per the new report, the agency is required to file its opening brief by January 15. With Gary Gensler stepping down on January 20, incoming pro-crypto SEC Chair Paul Atkins raises hopes for a favourable resolution, though the case‚Äôs complexity tempers expectations. Is a New XRP ATH Coming Soon? Now that the XRP price has flipped the previous resistance and the bullish sentiments surround the token, will the price mark a new ATH this quarter? The historical price action of XRP suggests the XRP price has launched a massive bullish attack. It has been following a pattern, according to which marking a two-digit milestone seems to be inevitable for the rally. Presently, the XRP price is trading nearly the interim highs at $2.9 and the historical pattern suggests the token is due for an upswing of a minimum of 200% in the next few months. The monthly RSI has entered the overbought zone for the first time since the 2018 bull run with a notable rise in the volume. On the other hand, the +Di of DMI has risen above the ADX, suggesting a rise in the rally‚Äôs strength. Therefore, the XRP price is primed for a vertical explosion as it did during the past couple of rallies after a couple of pullbacks. Therefore, the XRP price is expected to surpass $3 anytime from now, which could push the levels towards a new ATH at $3.5, probably during the weekend. This move is expected to attract some bearish activity but after a small consolidation, a bullish continuation seems imminent. The XRP price has been maintaining strong bullish momentum, even amidst the market retracement. Moreover, with the positive sentiments mounting ahead of the speculation of approval of a spot XRP ETF , liquidity in billions is expected to enter the platform. Besides, XRP is moving forward with a robust technology as a solution in international payments and remittances. With the optimism surrounding the inauguration of the new government in the U.S., cryptos like XRP are expected to gain new highs soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President with significant contributions and a grand ‚ÄúInaugural Crypto Ball‚Äù in Washington, DC. Scheduled for January 17, this black-tie event celebrates Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto policies and signals a revolutionary change toward digital currencies in U.S. policy. Major Backing for the ‚ÄúCrypto Ball‚Äù Event The Crypto Ball event is being hosted by BTC Inc. and co-hosted by Stand With Crypto, Exodus, Anchorage Digital, and Kraken. The event has garnered strong backing from major players like Coinbase, MicroStrategy, and Galaxy Digital. Prominent blockchain companies such as Sui, Mysten Labs, Solana, and Uniswap Labs are also key sponsors, showcasing the growing influence of crypto in mainstream politics. Tickets for the event have seen overwhelming demand, with Gold tickets sold out at $2,500 each. Remaining options include $5,000 Black tickets and exclusive VIP packages priced at $100,000 or $1 million, offering unique perks like a private dinner with Trump. While Trump is not expected to attend, his appointed AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks , will host the ball. Trump To Form Crypto Advisory Council Reports suggest that Trump is forming a Crypto Advisory Council of up to 22 blockchain leaders to guide federal policies. On his first day in office, Trump is expected to issue executive orders promoting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These orders may include overturning restrictive SEC policies and allowing banks to hold custody of digital assets. Impact OF Crypto Ball Event On BTC Price As the event nears, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has shown positive movement, recovering from $89K to $97K as of January 15. Analysts believe the combined impact of Trump‚Äôs inauguration and the Crypto Ball could push BTC past $100K, potentially reaching new all-time highs.

Amid this development, XRP price is also up by 11.52% with bulls now eyeing a breakout past $3.

Ripple and CEO Brad Garlinghouse filed a request to seal eight exhibits submitted as part of their motion for summary judgment in the ongoing XRP lawsuit. All Eyes on SEC‚Äôs Opening Brief Last year in 2023, the court announced that Ripple needs to pay $125 million in settlement charges to the US SEC, much lower than the $2 billion demanded by the securities regulator. The securities regulator will file a brief by the January 15 deadline while appealing the court ruling in XRP Lawsuit. Investors have been accumulating XRP, driving its token price higher as anticipation builds ahead of the SEC‚Äôs appeals brief. The brief‚Äôs filing deadline is seen as a potential near-term catalyst for XRP‚Äôs price movement. commenting on today‚Äôs XRP move, lawyer Bill Morgan stated that the market is already reacting positively to SEC‚Äôs opening brief.

The daily trading volumes have also surged by 12% to over $11.5 billion showing strong support for the bullish momentum to continue. As per the Coinglass data , the XRP open interest has surged by 21% while the 24-hour liquidations have surged to $14 million of which $10 million is in short liquidations. The XRP price hits fresh highs on the monthly chart, amid strong accumulation by whales holding anywhere between 1 million to 10 million XRP. These large-scale investors have increased their holdings by over 37% in the past two months, adding approximately $3.8 billion worth of XRP since November 12, 2024. This trend underscores robust market confidence and heightened demand for the Ripple cryptocurrency. Source: Santiment On the other hand, XRP Ledger is seeing strong demand due to its potential applications in banking and financial transactions. The demand is likely to surge following the expected settlement of the XRP lawsuit during the Trump administration. Furthermore, banking giant JPMorgan hinted at the possibility of an XRP ETF approval this year in 2025, while expecting nearly $8 billion in inflows during the first year of approval.

Remittix Set For 3,000% Gains By July!",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-vs-shiba-inu-which-one-will-prevail-in-2025-remittix-set-for-3000-gains-by-july/,"Crypto market has been losing steam in recent weeks without spearing the meme tokens. In the past week, Dogecoin is down by 16.8% following a 21% loss in the past one month. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is also down by 15% and 28% in the same period. Based on available data, analysts are currently analyzing the two tokens, projecting which would prevail in 2025. Same analysts have eyes set on Remittix , a token they predict will surge by 3,000% by July. Dogecoin‚Äôs Recovery or More Bearish Signals? Dogecoin is the largest memecoin by market cap, currently standing at $47.1 billion, dominating more than 50% of the meme coin market, and still maintaining its strong influence despite the ongoing decline..Over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin has dropped by 3.89% and is currently holding at $0.32. Data from TradingView shows that the Dogecoin‚Äôs price is retracing, reaching $0.3262, creating its fifth consecutive bearish candle. This persistent downtrodden highlights strong selling pressure. Also, the prevailing bearish trend shows the exponential moving average lines have given bearish crossovers and attained a negative alignment. Meanwhile, looking at the Fibonacci pattern, the Dogecoin trend suggests a potential double-bottom reversal from the 23.60% level. So, if this reversal plays out, it could initiate a bullish recovery, rechallenging the $0.40 mark. However, a bearish closing under the 23.60% Fibonacci level will put the $0.30 psychological zone at risk, potentially dropping to $0.265 support level. Could SHIB Recover From Its Downward Trend? Looking at the Shiba Inu‚Äôs price trend, there is not much difference in their prices patterns in recent weeks. Shiba Inu is currently down by 6.9% and 15.6% in the past day and week, currently trading at 0.00002011. With a market cap of $11.8 billion, it ranks as the 15th-largest cryptocurrency. With its price cheaper than Dogecoin, holders could accumulate more Shib than the former. While this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that Shiba Inu will outperform Dogecoin, it does make the token more appealing to some investors. Additionally, Shiba Inu has a lower market cap compared to Dogecoin, potentially giving investors more return if both coins should have a similar percentage increase. Looking at Shib on the 1-day chart, the altcoin seems to be consolidating in a short-term range between $0.0000211 and $0.0000246. However, this formation doesn‚Äôt indicate clear bullish momentum on the higher time frames. Additionally, Shiba Inu‚Äôs trading volume has dipped in recent weeks, suggesting that market traders are waiting for a strong bullish trend to emerge. From the current market sentiment and trading volume, a push towards the $0.00002312 level and audacious highs at $0.00002464 seems more likely. However, the reduced trading and the still broader crypto market, especially Bitcoin‚Äôs suggest Shib‚Äôs price will follow the broader cryptocurrency market trends Is Remittix Gearing For a 3,000% Surge? Before looking at the price analysis of RTX, a closer look at the use cases of the Remittix would explain the sentiment surrounding the token. For years, cross-border payments have been a challenge for users due to hidden costs, slow transaction times, and bloated systems. However, Remittix enters the PayFi space and pairs fiat banking with cryptocurrency to offer a frictionless, low-cost payment option. Addressing challenges of excessive delays and inflated costs, Remittix‚Äôs foundation is modern blockchain technology to enable instantaneous global transfers. By integrating cryptocurrency wallets with fiat bank accounts, Remittix eliminates middlemen and hidden charges, allowing users to send and receive money across borders with same-day processing and zero foreign currency fees. Additionally, With support for over 40 currencies, Remittix provides exceptional value for individuals and businesses needing quick, reliable payment solutions.

Remittix‚Äôs unique selling point is its commitment to user confidence. As such, the platform and RTX token has been audited by leading security firms. Additionally, liquidity is locked for three years to guarantee stability. With the presale underway and tokens selling rapidly, Remittix is poised to set a new standard. The RTX token is currently priced at $0.0207 in its ongoing presale and has already raised over $2.8 million in weeks. Analysts predict strong growth by July, potentially surging above 3,000% mark, a move that will see its price rise above $0.6169. This positions RTX as a top investment.

With $9.7 million raised within a few months, Flockerz has captured the attention of investors with its unique blend of meme culture and real utility. Currently priced at $0.0066883 per token, $FLOCK offers early investors an opportunity to join a project that is setting new benchmarks in the meme coin sector. As the clock ticks down, Flockerz is poised for a strong debut in the rapidly growing meme coin market. Redefining Meme Coins With Flocktopia‚Äôs Vote-to-Earn DAO What sets Flockerz apart from typical meme coins is its groundbreaking decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Flocktopia. Designed to put power into the hands of its community, Flocktopia allows $FLOCK holders to vote on important decisions that shape the project‚Äôs future, such as partnerships, development initiatives, and token burns. https://twitter.com/FlockerzToken/status/1831330384770207825 Unlike traditional DAOs, Flocktopia introduces a Vote-to-Earn model, where participants are rewarded with $FLOCK tokens for their votes. This system not only encourages active participation but also ensures that the community‚Äôs interests are aligned with the project‚Äôs long-term success. By incentivizing decentralized governance, Flocktopia addresses a key issue in the crypto space: centralization. Many meme coins are controlled by small, centralized teams, which can lead to decisions that don‚Äôt benefit the broader community. Flocktopia‚Äôs model ensures fairness, transparency, and inclusivity, making it a standout feature in the crowded meme coin market. High-Yield Staking: Passive Income for $FLOCK Holders In addition to its innovative governance model, Flockerz offers investors a chance to grow their holdings through its staking mechanism. Currently, $FLOCK holders can stake their tokens to earn an impressive 280% annual percentage yield (APY). With over 642 million tokens already staked, this program reflects strong investor confidence in Flockerz‚Äôs vision. Staking during the presale comes with dual benefits. Not only do investors compound their holdings before the token is listed on exchanges, but they also stand to gain from potential price increases after the launch. This mechanism creates a steady demand for $FLOCK while reducing the circulating supply, contributing to price stability. Flockerz has allocated 25% of its total token supply to staking rewards, ensuring that loyal investors continue to benefit as the ecosystem grows. However, as more tokens are staked, the APY will decrease, making early staking even more advantageous. Analyst Confidence in Flockerz‚Äôs Potential Flockerz‚Äôs unique approach has caught the attention of crypto analysts and influencers. ClayBro, a prominent YouTuber with over 135K subscribers, talked about how $FLOCK is collecting more than $100K daily through the ongoing presale. The YouTuber emphasized that the high staking rewards and Vote-to-Earn ecosystem will play a role in making Flockerz a top long-term investment opportunity. Flockerz Token Will Be Launching Soon! Bull Market Gains Ahead, But Only If We Participate! The success of Flockerz comes at a time when the meme coin market is experiencing a significant revival. In 2024, the market‚Äôs valuation skyrocketed from $20 billion to over $120 billion ‚Äì a staggering 500% increase. Furthermore, retail investors are diversifying into new presales ‚Äì with the likes of Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) collecting nearly $50 million in just a couple of months. With the momentum firmly in favor of meme coins, Flockerz is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this trend and deliver substantial returns to its investors. Final Opportunity to Join the $FLOCK Presale With just seven days remaining, this is the last chance for investors to secure $FLOCK tokens at presale prices. The token is available for purchase through the Flockerz website or the Best Wallet app , which features $FLOCK in its ‚ÄúUpcoming Tokens‚Äù section. The presale offers a unique opportunity to invest in a project that combines the fun and creativity of meme culture with real-world utility. As Flockerz prepares for its exchange debut, early adopters who stake their tokens now could see compounded rewards and significant returns in the future. Flockerz isn‚Äôt just riding the wave of meme coin popularity ‚Äì it‚Äôs setting new standards for the space. By merging decentralized governance, high-yield staking, and community engagement, Flockerz offers a comprehensive ecosystem that goes beyond hype. As the meme coin market continues to grow, Flockerz‚Äôs innovative features and strong community backing make it a standout contender for exponential growth. Flockerz has quickly built a vibrant and engaged community, with over 30,000 followers on X , and 5,800 Telegram members. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned investor or new to crypto, Flockerz presents a compelling opportunity to be part of a project that is shaping the future of meme coins. The project has also undergone rigorous audits by Coinsult and Solid Proof , ensuring a high level of security and transparency for its users.

CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us), a crypto news and analysis platform on X, highlighted these movements in a recent post, referencing a chart by Washigorira. The chart reveals that XRP experienced a death cross in December 2024, signaling bearish momentum. Another death cross appeared on XRP‚Äôs chart in early January 2025, marking the digital asset‚Äôs first significant bearish indicator of the new year. However, subsequent market movements invalidated these bearish signals. A golden cross, where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average, has now formed, often regarded as a strong bullish signal. Additionally, XRP has broken through a descending trendline, further supporting a potential upward trend. On Saturday, January 11, the digital asset experienced a notable surge, breaking above $2.6. It currently trades at $2.83, up 4.3% from last week. In the post, CryptosRus stated that XRP is ‚Äúgearing up for some big moves,‚Äù implying that these combined indicators could lead to significant price gains.

Get ready, XRP is gearing up for some big moves Chart: Washigorira pic.twitter.com/AYuxACZL10 ‚Äî CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) January 12, 2025 Potential Target for XRP The chart shows an intriguing target that could help XRP achieve a feat the community eagerly anticipated. The Fibonacci extension on the chart sets an ambitious target of $4.32 for XRP, representing a new all-time high for the digital asset. This level is also above the $4 level, which many analysts see as a crucial resistance level. In late 2023, one analyst predicted that a surge to $4 would come out of nowhere , and with this golden cross formation, XRP could experience a notable rally in no time. Can XRP Reach This Target? The golden cross comes as market participants are closely monitoring XRP‚Äôs price movements. With Donald Trump set to take office in under a week, the XRP army is excited about the future of digital assets. There are many promising developments, like the upcoming resignation of Gary Gensler , the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who has waged a war on crypto for years. Ripple, XRP, and the broader crypto market are about to be set free to grow and change the global financial landscape, and 2025 could be a game-changing year for XRP.

The complaint was filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., and alleges that Musk violated disclosure laws while amassing a large stake in the social media company. Elon Musk Faces US SEC Lawsuit for Securities Fraud In the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit , Elon Musk is accused of acquiring more than 5% of Twitter stock in March 2022. According to the federal regulations, shareholders are expected to report their holdings once they cross this threshold within ten days. The SEC alleges that Musk failed to disclose this information for 11 days and during this time he was purchasing shares at a lower price to avoid public knowledge. According to the SEC, Musk‚Äôs delayed disclosure let him purchase shares from unsuspecting investors and allegedly saved him more than $150 million. On 4th of April, 2022, Musk made public his investment in Twitter and claimed to have more than 9% of Twitter‚Äôs stocks. In the same week, Twitter made an announcement that it would be joining the exchange and its stock price increased by more than 27%. Legal Team Denies Allegations The attorney representing Elon Musk, Alex Spiro, said that the SEC complaint is a ‚Äòsham‚Äô and that the SEC is harassing Musk. Spiro said that the case was rooted in a bureaucratic matter and pointed out that ‚Äúeven if it is proven this alleged failure to submit a form has a very limited consequence.‚Äù Musk and the SEC have been in a tense relationship for the past few years with several investigations and legal battles. The billionaire has earlier on complained to the agency saying that it has been after him. Last month, Musk told X that the SEC had tried to convince him to pay a fine in the case but when he refused the regulator decided to pursue charges. Moreover, the agency has been called out severally for regulation by enforcement with recent lawsuit against Ripple moving forward as both parties submitted a stipulation while agreeing to file a deferred appendix. US SEC Seeks Financial Penalties In the lawsuit, the SEC wants the court to order Musk to give up any purported profits from the non-disclosure and also pay civil penalties. The agency is also asking for a jury trial in the case to decide whether or not Musk has violated securities laws. The lawsuit is the latest in a string of legal battles that Elon Musk has had to deal with since acquiring Twitter in a $44bn deal in October 2022. The acquisition was signed after a long period of negotiations and public confrontation between the parties, including Musk‚Äôs attempts to withdraw from the deal due to the presence of bots on the platform. This follows another lawsuit by the SEC regarding Musk‚Äôs acquisition of Twitter Inc. The Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System had sued Musk in 2022 for allegedly defrauding investors and untimely revelation of his plan to acquire the company. According to the pension fund, Musk‚Äôs actions impacted other shareholders‚Äô choices and harmed them financially through the lawsuit he filed. That lawsuit, Rasella v. Musk, was filed in a federal court in New York and the case is ongoing. The SEC‚Äôs lawsuit also comes at a time when there are changes in the leadership at the agency. Outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has been under pressure from business leaders, including Ripple CEO Brad, said that he will step down at the end of his term, which is on 20th January, after President-elect Donald Trump swearing in. Trump has vowed to cut down on the regulatory mechanisms that may influence the SEC in the future.

On its first day, the developers distributed 100 billion DOG tokens to over 75,000 owners of Runestone Ordinal NFTs. This strategy skyrocketed DOG‚Äôs value and established it as a significant token within the Runes system.

The decision follows the termination of a deal for Bitwise Asset Management to acquire OBTC‚Äôs assets. In a statement on January 14 , Osprey revealed plans to file a Form S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ‚Äúas soon as practicable.‚Äù Osprey CEO Optimistic About Filing for Bitcoin ETF Conversion Osprey‚Äôs CEO Greg King expressed optimism about filing the form by the end of January. ‚ÄúWe are committed to getting our investors into a Bitcoin ETF. This seems like the surest path at this point,‚Äù King stated. OBTC, launched in February 2021, was initially positioned as a competitor to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The fund tracks Bitcoin‚Äôs price without directly holding the cryptocurrency and currently manages $181 million in assets. While OBTC has seen a 151% price increase over the past year, it remains below its $50 all-time high reached at launch. Part 2 $OBTC https://t.co/rCgBotZO06 https://t.co/Nl69tyZen9 ‚Äî Greg King, CFA (@GregoryDKing) January 14, 2025 The decision to pursue an ETF conversion follows the collapse of a proposed acquisition by Bitwise. The deal, announced in August 2024, allowed for termination after December 31, 2024, if regulatory approvals were not secured. Osprey‚Äôs announcement comes amid growing momentum in the ETF market, with the SEC recently approving Bitcoin and Ether ETFs from Hashdex and Franklin Templeton. Currently, 32 Bitcoin ETFs trade in the U.S., though only 11 are spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to VettaFi. Osprey‚Äôs OBTC closed its last trading session with a 3% increase, reaching $29.84. The firm, however, has faced challenges in the highly competitive crypto asset market. In January 2023, Osprey filed a lawsuit against Grayscale, alleging misleading advertising and anti-competitive practices that allowed Grayscale to dominate the Bitcoin OTC trust market. This lawsuit remains unresolved. Osprey also explored options to sell or liquidate OBTC in March 2024, citing the fund‚Äôs units trading at a discount to Bitcoin‚Äôs value. Despite these hurdles, the firm appears determined to position OBTC as a spot Bitcoin ETF, a move aimed at capitalizing on the growing demand for regulated Bitcoin investment products. US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Over $35B in Inflows in 2024 As reported, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States recorded a remarkable $35.66 billion in net inflows in 2024, significantly exceeding early industry projections. BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) led the market with $37.31 billion in inflows, followed by Fidelity‚Äôs Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $11.84 billion, and ARK‚Äôs 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) with $2.49 billion. Other significant contributors included the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which reported $2.19 billion in inflows. These figures far surpassed Galaxy Digital‚Äôs initial $14 billion first-year estimate. However, Bitcoin ETFs faced a slight downturn toward the year‚Äôs end, with $1.33 billion in outflows since Dec. 19. On the Ether ETF front, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) led inflows with $3.52 billion and $1.56 billion, respectively. Grayscale‚Äôs low-fee Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) secured $608.1 million in inflows, while the Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) crossed $400 million.

Recently, Bitcoin touched the $100K mark for the first time, driven by the appointment of Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, as SEC Chair under the Trump administration. This move marks a significant regulatory shift towards fostering innovation in the digital asset market in the US. As the bull run market continues, the Crypto Market Sentiment Index climbed to 63, which reflects the growing optimism of investors. Popular altcoins like XRP and Solana closely follow the growth trajectory of Bitcoin, surging 5.8% and 7.3%, respectively. Naturally, investors looking to diversify their portfolios and ride the crypto wave are exploring the hottest crypto presales in January 2025 . With the market poised for further evolution, here are the top 5 presales you should be looking at. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) ‚Äì Overall Best Crypto Presale in January 2025 Having raised over $48M during its ongoing presale, Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) continues to dominate the list of most sought-after crypto assets in 2025. Interestingly, it blends entertainment and innovation. $WEPE stands out as it aims to break the dominance of whales (or institutional investors) and empower small-scale traders like you and me. As a $WEPE holder, you‚Äôll gain access to expert market strategies and alpha trading calls. Plus, you‚Äôll also benefit from tools previously available only to Wall Street pros. One $WEPE is currently available at $0.00036647, with the price set to increase in the next four hours. So, interested investors shouldn‚Äôt delay their purchase any more. If this is your first time buying a presale, check out our how to buy $WEPE guide for all the info. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Layer-2 Solution Promises to Revolutionize Solana Solaxy ($SOLX) has been built on the Solana blockchain and focuses on low-cost transactions at ultra-high speeds. This makes it ideal for gaming, DeFi applications, and decentralized projects. Most importantly, it aims to remove all inadequacies of Layer-1 chains. Its multi-chain compatibility and staking rewards appeal to both analysts and investors alike. Capitalizing on Solana‚Äôs growing dominance in the crypto market, $SOLX‚Äôs price is likely to soar in 2025, with experts suggesting it could be the next 100x token. Currently in presale, $SOLX has already crossed the $10M mark, and each token is presently available at $0.0016. 3. Flockerz ($FLOCK) ‚Äì Unique V2E Mechanism & Rewarding Staking APY As a pioneering Vote-to-Earn project, Flockerz ($FLOCK) has gained significant traction. Investors can shape the future of this project by voting on key decisions, for which they earn rewards. This innovative project has already raised over $10M during its presale, and you can get in now for just $0.0066883 per token. Analysts expect $FLOCK‚Äôs post-listing value to rise significantly, as the project features a robust NFT-based ecosystem that allows users to mint, trade, and collect unique digital birds. Token holders can also engage in a gaming metaverse, which delivers an intuitive experience. What‚Äôs more, a 274% APY staking reward and robust security audits ( SOLIDProof and Coinsult ) add to Flockerz‚Äôs appeal. 4. iDEGEN ($iDEGEN) ‚Äì One of the Best AI Meme Coins iDEGEN ($iDEGEN) is an AI meme coin that aims to revolutionize the crypto market. It‚Äôs powered by an autonomous, sentient AI that interacts dynamically on X , responding to every mention and learning from inputs provided by users. This kind of interactivity creates a unique and community-driven ecosystem where users can influence the AI‚Äôs behavior. Since its presale began, $iDEGEN has raised over $16M, recording a staggering 23,446% price increment since its launch. This coin is quickly gaining traction and is an exciting choice for investors. While some investors tag this coin a bit risky, that‚Äôs the element that can fetch you impressive returns. The high-risk/high-reward potential of iDEGEN makes it a bold pick among analysts in 2025. 5. Race to a Billion ($RACE) ‚Äì Predict Virtual Race Outcomes and Win Tokens Race to a Billion ($RACE) is another new coin that redefines gaming with blockchain, making it more meaningful and rewarding for players. Token holders can predict virtual race outcomes between meme-inspired characters. $RACE tokens act as digital assets, which makes them different from traditional gaming currency. Therefore, as an investor, you hold real value recorded by blockchains that can grow over time. Staking incentivizes community participation, which creates a stable foundation for growth through smart contracts. $RACE brings you a practical way to explore blockchain gaming while building long-term value. Having raised over $227K during its ongoing presale, it‚Äôs admittedly slower than the other presales, but there‚Äôs a lot of potential. Each token is currently price at just $0.00829. Verdict ‚Äì Fast BUT Furious Having shown you the top crypto presales on the market right now, it‚Äôs important we mention that investments are subject to market risks. This is especially true in the crypto space, which is wrought with volatility. So, you must do your own research and only invest an amount you‚Äôre comfortable losing.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-15 07:12:25

For instance, in September 2024, the bank suddenly stopped trading its Nucoin token, saying it wanted to protect users from market volatility. The bank launched Nucoin in late 2022 on the Polygon network as part of a rewards program offering perks like discounts.

According to a Bloomberg report published on Jan. 15, the Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission might allow Bitcoin ETFs to list on local exchanges for the first time as the country attempts to keep up with other countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and the U.S. in terms of developing its cryptocurrency sector. As of Nov. 30, 2024, data from the Thailand SEC shows that there are at least 270,000 active crypto trading accounts. The number of active accounts in November more than doubled compared to that of the previous month, which only reached 117,000. Acknowledging the importance of the crypto sector in Thailand moving forward, Secretary-General Pornanong Budsaratragoon said the SEC will consider letting individuals and corporations invest directly in local Bitcoin ETFs. ‚ÄúLike it or not, we have to move along with more adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide. We have to adapt and ensure that our investors have more options in crypto assets with proper protection,‚Äù said Pornanong. Thailand is not the only one. Leaders of major banks in Japan have also been pushing for its regulators to allow crypto-backed ETFs, specifically Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs . Other countries in the Asia-Pacific region like Hong Kong and Australia, have approved their own spot crypto ETFs .

As previously reported by crypto.news, the Thailand Crime Suppression Division is in the process of obtaining arrest warrants for those involved. Back in June 2024, Thailand‚Äôs One Asset Management had already launched a fund-of-funds that offers investors exposure to Bitcoin ETFs linked to companies overseas. However, Thailand has yet to allow local ETFs to invest directly in Bitcoin, the current largest cryptocurrency by market cap. In addition, the Thai SEC is also considering allowing local companies to issue stablecoins backed by their own bonds in order to expand access to corporate debt markets and minimize costs, according to Pornanong. Last December, Thailand‚Äôs former prime minister and crypto advocate Thaksin Shinawatra proposed a pilot project to develop Bitcoin payment in Phuket. Deputy Prime Minister Pichai Chunhavajira confirmed that the pilot project will mainly focus on tourists, making it easier for them to do digital payments in the region.

A recent report on Wednesday revealed Thailand‚Äôs plans to adopt Bitcoin ETFs, permitting local exchanges to list the exchange-traded funds. Thailand Prepares for Bitcoin ETF Debut The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to approve its first Bitcoin ETF, aligning with the country‚Äôs crypto hub vision, Bloomberg reported on January 15. SEC Secretary-General Pornanong Budsaratragoon posited that the move would allow individual and institutional investors to invest in the Bitcoin vehicles directly. Promoting the use of cryptocurrencies, Thailand is paving the way for the worldwide adoption of digital assets. During an interview on Tuesday, Pornanong stated, Like it or not, we have to move along with more adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide. We have to adapt and ensure that our investors have more options in crypto assets with proper protection. Although, One Asset Management in Thailand has introduced a fund-of-fund tracking international Bitcoin ETFs, a direct investment tool remains pending approval. The ONE Bitcoin ETF Fund of Funds Unhedged and not for Retail Investors (ONE-BTCETFOF-UI) and was approved by the Thai SEC last year. Thailand‚Äôs Thaksin To Legalize Crypto The latest development came on the heels of Pheu Thai Party leader Thaksin Shinawatra‚Äôs efforts to legalize crypto. Citing the incoming US President Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly approach, Thaksin suggested Thailand embrace a more progressive stance on virtual assets. He also proposed the increased issuance and use of stablecoins. Digital-asset trading activity in Thailand is picking up amid a wider rally that pushed Bitcoin to a record high of $108,315. Crypto hedge funds had a great last year but failed to give more returns than Bitcoin (BTC), as per Bloomberg Thailand‚Äôs Broader Crypto Vision and Regulations Thailand has long been striving to solidify its position at the forefront of the global crypto market. In a recent development, the country announced its crypto payment pilot project, with the trial set in Phuket. While the initiative is expected to be executed within Thailand‚Äôs existing legal framework, it bolsters the nation‚Äôs crypto vision.

The investment management firm said in a Jan. 14 statement that it would file a Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ‚Äúas soon as practicable‚Äù to convert the Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OBTC) into an ETF. Launched in February 2021, OBTC offers investors exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct investment, such as managing wallets or keys. The fund carries a management fee of 0.49%, making it one of the lowest-cost solutions of its kind. As of January 7, 2025, OBTC managed approximately $186.7 million in assets, with each share representing about 0.000326 Bitcoin. The decision to convert OBTC into an ETF comes after the termination of a proposed asset purchase agreement with Bitwise. Announced in August 2024, the deal aimed to transfer OBTC‚Äôs assets to Bitwise‚Äôs portfolio, providing unitholders with exposure to Bitcoin through Bitwise Bitcoin shares. However, as the December 31 regulatory deadline passed without the necessary approvals, the deal fell through , forcing both parties to walk away.

Of these, 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively manage around $109 billion in assets as of Jan. 15, just a year after the first approval .

This delay allows the SEC more time to conduct a thorough evaluation. The fund aims to track the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Cardano, Avalanche, Bitcoin Cash, Polkadot, and Uniswap. NYSE Arca initially submitted the proposal on November 14, 2024. It was published in the Federal Register on December 3, with no public comments submitted. By law, the SEC must act within 45 days, meaning the initial deadline was January 17, 2025. However, the decision has now been postponed. Approval of this ETF would mark a significant milestone in cryptocurrency regulation , signaling a pivotal moment for crypto investment vehicles. Bitwise has managed this fund since 2018, and the proposed ETF conversion has generated interest within the financial and crypto sectors. Analysts widely anticipated this delay, as the SEC often takes a cautious approach to such applications. Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart commented on Twitter, saying the postponement was expected. He also predicted similar delays for other proposals, including Grayscale's GDLC fund, whose decision deadline is February 2, 2025. In addition, crypto analyst Marty Party linked these delays to political factors, suggesting that approvals may come more swiftly after the next presidential inauguration. He pointed out that the Bitwise fund includes major cryptocurrencies like BTC , ETH, and SOL. Such funds could significantly impact the market if approved. Separately, Bitwise filed a new application with the SEC in December for the ""Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF."" This fund would focus on companies holding large Bitcoin reserves. The SEC‚Äôs methodical approach to these proposals highlights its effort to balance innovation with investor protection. While delays were expected, the potential approval of these ETFs would represent a breakthrough for crypto investment products , enabling more widespread participation in digital asset markets. Analysts and investors alike continue to monitor these developments closely.",,EN,0,0,BCH|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-15 07:26:28

The three nations urged stronger collaboration between public and private sectors to counter these attacks and recover stolen funds. North Korean hackers stole over $1.3 billion in cryptocurrency in 2024 , a record amount, with much of it funding ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs. The statement highlights the advanced tactics used by North Korean hackers, who frequently target cryptocurrency exchanges, digital asset custodians, and individuals. These cyberattacks often involve malware, social engineering, and insider operations. North Korean IT workers have infiltrated Web3 and blockchain companies, compromising their networks while posing as employees of legitimate organizations. The governments warned companies in these sectors to carefully vet freelancers and contractors to avoid unintentionally hiring DPRK-affiliated workers. According to Chainalysis, North Korean hackers stole $660.50 million in 2023 across 20 incidents. In 2024, this figure rose dramatically to $1.34 billion across 47 incidents‚Äîa 102% increase. These funds are believed to directly support North Korea‚Äôs missile programs and military advancements. The notorious Lazarus Group, a DPRK-linked hacker collective, has been responsible for many of the largest thefts in the cryptocurrency sector. Three weeks ago, South Korea sanctioned 15 North Korean IT organization members for allegedly aiding the country‚Äôs nuclear weapons program. The sanctioned individuals were reportedly operating in China, Russia , Southeast Asia, and Africa under fake identities, funneling earnings back to North Korea. The US, Japan, and South Korea emphasized the need for transnational collaboration to disrupt these activities. They called for increased efforts to prevent theft, recover stolen funds, and deny North Korea access to illicit revenue streams. The statement also urged private entities to implement stricter cybersecurity measures and to review governmental advisories on mitigating cyber threats. In October, US authorities seized Bitcoin and Tether linked to the Lazarus Group after they stole $879 million. Legal actions were initiated to recover $2.67 million in digital assets from two major hacks: one involving $1.7 million USDT stolen from Deribit and another targeting Bitcoin holdings worth over $970,000. The statement underscores the persistent threat posed by DPRK-affiliated hacking groups. These advanced groups, including the Lazarus Group, have been labeled as ongoing security risks by authorities in the US, Japan, and South Korea.

Expert Predicts Final Correction Before Bull Market Resurgence,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/last-dip-for-altcoins-expert-predicts-final-correction-before-bull-market-resurgence/,"As the cryptocurrency market grapples with a broader decline, altcoins have faced significant challenges, with Ethereum (ETH) leading the way with losses nearing 20%. This drop comes after Ethereum‚Äôs repeated failures to break through the crucial resistance level of $4,000, a barrier that has proven formidable in recent months also preventing the cryptocurrency to reach new record levels as Bitcoin (BTC) did to close 2024. Mid-Cycle Correction For Altcoins: A Path To Recovery? Market expert Ash Crypto has recently offered insights in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), into the current state of altcoins, suggesting that they are undergoing a ‚Äúmid-cycle correction.‚Äù According to Ash Crypto, this phase is a natural part of the bull market cycle and may set the stage for a recovery of previously lost value and potentially even higher gains for these digital assets. Related Reading: Chainlink Weekly Chart Looks Promising ‚Äì If Bulls Reclaim $30 ‚ÄòATH Are Next‚Äô In his social media post, the expert highlighted historical precedents, noting that similar price actions were seen in January 2021, just before the onset of an altcoin season that captivated investors. Despite recent fluctuations, Ethereum and other altcoins have shown slight signs of recovery, with ETH managing to surge above $3,200, rebounding from its nearest support level of $3,100. This recent uptick prevented further losses and sparked hope among traders. However, Ash Crypto cautions that another dip may be on the horizon before a more sustained recovery can take hold. Market Whales May Shake Out Retail Investors In his analysis, Ash Crypto projected that altcoins could experience one final market correction before entering what he believes will be a full bull mode later this year. The expert referenced a chart he shared, depicting the total market capitalization of altcoins excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, which showed potential consolidation between the $926 billion and $930 billion levels. This consolidation phase could precede a move towards a bullish cycle peak, estimated to reach as high as $3.39 trillion. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Crash To $89,000 Reveals Where BTC Is Headed Next Adding to the intrigue, Ash Crypto remarked that Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance appears to have topped out, suggesting that an altcoin season is imminent. However, he warns that before this potential surge, market whales may attempt to shake out retail investors by manipulating prices. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,215, up over 3% in the 24-hour time frame. Other altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) have also risen by 5%, 3% and 5.3% respectively in the same time frame. Taking into account Ash Crypto‚Äôs analysis, it remains to be seen whether further consolidation or another correction will take place for altcoins before what could be the most notable gains for these digital assets in history.

These estimates are based on adoption rates observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs, signaling strong growth potential for these digital assets. Historical Context of ETP Adoption According to the image shared by Sigel, Exchange-traded products tied to Bitcoin currently hold $108 billion in assets, which accounts for 6% of Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization of $1.874 trillion. Similarly, Ethereum ETPs reached a penetration rate of 3% of the asset‚Äôs total market cap‚Äî$12 billion of assets relative to Ethereum‚Äôs $395 billion market cap‚Äîwithin their first six months of operation. JPMorgan analysts applied these adoption metrics to forecast potential outcomes for XRP and Solana. If these assets achieve similar levels of penetration, their ETPs could unlock significant new capital flows into the respective markets. SOL & XRP ETPs Could Attract $3-8bn Each: JPM ETP assets ($108bn) make up 6% of the total Bitcoin market cap ($1,874bn) after the ETPs‚Äô first year of trading; likewise, ether ETP assets ($12bn) have a 3% penetration rate of the total Ethereum market cap ($395bn) within its first‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/7rApA2z71h ‚Äî matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) January 13, 2025 XRP and Solana ETP Projections The report suggests that XRP, with its market cap of $146.5 billion at the time of the analysis, could attract between $4.3 billion (at a 3% penetration rate) and $8.4 billion (at a 6% penetration rate) into ETPs. Solana, with a market cap of $90.5 billion, might see inflows ranging from $2.7 billion (3%) to $5.2 billion (6%). These projections underline the strong potential of both assets to capture a significant share of institutional and retail investment through ETPs.

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional and Retail Implications The potential influx of billions into XRP and SOL through ETPs could mark a pivotal step in broadening access to these digital assets. ETPs simplify exposure to cryptocurrencies for institutional investors and retail participants by bypassing the complexities of direct token ownership. The success of XRP and Solana ETPs would further validate the demand for regulated and tradable investment products tied to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, these projections come at the moment when regulatory clarity for XRP is expected to improve with Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. Experts believe the SEC will dismiss its lawsuit against Ripple once Trump takes office, and provide proper crypto-friendly regulation to help the industry grow. This would increase investor confidence, and XRP‚Äôs ability to draw institutional interest. JPMorgan‚Äôs analysis highlights the importance of ETP adoption rates as a key indicator of institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. If Solana and XRP replicate the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum, they could significantly strengthen their positions within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The recent breakout has fueled investor optimism, cementing XRP‚Äôs position as a standout performer in the crypto market. Here‚Äôs are why the XRP price is surging today. What‚Äôs Behind XRP Price 10% Surge Today? XRP price surged 10% today, driven by multiple factors, including speculation around Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal case with the SEC. Market watchers are focused on the SEC‚Äôs January 15 deadline to file its opening brief in the appeal against Judge Torres‚Äô ruling. The broader crypto market also showed strong momentum, with Bitcoin hovering above $97,000. The global crypto market cap rose by 2.86% over the last 24 hours, contributing to positive sentiment. Major tokens, including Ripple, benefitted significantly from the bullish trend. Ripple‚Äôs anticipated release of its stablecoin, RLUSD, on Cardano‚Äôs blockchain is another potential catalyst for the asset‚Äôs rally. The development has sparked optimism within the community, further fueling price momentum. Additionally, political shifts in the United States appear to have boosted market sentiment. Donald Trump‚Äôs upcoming inauguration on January 20 and his pro-crypto regulatory nominations, including Paul Atkins, favor Ripple price. Meanwhile, reports suggest SEC Chair Gary Gensler will step down soon, with a crypto-friendly successor expected to take the reins. Whale activity around XRP has been particularly noteworthy. Over the past week, whales accumulated 1.09 billion Ripple tokens, suggesting strong institutional interest. This accumulation is believed to be a significant driver of today‚Äôs price spike.

Let‚Äôs delve into the details shaping this silent financial revolution in the Asian region. Thailand‚Äôs Push for Bitcoin ETFs As per recent reports , the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Asian country of Thailand is preparing to allow Bitcoin ETFs to list on local exchanges. SEC Secretary-General Pornanong Budsaratragoon acknowledged the reports revealed the regulator‚Äôs plan to bring revolutionary changes in the crypto sector. Once implemented, the plan will enable individuals and institutions to invest directly in local BTC ETFs. Currently, only indirect exposure through overseas funds is permitted. Thailand‚Äôs Ambition of Becoming a Digital-Assets Hub Several Asian financial powers have openly come forward to express their support for the cryptocurrency industry. Among those, Singapore and Hong Kong are the most prominent ones. They have introduced several pro-crypto policies to create a suitable environment for the growth of the sector. With the aforementioned policies, what Thailand aims is to counter the dominance of these two financial powers in the crypto sector and to emerge as the topmost crypto hub in the Asia-Pacific region. Reports suggest that the country may introduce strong policies to ensure investor protection and foster cryptocurrency adoption . Reports add that Thailand‚Äôs regulatory authority is considering the possibility of permitting corporations to issue stablecoins backed by bonds. Thailand‚Äôs Thriving Tourism Sector & The Crypto Revolution Thailand is an extremely famous tourist destination in Asia. At least 28 million tourists visit Thailand a year. Experts think that the country‚Äôs tourism sector will be one of the primary beneficiaries of its effort to introduce policies to create a positive environment for crypto adoption.

In conclusion, Thailand‚Äôs steps toward embracing Bitcoin ETFs and stablecoins reflect a progressive stance on cryptocurrency adoption. As the nation positions itself as a digital-asset hub, the evolving market could drive innovation, attract global investors and bolster its crypto ecosystem. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The SEC is still required to file its opening brief by tomorrow (January 16). Despite this, the XRP community is questioning whether the new SEC chair Paul Atkins could potentially retract the appeal. Bill Morgan, a legal expert, expressed uncertainty, suggesting that a vote by all five commissioners might not be required. Morgan has always anticipated the SEC would proceed with filing the opening brief, noting the appeal is arguable and the SEC holds a decent position for negotiation. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel weighed in, stating that a newly-formed SEC would likely need to vote to dismiss the appeal, although it would be a highly unusual move. Morgan responded, acknowledging Fagel‚Äôs point but clarified he doesn‚Äôt expect the SEC to vote to dismiss. He suggested that the SEC might instead seek a better deal through settlement, even if enforcement actions shift under new leadership. A newly-constituted SEC would need to vote to dismiss the appeal. Which they may do (though it‚Äôs a highly unusual move). ‚Äî Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) January 14, 2025 Morgan wrote on X, I don‚Äôt see or at least don‚Äôt assume the SEC will vote to dismiss it. They could quietly negotiate a better deal by settlement even if the policy changes towards enforcement actions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Eyes a 30% Rise After a 40% Upswing‚ÄîWill it Surpass Ethereum in 2025? , XRP Price Rallies Ripple‚Äôs XRP is currently up by more than 12 percent and is now eyeing to break the crucial $3 mark.

The token aimed to build a no-stress investment community around the drone meme, when the team was approached with a malicious wallet-draining link. Chill Drone (CHONE) started its trading with a major setback, as team and community wallets were drained through a malicious link. The Chill Drone team, unfortunately, encountered a common crypto scam when trying to verify its token through Jupiter. The project sent out the usual form to verify CHONE. After not receiving feedback for two weeks, the Chill Drone team decided to be proactive and reach out through the legitimate Telegram channel of Jupiter DEX aggregator. Jupiter DEX aggregator usually verifies Solana tokens after at least 21 days from launching, after a minimal $10K in daily volumes. CHONE fulfilled all the market cap and community conditions, though the team still claimed they had to wait for verification. The Chill Drone project already built up a Telegram channel with over 2,000 members, where attempts at sending malicious links are still a threat. The token has a total of 1,803 holders, with around 5.54% of the supply held in the Raydium liquidity pool. CHONE trades at a valuation of $1.12M, the usual range for a token just starting out. The asset expects a potential breakout, similar to other memes just starting out. The initial idea of CHONE was to launch a token for both meme token veterans and newcomers with limited crypto experience. Chill Drone was created by a team with previous business experience outside crypto, which increased the token‚Äôs credibility. The project aims to follow a model similar to Pudgy Penguins, creating a community with physical items and merchandise. Chill Drone team gets wallets drained in Telegram phishing attack Like other meme tokens, Chill Drone had multiple copycats after its launch on Pump.fun. This created the need to become verified, especially on the Jupiter aggregator and routing service. An OK tick on Jupiter would ensure the community chose the right CHONE token. One of the Chill Drone team members decided to contact Jupiter through Telegram, encountering a legitimate-looking group with over 73,000 members. One of the group‚Äôs members, claiming to be a Jupiter developer, opened a personal chat with Chill Drone‚Äôs team. The alleged developer, Alex Dobrin, would turn out to be a scammer who sent out a malicious link. The hacker contacted the founder of Chill Drone with an offer of verifying the token on Jupiter DEX. The hacker contacted the founder of Chill Drone with an offer of verifying the token on Jupiter DEX. The alleged Jupiter developer looked over Chill Drone‚Äôs wallets and requested to connect the main team wallet with the biggest balance to the link that he sent. After that, the funds were moved and laundered. ‚Äú Before I realized what was happening, all the tokens in that account, along with those in the linked wallets, were drained. It‚Äôs especially heartbreaking because it wasn‚Äôt just the dev team‚Äôs wallets‚Äîit also included funds from family members and community members who had invested with us, many of whom were new to buying crypto and asked us to buy for them,‚Äù said the project‚Äôs founder, Adnaan. The team became aware of the drained wallet only after the community noticed the missing funds, which initially appeared to be a rug pull. The CHONE token‚Äôs price plummeted following a $60,000 sell-off in a single transaction. To stabilize the asset, the team injected personal funds, helping to redirect its trajectory. The only source of selling was the hacker, as CHONE is widely distributed across multiple wallets, none of which hold more than 5% of the total supply. The team put in about $50K in personal funds, and continued buying more tokens to bring up the market cap, and buy back the stolen tokens. This ensured the coin‚Äôs stability and repaired the reputation with the community. ‚ÄúMany of the community members, with the long-term vision and confidence they have, bought back into the coin as they realized it was effectively trading at a ‚Äòdiscount ,'‚Äù explained the project‚Äôs founder. The token team has not given up on CHONE, and will continue to develop the asset. The newly verified token is already listed on CoinGecko, starting trading anew from January 13. The token creator team will investigate the hack, while also taking care of the platform‚Äôs development. After the exploit, the Jupiter Exchange Official channel once again posted its message to warn against impersonators. Source: Jupiter DEX Telegram channel Hacker swapped CHONE for SOL The hacked address was created for the sole purpose of draining the CHONE tokens. Based on wallet activity, the hacker wallet retained USDC for $29,250 . The funds were drained in a single transaction on January 5, then swapped for SOL. The final balance in the hacker‚Äôs wallet is in USDC. Source: DexScreener As a proof for the exploit, the hacker‚Äôs wallet was first funded by the Chone reserve wallet, with no transfers or connections before that. The hacker also interacted with a known Binance hot wallet, going under the name of kiing.sol .

He is an American investor, entrepreneur, and business executive. He is the CEO of Coinbase,¬†a cryptocurrency platform.

The memecoin built on the Base network will be listed on the Coinbase Global network after reaching a crucial milestone in terms of trading activity. According to the announcement , Toshi memecoin was added to the listing roadmap by Coinbase Global. As a result, the Toshi token will follow other memecoin projects listed on the Coinbase exchange led by Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and Floki (FLOKI), among others Impact on the Toshi Price Action Following the listing plans on Coinbase Global, Toshi‚Äôs price rallied more than 120 percent in the past 24 hours to reach a daily high of about $0.0003679. The small-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $114 million, registered a 515 percent surge in daily average trading volume to about $60M. Consequently, Toshi‚Äôs price rebounded above the daily 50 Moving Average (MA), thus invalidating the previous bearish sentiment. However, Toshi‚Äôs price must consistently close above the resistance level of around $0.0004 to guarantee a new bullish trend in the near term. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : DOGE & SHIB Prices Plunge: Will These Memecoins Recover? , Fundamental Outlook The small-cap memecoin has grown to a vibrant project listed on a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges and decentralized exchanges . As a result, Toshi has attracted more than more than 489k on-chain holders. Furthermore, Toshi has a decent liquidity of around $1 million in Wrapped Ether (WETH). With the goal of becoming the premier memecoin on the Base network, Toshi‚Äôs listing in Coinbase will be a major boost. Moreover, the existence of thousands of memecoins has significantly diluted the altcoin industry, hence slowing down the timings of the much-anticipated altseason. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With this, Binance founder has not only teased his support for buying BTC at its lower price but has also sought due consideration from crypto enthusiasts due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Everyone has FOMO. Just do it responsibly. ‚Äî CZ BNB (@cz_binance) January 15, 2025 Impact on BTC Price There has been a notable surge in BTC price over 2% in the last 24 hours. The flagship cryptocurrency is now exchanging hands above $97K, which also represents a rise of 126.87% over the year. BTC price has been rising constantly throughout the day with the initial price recorded at $94,823.5. Source: CoinMarketCap This has triggered speculation that its prices will soar in the days to come, especially as Donald Trump gets closer to assuming the US Presidential office. The lower-than-expected PPI data on Tuesday fueled BTC is estimated to grow by 26.38% in the next 30 days amid a volatility of 3.53% and an FGI of 63 points. Data related to Open Interest from Coinglass data shows Bitcoin has gained bullish sentiment amid demand from derivatives market. Earlier Support for Bitcoin This is not the first time that Changpeng ‚ÄòCZ‚Äô Zhao and Robert Kiyosaki have come forward to express their support for Bitcoin. On Tuesday, Binance Founder teased buying BTC dips when it was anticipated that Donald Trump would sign key crypto executive orders during his early days as the US President. CZ, at that time, had compared that opportunity to the initial days of Bitcoin when the token was just starting to gain traction, or when its prices were just starting to pick a momentum on the price chart. Similarly, Robert Kiyosaki earlier called the crash of Bitcoin ‚Äògreat news‚Äô, emphasizing that he would continue buying Bitcoin because a crash in BTC prices meant an opportunity to buy the token at a discount. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has broken the silence on Solana and XRP ETFs , highlighting that there is a possibility for both ETFs to bring an inflow of $15 billion within the first year. This has backed the adoption of cryptocurrencies and hence, is also boosting the price surge of BTC.

Experts forecast the asset could hit $4 and $8 soon, with some projecting its market cap might exceed $500 billion. XRP Makes the Headlines The cryptocurrency sector experienced a substantial revival in the last 24 hours, with its global market capitalization rising above $3.5 trillion once again . Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and many more leading digital assets are well in the green today (January 15) , but some lead the pack with double-digit price spikes. One notable gainer is Ripple‚Äôs XRP, whose valuation recently hit a 7-year high of almost $2.90. Currently, the price is hovering around $2.88 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data), representing a 14% increase on a daily scale . XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Alongside its significant surge, XRP became the top-trending cryptocurrency on January 14. According to Santiment, the reasons behind the buzz surrounding the asset are the increased optimism over its potential use in banking and financial transactions, the bullish predictions of a further rally, and the XRP ETF speculations. The platform‚Äôs research estimated that the second most-trending cryptocurrency is Ethereum (ETH) . The interest is supposedly fueled by the introduction of Soneium (an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain solution developed by Sony). ‚ÄúThere are multiple transactions involving significant amounts of ETH, highlighting active trading and investment throughout the Ethereum ecosystem,‚Äù Santiment added. Other cryptocurrencies that have captured the attention of industry participants as of late include Bitcoin (BTC), Kaspa (KAS), and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) . XRP Targets Fresh Peaks As mentioned above, numerous analysts believe the price of Ripple‚Äôs native token could reach a new all-time high as soon as this year. X user CRYPTOWZRD recently claimed that the asset ‚Äúhas flipped previous resistance to support‚Äù of around $2 and is now poised to soar to $4 and then $8. They said such a scenario would mirror the pre-bull run in 2017 and the subsequent rally the following year. The veteran trader Peter Brandt also chipped in. He outlined multiple bullish forecasts lately, assuming that XRP‚Äôs market capitalization could explode above $500 billion. Such a pump would result in a price increase of almost $9.50. It is worth mentioning that Brandt has been predominantly anti-XRP for the past several years. Earlier this month, though, he apologized for his stance and wished the Ripple community all the best.

On Jan. 14, Tom Emmer, an American attorney and Congressman, was appointed as the Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence. Formed in 2023, the Subcommittee is tasked with overseeing the development and regulation of crypto assets, examining the integration of AI in financial services, and exploring advancements in financial technology. The 63-year-old Congressman expressed his honor at the new position, stating that under his leadership, he will ensure ‚Äúthe future of digital assets is guided by Americans, with American values.‚Äù I am honored to have been selected as Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence.

Gensler, a polarizing figure in the crypto world, will end his term concurrent with the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th president of the U.S. on Jan. 20. He will be replaced by Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner known for his pro-crypto stance.

He was the Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee during the 116th and 117th Congresses. Emmer was also a part of the FIT21 Bill , which created the term ‚Äúdigital commodity‚Äù for cryptocurrencies and clarified the SEC‚Äôs role in regulating them. All in all, the Congressman has been an advocate for crypto-friendly laws. Moreover, in Consensus 2024 , a crypto conference that took place in Austin, Texas, Emmer said that crypto was ‚Äúnonpartisan and here to stay.‚Äù In a 2023 post on X, Emmer highlighted Binance‚Äôs $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice as evidence that properly enforced existing laws can effectively root out misconduct in the crypto industry. He argued for using congressional resources to support and expand opportunities within the sector. Congressional resources should instead be spent working to bring more crypto activity and opportunities onshore to bolster U.S. national security. ‚Äî Tom Emmer (@GOPMajorityWhip) November 22, 2023 In 2018, he repealed certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The act sought to relieve some of the regulatory relief on small banks and credit unions, thereby giving them greater capacity to serve their local communities. Emmer is one of the many picks among other pro-crypto elected officials like Patrick McHenry, Senator John Thune, and Bryan Steil , to name a few. As Donald Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20, the crypto industry prepares itself for a possible shift in regulatory and legislative attention: a Republican majority in both Houses poses renewed hope for things to get friendlier in terms of policy.

As DOGE and BONK navigate the volatile market, Remittix presents a unique PayFi solution that has bolstered massive adoption. Table of Contents Could Dogecoin hit $1 in 2025? Bonk struggles despite major burn event Better alternative for DOGE and BONK: Remittix RTX presale on path to $3m Meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) have highlighted mixed sentiments reflecting the broader crypto market dynamism. After facing significant pressure in the past week, Dogecoin‚Äôs price has risen in response to Elon Musk‚Äôs tweet appreciating U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and others for supporting D.O.G.E. On the other hand, Bonk has experienced a downtrend even after its strategic step of burning 1.6 trillion BONK tokens. The burning event aims to increase scarcity and exemplifies its commitment to long-term growth. As Bonk and Dogecoin quietly position themselves for explosive growth, Remittix (RTX) has generated substantial buzz with its unique PayFi solution and growth potential. Each of these tokens brings something unique, whether it is a strong community backing or technology. Let‚Äôs look at the deets. Could Dogecoin hit $1 in 2025? DOGE crypto jumped above $0.3432 on Tuesday, rallying alongside the top three cryptocurrencies. The uptick was likely catalyzed by Elon Musk‚Äôs tweet and a broader market relief rally. The meme token has showcased resilience, holding gains above its critical support level of $0.30. Dogecoin‚Äôs uptick coincides with a more than 90% jump in daily trading volume to over $3.80 billion. Despite the broader market correction, Dogecoin whales have indicated strong confidence in the token‚Äôs recovery. Per crypto analyst Ali Charts, large wallets have accumulated approximately 470 million DOGE tokens worth $155 million at $0.33. The upsurge in whale accumulation highlights optimism for DOGE‚Äôs long-term potential and recovery prospects. Notably, the meme coin‚Äôs price action has coincided with its historical patterns. After an uptrend in late 2024 and a healthy correction, the token mirrored previous cycles where Dogecoin consolidated near the key Fibonacci retracement levels before triggering another breakout. CryptoSurf has indicated that DOGE is hovering near the 0.618 Fib retracement level around the $0.33 mark, a key area for reversals. Historically, Dogecoin has exhibited explosive rallies from similar levels. If this pattern repeats, the DOGE coin could see a significant upside toward the $1 psychological barrier in the coming months. Bonk struggles despite major burn event Following its recent token-burning event, which successfully removed 1.69 trillion BONK tokens, worth over $51 million, from circulation, the Bonk price witnessed a brief rally but slipped back to its downtrend. Looking ahead, the BONK ecosystem seems focused on diversification beyond token burns. The team had shared plans to support projects building on top of BONK, creating value streams and additional utility. Combining supply reduction with ecosystem expansion through development plans could heighten its growth potential in 2025. Moreover, its Arkham Exchange listing could encourage more trading activity and exposure, resulting in significant price changes. Beyond network development, Bonk‚Äôs technical structure indicates the meme coin is hovering below its 100-day simple moving average. This positioning below the SMA typically signals a bearish outlook. Per Andrew Griffiths‚Äôs analysis, Bonk‚Äôs price has shown signs of a bullish breakout, with its upper resistance forming a falling wedge. The meme token is targeting $0.00003141. Notably, if BONK can sustain its momentum, it could target the $0.000075 mark and, ultimately, the $0.11 mark by the end of 2025. Its relative strength index (RSI) is below 50, suggesting that BONK coin has room for more upside rally, with prices poised for a recovery if buyers step in.

Months later, the reports confirm that World Liberty‚Äôs portfolio faced a $4.8M loss with these holdings. At the same time, the wallet address transaction history shows multiple transactions from the portfolio. Let‚Äôs discuss the Trump‚Äôs crypto bets and the current conditions. World Liberty Financial Loses $4.9M In Its Crypto Holdings Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto project was launched in September, but its first crypto purchase occurred in December. The DeFi platform spent $12 million to buy popular cryptos like Ethereum (ETH), Aave, and Chainlink (LINK), with ETH having the biggest portion. At that time, the prices of these cryptos rose higher with WLFI‚Äôs buying . That was just a start, and the firm bought even more with time, adding WBTC, ONDO, ENA, and many others to its holdings. However, amid market uncertainties and Bitcoin price struggles, altcoins faced a major correction. This impact is visible in World Liberty‚Äôs portfolio, which lost nearly $4.8M in unrealized losses in the ETH, WBTC, AAVE, LINK, ENA, and ONDO holdings. The crypto project has not sold any holdings till the time of reporting but bears significant unrealized losses. In contrast, Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto holdings are growing. Eventually, this will make him the first-ever sitting President with meme coin holdings .¬†Although losses were quite expected in this changing market, the project seems unaffected, except for a few transactions. Is Donald Trump‚Äôs Crypto Project Selling Holdings? Many on-chain analytics platforms have noticed the transaction from the WLFI wallet. A Lookonchain X post states that the World Liberty firm exchanges some of its WBTC for ETH and USDC for WBTC. According to the post, the crypto project has exchanged 103 WBTC ($9.89M) for 3,075 ETH at the rate of $0.0354. After that, a total of $59.8M worth of ETH has been transferred to Coinbase. WLFI also spent 1.7M USDT and bought 17.62 WBTC at $96,491. This constant buying confirms the project‚Äôs farseeing in the industry, as it‚Äôs still holding despite current losses. These transfers have concerned investors about a possible selling mindset, as the WLFI transferred massive holdings to Coinbase. However, the DeFi crypto project‚Äôs team has clarified the reasons behind these transactions. With an X post, the team explained that these transactions were routine movements that addressed the project‚Äôs functioning. More importantly, these were just a relocation for their ordinary business purpose and were not a sale. Key Points To Remember Amid the market‚Äôs uncertainties, Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto project faces significant unrealized losses. Crypto holdings, primarily in ETH, WBTC, AAVE, LINK, and ONDO, collectively declined by $4.8M. At the same time, World Liberty Financial made a few swaps between WBTC and ETH and added more WBTC to its holdings before transferring $59.8M in ETH to the Coinbase exchange. However, the WLFI team has confirmed that these transactions and exchanges are not connected to selling behavior but are just routine moves needed for the functioning of the project.

Thanks to that, the AI sector‚Äôs 2024 valuation reached a staggering $621.19 billion. Latest projections indicate a possible explosive surge to $2.74 trillion by 2032. Furthermore, with the technology continuing to permeate into every sector of the global economy, tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta have collectively poured around $200 billion into AI development over the course of 2024 alone. Nonetheless, this monetary commitment extends beyond software development. The market for AI infrastructure is also expanding at an unfathomable rate. Investments into data centers, hardware, software solutions, and other related fields are growing by 40-55% annually . This commendable growth rate has the potential to skyrocket the industry to $1.4 trillion by 2027. Last year, there was the invasion of ‚Äòdigital twins.‚Äù To be precise, AI-enabled virtual replicas of physical beings that are capable of redefining how individuals interact with technology. This in turn is offering unfathomable possibilities for personalization and engagement in the digital world. AI is ushering the Emotional Intelligence Revolution As we witness the staggering rise and evolution of AI and machine learning (ML) technologies, we have started to witness the integration of emotional intelligence into these digital advanced systems. It‚Äôs intriguing to know that AI algorithms have become so capable that they can analyze subtle facial expressions. Additionally, the can also assess voice modulations, behavioral patterns, and much more to understand and respond to human emotions with remarkable accuracy. This enables digital representations to engage in more natural, context-aware conversations that can adapt to the emotional state of their human counterparts. Naturally, these AI twins have opened up new frontiers for deployment across the board. In customer service, AI twins can be used to handle routine inquiries with personalization. On the other hand, in the healthcare domain, they can be used for remote caregiving. However, these advancements also raise important considerations. The primary problems are related to privacy, emotional manipulation, and the ethical implications of AI systems that can recognize and respond to human emotions. Amidst this rapidly evolving fray, Antix has emerged as a leading innovator in the digital twin space. It offers cutting-edge solutions that are designed to transform how brands engage with their audiences. Through its proprietary technology, Antix creates hyper-realistic ‚ÄòDigital Twins‚Äô and ‚ÄòDigital Humans‚Äô ‚Äî helping maximize customer interaction quality. Antix‚Äôs success is evidenced by its collaborations with global industry leaders, who are spread across diverse sectors including Warner Brothers, Porsche, and Tencent, etc. Moreover, the company stands out for its ability to create digital representations that not only look realistic, but also exhibit natural behaviors and emotional responses. This makes Antix‚Äôs solutions particularly valuable for content creators and influencers. This is the case as they can use these digital twins to expand their reach and engage with audiences more effectively. The platform‚Äôs AI-driven personalization ensures that each digital human maintains the authentic characteristics and personality traits of their real-world counterparts. Lastly, Antix‚Äôs service suite has also expanded into the realm of enterprise solutions. To elaborate, their technology affords businesses the power to create personalized customer experiences at scale, with digital humans serving as brand ambassadors, customer service representatives, and educational facilitators. Such a high degree of versatility has already helped the project attract a community of over 100,000 active users, thus signalling a growing demand for such solutions. Is the dawn of a new digital era upon us? Looking ahead, the continued emergence of AI tech stands to fundamentally reshape how humans interact with digital systems across different industries. Beginning with revolutionizing entertainment and education to transforming customer service and healthcare delivery, the concept of digital twins has already laid the groundwork for a more connected and personalized digital future. As companies like Antix continue to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in today‚Äôs advanced digital world, the line between physical and digital experiences seems to be diluting. Ergo, it‚Äôs opening up unprecedented opportunities for human-computer interaction and digital engagement. Interesting times ahead!

So What Is The Reason For The Rise? Santiment Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-is-on-the-attack-again-so-what-is-the-reason-for-the-rise-santiment-explained/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins have been experiencing a recovery, albeit limited, over the last two days. At this point, Bitcoin has exceeded $97,000, while altcoins have also experienced small increases. However, XRP positively separated from the market and came to the fore with a 12.8% increase in the last 24 hours. While wondering what is behind this rise, Santiment said that whale accumulation and ETF speculation are behind the XRP rise. Cryptocurrency analytics firm Santiment attributed XRP‚Äôs recent price surge in the uncertain crypto market to several factors, saying the most important one is the significant accumulation of wallets holding 1-10 million XRP. ‚ÄúXRP investors are delighted to see the third-largest cryptocurrency, XRP, reach $2.69 today for the first time since December 17, 2024. This rise is supported by the ongoing massive accumulation of wallets holding 1 million-10 million XRP. These wallets hold over 37% more XRP than they did 2 months ago, adding approximately $3.8 billion worth of XRP since their holdings began on November 12, 2024. Apart from Santiment, Sean Dawson, head of research at on-chain protocol Derive, also commented on the XRP rally. Dawson said that the expectation of an XRP ETF launch in 2025 has increased and that this expectation supports the rise. Dawson also added that the rise was also driven by the growing expectation that XRP‚Äôs legal battle with the SEC could be resolved in Ripple‚Äôs favor. As anticipation for XRP ETF approval grows, banking giant JPMorgan estimated that the XRP ETF could attract $4-8 billion inflows.

While Bitcoin (BTC) remains dominant, altcoins are quickly gaining ground and challenging its lead. Ethereum (ETH) and the up-and-coming BigBossInu are positioned for remarkable growth, with investors keenly monitoring these standout contenders for significant gains ahead of the market‚Äôs next surge. BigBossInu: Leading the Charge in Crypto Innovation BigBossInu is quickly establishing itself as a major force in the crypto space, with its cutting-edge presale drawing significant investor attention. This high-potential project presents a rare opportunity for early backers to benefit from its fast-paced momentum. As interest continues to surge, BigBossInu is positioning itself as a strong market contender. Its pioneering technology and ambitious roadmap are set to propel the project toward substantial growth in the near future. >>>>>> Solana (SOL) is currently trading around $179.45, showing strong bullish momentum. Analysts are optimistic about SOL‚Äôs potential to rise further, with predictions suggesting it could reach as high as $215 by the end of January, 2025. However, breaking the $250 mark might be a challenge within this timeframe‚Äã. Toncoin (TON) is experiencing steady growth, with recent reports highlighting its adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Layer-1 blockchain projects. It continues to solidify its position as a leading player, particularly with its expanding ecosystem and partnerships‚Äã. Optimism (OP) has seen a significant price increase, trading at $3.34, as it benefits from its role as a key Layer-2 solution for Ethereum. The growing demand for scaling solutions has fueled optimism around OP, with analysts predicting further gains as Ethereum‚Äôs network continues to expand‚Äã. Sei (SEI) recently hit a new all-time high of $0.589 and is currently trading around $0.60. With its strong infrastructure for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and an ecosystem poised for growth, SEI is well-positioned for further upward movement, with analysts suggesting it could reach $1 in early 2025‚Äã. >>> Conclusion As the market gears up for the next rally, cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BigBossInu, Solana, Toncoin, and Optimism are gaining attention for their growth potential. BigBossInu‚Äôs presale, Solana‚Äôs momentum, Toncoin‚Äôs DeFi expansion, and Optimism‚Äôs scaling solutions highlight promising opportunities.

Dogecoin remains at the forefront of discussions, with experts delivering a Dogecoin price prediction pointing to significant changes in 2025. Meanwhile, Solana‚Äôs prowess in DeFi continues to capture the spotlight, as Solana TVL hits a remarkable $9.52 billion, achieving a three-year record. On another front, BlockDAG (BDAG) is ramping up for its eagerly awaited 2025 mainnet launch, an event poised to escalate BDAG‚Äôs value dramatically. In celebration, they‚Äôve rolled out the LAUNCH300 code for a limited time. This appealing offer provides a 300% bonus on BDAG acquisitions, sparking increased demand as the presale shatters records and gathers steam. Dogecoin Price Prediction 2025: What‚Äôs on the Horizon? Dogecoin continues to be a vibrant subject in the crypto market, and its 2025 outlook is drawing keen interest from analysts. Current predictions for Dogecoin price projection indicate a potential range from $0.30 to $0.44, driven by significant market shifts and network activities. Recent commentary by KrissPax compares Dogecoin‚Äôs present trends to its past dynamics, hinting at a substantial upswing in 2025 after a consolidation phase. As specialists refine their Dogecoin price predictions, the $0.40 resistance level is becoming increasingly pivotal. The trajectory of Dogecoin will largely depend on unfolding market trends and community perceptions. Solana‚Äôs Record-Breaking TVL: Exploring the Drivers Solana has reached an important benchmark, with Solana TVL surpassing $9.52 billion, its highest in three years. This surge is underpinned by a dynamic DeFi ecosystem and an impressive $3.98 billion in daily DEX trading volume, outstripping Ethereum and other second-layer solutions. The network‚Äôs scalability and affordable transaction fees have fostered broad adoption, while the upcoming SIMD-0215 upgrade is set to improve real-time account updates to meet growing demands. As Solana TVL continues its ascent, the blockchain‚Äôs ability to handle substantial transaction volumes cements its status as a central figure in the DeFi arena. Seize BlockDAG‚Äôs LAUNCH300 Bonus Before It‚Äôs Gone! BlockDAG is ramping up excitement for its 2025 launch with an extraordinary bonus offer: the limited-time LAUNCH300 code. This code grants a whopping 300% bonus in BDAG coins with each purchase, marking it as one of the most compelling offers in the marketplace. For example, buying $200 worth of BDAG coins with this code will net an extra $600 in bonus coins, significantly boosting the buyer‚Äôs total. With the presale already stirring considerable buzz, this bonus represents a not-to-be-missed chance. Remember, the LAUNCH300 code is only available for a short duration. BlockDAG‚Äôs presale has electrified the crypto market, amassing over $180 million and distributing more than 17.8 billion BDAG coins. The coin‚Äôs price has skyrocketed by 2380%, rising from just $0.001 in its first release to $0.0248 in the current batch 27. This spectacular ascent has spotlighted BlockDAG as one of the best long term crypto assets. With an active presale and soaring demand, BDAG‚Äôs prominence is setting the stage for the network‚Äôs upcoming comprehensive launch. As BlockDAG gears up for its 2025 debut, BDAG is capturing widespread attention. Analysts are forecasting its value might hit $20 by 2027, indicating significant growth potential. This rapid expansion, alongside BlockDAG‚Äôs dynamic progress, hints at a luminous future. The LAUNCH300 bonus introduces an extra thrill, giving buyers a rare opportunity to amass more coins at a pivotal moment in BDAG‚Äôs trajectory. As the clock ticks down, the blend of explosive presale results, enticing bonus offers, and future prospects positions BDAG as a thrilling prospect in the cryptocurrency arena. Final Analysis The latest Dogecoin price prediction shines a spotlight on DOGE, with analysts projecting prices might fluctuate between $0.30 and $0.44, propelled by robust market dynamics and network activity. Simultaneously, Solana TVL smashing the $9.52 billion mark highlights its preeminence in decentralized finance, fueled by enhanced scalability and broad adoption. Yet, BlockDAG dominates the stage as its groundbreaking presale leads up to an epic 2025 mainnet launch. The fleeting LAUNCH300 code, which delivers a staggering 300% bonus on BDAG purchases, is creating substantial excitement. With presale interest at an all-time high and forecasts suggesting a $20 valuation by 2027, bypassing BlockDAG now could mean missing out on one of the best long term crypto opportunities.

In a new strategy session, Svenson tells his 81,800 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin‚Äôs parabolic trend indicates the flagship crypto asset may surge to at least $124,000 before June, correct for a few months, then have one final explosive move in late 2025. ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin parabolic trend [on the weekly chart] is in strong health. It‚Äôs very healthy. Look at it. The weekly‚Äôs going back to the green. It looks like a nice hammer candle is being printed right here‚Ä¶ hammer candle before a major uptrend continuation‚Ä¶ Bitcoin is elevated heavily off the parabolic trendline, which means that, in theory, Bitcoin could dip even further if it wanted to, and it would still be an exponential higher low within a parabolic trend. Not saying it‚Äôs going to. My bias is bullish, and there‚Äôs not really anything wrong with the trend at all.‚Äù Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube According to the analyst, Bitcoin appears to be in base four of the parabolic curve pattern, putting BTC in a position to witness massive gains in a steep upward move. ‚ÄúAnd in theory, Bitcoin is right now creating base four of the parabolic trend‚Ä¶ This parabola is beautiful, and you see base one, base two, base three. Now that‚Äôs base four. It‚Äôs possible that we could dip a little lower. Doesn‚Äôt really matter, as long as we‚Äôre getting an exponential higher low. Well, that would be the creation of base four. It could be this low. Could be, I don‚Äôt see why not. This is the creation of base four, which means that our sell point is coming up on the next target.‚Äù Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Lastly, Svenson predicts Bitcoin will reach a cycle peak of approximately $160,000 in about ten months. ‚ÄúFrom base three, the price doubles, which is roughly $124,000, meaning that this parabolic trend would look to run up to about $124,000, maybe slightly higher, before breaking the parabolic trend and settling up through the summer before an end of year run at the 80th week in October, and then the bear market begins.‚Äù Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $96,569 at time of writing, up 2.2% in the last 24 hours.

The asset management titan wants the world to know it‚Äôs playing a different game. While MicroStrategy‚Äôs entire identity revolves around amassing Bitcoin like it‚Äôs Pok√©mon cards, BlackRock takes a more measured, institutional approach. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock‚Äôs head of digital assets, spelled it out clearly: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not BlackRock hoarding Bitcoin; it‚Äôs about providing access to a broad pool of investors.‚Äù MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 450,000 Bitcoin. That‚Äôs more than 2% of all Bitcoin in circulation. They‚Äôve spent $62,503 per Bitcoin on average, translating to a portfolio worth $41.1 billion. In January 2025 alone, they added 3,600 BTC to their stash. First, they scooped up 1,070 BTC for $101 million. A week later, they snagged another 2,530 BTC for $243 million. Saylor isn‚Äôt just buying Bitcoin, he‚Äôs betting the farm on it, raising $2 billion through perpetual preferred stock offerings to keep his Bitcoin spree alive. The goal? Deliver returns 1.5 times greater than Bitcoin‚Äôs own performance. BlackRock: Bitcoin for the masses BlackRock‚Äôs approach couldn‚Äôt be more different. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust holds around 250,000 Bitcoin. The trust doesn‚Äôt serve as BlackRock‚Äôs personal piggy bank. Instead, it‚Äôs a tool for institutional investors who want in on Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Mitchnick explained, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not buying and selling Bitcoin for ourselves. This is for our investors.‚Äù The numbers back it up‚Äî682 unique investors filed holdings in the latest quarterly report from Q4 2024. BlackRock‚Äôs strategy is about scale and diversification. Unlike MicroStrategy, which thrives on leverage, BlackRock avoids piling risk on top of an already volatile asset. Mitchnick put it bluntly: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need a three-times levered Bitcoin ETF. The asset‚Äôs got enough volatility without it.‚Äù This ethos has made BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF a runaway success. In its first year, it brought in $36 billion in net new assets, doubling the total market value of cryptos. But the question now is whether that momentum can continue. Crypto ETFs face an uncertain future The buzz around Bitcoin ETFs has cooled. Applications for new funds tied to altcoins like Solana, XRP, Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin are stacking up, but analysts are skeptical. Even if these ETFs get approved, they‚Äôre unlikely to attract the same level of interest. JPMorgan estimates Solana ETFs could bring in $3 billion to $6 billion, while XRP ETFs might pull in $4 billion to $8 billion. That‚Äôs chump change compared to Bitcoin ETFs, which hold $108 billion, making up 6% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total market cap. Ether ETFs haven‚Äôt fared much better. They‚Äôve only managed to capture 3% of Ether‚Äôs market cap, totaling $12 billion in assets. The disparity is clear: Bitcoin remains king, and other cryptocurrencies aren‚Äôt ever gonna dethrone it. Regulation is another wildcard. With a pro-crypto Congress and White House in 2025, the industry is hopeful for favorable changes. A new SEC chairman could pave the way for more innovative crypto products. Analysts believe this could open doors for hybrid Bitcoin and Ether ETFs and other creative solutions.
