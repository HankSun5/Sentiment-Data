The company’s total revenue surged to $10.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, which ended September 30. This is a 1,100% year-over-year increase from the $0.9 million reported in the same period last year. The sharp rise was primarily attributed to the strong performance of SharpLink’s ETH holdings and its strategic deployment within the Ethereum ecosystem. Q3 Results Show ETH Strategy at Core According to the official press release, net income for the quarter soared to $104.3 million, or $0.62 per fully diluted share, in a stark reversal from a net loss of $885,000 in Q3 2024. As of September 30th, the company’s crypto assets stood at $3.0 billion, including 817,747 ETH, which comprised both native and liquid staking tokens. By November 9, SharpLink’s ETH position had further grown to 861,251 ETH. The company also reported $11.1 million in cash and $26.7 million in USDC stablecoins on its balance sheet. Commenting on the financial results, the company’s co-CEO Joseph Chalom said, “SharpLink is pioneering a new model for publicly traded ETH treasury companies – one that marries the agility of an active asset manager with the transparency of a public company. Our ability to dynamically manage capital, pursue sophisticated compounding yield strategies, and partner with many of the most revered names in the Ethereum ecosystem, puts SharpLink in pole position as the Ethereum institutional supercycle accelerates.” SharpLink’s Strategic Moves On the operation side of things, SharpLink made several moves throughout the quarter to strengthen its position as a leading Ethereum treasury operator. In August, its Board of Directors approved a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, under which 1.94 million shares were repurchased for approximately $31.6 million by quarter-end. In September, the Nasdaq-listed company partnered with Superstate to launch tokenized SBET on Ethereum. The following month, SharpLink roped in Matthew Sheffield as Chief Investment Officer, Mandy Campbell as Chief Marketing Officer, and Michael Camarda as Chief Data Officer. Around the same time, the company completed a $76.5 million registered direct offering, priced at a 12% premium to its share price and above the net asset value of its ETH treasury. SharpLink also revealed plans to deploy $200 million worth of ETH from its corporate treasury onto Linea, an Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by Consensys. The funds will be managed through Anchorage Digital Bank, its custodian, and invested across staking, restaking, and AI-driven yield strategies on Linea’s zkEVM framework. This approach is designed to generate diversified ETH-based returns by combining Ethereum staking rewards, EigenCloud restaking incentives, and Linea’s native yield programs.

The Fear & Greed Index now sits at 10, marking extreme fear among investors. This drop signals growing pessimism across the cryptocurrency market. The leading digital asset has fallen below critical technical levels. Both the 7-day and 30-day moving averages now sit above the current price. This pattern indicates deteriorating momentum across short and medium timeframes. Bitcoin has declined 9.81% over the past week. The price dropped beneath the psychologically important $100,000 threshold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $94,211. Large-scale holders have accelerated their selling activity. These ”whales” control substantial portions of the circulating supply. Their distribution pattern has intensified downward pressure. BTC weekly price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Institutional Interest Weakens Amid Tech Correlation U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded notable outflows . These vehicles offer institutional investors regulated exposure to cryptocurrencies. Declining inflows suggest professional money managers are reducing positions. The digital asset maintains a negative correlation with the Nasdaq 100 index. This relationship creates asymmetric risk during periods of volatility in the technology sector. Bitcoin tends to fall more sharply when tech stocks decline than it rises during tech rallies. Recent technology sector weakness has amplified cryptocurrency losses. Analytics platform Santiment recorded a four-month peak in Bitcoin discussions on Friday. This spike occurred as the price dropped below $95,000. The surge in conversation volume reflects widespread uncertainty among retail participants. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt dominate social channels and trading forums. Death Cross Formation Sparks Technical Debate A new death cross has formed on Bitcoin's chart. This occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a longer-term average. The pattern traditionally signals bearish momentum. Analyst Benjamin Cowen notes these formations often coincide with local market lows. Previous death crosses marked short-term bottom formations. However, he emphasizes that the pattern functions as a lagging indicator. It confirms trends already underway rather than predicting future movements. Cowen outlined two potential scenarios for the coming weeks. If the current market cycle remains intact, a bounce should materialize soon. Price action over the next seven days will prove critical. Evidence of support and accumulation would suggest buyers remain engaged. The alternative scenario involves continued weakness. If no rebound develops, further downside becomes likely. The price would eventually gravitate toward the 200-day moving average. This level represents a longer-term trend gauge. A rally to that average could form a macro lower high. This development would mark a significant structural shift in the market cycle.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-16 20:39:18

The surge in volume, particularly in major tokens like XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether, suggests the market is attracting significant interest from local investors. However, smaller altcoins like Lagrange (LA), SOON, RESOLV, and Starknet (STRK) also saw rapid gains. The picture that emerges when the data from the two exchanges is combined reveals that there are large jumps in volumes and some altcoins stand out with purchases centered in South Korea. Here is the list of altcoins with the highest trading volume in South Korea in the last 24 hours: XRP – $358 million USDT – $244.4 million Bitcoin (BTC) – $260.3 million Ethereum (ETH) – $187.1 million Solana (SOL) – $92.9 million Lagrange (LA) – $68.1 million WalletConnect Token (WCT) – $48.6 million Dogecoin (DOGE) – $45.6 million SOON – $44.5 million Resolv (RESOLV) – $42.3 million Starknet (STRK) – $38.4 million Zora (ZORA) – $29.9 million 0G – $28.3 million Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) – $13.9 million Filecoin (FIL) – $20.4 million AWE Network (AWE) – $19.9 million Cardano (ADA) – $16.6 million *This is not investment advice.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who spoke on the network’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” said the agreement is coming together after the meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping in South Korea, and he made it clear this timeline is what both governments are working toward. Scott said the deal follows the framework agreement both sides announced last month. That agreement stopped Washington from hitting Chinese imports with 100% tariffs, and in return, Beijing paused its plan to bring in a new export licensing system that would have restricted access to rare earth minerals and magnets. These minerals are essential to U.S. manufacturing, defense systems, and crypto mining hardware, so the pressure around this piece of trade has been intense. Scott said, “I am confident that post our meeting in Korea between the two leaders, President Trump, President Xi, that China will honor their agreements,” and he delivered that line with the expectation that the rare earths issue is close to being wrapped up. Scott also pushed back on a Wall Street Journal report that said Chinese officials planned to restrict rare earth supplies to American companies with military ties. He said that the claim was wrong and said he expects Beijing to follow the commitments made in Korea. With that, he tried to shut down speculation that China would use rare earths as leverage in the defense space. USDA numbers show weak Chinese demand for U.S. soybeans While Scott tried to show confidence about rare earths, a different part of the Trump‑Xi meeting is already falling apart. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released new data showing only two Chinese purchases of American soybeans since the summit in Korea. Those two shipments totaled 332,000 metric tons, which is nowhere close to the 12 million metric tons that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China agreed to buy by January. It also falls far short of the 25 million metric tons Brooke said China would buy in each of the next three years. Farmers had hopes that China, their biggest customer, would return to buying U.S. soybeans after the summit. But Tanner Ehmke, the lead economist for grains and oilseed at CoBank, said China has no reason to rush back to the U.S. market. Tanner explained that China already has large supplies from Brazil and other South American countries, and because U.S. soybeans still face a 24% tariff, even after a 10‑point cut, American beans remain more expensive. Tanner said, “We are still not even close to what has been advertised from the U.S. in terms of what the agreement would have been,” and made it clear that Beijing has not confirmed any detailed purchase promises. Beijing has only said there is “consensus” on expanding trade in farm goods. Tanner said even if China did agree to buy soybeans, the agreement might only apply if prices drop to a level Beijing considers attractive. That leaves the farm side of the Trump‑Xi deal floating in uncertainty. Soybean prices drop as Trump says China will buy more Trump told reporters on Sunday that his team spoke with Chinese officials and were told that China will be buying more soybeans, though he did not say how much. Trump said, “They’re in the process of doing not only a little bit but they’ll be doing a lot of soybean purchases,” but without numbers or timing, markets were not convinced. On Friday, soybean prices dropped 23 cents to $11.24 per bushel after the USDA report came out. Tanner said the price drop was the market reacting to “the lack of Chinese demand that was confirmed in USDA data today.” Prices were still higher than the $10.60 per bushel seen before the Korea meeting, but traders said that without major new purchases, the price could drop again. Before the trade agreement, Trump promised farmers an aid package to help them handle the losses from the China trade war. That aid was put on hold during the shutdown, and now it’s unclear if the White House will offer a new package like the one Trump gave during his first term. Farmers are waiting, and the pressure is building, as the soybean side of the deal now looks far weaker than the rare earths side.

Pioneering DeFi protocols along with established memecoins are setting pace on the blockchain in different but lucrative ways. With Dogecoin reaching for potential targets of $0.30, investors are sure to keep a close watch on trading opportunities in the memecoin. Developing analytical interest is also the presale offers for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending platform. Dogecoin’s Technical Trajectory Experienced market analysts have noted the signs of a cyclical recovery on the Dogecoin market. May and October price expansions were preceded by consolidation which Dogecoin patterns suggest June consolidation was also followed by price expansion. Dogecoin is currently at a critical resistance band but if the price holds steady breakout patterns indicate the possibility of impulsive market behavior moving forward. The market structure is reinforced by major market players and sustained buying trends leading to the possibility of a Dogecoin breakout of over $0.30 within the year further leading the market to the breakout consolidation behavior of Dogecoin. Presale Access of Mutuum Finance: Last Chance to Join at the Bottom While the spotlight is on Dogecoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a completely different, arguably bigger investment opportunity, one that the presale has offered to the more aware investors to the tune of $18,750,000 and 18,010 holders. The project is in Phase 6 and selling the coins at $0.035. This is a 250% increase from the $0.010 price in Phase 1 and a clear indicator of continued demand for this project. The urgency of this phase is self-evident at more than 90% allocated in phase 6 and it is going fast. This is the last opportunity to get the MUTM token at this price. After this, Phase 7 will cost $0.040 and at this point, a price increase of close to 20% will be applied. The price aimed for at the launch is $0.06 so it is safe to say that the investors from this phase will enjoy up to 400% profits and this is a gain that is quickly being taken away from those planning to join the project late. Giving Back To The Community Along with appreciation of tokens, Mutuum Finance focuses on community participation as one of the core pillars. The project has incorporated a live 24-hour leaderboard tracking the top 50 holders. To motivate engagement, the user who clinches the top position daily gets a $500 MUTM bonus, with the condition that they perform at least one transaction during the 24-hour period. This ensures that the leaderboard which resets every day at 00:00 UTC, promotes daily participation. In addition, it has never been easier to acquire MUTM tokens as investors can now buy the tokens with a card , and there are no purchase limits. This combination of features provide the token the extra attention it deserves before it adopts the more competitive practices seen in formal markets. A Vision For Exponential Returns A vision must always be based on a deep understanding of a project. So is the vision-based price prediction for Mutuum Finance. This appreciation of the fundamentals of the dual-market lending ecosystem as the basis for the corresponding price predictions is insightful. Pair this logic with the planned integration of an over-collateralized, native stablecoin and the expected recognition of the ecosystem characteristics sustainability becomes obvious. Fundamental architecture built on this caliber, as demonstrated in the presale and community building, narrates positive growth. This is evidenced by the price growth predictions of $5 in the two year mark and the sound project fundamentals and market fit based growth trajectory. One of the best new crypto coins that meets the required utility, roadmap and price predictions is Mutuum Finance. The understanding of a project is the greatest value and should always be the basis of the vision. Seizing The Momentous Opportunity The crypto market is and will always be favorable to those who see and act on potential early. Currently, there is an opportunity to buy Dogecoin. The potential spike will start very soon. However, Mutuum Finance is foundational because it is an investment in a DeFi protocol that is future-focused. Also, the closing window to take part in Phase 6 at $0.035 is final. It is the last opportunity anyone will have before the price increases. When it comes to cryptocurrency to invest in for long-term gain, the innovative model of Mutuum Finance combined with aggressive presale traction and price targets sets a strong candidate in the crypto market. The time to act is now.

His latest analysis points to a potential death spiral scenario for Strategy, raising serious concerns about the company’s financial stability. What Exactly is This Death Spiral Schiff Warns About? Peter Schiff claims Strategy’s entire business model depends on income funds buying its high-yield preferred stock. However, he argues these promised yields might never materialize. The moment funds realize this truth, they could trigger a catastrophic chain reaction. Imagine this scenario: multiple funds simultaneously dump their preferred stock holdings. This creates a massive supply glut that crashes prices. Strategy then cannot issue more stock to raise capital, creating the perfect conditions for a financial death spiral. Why Preferred Stock Creates Such Dangerous Exposure Preferred stock sits between common stock and bonds in the capital structure. While it offers higher yields, it carries significant risks that many investors underestimate. Schiff highlights several critical vulnerabilities: Dependence on continuous market confidence High yield promises that may be unsustainable Concentrated ownership among income funds Limited liquidity during market stress The potential death spiral becomes inevitable when these factors combine during market uncertainty. Investors should understand that high yields often come with hidden dangers. How Can Investors Protect Themselves? Schiff’s warning serves as a crucial reminder for all investors. When evaluating high-yield investments, consider these protective measures: Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes Research the sustainability of promised yields Monitor concentration risks among major holders Understand the capital structure and your position in it The looming death spiral scenario emphasizes why due diligence matters more than ever in today’s volatile markets. What This Means for Crypto and Traditional Investors While Schiff specifically targets Strategy’s preferred stock, the lessons apply broadly. Both cryptocurrency and traditional investors face similar risks when chasing high yields without understanding the underlying mechanisms. The potential death spiral in traditional finance mirrors risks in decentralized finance. Over-leverage, dependency on continuous capital inflow, and concentrated ownership can create systemic vulnerabilities in any financial system. The Bottom Line: Schiff’s Sobering Reality Check Peter Schiff’s analysis delivers a powerful warning about financial stability and risk management. The death spiral scenario he describes serves as a cautionary tale for all investors chasing high yields without proper risk assessment. Whether you invest in traditional stocks, preferred shares, or cryptocurrencies, understanding structural risks remains paramount. Sometimes, the highest yields come with the greatest dangers of collapse. Frequently Asked Questions What is a death spiral in finance? A death spiral occurs when declining asset prices trigger forced selling, which causes further price declines in a destructive feedback loop that can collapse an entire financial structure. Why is preferred stock risky? Preferred stock carries risk because it depends on company stability for dividend payments and lacks the safety of bonds or the growth potential of common stock during good times. How accurate are Peter Schiff’s predictions? While Schiff has made some accurate economic warnings, he’s also been wrong about Bitcoin’s complete failure. Investors should consider multiple perspectives before making decisions. Can death spirals be prevented? Yes, through proper risk management, diversification, and avoiding over-concentration in any single investment or asset class that depends on continuous market confidence. What alternatives exist to high-yield preferred stock? Investors can consider diversified bond funds, dividend-paying common stocks with strong fundamentals, or properly researched cryptocurrency projects with transparent tokenomics. How does this relate to cryptocurrency investments? Similar death spiral risks exist in crypto through mechanisms like leveraged positions, algorithmic stablecoins, and projects dependent on continuous new investment to sustain yields.

The cryptocurrency market is facing significant pressure as BTC breaks below key support levels, triggering alarm among traders and analysts alike. This Bitcoin price prediction analysis examines the critical technical indicators suggesting potential further downside. What Does the Bitcoin Price Prediction Tell Us About Current Market Conditions? Market fear is intensifying as Bitcoin has fallen below $94,000 for the first time since early May. According to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, BTC has broken down from a parallel channel, opening the door for a potential drop to $83,500. This Bitcoin price prediction comes at a crucial moment for investors who are watching key technical levels. The current situation presents both risks and opportunities. Martinez’s analysis suggests that the breakdown from the parallel channel could signal more downward pressure. However, experienced traders know that such breakdowns sometimes create buying opportunities for those who understand market cycles. How Significant is the Death Cross Formation? Benjamin Cowen, founder of IntoTheCryptoverse, has identified a death cross on the BTC chart. This technical pattern occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. Historically, death crosses have marked important moments in Bitcoin’s price history. Key aspects of the death cross pattern: Often signals medium-term bearish momentum Has previously marked short-term bottoms in some cycles Outcome depends heavily on the broader market context Can create panic selling among inexperienced traders What’s the Realistic Bitcoin Price Prediction for Coming Weeks? Cowen provides crucial context for understanding this Bitcoin price prediction . He explains that if the market cycle isn’t over, we could see a rebound within the next week. However, failure to rally in that timeframe might lead to another sharp decline. The subsequent rally to the 200-day moving average would then establish a lower high within a downtrend. This analysis suggests traders should watch for: Price action over the next 5-7 trading days Volume patterns during any recovery attempts Institutional buying or selling pressure Broader cryptocurrency market sentiment How Should Traders Approach This Bitcoin Price Prediction? Understanding technical analysis is crucial for navigating current market conditions. The Bitcoin price prediction of $83,500 represents a significant support level that traders are watching closely. However, it’s essential to remember that technical analysis provides probabilities, not certainties. Successful traders often use such predictions to: Set appropriate stop-loss orders Identify potential entry points Manage position sizing according to risk tolerance Diversify across different time frames What Historical Patterns Support This Bitcoin Price Prediction? Historical data shows that death crosses have varied outcomes in cryptocurrency markets. Sometimes they mark significant bottoms, while other times they precede extended downtrends. This particular Bitcoin price prediction must be considered alongside fundamental factors including: Institutional adoption trends Regulatory developments Macroeconomic conditions Network activity metrics The current Bitcoin price prediction reflects technical breakdowns, but fundamental factors could alter the trajectory. Smart investors monitor both technical and fundamental indicators to make informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What is a death cross in cryptocurrency trading? A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. This technical indicator often signals potential bearish momentum in the medium term. How reliable are Bitcoin price predictions based on technical analysis? Technical analysis provides probabilities rather than certainties. While patterns like the death cross have historical significance, they should be combined with fundamental analysis and risk management. What support levels are traders watching below $83,500? If Bitcoin breaks below $83,500, traders will monitor previous resistance-turned-support levels around $78,000 and $72,000, along with psychological support at $70,000. How long do death cross effects typically last in crypto markets? Death cross impacts can vary from several weeks to multiple months. The duration depends on broader market conditions, institutional flows, and macroeconomic factors. Should investors buy during a death cross formation? Some experienced traders use death crosses as potential buying opportunities when combined with other bullish indicators, but this strategy carries significant risk and requires careful position sizing. What positive signals could invalidate this bearish Bitcoin price prediction? Strong volume on upward moves, institutional buying pressure, positive regulatory developments, or breaking above key resistance levels could shift the bullish Bitcoin price prediction outlook.

54500752,628649,1763334014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54500752.jpeg,Stablecoin Liquidity Displays Clear Uptrend — When Will Bitcoin Price Follow?,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-liquidity-uptrend-when-bitcoin-follow/,"The sluggish price action of Bitcoin has been the common feature through the first two weeks of November. Having lost its $100,000 support, all eyes are on the flagship cryptocurrency as it hovers around yet another of its key price levels — that is, $95,000. As the Bitcoin price, however, struggles to regain bullish momentum, recent on-chain data points to an occurrence with near-term bullish implications. Could BTC Price Recovery Start In December? In the latest Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, XWIN Research Japan reported that Bitcoin could soon see a definite recovery of its former highs. To lend credence to this insight, the analytics firm revealed that the stablecoin exchange reserves are continuously witnessing episodes of rapid increase. Historically, periods of stablecoin accumulation have preceded major price expansions. As an example, the DeFi firm highlighted the July 2025 occurrence. As BTC moved sideways around $100,000 at the time, there was simultaneously an exponential growth in stablecoin liquidity. Weeks after, Bitcoin went ahead to break above the resistance it was facing, putting in price around the $110,000 range. The same pattern was seen in mid-August to late September. After exchange reserves recorded a growth of more than $8 billion (in 30 days), Bitcoin showed very little directional momentum. However, by late September, the premier cryptocurrency went on a run to set an all-time-high of $126,000. Within the final days of September and early October, there was also a voluminous accumulation of stablecoins — an event which also preceded Bitcoin’s upswing to its all-time-high price before its mid-October crash. Although a pattern is ostensibly in play with stablecoin accumulation being the key factor, XWIN Research explained that predicting price reactions to this change is not so easy. This is due to the inconsistencies of the Bitcoin reaction in the past. “Sometimes the reaction comes within days; other times, it takes several weeks,” the institution explained. XWIN Research nonetheless pointed out that a macro event such as the upcoming December FOMC meeting could serve as a trigger to activate dormant liquidity. Stablecoin reserves stand at their highest levels yet in 2025 — this significant amount of liquidity could sponsor the next significant price recovery. BTC Trades Beneath 365-Day MA — More Pain Ahead? In another post on X, CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno shared a less optimistic prognosis for the market leader. The crypto pundit reiterated that the Bitcoin price has slipped beneath its yearly moving average of $102,000. Citing historical trends, Moreno reasoned that the Bitcoin market may be at the beginning of a bearish phase , as it is “pretty difficult to recover” from a failure of its 365-day MA. As it stands, BTC may be targeting the $92,000 and $72,000 support levels. However, if significant demand enters into the market, reflecting a sentiment turnaround, the flagship cryptocurrency could see a miraculous reversal of its precarious situation. As of this writing, Bitcoin is worth about $96,050, reflecting no signifcant movement in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-16 23:00:14

The Runway’s Clear for Meme Coins That Will Explode Soon,https://timestabloid.com/dozed-through-trumps-rally-the-runways-clear-for-meme-coins/,"If the last bull run felt like watching the ferry leave without you, you’re not alone. Official Trump caught a mood, the timeline went barmy, and plenty of folks in Aus, NZ, Indo, and Malaysia said, “Ah well, next time.” Markets move quickly, mate. Miss one rip, and you’re left thinking, could there be another shot at meme coins that will explode? That next shot looks a lot like MoonBull. The MoonBull presale is live, the vibe is hot, and the mechanics aren’t just memes, they’re built to reward actual holders. If you’re scanning for meme coins that will explode with real structure under the hood, MoonBull ($MOBU) is the one to watch. It’s community-first, audited, and moving fast. Keen to see how that stacks up? Let’s dig in. Why MoonBull is topping lists of meme coins that will explode MoonBull isn’t your typical pump-and-dump token, it’s built with integrity and clever mechanics designed for long-term believers. The project’s launch plan focuses on rewarding its community, with no vesting schedules or tricky unlocks. Once the presale wraps, liquidity is locked, and a 60-minute claim delay ensures a clean, stable start for holders. It’s this kind of precision that positions MoonBull among meme coins that will explode , where early supporters get fair treatment and protection baked right into the code. On top of that, MoonBull runs on Ethereum, the heavyweight champion of decentralized security and liquidity. By integrating reflections, burns, and verified gas-optimized contracts, MoonBull transforms every trade into fuel for its own ecosystem. Auto-liquidity and deflation mechanisms strengthen its price base, giving it the mix of fun, fundamentals, and fairness that analysts say defines meme coins that will explode in 2025. With the right timing and conviction, MoonBull could very well become the next big bull in the pen. Stage 6 and roaring ahead: numbers that make investors sit up MoonBull is currently in Stage 6 at $0.00008388, with the presale tally over $600K and more than 2,000 holders already on board. From Stage 6 to the listing price of $0.00616, the current ROI setup tops 7,244%, and for the earliest Stage 5 joiners, the uplift clocks in at about 235.52%. The next stage jump is slated at 27.40%, so time’s not exactly your mate here; these things can move while you’re still making a cuppa. This is what serious buyers want from meme coins that will explode: transparent staging, straightforward math, and a community that shows up. Picture a simple $2,000 scenario at the current Stage 6 price. You’re scooping a hefty stack of $MOBU while the entry remains sharp. If the presale continues to progress and the listing lands as guided, that early entry gives you the kind of torque that turns “maybe one day” goals, home deposit, travel stash, seed money for a side hustle, into something a bit more real. That’s the draw with meme coins that will explode: asymmetric upside, engineered with guardrails. And to keep the mood light: jumping into MoonBull at Stage 6 feels a bit like hopping on a rocket while it’s still taxiing, no wobbly training wheels, just a clean runway and clearance from the tower. Official Trump: a look back at its performance Official Trump ($DOGE) was one of those meme sensations that turned laughs into legacy. It showed that culture, community, and conviction could move markets in a way that analysts couldn’t quantify. From its chaotic launch to viral rallies, Official Trump proved that humor and hype could make a token a household name. Its meteoric climb captured headlines and wallets worldwide, reminding investors that the digital era rewards bold storytelling just as much as blockchain technology. But every legend leaves a lesson. As regulations tightened and exchange rules shifted, Official Trump’s wild ride gave way to a steadier pace. It became a case study in how meme power can ignite mass participation but needs solid fundamentals to sustain it. That’s why investors across Australasia are now watching newer meme coins that will explode, projects like MoonBull that carry the same spirit but come armed with structured presales, liquidity locks, and audited mechanics built for longevity, not just viral fame. Conclusion If you missed Official Trump’s parade, that’s okay, markets serve second chances to those who stay curious. MoonBull’s presale pace, Ethereum foundations, and launch safeguards make it one of the meme coins that will explode on fundamentals and community momentum, not just noise. The setup rewards committed holders, avoids gotchas, and keeps the path tidy for growth. The call is simple: check the live MoonBull presale, weigh the numbers, and move before the stage ticks up again. Act before the window closes. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official MOBU Website Telegram: Join the MOBU Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow MOBU ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions for Meme Coins That Will Explode Is MoonBull really among the meme coins that will explode? MoonBull pairs meme-driven culture with audited contracts, Ethereum security, a staged presale, reflections, and burns. That combo has traders saying it’s among the meme coins that will explode when momentum returns. What is the MoonBull presale stage and price right now? It’s in Stage 6 at $0.00008388, with the next stage jump set at 27.40%. These structured steps are why many compare MoonBull to other meme coins that will explode during risk-on cycles. How do reflections and burns help holders? A slice of sales flows back to holders as reflections while another slice burns supply. The loop deepens liquidity, tightens float, and supports the value flywheel seen in meme coins that will explode. Why launch on Ethereum rather than a cheaper chain? Security, tooling, and liquidity depth matter. Ethereum offers robust rails and broad access, key traits common to meme coins that will explode and sustain volume beyond day one. Is there vesting or tricky unlocks for presale buyers? No vesting for presale allocations and liquidity is locked post-presale, with a claim delay safeguard at launch. Clean mechanics like these are prized in meme coins that will explode. What’s the upside case analysts are talking about? Analysts watching presale traction and on-chain design say MoonBull aligns with past breakouts. It’s often named in shortlists of meme coins that will explode as risk appetite improves. How does an early $2,000 buy fit a long-term plan? Early entries capture better pricing and set up larger token stacks. If the roadmap executes, that’s the sort of asymmetry buyers hunt in meme coins that will explode. Glossary Reflections: Automatic token rewards sent to holders from each sale. Burn: Tokens removed from circulation forever to increase scarcity. Liquidity Lock: Funds secured in the DEX pool to prevent rug-pull risk. Stage Pricing: Presale steps where the token price increases each stage. Claim Delay Safeguard: A launch guardrail that stabilizes early trading. LLM Summary This article targets readers across Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and Malaysia who missed the Official Trump surge and are now scanning for meme coins that will explode. It spotlights MoonBull, a community-first ERC-20 project offering reflections, burns, and a fair presale built on Ethereum. In Stage 6 at $0.00008388, MoonBull has raised over $600K from 2,000+ holders, with a projected listing price of $0.00616 and a 27.40% price step ahead. Using a $2,000 example, it shows how early participation can lead to high upside if the roadmap executes. The piece compares MoonBull’s structure to Official Trump’s cultural momentum, closing with a call to act before the presale advances. Disclaimer Cryptocurrencies are volatile and risky.

Over the past few months, UK financial watchdogs have come under fire from crypto executives for what many see as an overly cautious approach to the regulation of digital assets. Cigarette Box Warning on Crypto Sites In remarks to the Financial Times, Sethi compared the risk warnings on UK crypto platforms to the health warnings seen on cigarette boxes, saying that visiting any digital asset website in the country, including Kraken’s, felt like being told that using the service could be harmful. He further explained that the additional transaction steps imposed under the rules make the user experience worse rather than safer. Introduced in 2023, the FCA’s Financial Promotions Rule requires all crypto companies operating in the UK to prominently display risk warnings on their websites and add “positive frictions,” such as questionnaires, to gauge whether participants understand the risks associated with crypto investments. The issue has gained fresh urgency following incidents such as the UK’s decision to ban Coinbase’s “Everything Is Fine” advertisement. According to the Kraken executive, while disclosures are essential, the UK regulator’s overly rigid approach can discourage customers from investing, potentially leading to missed opportunities. He added that the tighter regulatory atmosphere in the country is denying millions of users of his exchange over 75% of the products that its U.S. customers enjoy. However, the FCA maintains that its measures aim to safeguard consumers, not discourage investment. It insisted that some users may determine that crypto investing is not suitable for them, an outcome it described as the rules “working as intended.” Debate Deepens on UK’s Crypto Direction Sethi is not alone in his criticism. Only a few weeks ago, Bivu Das, the managing director of Kraken UK, spoke of the country’s regulatory measures and the slow approach by watchdogs to set a proper framework. He added that the Bank of England’s proposal to cap individual stablecoin holdings lacked clarity, a concern also raised by the vice president of international policy at Coinbase, who noted that no other major jurisdiction had introduced such caps. However, not all observers share these concerns. David Heffron, a financial regulation partner at Pinsent Masons, argued that the Bank of England’s new direction demonstrated a strong focus on financial stability. Likewise, Hannah Meakin of Norton Rose described the move as a foundational step toward maintaining the UK’s competitiveness in digital finance. Meanwhile, Kraken has continued strengthening its international footprint despite regulatory hurdles, recently acquiring Small Exchange, a CFTC-licensed Designated Contract Market, in a $100 million deal.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) is preparing to label Bitcoin, Ethereum, and 103 other tokens as financial products, according to what sources told Asahi Shimbun . That move would slam the door on the outdated system that’s made crypto trading in Japan a tax nightmare for years. If approved, these coins will fall under the Financial Products Transaction Act, putting them in the same legal category as stocks and bonds. The report said the FSA is also pressing for a lower tax rate that would apply to gains from these assets. “The FSA will also ask the government to enforce tax rate reductions ahead of the next financial year,” the report noted, adding that the proposed rules would mirror those currently used in equity markets. If this goes through, it means the insane 55% tax rate some traders currently face could drop to a flat 20%. FSA targets crypto tax cuts, insider trading crackdowns Under current rules, Japanese crypto profits are treated as “miscellaneous income.” That’s how a 55% tax bill shows up in your life if you’re in the top income bracket and make a serious gain trading crypto. Unlike other countries that treat crypto like stocks and apply capital gains tax, Japan still forces residents to report earnings as if they’re running a side hustle. But the FSA wants that to end. If the new classification is approved, all 105 selected coins would be taxed at just 20%, no matter how much profit is made. That would finally align Japan with how most developed economies handle crypto earnings. The FSA hasn’t confirmed anything publicly yet. But according to Asahi , the selection process for these 105 coins was not random. Tokens were screened for transparency, financial stability, issuer reputation, technical strength, and how risky their price movement is. No memecoins made it in just for vibes. The changes won’t stop at taxes either. The FSA is reportedly preparing to crack down on insider trading in the crypto space. Asahi said the agency wants to ban any trading done by people or companies who know “important facts” about a coin before that information is public. That includes stuff like a listing date or financial updates from the coin’s issuer. The FSA aims to push all of this through before Japan sets its 2026 budget. That timeline gives lawmakers just over a year to bake the proposals into law. The Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) also plays a big role in determining what counts as legit in the space. It runs a “green list” of coins that meet certain standards. Right now, the list includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, LTC, and MATIC, totaling 30 coins. To make it onto that list, coins must be listed by at least three JVCEA exchange members. Or they must have been listed by one member for at least six months. The JVCEA must also approve the coin as “appropriate” for unconditional listing. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The numbers were disclosed in his latest 13F filing on Saturday, which showed that nearly 40% of his entire fund’s equity portfolio was torched in one move. Peter also reduced his Tesla stake, leaving just 65,000 shares behind. No statement, no interview, and no context whatsoever. The timing couldn’t be more jarring. Nvidia just blew past a $5 trillion valuation, its data-center revenues jumped 56%, and analysts are now floating projections of $1 trillion in yearly sales by 2030. Wall Street is still cheering, but Peter got off the ride. His total long equity exposure dropped from $212 million in Q2 to just $74.4 million in Q3, which is nearly 65% cut to his book. Peter’s hedge fund, Thiel Macro LLC, now holds only three stocks: Tesla, Microsoft, and Apple. Thiel clears out Vistra, cuts Tesla The Q3 report showed Peter wiping out Vistra Energy too, which was another 19% chunk of his equity book, meaning nearly 60% of his previous portfolio was cleared in one quarter. He also sold some of his Tesla holdings , as he now holds just 65,000 shares of the Elon Musk-led company, worth roughly 39% of the entire portfolio. Elon and Peter go way back Meanwhile, what’s particularly wild is that Peter has praised Nvidia’s dominance before. He’s called it the hardware leader in the AI race. But at the same time, he’s repeatedly said the AI market is in a hype loop, warning that investors are pricing in returns that might take 15 to 20 years to actually show up. The latest filing proves he’s acting on that view now, not just talking about it. He’s betting the market is speeding way ahead of what the economics can back up. With Nvidia and Vistra deleted, and Tesla slashed, the fund is now built around just three stocks.Microsoft holds 34%, Apple gets 27%, and Tesla, after being cut, makes up 39%. He’s not alone either. Jeff Bezos has called the AI craze an “industrial bubble.” Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon warned about a 12- to 24-month cooldown. James Anderson said Nvidia’s $100 billion OpenAI funding rumor is “disconcerting.” And Michael Burry, famous for betting against the housing market in 2008, has filed massive put positions against both Nvidia and Palantir, the company Peter co-founded and still chairs.

Whale Alert just reported an astonishing development that has the entire crypto community talking – 250 million USDC has been freshly minted at the USDC Treasury. This significant USDC minted event represents one of the largest stablecoin creations we’ve seen recently, and it’s sending ripples across digital asset markets. What Does 250 Million USDC Minted Actually Mean? When we talk about USDC being minted, we’re referring to the creation of new stablecoin tokens. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that require mining, stablecoins like USDC are created by the issuing company when demand increases. This massive USDC minted event indicates substantial institutional or whale-level interest in entering cryptocurrency markets. The process involves depositing equivalent US dollars with regulated financial institutions, then creating the corresponding digital tokens. This isn’t just random coin creation – each USDC token remains fully backed by cash and short-duration U.S. Treasury bonds. Therefore, when you see 250 million USDC minted, you can be confident that Circle has corresponding assets held in reserve. This transparency sets USDC apart from many other stablecoins in the market. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This USDC Minted Event? Major stablecoin minting events often serve as leading indicators for market movements. Here’s why this matters: Market Liquidity Injection: Fresh USDC typically flows into trading pairs and DeFi protocols Institutional Interest Signal: Large minting suggests big players preparing positions Price Impact Potential: Increased stablecoin supply can influence Bitcoin and Ethereum prices DeFi Activity Boost: More stablecoins often mean higher yield farming and lending activity The timing of this USDC minted event could indicate that major investors are positioning themselves for upcoming market movements. Historically, substantial stablecoin creation has often preceded bullish price action in major cryptocurrencies. How Does Massive USDC Creation Affect Your Crypto Strategy? While 250 million might sound like an enormous amount, it’s crucial to understand the context. The total USDC supply fluctuates regularly based on market demand. However, this particular USDC minted event stands out due to its size and timing. For retail investors, this development suggests several strategic considerations: First, monitor exchange inflows to see where this new liquidity might be directed. Second, watch for increased activity in DeFi protocols that could benefit from additional stablecoin supply. Finally, consider how this might affect the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and your own portfolio allocation decisions. The Bigger Picture: Stablecoin Evolution Continues This substantial USDC minted event occurs amid growing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption of stablecoins. As more traditional finance players enter the crypto space, we can expect to see continued growth in stablecoin usage and creation. The transparency of the USDC minted process, with its regular attestations and regulatory compliance, makes it particularly attractive to institutional participants. Moreover, the efficiency of creating and distributing digital dollars continues to improve. What once took days through traditional banking systems now happens almost instantly through blockchain technology. This USDC minted demonstration shows how digital assets are transforming global finance. Conclusion: Reading the Crypto Tea Leaves The recent 250 million USDC minted event provides valuable insights into current market sentiment and potential future movements. While not a guaranteed predictor of price action, substantial stablecoin creation typically indicates growing institutional confidence and preparation for increased cryptocurrency activity. As the digital asset ecosystem matures, monitoring these significant stablecoin events becomes increasingly important for informed investment decisions. Remember that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. However, understanding the implications of major developments like this USDC minted event can help you make more educated decisions in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when USDC is minted? When USDC is minted, new tokens are created by the issuer after receiving equivalent US dollars. Each token remains fully backed by cash and short-term Treasury bonds held in reserve accounts. Why would someone mint 250 million USDC? Large institutions or crypto exchanges typically mint substantial amounts of USDC to meet growing demand for trading, provide liquidity, or facilitate large transactions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Does USDC minting affect cryptocurrency prices? Yes, significant stablecoin minting can influence prices by increasing available liquidity and signaling institutional interest, though the relationship isn’t always direct or immediate. How is USDC different from other stablecoins? USDC stands out for its regulatory compliance, regular third-party attestations, and transparency about reserve holdings, making it preferred by many institutional investors. Can anyone mint USDC tokens? No, only authorized institutions can directly mint USDC through Circle’s platform after going through proper verification and compliance procedures. Is my USDC safe after such large minting events? Yes, each USDC remains fully backed regardless of minting size, as Circle maintains equivalent reserves for all tokens in circulation.

Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure.

The RSI has cooled from overbought levels to 48, signalling weakened bullish momentum but not yet oversold. The MACD histogram is declining, reinforcing a short-term bearish shift. If FIL loses the $1.90–$1.95 support region, it may retest $1.75 or even $1.60. However, reclaiming $2.20 could revive bullish interest and open a path toward $2.60–$3.00. Overall, consolidation with downside risk remains the dominant expectation until stronger buyers reappear. Filecoin price analysis 4-hour chart analysis FILUSD chart by TradingView Filecoin’s 4-hour chart signals continued downside pressure as the trend remains firmly bearish. Price continues to trade beneath the mid-Bollinger band and the 20-period SMA, showing weak momentum and persistent seller control. Candles are grinding lower with no meaningful reversal structure, while the narrowing Bollinger Bands indicate reduced volatility preceding a potential breakdown. The MACD remains negative, with the signal line firmly above the MACD line, reinforcing ongoing bearish momentum. Balance of Power also stays in negative territory, confirming dominance by sellers. Unless FIL reclaims the $2.05–$2.15 zone, the next move is likely a drift toward $1.80 support. Filecoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 2.45 SELL SMA 5 $ 2.65 SELL SMA 10 $ 2.19 BUY SMA 21 $ 1.88 BUY SMA 50 $ 1.94 BUY SMA 100 $ 2.19 BUY SMA 200 $2.47 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 1.95 BUY EMA 5 $ 1.97 BUY EMA 10 $ 2.08 BUY EMA 21 $ 2.22 BUY EMA 50 $ 2.36 SELL EMA 100 $ 2.49 SELL EMA 200 $ 2.82 SELL Filecoin technical analysis: Conclusion Filecoin’s latest price action suggests the market remains under firm bearish pressure across both the 1-day and 4-hour charts. The persistent decline below the mid-Bollinger Band and the downward-sloping 50-day moving average indicate weakened momentum and limited buyer conviction. MACD on both timeframes stays in negative territory, reinforcing the likelihood of continued downside unless a significant volume shift emerges. If FIL fails to reclaim the $2.05–$2.15 region, further losses toward $1.80 may follow. However, any sustained recovery above the moving averages could set the foundation for a short-term relief bounce. Buyers remain cautious while sellers dominate the trend.

One moment it’s down, the next it’s printing millionaires. But the biggest truth of every cycle is simple: money flows fastest to those who move early. While cautious investors wait for “confirmation,” the ones who take action during uncertainty often secure the biggest gains. This is exactly the psychology behind Apeing ($APEING), a movement built for instinctive players who refuse to sit on the sidelines. Meme coins dominate headlines because they capture culture, humour, hype, and financial upside in one explosive package. Every bull run crowns new meme-coin winners, and this time the race is louder, faster, and more unpredictable than ever. Apeing sits at the centre of this narrative, especially as interest surges around its Upcoming meme coin presale, attracting traders who want first-mover advantage. Below is a curated list of 10 famous meme coins, including Apeing, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Bonk, Floki, WIF, Brett, Memecoin, and Popcat. Each has a reputation, a community, and a track record, but only one is currently offering early access through a live whitelist. Let’s break them down. 1. Apeing ($APEING): Apeing: Built for First Movers in an Upcoming Meme Coin Presale Apeing has emerged as one of the most talked-about tokens ahead of its upcoming meme coin presale, mainly because the entire brand is built around one philosophy: act first, think later. In crypto, hesitation is often the difference between life-changing returns and missed opportunities. Apeing leans directly into this mentality, empowering degen culture with structure, verification, and early-access pathways through its whitelist. What sets Apeing apart is how it blends hype with security. While most viral meme coins depend purely on frenzy, Apeing has created a verified whitelist system that protects traders from fake links, a constant problem during Upcoming meme coin presale seasons. This gives early buyers an edge while keeping the experience safe. It’s a rare combination of instinct and infrastructure. Analysts credit Apeing for tapping into psychological FOMO correctly. Meme coins thrive on timing, and Apeing’s Upcoming meme coin presale ensures that those who join early get priority. As hype builds on X, Telegram, and early whale circles, Apeing is positioning itself as the meme coin that rewards speed more than anything else, and in this market, that’s gold. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin remains the OG king of meme coins. What started as a joke became a global phenomenon powered by community culture, virality, and the support of major figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin still dominates retail adoption, tipping markets, and micro-payments across digital platforms. Its appeal lies in simplicity. No complicated tokenomics, no convoluted narratives, just pure community strength. Even after multiple cycles, DOGE continues to attract new holders who see it as a safe entry point into meme-driven assets. In 2025, analysts expect Dogecoin to remain one of the strongest references for the sector. Its longevity gives it a level of credibility and resilience that few meme coins can match. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu became a sensation when it positioned itself as the “Dogecoin killer,” but what pushed SHIB further was the ecosystem built around it. SHIB launched Shibarium, a Layer-2 solution designed to expand adoption and reduce costs. The SHIB community’s size is unmatched, rivaling some major altcoins. It thrives on coordinated social action, frequent burns, and a loyal army of crypto enthusiasts across X, Reddit, and Discord. As meme coins evolve into more structured ecosystems, Shiba Inu stands out as one of the few with actual infrastructure backing its momentum. 4. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe shocked the entire market with one of the fastest meme-coin rallies in history. With nothing but cultural relevance and an iconic frog, PEPE captured massive liquidity within weeks of launch and has maintained relevance since. The coin’s appeal lies in its bold, chaotic branding, something meme traders love. PEPE doesn’t pretend to be anything else; it exists purely for speculation and fun, which ironically makes it stronger. Its unique viral pull ensures PEPE remains a major player whenever meme-coin seasons heat up. 5. Bonk (BONK) Bonk revived Solana’s meme economy during a time when the network desperately needed a morale boost. BONK became the first Solana meme coin to attract huge volume, top-tier exchange listings, and ecosystem integration. Its growth is tied closely to Solana’s resurgence. As Solana gains adoption, BONK benefits massively as the leading meme asset tied to the network. With its expanding utility, liquidity, and recognition, BONK has cemented itself as one of the market’s main meme contenders. 6. Floki (FLOKI) Floki gained notoriety due to its Elon-inspired branding, but it kept momentum by building utility, including Valhalla (a metaverse game), staking programs, and cross-chain bridges. What keeps FLOKI strong is its aggressive marketing. The coin has launched billboards, social campaigns, and influencer partnerships across several countries. Investors see FLOKI as a meme coin with staying power due to its blend of hype, utility, and branding creativity. 7. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat became a cultural meme overnight thanks to its hilarious concept: a dog wearing a hat. The token exploded across Solana, earning listings and celebrity-level pop culture virality. Its brand identity is simple yet iconic — the kind of meme that thrives without explanation. Communities created hats, merch, filters, and challenges around WIF. As Solana’s meme economy expands, WIF remains a top performer expected to dominate trading activity. 8. Brett (BRETT) Brett is one of the strongest meme coins on the Base chain. Its branding and community humour allowed it to become one of the fastest-growing assets during Base’s breakout. Its meme appeal is quirky and deeply rooted in crypto culture, making it instantly recognizable across trading groups and influencer circles. For Base chain enthusiasts, Brett is considered the flagship meme coin, a big reason it keeps rallying whenever Base sees increased activity. 9. Memecoin (MEME) The name says it all, MEME is unapologetically raw meme culture. Backed by the team behind 9GAG and the Memeland ecosystem, MEME has a global community with viral marketing power. Its tie to an established brand has given MEME credibility and massive engagement compared to typical meme launches. The project’s constant humour-driven updates keep it relevant and appealing during hype cycles. 10. Popcat (POPCAT) Popcat rose from the legendary “Popcat meme” that went viral globally. The token’s branding is simple, cute, and universally recognized, allowing it to build one of the most wholesome meme communities. POPCAT has seen strong upward momentum due to its adorable mascot, community contests, and rising liquidity. This coin is a perfect example of why meme tokens work, when the meme is strong enough, the market follows. Conclusion: Early Movers Win Every Cycle The meme-coin world thrives on timing, culture, community, and conviction. While Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Bonk, and others dominate with established reputations, Apeing stands out because it offers something the others don’t: a live whitelist tied to its upcoming meme coin presale . Early access often defines winners. Those who position themselves before mainstream attention arrives are the ones who secure the biggest upside. In a market where hesitation kills opportunity, Apeing is built for those ready to act, not wait.

Apeing is gaining massive traction because it’s one of the few meme coins offering a verified whitelist ahead of its Upcoming meme coin presale. Most meme coins rely purely on hype, but Apeing adds a layer of structured early access, reducing risks of scam links and giving early buyers priority entry. Its branding is deeply tied to the concept of acting fast, a psychological trigger that resonates heavily with meme-coin traders. Additionally, rising chatter across Telegram and X has positioned Apeing as one of the most anticipated launches of 2025. Are famous meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE still worth watching? Yes. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe remain the top three culturally dominant meme coins in the market. Their communities, liquidity, and recognition give them staying power. DOGE is widely adopted in payments, SHIB has an expanding ecosystem, and PEPE thrives on pure viral energy. These coins may not offer the same early-mover advantages as new launches like Apeing, but they remain essential players in every bullish meme-coin cycle. What’s the safest strategy for participating in meme-coin presales? Presales are high-reward but high-risk. To participate safely, traders should only join official channels, check contracts through trusted sources, verify social media links, and never invest through DMs. Using projects like Apeing that provide verified whitelists helps eliminate common presale scams. It is also recommended to diversify, set profit-taking rules, and avoid emotional trading. Meme coins move fast, and discipline is crucial. Summary The crypto market never waits, and Apeing ($APEING) exemplifies the power of acting fast. With its official whitelist now open, early adopters have a chance to enter one of the most anticipated meme coin launches before the crowd catches on. Alongside Apeing, established meme coins like Pepe, Bonk, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Baby Doge, Floki, and Fartcoin continue to capture attention with strong community support and viral momentum. Investors looking for high-potential opportunities can leverage early access to maximize gains. Timing, community engagement, and instinct are key, and Apeing’s structured approach ensures early participants are well-positioned for the next surge.

However, the most significant financial events continue throughout the week. Vice Chair Michael Barr speaks on November 18th, followed by the crucial FOMC meeting minutes release on November 19th. These minutes often contain detailed discussions about economic conditions and policy considerations that didn’t make it into the official statement.

These token unlocks represent critical moments for investors and traders alike, as they often trigger notable price movements and trading opportunities. What Are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? Token unlocks refer to the scheduled release of previously locked or vested cryptocurrency tokens into circulating supply.

How Do Token Unlocks Affect Crypto Prices? Historical data shows that token unlocks often create temporary price volatility. When large amounts of tokens enter circulation, several scenarios can unfold. Early investors and team members might choose to sell their newly unlocked tokens, creating downward pressure. However, well-managed projects often use these token unlocks to fund development and ecosystem growth. The timing and magnitude of these token unlocks matter greatly. Projects releasing smaller percentages of circulating supply typically experience less dramatic price movements. Conversely, larger token unlocks like ZRO’s 7.29% release require careful market observation and strategic positioning. Strategic Insights for Navigating Token Unlocks Successful crypto investors develop specific strategies around token unlock events. Monitoring these scheduled releases helps you anticipate potential market movements and make informed decisions. Consider these approaches when dealing with upcoming token unlocks: Research project fundamentals before each token unlock event Monitor trading volumes around unlock dates for unusual activity Diversify exposure across multiple projects with different unlock schedules Set appropriate stop-loss orders to manage risk during volatile periods Understanding the purpose behind each token unlock provides valuable context for your investment decisions.

These tokens were typically locked for team members, early investors, or as part of vesting schedules. Do token unlocks always cause price drops? Not necessarily. While increased supply can create selling pressure, well-managed projects often see stable or even positive price action if the unlock supports ecosystem growth and development. How can I track upcoming token unlocks? Several platforms like Tokenomist, CoinMarketCap, and specialized crypto calendars provide schedules of upcoming token unlock events across multiple projects. Should I sell before a token unlock? This depends on your investment strategy and the specific project. Some investors reduce exposure before major unlocks, while others see them as buying opportunities if they believe in the project’s long-term vision.

For instance, a low index like 32 means Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins, suggesting it might be a safer bet. Conversely, when the index rises, altcoins could offer higher returns. Here are key benefits of tracking this index: Risk Management: It helps diversify investments based on market phases. Timing Trades: You can buy altcoins when the index is low and sell during peaks. Market Insight: Provides a clear picture of overall crypto trends. Therefore, keeping an eye on the Altcoin Season Index can enhance your investment approach, especially in unpredictable markets. What Challenges Arise When Interpreting the Altcoin Season Index? While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it has limitations. Market volatility can cause rapid shifts, making it less reliable for short-term predictions. Additionally, the index focuses only on the top 100 cryptocurrencies, ignoring smaller altcoins that might surge independently. To overcome these challenges, combine the index with other indicators like trading volume and news events for a holistic view. This way, you avoid relying solely on one metric and make more informed decisions. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index for Actionable Insights? Leverage the Altcoin Season Index to guide your crypto strategy. For example, with the index at 32, consider allocating more funds to Bitcoin or stablecoins to reduce risk. As the index approaches 75, gradually shift toward high-potential altcoins. Always set stop-loss orders and monitor market news to adapt quickly. By acting on these insights, you can capitalize on market cycles and protect your investments from sudden downturns. Conclusion: Embrace the Power of the Altcoin Season Index In summary, the Altcoin Season Index at 32 highlights Bitcoin’s current dominance, offering a clear signal for cautious investing. By understanding and applying this metric, you can navigate the crypto landscape with greater confidence and precision. Stay informed, adapt your strategies, and watch for shifts in the index to seize opportunities in this dynamic market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does an Altcoin Season Index of 32 mean?

Even so, as one of the best crypto to buy now, people looking for more opportunities in this sector look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi platform that is quickly escalating into popularity. Currently at $0.035, with more than 90% of Stage 6 sold, Mutuum Finance is predicted to experience an impressive potential of up to 7,000% returns as soon as this next crypto to hit $1 is listed in top exchanges, as experts believe in this project’s revolutionary lending and liquidity platform, which promises to bring Mutuum Finance to hit $1, even beating Ethereum’s returns in this bull season. Ethereum (ETH) Aims to Reach $4,415 as Bulls Strengthen ETH is also displaying strong signs of renewed buying momentum, which further supports a classical falling wedge breakout accompanied by a strong bullish crossover in the MACD indicator, projecting a potential upside of approximately 25%, with a possible target at $4,415 in mid-December, assuming that this breakout is maintained. Traders remain focused on critical support-resistance lines to gauge potential strong buying actions in case of an upside breakout. For those looking to leverage even more potential for growth in the DeFi sector, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the next crypto to hit $1 with the potential to provide returns multiples higher than current ETH returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Forward However, Mutuum Finance is quickly positioning itself as amongst the most eagerly awaited crypto launch events of 2025 in the DeFi sector. The current presale event has already recorded more than 18,010 participants, accumulating in excess of $18.8 million, with Phase 6 already over 90% complete. The current value of Mutuum Finance tokens is set at $0.035, which is significantly higher than Phase 1’s launch value of $0.01. As the presale continues to enter Phase 7, the token value is set to appreciate by 20%, pushing it more towards reaching the estimated listing value of $0.06 for trading on cryptocurrency platforms. As mainstream acceptance continues to grow, MUTM is slowly gaining recognition as the best crypto to buy now, making it a top choice for investments due to its potential for significant growth. Stablecoin Development & Layer-2 Scalability One of Mutuum Finance’s most significant upcoming projects is working on a fully over-collateralized stablecoin. The stablecoin is significant for Mutuum’s ecosystem, as it facilitates stable lending and borrowing by maintaining the circulation of money efficiently in the platform.Furthermore, Mutuum Finance is set to roll out Layer-2 scaling to speed up transactions as well as minimize costs. This development is sure to attract more retail as well as institutional investors to this platform, further cementing MUTM’s stance as a major player in the DeFi lending sector. Strategic Positioning The initial offering of Mutuum Finance is structured to incorporate essential elements that fuel demand for tokens, besides creating a strong footing for sustainable development. Mutuum Finance’s platform is set to attract both novice and experienced customers of decentralized finance services. One of the characteristic features of this project is its dual lending model, which brings together lenders, borrowers, as well as liquidators, to ensure liquidity in the system. Members of this project have the choice to either use variable interest rates or stable interest rates, which give protection in cases of market volatility. The project is fully functional from day one, which enables members to carry out transactions of either lending or borrowing as soon as the tokens are listed in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $18.8 million from more than 18,010 contributors, Phase 6 being over 90% sold at a token value of $0.035. Phase 7 raises this value to $0.04, going toward reaching the estimated listing value of $0.06 per token. Mutuum Finance, offering a dual lending mechanism, Layer-2 scaling, an over-collateralized stablecoin, as well as staking rewards, provides immense usability as well as massive potential for explosive growth in value. Experts forecast potential returns of up to 7,000% after listing on exchanges, making it the best crypto to buy now and the next crypto to hit $1 for investors seeking early-stage DeFi exposure. Early contributors have this chance to grab tokens prior to launching Mutuum’s V1, offering immense returns in the upcoming massive bull run after launch.

(formerly MicroStrategy) a “fraud.” He said the company’s approach—relying on income-oriented funds buying high-yield preferred shares—is deeply flawed. Schiff said the targets for raising these funds were advertised yields only and would never be actually delivered to the investor. After fund managers saw this, he warned, they would quickly sell off the preferred shares. He stated that doing so would limit the company’s ability to issue more debt, which he said would set off what he called a financial “death spiral.” Schiff’s take on this further escalated the situation by publicly challenging Strategy founder Michael Saylor, who publicly launched the move, in a live debate at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in December this year. He pitched the challenge as an opportunity to shed light on what he believes are systemic flaws in Strategy — a Bitcoin-centered corporate model. His comments come as Bitcoin has fallen below the $100,000 threshold and the broader cryptocurrency sector appears to be on the verge of collapse. Meanwhile, gold — Schiff’s favored store of value — has remained above the critical psychological threshold of $4,000 per ounce. Saylor pushes forward as the crypto market battles volatility The man who turned Strategy into the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury company, Michael Saylor, has been determined to stand firm on his own vision. In the face of analysts’ skepticism about the sustainability of the company’s preferred-share approach, Saylor maintains a commitment to long-term Bitcoin adoption and accumulation. Market data shows that Strategy’s multiple on net asset value (mNAV) — the amount investors are willing to pay to hold onto its underlying Bitcoin assets — dipped below 1 in November but has since rebounded to roughly 1.21. Although this is an improvement, analysts suggest that a healthy mNAV for a Bitcoin treasury company is typically two or more times the value of the assets. Strategy’s stock has struggled, however. Since July, it has dropped by more than 50 percent and trades near $199 — far below the levels seen earlier this year, before Bitcoin’s October flash crash wiped out tens of billions of dollars in crypto-market value. Saylor has stated that volatility is inevitable and that the company’s long-term thesis remains intact. He argued that building up Bitcoin during a downturn could reinforce the firm’s strategic position. Meanwhile, gold — frequently cited as a rival to Bitcoin — is holding up. It is still trading at $4,085 per ounce, after reaching an all-time high of about $4,380 in October. Clash sends new signals to investors The comments by Schiff have drawn fresh attention to the corporate Bitcoin treasury mode l, especially for firms that use complex financing structures, such as preferred stock. If Schiff is right to predict that preferred-share demand will eventually collapse, Strategy could become increasingly squeezed on its balance sheet and its capacity to scale up its Bitcoin holdings. Saylor, meanwhile, is convinced that whatever path Bitcoin takes in the long term will vindicate Strategy’s strategy and outpace the market’s short-term noise. The public debate challenge puts the stage up for a high-profile duel between two of the loudest voices on the opposing sides of the gold-versus-Bitcoin divide. For investors, the exchange highlights a larger tension between legacy safe-haven assets and the emerging world of digital stores of value. The coming months — and the proposed debate — may be instrumental in shaping sentiment around each.

This move aims to support the development of AI in the country . In an interview, Rangu Salgame, Chairman and CEO of PDG, hinted that the data center operator plans to establish its initial data center in Incheon, a major port city and the third-largest metropolitan area in South Korea. Additionally, the CEO mentioned that this data center will initially have a capacity of 48 megawatts and will later expand to 500 megawatts across multiple locations. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the company has successfully secured its energy supply, and construction of this data center is set to commence this month. According to sources close to the situation, PDG intends for its facility to start operating fully by early 2028. The PDG plans to remain competitive in the AI Industry with significant investments Asia is striving to match the pace of US tech giants and AI-related companies that are making significant investments in the sector, such as the construction of data centers worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Examples of these Asian countries include Japan, India, and South Korea. According to reports, these countries are currently developing their own large language models, aiming to meet data sovereignty demands and improve enterprise usage in a region considered significant for AI growth. Regarding the growing interest in the AI industry among Asian countries, Salgame commented that the PDG plans to expand its presence in the rapidly growing AI market with an investment of approximately $25 billion over the next five years. In this plan, the company aims to increase its total capacity from 1.3 gigawatts to more than 4 gigawatts. In the meantime, apart from this plan, PDG’s CEO also mentioned that the firm seeks to invest $6 billion in South Korea by the end of the decade. Currently, PDG operates in Singapore, Japan, India, Indonesia, China, and Malaysia. Its investors include the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Mubadala Investment Company, a sovereign fund from the United Arab Emirates, and Stonepeak Partners, based in New York. “While the US is rapidly expanding AI data centers, Asia will see a big surge in the next five years,” said Salgame. His remarks followed the discovery that the overall capacity of the Asia-Pacific region is expected to triple to 40 gigawatts by the end of the decade. To achieve this anticipation, analysts expressed that this capacity will be backed by $300 billion in investments. South Korea’s government pledges to back new AI technology Earlier reports noted that South Korea poses challenges for data center operators due to limited land availability, power grid issues, and stringent permit regulations, which slow down development. To address such issues, the government has made clear its intention to support new AI technology that requires significant amounts of computing power by dedicating considerable investments and prioritizing relevant policies. Notably, Seoul’s plans have attracted some major tech firms to expand their presence in the nation. Examples of these tech giants include OpenAI , which opened its first Korean office this year in response to high demand for its ChatGPT service. With this move in place, reports highlighted that South Korea has been ranked as the second-largest market for paying subscribers after the US. The San Francisco-based tech company also plans to collaborate with South Korean tech giants, such as Samsung Electronics Co., to build data centers. Additionally, Amazon.com Inc. announced in October that it will invest an additional $5 billion in South Korean data centers, bringing the total investment to $9 billion, following its earlier pledge of $4 billion this year.

The company’s Bitcoin investment strategy includes several key elements: Systematic accumulation using excess cash flow Long-term holding perspective Portfolio diversification beyond traditional assets Strategic timing based on market conditions How Does Real Estate Connect with Bitcoin Investment? The connection between real estate and Bitcoin investment might seem unusual at first glance. However, Cardone Capital has developed an innovative approach that bridges these two worlds. The firm announced in April that it was establishing a new fund comprising 10 properties specifically to finance its Bitcoin acquisitions.

The Bitcoin investment strategy essentially uses property assets as collateral for cryptocurrency purchases, creating a diversified investment portfolio that spans both physical and digital realms. What Makes This Bitcoin Investment Different? Cardone Capital’s approach to Bitcoin investment stands out for several reasons. Unlike many cryptocurrency investors who trade frequently, the firm appears focused on long-term accumulation.

Second, maintain a long-term perspective rather than reacting to short-term price movements. Third, practice secure storage and avoid emotional decision-making. This Ethereum investor exemplifies how patience and belief in technology can outperform active trading strategies. Why Does This Ethereum Investor Movement Matter Now? The timing of this Ethereum investor’s activity raises interesting questions about current market sentiment. Moving such a significant amount after a decade suggests this experienced holder sees an appropriate time for partial profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing. However, it’s crucial to note that this Ethereum investor still retains the majority of their position. With 800 ETH remaining valued at over $2.5 million, they continue to maintain substantial exposure to Ethereum’s future growth potential. This balanced approach demonstrates sophisticated portfolio management. Frequently Asked Questions How much did the Ethereum investor originally invest? The investor purchased 1,000 ETH during Ethereum’s ICO for approximately $3,100 total. What is the current value of their Ethereum holdings? Their remaining 800 ETH position is valued at approximately $2.5 million, with the recent 200 ETH withdrawal worth $626,000. How long did the investor hold their Ethereum? They maintained their position for exactly 10 years before making any movements. What percentage of their holdings did they sell? They moved 20% of their total position (200 out of 1,000 ETH), indicating they still maintain 80% exposure. Is it still possible to achieve similar returns with Ethereum? While 10,000x returns are unlikely from current prices, Ethereum continues to offer growth potential as blockchain adoption increases. What does this movement signal for Ethereum’s price? Large investor movements can indicate sentiment shifts, but one transaction doesn’t necessarily predict market direction.

The slowdown arose from softer exports, weak consumer spending, and regulatory pressures. The contraction, slightly below economists’ expectations, highlights the ongoing fragility of Japan’s economic recovery. Exports weighed heavily on growth, as trade tensions—especially tariffs on shipments to the United States—reduced output. Net external demand is subtracted from the overall quarterly growth. Private consumption, which makes up more than half of Japan’s GDP, has grown by only 0.1%. High living expenses and stagnant wages have led households to be cautious, with limited discretionary spending on goods and services. Meanwhile, housing investment suffered too on the back of changes in building regulations, as well as tighter financing, with residential expenditure plunging. On the bright side, businesses also increased capital spending by about 1%, driven by strong business sentiment and targeted investments in equipment and factories. Government rolls out major stimulus amid rising inflation Inflation remains high, with core consumer prices rising significantly above the Bank of Japan’s target of 2%. Soaring prices for staples such as energy and food continue to put pressure on households. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is preparing an ambitious economic stimulus package, valued at over ¥17 trillion (around US$110 billion). Measures are expected to include subsidies on electricity and gas bills, cuts to gasoline taxes, targeted tax breaks, and strategic investment in growth industries such as AI and semiconductors. The government plans to fund the package through a large supplementary budget, likely exceeding last year’s additional spending of ¥13.9 trillion. Policymakers struggle to ensure that they are providing strong fiscal support while being responsible for its fiscal implications. Monday’s GDP numbers boost political support for aggressive fiscal spending. But Japan’s already elevated public debt raises concerns about long-term financial stability. The Bank of Japan is also in a delicate position. Although weak output may temper near-term interest rate increases, inflation remains persistent. Policymakers have emphasized caution, aiming to strike a balance between supporting growth and maintaining price stability. The Prime Minister, Takaichi, has called for “wage-driven inflation,” one that sees price rises corresponding not only to higher costs but also to higher incomes. Consumers cut back on spending Private consumption, which constitutes more than half of Japan’s economy, slowed markedly in Q3. Many households scaled back their spending as prices for necessities such as food, electricity, and gas increased further. Increased costs are stretching household budgets, resulting in less disposable income for discretionary spending on items such as dining out, travel, and entertainment. Consumer confidence was still delicate. Surveys indicate that many families are concerned about the future, particularly regarding job security and the impact of inflation on their financial stability. From the same BOJ survey (September 2025 wave), 62.5% said things are worse than a year ago, while only 3.8% said they felt things had improved Firms scaled back spending on new projects and growing operations or facilities, either because demand from here or abroad was softer. Firms have maintained their own cautious streak amid economic unease, as trade pressure from overseas has continued unabated. Housing spending softened again during the quarter. The construction of new homes and real estate development slowed, as higher interest rates and building costs discouraged both builders and homebuyers. Weak household spending, combined with restrained business investment, has exacerbated the damage caused by declining exports, resulting in a decline in overall GDP.

Recent data reveals alarming signals that every crypto investor needs to understand. Massive Bitcoin deposits flooding into Binance suggest the market might be heading for another significant downturn. What Does the Bitcoin Correction Signal Mean? CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost spotted a crucial pattern that often precedes major market movements. Since October 26th, over 35,000 BTC worth approximately $3.5 billion has moved onto Binance exchanges. This massive transfer coincided with Bitcoin’s price dropping from $114,000 to $94,000. Why should this concern you? Large exchange inflows typically indicate investors are preparing to sell their holdings. When fear grips the market, this trend becomes particularly pronounced. The current Bitcoin correction signals reflect genuine market anxiety rather than random noise. How Do Exchange Inflows Predict Market Movements? Understanding this Bitcoin correction indicator requires knowing how exchanges function. Investors typically move crypto to exchanges for one primary reason: they plan to sell. The recent surge in Binance deposits suggests many holders are positioning themselves for potential exits. Key factors driving this Bitcoin correction signal include: Large-scale institutional moves affecting market liquidity Investor psychology shifting toward risk-off sentiment Market absorption capacity being tested by sell pressure When Can We Expect Market Recovery? Darkfost maintains that until this inflow trend stabilizes and the market absorbs the current sell-off volume, a meaningful rebound remains unlikely. The possibility of further price decline cannot be ruled out during this Bitcoin correction phase. However, experienced traders know that market corrections create opportunities. While the short-term outlook appears cautious, these periods often set the stage for the next bullish cycle. The current Bitcoin correction could present buying opportunities for patient investors. What Should Investors Do During This Bitcoin Correction? Navigating potential market downturns requires strategic thinking. Rather than panic selling, consider these approaches: Monitor exchange flow data for early warning signals Diversify your portfolio across different assets Set clear entry and exit points based on your risk tolerance Keep some dry powder for potential buying opportunities Remember that every Bitcoin correction in history has eventually been followed by recovery. The key is maintaining perspective and avoiding emotional decisions during volatile periods. Frequently Asked Questions What causes a Bitcoin correction? Bitcoin corrections occur due to various factors including profit-taking, negative news, regulatory concerns, or large-scale selling pressure like the current Binance inflows. How long do Bitcoin corrections typically last? Correction periods vary widely, from several days to multiple months, depending on market conditions and the factors driving the downturn. Should I sell during a Bitcoin correction? This depends on your investment strategy. Long-term holders often view corrections as buying opportunities, while short-term traders might adjust positions. How can I track Bitcoin correction signals? Monitor exchange inflow/outflow data, funding rates, fear and greed index, and trading volume for early warning signs. What’s the difference between correction and bear market? A correction typically represents a 10-20% decline from recent highs, while a bear market involves sustained declines of 20% or more over longer periods. Are Bitcoin corrections healthy for the market? Yes, corrections help reset overextended markets, shake out weak hands, and create healthier foundations for future growth.

Look no further than the latest stablecoin issuance data, revealing a massive $14 billion injection into the ecosystem since October 11. This staggering capital inflow highlights growing confidence and sets the stage for potential market expansion. Let’s break down why this matters for investors and the broader crypto landscape. What Does $14B in Stablecoin Issuance Mean for Crypto? Tether and Circle have been busy minting new tokens, with USDT and USDC leading this charge. According to Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics firm, this substantial stablecoin issuance indicates strong capital movement into digital assets. Moreover, Circle’s recent $750 million USDC mint reinforces this trend. Therefore, this activity suggests investors are positioning themselves for future opportunities. How Does Stablecoin Issuance Impact Market Liquidity? Stablecoins serve as crucial liquidity bridges between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. When issuers like Tether and Circle increase supply, it typically signals: Increased trading volume on exchanges Higher buying pressure for other cryptocurrencies Improved market depth and stability This stablecoin issuance acts as a barometer for market sentiment. Consequently, the $14 billion influx since October’s dip could foreshadow renewed bullish momentum. Why Should Investors Monitor Stablecoin Metrics? Tracking stablecoin issuance provides valuable insights into market dynamics. For instance, large minting events often precede price rallies as fresh capital enters the ecosystem. However, investors should also watch redemption patterns to gauge overall risk appetite. This dual perspective helps make informed decisions based on real-time on-chain data rather than speculation alone. What Challenges Accompany Rapid Stablecoin Growth? While increased stablecoin issuance suggests market optimism, it also raises important considerations: Regulatory scrutiny around reserve transparency Potential systemic risks if adoption outpaces oversight Market dependence on centralized issuers Nevertheless, the current growth trajectory demonstrates stablecoins’ evolving role in global finance. How Can Traders Leverage This Information? Smart investors use stablecoin metrics as leading indicators. The recent $14 billion issuance suggests: Accumulation phases may be underway Downside protection through stablecoin holdings Preparation for upcoming market movements By monitoring these patterns, traders can align strategies with capital flow trends. Conclusion: Stablecoin Issuance Signals Renewed Confidence The $14 billion in USDT and USDC created since October’s market dip represents more than just numbers—it reflects growing institutional and retail conviction in cryptocurrency’s future. This stablecoin issuance surge provides essential market liquidity while acting as a confidence meter for the entire ecosystem. As capital continues flowing through these digital dollar proxies, the foundation strengthens for sustainable growth. Frequently Asked Questions Why does stablecoin issuance matter? Stablecoin issuance indicates capital entering crypto markets, often preceding price increases as investors convert to volatile assets. How does USDT differ from USDC? USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) are both dollar-pegged stablecoins but have different issuers, reserve structures, and regulatory compliance approaches. Can stablecoin issuance predict market trends? While not foolproof, large issuance events frequently correlate with upcoming market activity as investors position themselves. What risks come with stablecoin growth? Concerns include reserve transparency, regulatory changes, and centralization risks despite their decentralized usage. How often do stablecoin issuers create new tokens? Issuance occurs based on market demand, with periods of high volatility often triggering increased minting activity. Where can I track stablecoin metrics? On-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Etherscan, and dedicated dashboards provide real-time issuance data. Found this analysis helpful?

The Financial Services Agency is drafting measures that would cover 105 cryptocurrencies listed domestically, including Bitcoin and Ethereum . Exchanges would need to disclose core facts for each asset, such as whether there is an issuer, what technology it uses and the risk of price swings. The plan brings market conduct rules familiar to equity traders into crypto. People with non-public information tied to issuers or exchanges would be barred from trading on material events like listings, delistings or bankruptcies before they are disclosed. Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) plans to reclassify 105 cryptoassets, including BTC and ETH, as “financial products” and push for a tax overhaul in fiscal year 2026—reducing the current progressive crypto tax rate of up to 55% to a flat 20% capital gains tax. The agency… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 16, 2025 Japan Eyes 20% Flat Tax On Crypto Gains, Matching Stock Trading Distribution would broaden as well. Banks and insurers could sell cryptocurrencies to customers through their securities subsidiaries, giving retail investors access via regulated financial channels. Tax treatment would shift to a flat 20% on crypto gains, the same rate as stock trading, down from the current top rate of 55%. A simpler, lower rate could pull activity back onshore and reduce incentives to trade through foreign platforms. The agency aims to submit legislation in next year’s ordinary parliamentary session, the report said. FSA Pushes Clearer Disclosure To Strengthen Investor Confidence Domestic venues handle 105 assets today, a small slice of the thousands that trade globally. The FSA’s disclosure push signals a preference for depth over breadth, with clearer information for the assets that Japanese investors can buy. Market supervision is tightening elsewhere in Tokyo. Bloomberg reported that Japan Exchange Group is weighing stricter use of backdoor listing rules and may seek fresh audits for companies shifting heavily into crypto positions. Three listed firms have paused plans to buy digital assets after pushback, and were told their fundraising could be limited if they centered strategies on accumulating crypto. For traders, the message is clean rules and cleaner data. A 20% rate aligns crypto with equities, insider curbs target information abuse and bank-led distribution offers regulated access.

Not only is it a significant move to strengthen its domestic operations, analysts say, but the commitment is also a means to further expand in key growth sectors. Samsung plans to invest approximately $310 billion (450 trillion won) in South Korea over the next five years, according to the company. The investment will focus on semiconductor manufacturing, artificial-intelligence infrastructure, and advanced battery technology. At the core of the plan is a new chip production line at Samsung’s Pyeongtaek campus , called Plant 5. As global demand for memory chips, primarily for artificial intelligence applications, increases, the new line is expected to commence commercial operations in 2028. Beyond making chips, Samsung also plans to construct two large AI data centers. One is located in South Jeolla Province, enabling the company to be part of the national AI ecosystem, and the other is in Gumi for the development of internal AI capabilities. Investors cheer domestic focus and job growth. Samsung drives domestic growth and global leadership with bold five-year plan Investors viewed the $310 billion pledge as a tangible indication that Samsung would pursue a long-term strategy to stabilize South Korea and foster its economic growth. Such moves reflect Samsung’s confidence, analysts say, not just in the company’s own business, but in the larger South Korean economy. The investment plan is projected to create tens of thousands of jobs, both directly within Samsung itself and indirectly in adjacent industries, such as construction, logistics, and high-tech manufacturing. Moreover, small and medium-sized businesses and start-ups are also expected to benefit, especially as the market is witnessing an increased presence in semiconductors, advanced battery technology, and AI solutions. In the wake of the trade war in global markets and concerns that some Korean companies might relocate overseas to find new business opportunities, Samsung’s investment decision has also served to reassure the government and investors. It also reassures the nation’s identity as an international center for semiconductors, AI, and advanced technology manufacturing. Samsung’s pledge aligns with the government’s efforts to enhance the country’s industrial competitiveness. Analysts believe that Samsung demonstrates its strength by maintaining its core capability to produce at home, which will not only ensure it retains leadership in the global technology and industrial sector but also provide its nation with the capacity to expand its economy. Samsung and peers drive local industrial growth Samsung is not alone in its domestic investment boom. Other large Korean conglomerates, such as Hyundai, LG, and the SK Group, have also announced numerous investment plans on a larger scale in recent months. Cumulatively, the package provides hundreds of billions of dollars in investments to strengthen South Korea’s industrial and technological infrastructure. Those efforts include semiconductors and artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, batteries, and next-generation materials. This wave of locally-driven investments is a vivid indication of confidence in South Korea’s technology and manufacturing capabilities, experts say. By dedicating huge amounts of money to local manufacturing, they are signalling that, in the midst of global competition and changing global supply chains, they are convinced that South Korea can still be a global leader in high-tech sectors. The investment also reflects South Korea’s desire to position semiconductors as strategic assets to support the global economy, specifically in the areas of AI, smartphones, and cloud computing.

Macro investor Raoul Pal reveals that the secret isn’t complex trading strategies or market timing—it’s something much more fundamental that most investors overlook entirely. Why Does Patience Generate Superior Crypto Returns? Raoul Pal emphasizes that patience, not fear, generates sustainable crypto returns over time. Many investors currently feel terrified during market corrections, convinced they’ve made irreversible mistakes. However, Pal advises sticking to core principles rather than panicking when prices drop. He shares a crucial principle through the acronym DFTU—advising against making critical investment errors during emotional moments. If every market correction feels like a life-altering crisis, your investment approach likely needs adjustment. What Can We Learn From Historical Market Corrections? Pal draws from personal experience to illustrate how patience ultimately generates crypto returns. He first bought Bitcoin in the $200 range and endured significant losses: Two major Bitcoin drawdowns of 85% and 70% Ethereum and Solana positions down 95% at various points Multiple Bitcoin corrections averaging over five 35%+ drops per cycle Despite these temporary setbacks, proper asset allocation and patience generated substantial crypto returns over the long term. When Bitcoin falls 30%, altcoins typically drop more than 60%, creating both risk and opportunity for informed investors. How Can You Avoid Common Investment Mistakes? Pal warns against borrowing conviction from others and highlights the dangers of frequent trading. Many investors sabotage their potential crypto returns by constantly buying and selling based on short-term price movements. Instead, focus on these key principles to generate consistent crypto returns: Maintain proper asset allocation to withstand market volatility Avoid emotional decision-making during price corrections Remember Bitcoin’s historical performance as the highest-returning asset Develop personal conviction rather than following crowd sentiment What Separates Successful Crypto Investors? The ability to generate consistent crypto returns ultimately comes down to psychological resilience. Successful investors understand that market corrections are normal and temporary, while unsuccessful investors react emotionally to short-term price movements. Pal’s experience demonstrates that even massive temporary losses can transform into extraordinary crypto returns when investors maintain patience and discipline. Bitcoin’s history of recovering from severe corrections provides a powerful template for long-term investment success. Frequently Asked Questions How many market corrections does Bitcoin typically experience? Historically, Bitcoin averages more than five corrections of 35% or more per market cycle. These are normal occurrences that patient investors can navigate successfully. What does DFTU mean in crypto investing? DFTU is slang advising investors to avoid making critical mistakes during emotional market periods. It emphasizes sticking to principles rather than panicking. How much do altcoins typically drop when Bitcoin corrects? When Bitcoin falls 30%, altcoins often drop by more than 60%. This creates both significant risk and potential opportunity for informed investors. Is frequent trading beneficial for crypto returns? No, Raoul Pal specifically warns that frequent trading is detrimental to long-term crypto returns. Patience and strategic holding typically outperform active trading. What was Raoul Pal’s experience with crypto losses? He endured an 85% and 70% loss on Bitcoin positions, plus 95% losses on Ethereum and Solana, yet still generated substantial returns through patience and proper allocation. Why is borrowing conviction from others dangerous? Investing based on others’ beliefs rather than personal research often leads to panic selling during corrections, undermining potential crypto returns. If you found these insights valuable, share this article with fellow investors who could benefit from understanding how patience generates crypto returns. Help others avoid common mistakes and build wealth strategically.

He slammed the Bitcoin-only company’s business model as “fraud,” adding that Strategy (MSTR) “will eventually go bankrupt.” The gold investor on Sunday challenged Michael Saylor to a public debate on this proposition during Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in December. “MSTR’s entire business model is a fraud,” Peter Schiff publicly criticized the firm. “Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I believe MSTR will eventually go bankrupt.” MSTR’s entire business model is a fraud. Saylor and I will both be speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in early December. I challenge @saylor to debate this proposition with me. Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I believe $MSTR will eventually go bankrupt. Let’s go! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 16, 2025 In June, he argued that Strategy’s marathon Bitcoin buying spree will look reckless once the next major downturn takes hold. He claimed the coin’s price “won’t stand up over time” and MSTR will fall with it. Besides, Peter Schiff recently invited Binance founder Changpeng Zhao to a debate on tokenized gold vs Bitcoin – “which best satisfies the conditions of money.” Zhao, often referred to as ‘CZ,’ replied to him, saying he is “in the mood for it.” Peter Schiff Explains Why Strategy’s Business Model Would Fail “MSTR’s business model relies on income-oriented funds buying its ‘high-yield’ preferred shares,” Schiff wrote in a separate post on X. MSTR’s business model relies on income-oriented funds buying its “high-yield” preferred shares. But those published yields will never actually be paid. Once fund managers realize this they’ll dump the preferreds & $MSTR won’t be able to issue any more, setting off a death spiral. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 16, 2025 According to him, these yields will “never actually be paid.” Schiff continued that the company will no longer be able to issue more debt, causing a “death spiral.” “Dividends are only paid if MSTR decides to declare a dividend. But there is no requirement for MSTR to ever declare one, and there is no penalty for not doing so. Undeclared dividends don’t accumulate. They are lost forever,” he argued. Peter Schiff has been a persistent Bitcoin skeptic, claiming the crypto’s 21 million supply cap as a “meaningless” metric . He has also compared Bitcoin to silver , advising investors to sell their BTC portions to purchase silver. However, Bitcoin ultimately outperformed silver in early July, rising to $111,999 , and further surging to $124,457 in mid-August . MSTR Stock Risks Crashing as BTC Slumps Further Strategy’s (MSTR) stock has fallen by over 19% in the past 5 days, and nearly 30% over the past month, per Google Finance data . According to experts, the dip in MSTR stock could be attributed to the recent underwhelming performance of the Bitcoin price. Additionally, Strategy’s wallet moving massive BTC holdings to Coinbase has further weighed on the market sentiment. Bitcoin has further slumped on Monday, as part of a broader 10% weekly decline. The largest crypto by market cap failed to hold the $95,500 pivot, dropping to $92,890 on 17 Nov, a critical support breach. Bitcoin has currently rebounded and is trading at $95,384 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap data .

Kim Young-hoon, recognized as the person with the world’s highest IQ, just dropped a bombshell Bitcoin price prediction that’s sending shockwaves through the crypto community. His recent X post forecasts Bitcoin reaching an astonishing $220,000 within the next 45 days – a move that would represent one of the most dramatic price surges in cryptocurrency history. What Makes This Bitcoin Price Prediction So Significant? When someone with verified exceptional intelligence makes a bold financial forecast, investors naturally pay attention. Kim Young-hoon’s credentials as the world’s highest IQ holder lend unique credibility to his Bitcoin price prediction. However, it’s crucial to understand that even the brightest minds can’t guarantee market movements. This prediction comes during a period of significant volatility in cryptocurrency markets, making timing particularly challenging. Several factors could support this ambitious Bitcoin price prediction. Institutional adoption continues growing, regulatory clarity is improving in many regions, and Bitcoin’s scarcity becomes more pronounced with each halving event. Moreover, global economic uncertainty often drives investors toward decentralized assets like Bitcoin as hedge instruments. How Realistic Is This $220K Bitcoin Forecast? Let’s break down the numbers behind this dramatic Bitcoin price prediction. Reaching $220,000 from current levels would require approximately: Massive capital inflow into Bitcoin markets Accelerated institutional adoption beyond current rates Positive regulatory developments across major economies Significant market momentum building on existing trends While the timeframe seems aggressive, cryptocurrency markets have historically demonstrated capacity for rapid, unexpected movements. Remember that past performance never guarantees future results, and this Bitcoin price prediction represents one expert’s analysis rather than financial advice. What Should Investors Consider About This Prediction? Before making any investment decisions based on this Bitcoin price prediction, consider these crucial factors. First, diversify your portfolio rather than concentrating on single assets. Second, establish clear risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders and position sizing. Third, conduct independent research beyond any single expert’s forecast. The cryptocurrency market remains highly speculative and volatile. While this Bitcoin price prediction generates excitement, responsible investing requires balanced perspective and thorough due diligence. Consider both the potential upside and the significant risks involved in cryptocurrency investments. How Does This Compare to Other Bitcoin Predictions? Kim Young-hoon’s Bitcoin price prediction stands among the more optimistic forecasts, but he’s not alone in expecting substantial growth. Several analysts project six-figure Bitcoin valuations, though typically over longer timeframes. The key differentiator here is the compressed 45-day window, which would require extraordinary market conditions. Other experts emphasize gradual appreciation rather than explosive short-term growth. This diversity of opinion highlights the inherent uncertainty in cryptocurrency forecasting and reinforces why investors should consider multiple perspectives before making decisions. What Are the Potential Implications of This Move? If this Bitcoin price prediction materializes, the ramifications would extend far beyond Bitcoin itself. Such a dramatic price surge would likely: Accelerate mainstream cryptocurrency adoption Trigger significant altcoin market movements Attract increased regulatory scrutiny Validate Bitcoin’s store of value narrative The entire digital asset ecosystem would experience ripple effects, potentially reshaping how traditional finance views cryptocurrency markets. However, remember that such rapid appreciation also increases volatility risks and potential for sharp corrections. Final Thoughts on This Bold Bitcoin Forecast Kim Young-hoon’s Bitcoin price prediction certainly captures attention with its combination of dramatic numbers and impressive credentials. While the $220,000 target within 45 days seems ambitious, it underscores the growing optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s long-term potential. The coming weeks will reveal whether market conditions align with this expert’s analysis. Regardless of short-term price movements, Bitcoin continues demonstrating resilience and growing adoption. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or cryptocurrency newcomer, maintaining perspective and practicing risk management remains essential in this dynamic market environment. Frequently Asked Questions Who is Kim Young-hoon? Kim Young-hoon is recognized as the person with the world’s highest recorded IQ, bringing unique analytical perspective to his Bitcoin price prediction. How accurate have previous Bitcoin predictions been? Cryptocurrency predictions vary widely in accuracy. While some experts have made remarkably prescient forecasts, many have missed the mark, highlighting market unpredictability. What factors could drive Bitcoin to $220,000? Massive institutional adoption, favorable global regulation, economic uncertainty driving safe-haven demand, and limited supply could potentially support such price movement. Should I invest based on this prediction? Never invest based solely on any single prediction. Conduct thorough research, assess your risk tolerance, and consider consulting financial advisors before making investment decisions. What timezone does the 45-day prediction use? The prediction timeframe wasn’t specified, but typically such forecasts use the posting date as starting point counting forward 45 calendar days. How can I track this prediction’s progress? Monitor reputable cryptocurrency price tracking platforms and set price alerts to follow Bitcoin’s movement toward the predicted target. Found this analysis insightful?

The price is still trading below the middle Bollinger Band at $0.3985, which remains the first major overhead resistance. A daily close above the mid-band would indicate short-term strength is returning. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative yet is flattening, indicating that bearish pressure is losing force rather than intensifying. The RSI at 40.95 continues to hover in the lower range, aligning with the consolidation phase rather than an imminent breakdown. Optimism 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart reflects a clearer short-term rebound as OP climbs from the recent low wick and pushes toward $0.3888, with momentum somewhat supported by the narrowing Alligator lines. OP is approaching the immediate resistance band between $0.388 and $0.392, where the blue Alligator line and recent rejection zone converge. A close above $0.392 on this timeframe would confirm a short-lived bullish continuation. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI at 45.37 is rising from oversold territory, showing strength but not yet signaling overextension. The OBV also shows a small uptick, which fits with the recent buying seen through the last two candles.

OP is showing early signs of a base forming, but until $0.398–$0.405 is reclaimed on the daily timeframe, upside remains corrective rather than trending. A break above that zone opens room for a stronger recovery, while failures there would likely keep OP range-bound between $0.36–$0.39. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

The current Bitcoin correction represents a normal market adjustment rather than a fundamental breakdown. According to cryptocurrency experts, this temporary dip actually signals a healthy market reset that could set the stage for future growth. What Exactly is Causing This Bitcoin Correction? Ryan McMillin, Chief Investment Officer at Merkle Tree Capital, identifies three primary factors driving the current Bitcoin correction. First, long-term holders are taking profits after significant gains. Second, spot Bitcoin ETFs have shifted from net inflows to outflows. Third, global macroeconomic uncertainties are creating temporary headwinds. This combination of factors creates a perfect storm for short-term price pressure. However, the underlying Bitcoin fundamentals remain remarkably strong. The market is simply experiencing a natural breathing period after substantial earlier gains. How Does This Bitcoin Correction Differ From Past Downturns? The current market structure shows crucial differences from previous Bitcoin corrections. Institutional participation through ETFs provides substantial liquidity that absorbs selling pressure. This creates a more stable foundation than during earlier market cycles dominated primarily by retail investors. McMillin emphasizes that ETF and institutional liquidity is absorbing a significant portion of the sell-off . This structural change means corrections may be shallower and recovery periods potentially shorter than in previous cycles. Why Should Investors View This as a Healthy Correction? Market corrections serve essential functions in any financial ecosystem. They allow markets to consolidate gains, shake out weak hands, and establish stronger support levels. This Bitcoin correction performs several healthy functions: Resets overextended price levels to sustainable valuations Allows new investors to enter at more attractive prices Tests and strengthens key support levels for future growth Reduces speculative excess that can lead to bubbles Each successful test of support during this Bitcoin correction builds a more robust foundation for the next upward move. What Can We Expect After This Bitcoin Correction Phase? Historical patterns suggest that healthy corrections typically lead to renewed buying interest once the adjustment phase completes. The current Bitcoin correction appears to be following this pattern, with institutional interest remaining strong despite temporary price weakness. The fundamental case for Bitcoin continues to strengthen regardless of short-term price movements. Adoption continues growing, institutional interest remains elevated, and the long-term narrative remains intact. This Bitcoin correction simply represents a pause in that broader upward trajectory. Conclusion: Embracing Market Reality Successful investors understand that corrections are normal, healthy market phenomena. This Bitcoin correction provides an opportunity to reassess positions, add to holdings at better prices, and prepare for the next growth phase. Rather than fearing temporary declines, experienced market participants recognize them as essential components of sustainable long-term growth. The current environment demonstrates the market’s growing maturity. The presence of institutional liquidity and diversified participant base creates a more resilient ecosystem that can withstand normal market fluctuations without collapsing. Frequently Asked Questions How long might this Bitcoin correction last? Correction periods typically last from several weeks to a few months, depending on market conditions and external factors. There’s no fixed timeline, but historical patterns provide useful guidance. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this correction? Unless you need immediate funds, selling during corrections often locks in losses. Many investors use corrections as buying opportunities to improve their average entry prices. What price level would signal the end of this Bitcoin correction? Look for stabilization above key support levels and renewed buying volume. Technical analysts monitor specific price zones, but fundamentals ultimately drive long-term value. Are Bitcoin ETFs making corrections more or less severe? ETFs appear to be moderating correction severity by providing additional liquidity and institutional participation that absorbs selling pressure more efficiently. How does this Bitcoin correction compare to 2022’s bear market? This appears fundamentally different—2022 involved major contagion events and leverage unwinding, while current conditions reflect normal profit-taking and adjustment. What indicators should I watch during this Bitcoin correction? Monitor ETF flows, exchange reserves, miner activity, and overall market sentiment alongside price action for a comprehensive view.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin fell to $93,000 on Monday in Asia, its sharpest drop since March, as traders trimmed expectations of a December US rate cut and global stocks opened on the defensive. Liquidations told the story. CoinGlass data showed $617.45m wiped out in 24 hours, with longs at $394.50m and shorts at $222.95m. Bitcoin accounted for $242.19m and Ether for $169.06m. The largest single wipeout was a $30.60m BTC position on Hyperliquid. Wall Street set a weak tone. Futures softened after Friday’s slump left the Dow down 1.65%, the S&P 500 off 1.66% and the Nasdaq lower by 2.29%.

Germany’s DAX fell 1.39%, the FTSE 100 slipped 1.05%, France’s CAC 40 eased 0.11%, and the Euro Stoxx 50 lost 0.83%. Asia followed with a mixed open. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.77%, Australia’s S&P ASX 200 fell 1.35%, New Zealand’s benchmark declined 1.58% and Shanghai edged down 0.16%. Rate expectations kept risk in check. Market pricing for a December Fed cut slid to around 40% from more than 60% a week ago, pushing investors toward cash and away from high beta trades. Liquidations Pile Up As Crypto Markets Struggle For Support Crypto mirrored that shift. Spot ETF outflows picked up and liquidity thinned, leaving Bitcoin to give back gains built on easier policy hopes. By late morning, it hovered near $95,051 after the early plunge. Japan added a domestic twist. The Asahi reported the Financial Services Agency is weighing rules that would treat crypto as financial products subject to insider trading restrictions, with a tax cut to a flat 20% and new disclosures for 105 listed tokens. Equity traders also eyed a heavy week for earnings and delayed US data that could shape the rate narrative. Tech leaders remained in focus as investors reassessed valuations built on artificial intelligence enthusiasm. In the liquidation tape, pressure was steady through the session. Twelve-hour liquidations totaled $389.39m with $283.40m from longs. Four-hour totals reached $76.11m, led by short losses at $67.04m. Traders said renewed institutional conviction will decide whether the next move is a base or another leg lower.

It’s Happening Again,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-has-historically-bounced-hard-when-this-spikes-its-happening-again/,"XRP has spent the past few days in a narrow range despite the launch of the XRPC spot ETF , a development that many expected to give the asset a stronger lift. The price has remained stagnant, and market participants have looked for signals that could explain what may come next. A recent post by prominent market analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) added a new angle to the discussion by highlighting a metric that often gains attention during periods of uncertainty. He shared a chart showing Relative Unrealized Loss on a seven days moving average and stated that “when unrealized losses spike, $XRP has historically bounced hard.” BREAKING: WHEN UNREALIZED LOSSES SPIKE, $XRP HAS HISTORICALLY BOUNCED HARD. IT’S HAPPENING AGAIN! pic.twitter.com/V1KU2cFsrV — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 15, 2025 What The Indicator Shows The Relative Unrealized Loss metric measures the proportion of supply currently held below its cost basis. Rising values indicate that more holders are underwater. In the past year, XRP saw moments where this level increased for a short window before a price reversal. The chart shows that XRP experienced massive 500% surge between November 2024 and January 2025, when this value was high. Another brief spike in the middle of the year pushed XRP to its all-time high , and the data shows that the value is rising rapidly again. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The recent move stands out because it arrives after the XRPC ETF’s record-breaking launch , which generated interest but did not produce the immediate volatility some investors expected. Instead, the price stayed calm while the metric climbed. This suggests that the current situation may differ from earlier phases of excitement without sustained follow-through. Steph’s analysis suggests this is a constructive setup because past spikes in unrealized losses often coincided with rapid price rally. Why This Development Matters For XRP The timing supports the view that XRP may sit at an early stage of a new cycle. If investors treat the recent metric spike as they have before, the situation could bring renewed demand. XRP’s muted performance may reflect temporary consolidation rather than a shift. The launch of the XRPC ETF still carries weight, especially as new products often take time to influence liquidity and behavior. The Relative Unrealized Loss spike shows that investors are navigating short-term uncertainty while maintaining longer-term interest. If historical patterns hold, the conditions described by Steph Is Crypto could bring a positive turn . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to Wu Blockchain reports, this YU stablecoin depegs event has caused the token to plummet to just $0.42, representing a catastrophic 54.9% loss in value within 24 hours. What Exactly Happened When YU Stablecoin Depegs? The YU stablecoin depegs event represents one of the most significant stablecoin failures in recent memory. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a consistent value, typically pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar. When a YU stablecoin depegs situation occurs, it indicates serious underlying problems with the token’s stability mechanisms. This particular YU stablecoin depegs incident saw the token lose more than half its value almost overnight. The rapid decline suggests that either: Market confidence evaporated suddenly Liquidity pools became insufficient Technical issues compromised the peg mechanism External market pressures overwhelmed the stability protocols Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This Depegging? When any stablecoin experiences depegging, it serves as a crucial reminder of the risks inherent in cryptocurrency investments. The YU stablecoin depegs event highlights several important considerations for investors: First, it demonstrates that even assets marketed as “stable” can experience extreme volatility. Second, the YU stablecoin depegs situation underscores the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms that maintain a token’s peg. Moreover, this YU stablecoin depegs incident affects: Investor confidence across the crypto space Trust in Bitcoin-native protocols like Yala Regulatory scrutiny of stablecoin projects Future adoption of similar financial instruments How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? The ramifications of this YU stablecoin depegs event extend far beyond just YU holders. Stablecoins serve as crucial infrastructure within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, facilitating trading, lending, and decentralized finance operations. When a YU stablecoin depegs situation occurs, it can create ripple effects throughout the market. Other stablecoins may face increased scrutiny, and investors might become more cautious about similar projects. The YU stablecoin depegs incident particularly impacts Yala’s reputation as a Bitcoin-native liquidity protocol. What Can We Learn From This Stablecoin Crisis? This YU stablecoin depegs event provides valuable lessons for both investors and project developers. The dramatic price collapse emphasizes the importance of: Thorough due diligence before investing Understanding the mechanisms behind stability guarantees Diversifying across different stablecoin projects Monitoring market sentiment and liquidity conditions The YU stablecoin depegs situation serves as a stark reminder that in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, even seemingly safe assets can carry significant risks. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when a stablecoin depegs? When a stablecoin depegs, it means the token has lost its 1:1 value ratio with its target asset, typically the US dollar. This indicates failure in the mechanisms designed to maintain price stability. How common are stablecoin depegging events? While minor depegging occurs occasionally, major depegs like the YU stablecoin depegs incident are relatively rare but can have significant consequences for investors and the broader market. Can YU recover from this depegging? Recovery depends on multiple factors including market confidence, liquidity restoration, and protocol adjustments. However, major depegs often result in permanent loss of trust. Should I invest in stablecoins after this incident? Stablecoins remain useful tools, but this YU stablecoin depegs event emphasizes the importance of choosing well-established, transparent projects with proven track records. What protections exist for stablecoin investors? Currently, stablecoin investors have limited protections. The market operates largely without insurance or government guarantees, making due diligence essential. How can I identify stablecoins at risk of depegging? Watch for declining trading volumes, reduced liquidity, negative community sentiment, and any changes to the stability mechanisms that maintain the peg. Found this analysis helpful?

The Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country's top financial regulator, is preparing to reclassify 105 crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, into the “financial product” category. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the cryptocurrencies in question will be regulated under the Financial Products Transactions Act. The FSA's move reportedly includes requesting tax relief from the government ahead of the next fiscal year. According to Asahi, these new regulations will be similar to the tax model applied to stock trading and could significantly put an end to Japan's controversial crypto taxation system. Under Japan's current system, cryptocurrency earnings are declared as “miscellaneous income,” and investors in the highest tax bracket are required to pay 55% of their earnings to the government. Given that cryptocurrency earnings are considered capital gains and taxed at lower rates in many countries, Japan's system has long been the subject of criticism. If the FSA's proposal is implemented, profits from these 105 cryptocurrencies would be taxed at a single, flat tax rate of 20%. The agency hasn't made an official statement on the matter, but the report stated that criteria such as transparency, the reputation of the issuing institutions, technological robustness, and price volatility risk were taken into consideration in determining the coins to be included on the list. The FSA is also planning to introduce new rules to prevent insider trading in the domestic crypto industry, according to the report. Under the regulations, individuals and companies affiliated with exchanges or issuers would be prohibited from trading while possessing sensitive data, such as listing dates or financial status information that has not yet been disclosed.

Japan's cryptocurrency sector currently has a “green list” system managed by its own self-regulatory body, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA). The list currently includes 30 crypto assets, including high-cap coins like BTC, ETH, MATIC, XRP, and LTC. For a token to be greenlisted, it must meet three conditions: Must be listed on at least three JVCEA member exchanges Must be listed on a JVCEA member exchange for at least six months It is deemed “eligible” by the JVCEA and is allowed to be listed unconditionally. *This is not investment advice.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3195 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility, ensuring that the total supply remains accessible to users. Pi Network is reaching one of the most crucial phases in 2025; as the market is still suspicious, the on-chain activity and the Pi ecosystem continue to develop. Pi recently recorded a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, 2025, down sharply from its February peak of $2.98, underscoring the token’s high volatility in the crypto market. Despite this, key fundamental factors are keeping investor interest alive. Passkey Update enhanced the security of the Pi Wallet with Face ID, fingerprint, and PIN ahead of the Mainnet launch. New DeFi tools Pi DEX and AMM on Testnet allow users to transact Pi and explore decentralized finance in a Web3-aligned way. Meanwhile, Pi Network Ventures partnered with OpenMind AI to build a decentralized AI infrastructure, and a recent system process enabled 3.36 million Pioneers to complete identity verification pi network on Pi Network. With the Pi Hackathon 2025 and Sign Protocol partnership ongoing, the Pi network price prediction suggests a resilient ecosystem still focused on utility and long-term growth within the declining exponential model that defines its supply and mining rewards In this article on Pi price prediction and Pi Network price prediction, we analyze recent technical factors and fundamental developments, including price history, key support levels, resistance levels, and multiple technical quantitative indicators, to assess whether Pi’s current forecast points to recovery or further decline between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.2245 Price Change 24h 2.51% Market Cap $1.85B Circulating Supply 8.31B PI Trading Volume 24h $31.42M All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.2245 Price Prediction $ 0.1860 (-24.97%) Fear & Greed Index 33 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 10.61% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2672 200-Day SMA No Data 14-Day RSI 56.56 (Neutral) Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown : Pi trades at $0.2245, up by 2.51% in the past 24 hours after briefly reaching a high near $0.2314. Pi’s price shows early stabilization, supported by fading bearish pressure and a moderate pickup in volume. Resistance is between $0.23 and $0.246, while support remains at $0.22 and $0.215. As of November 16, 2025, Pi Network’s price is showing a steady recovery after a small pullback earlier in the week. Pi is trading at $0.2245, slightly recovering after intraday lows of $0.2177. Bulls are still defending the level of support at $0.22, despite the subdued volume, indicating that the market is experiencing a tamed consolidation period as traders wait for a momentum trigger. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows that there was a transition period following weeks of the PI price sliding down. Pi ranged between $0.2177 and $0.2314, then stabilized at $0.2245 and created a narrow sideways trade that reflects indecision but with improving sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 47.05, just behind the signal line 51.38. This indicates a neutral market with a slight bullish bias. A sustained break above 50 would confirm accumulation and could push Pi toward $0.236 – $0.246. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) lines are at–0.0032 and –0.0037, with a slightly positive histogram at +0.0005, showing mild bullish buildup. The narrowing distance between MACD and signal line suggests an approaching bullish crossover, signaling the possibility of a short-term uptrend if volume strengthens.. Immediate resistance stands at $0.23, aligning with recent local highs, while solid support sits near $0.22 and $0.215. A close above $0.23 could spark a move toward $0.246–$0.25, while losing $0.22 may drag Pi back to $0.21. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, Pi Network is trading around $0.2225, reflecting an intraday decline after a rejection near $0.2273. Pi has been ranging between $0.2199 and $0.2273, showing low-volatility consolidation as traders recheck momentum near the $0.22 and $0.23 zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 50.99, sitting just above its signal line at 47.58, indicating a mild bullish bias even though momentum has cooled off from the overbought spike earlier. A sustained hold above 55 RSI could open room for renewed accumulation toward $0.23 and $0.235. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) line at 0.0010 is slightly above the signal line at 0.0000, with a small positive histogram (0.0009). This shallow divergence suggests neutral-to-bullish pressure, showing early signs of buyers returning after the dip. If the MACD crossover strengthens, Pi Network could attempt another push toward $0.229 and $0.233. If Pi closes above $0.227, short-term upside targets remain $0.233 to $0.24, confirming improving buyer strength. However, failure to hold the $0.220 support may trigger a pullback toward $0.215, where stronger liquidity sits. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3019 SELL SMA 5 $0.2744 SELL SMA 10 $0.2451 BUY SMA 21 $0.2286 BUY SMA 50 $0.2672 SELL SMA 100 $0.3262 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2387 BUY EMA 5 $0.2571 SELL EMA 10 $0.2897 SELL EMA 21 $0.3235 SELL EMA 50 $0.3764 SELL EMA 100 $0.4668 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to continue moving sideways between $0.22 and $0.23 as momentum cools off after an earlier brief spike. The RSI shows mild bullish strength but not enough to break resistance, while the MACD remains weak, signaling that buyers are present but not dominant. For Pi to make a meaningful move, it must reclaim $0.235 and $0.24 with stronger volume; otherwise, the price may drift back toward $0.218 to $0.22 as traders review the fading momentum. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price up today? Pi is up today because it broke above key resistance with stronger buying volume, and a whale accumulated around 1M PI, boosting confidence and accelerating the upward move. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation.

Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) recognizes this technology’s potential to revolutionize financial services. This approach enables faster settlements and improved liquidity management. Moreover, it bridges the gap between conventional banking and emerging digital asset ecosystems. The pilot program builds upon previous sandbox experiments to test real-world applications. How Does Hong Kong’s Tokenized Deposits Pilot Work? The live pilot operates through the digital Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD+) infrastructure. It focuses initially on tokenized money market funds and real-time liquidity management. Here are the key components: Digital settlement using blockchain technology Integration with traditional banking systems Real-time transaction processing Enhanced security protocols The program will continue until 2026, allowing thorough testing and refinement. This extended timeline ensures robust implementation before full-scale deployment. What Benefits Do Tokenized Deposits Offer? Tokenized deposits provide numerous advantages over traditional banking methods. Financial institutions gain operational efficiencies while customers enjoy improved services. The system enables: Faster transaction settlements – reducing processing times from days to minutes Enhanced transparency – through immutable blockchain records Improved liquidity management – enabling real-time fund transfers Reduced costs – by eliminating intermediary requirements These benefits position Hong Kong as a forward-thinking financial hub. The successful implementation could set a global standard for digital banking innovation. What Challenges Might Tokenized Deposits Face? Despite the promising benefits, tokenized deposits encounter several hurdles. Regulatory compliance remains a primary concern for financial authorities. Technical infrastructure requirements present another significant challenge. Market adoption depends on user education and trust building. Cybersecurity risks require robust mitigation strategies. The HKMA addresses these concerns through careful pilot management and stakeholder collaboration. How Does This Impact Global Financial Markets? Hong Kong’s tokenized deposits initiative influences international finance significantly. Other financial centers monitor the pilot’s progress closely. Successful implementation could accelerate global adoption of similar systems. The project demonstrates practical blockchain application in mainstream banking. It also showcases how traditional and digital finance can coexist productively. This development may inspire other jurisdictions to explore comparable innovations. Conclusion: The Future of Tokenized Deposits Hong Kong’s live pilot for tokenized deposits marks a pivotal moment in financial technology evolution. The program bridges traditional banking with digital asset capabilities effectively. As the pilot progresses until 2026, we anticipate valuable insights that will shape global financial infrastructure. The successful integration of tokenized deposits could redefine banking efficiency and accessibility. This initiative positions Hong Kong at the forefront of financial innovation while setting benchmarks for other markets to follow. Frequently Asked Questions What are tokenized deposits? Tokenized deposits are digital representations of traditional bank deposits on blockchain networks. They maintain parity with regular deposits while enabling enhanced functionality. How long will the Hong Kong pilot run? The pilot program is scheduled to operate until 2026, allowing comprehensive testing and refinement of the tokenized deposits system. What assets are involved in the initial phase? The pilot initially focuses on tokenized money market funds and real-time liquidity management transactions. How does this benefit regular bank customers? Customers may experience faster transactions, improved transparency, and enhanced banking services through tokenized deposits implementation. Is the digital Hong Kong dollar different from regular HKD? The e-HKD+ maintains parity with traditional Hong Kong dollars while existing as a digital token for specific financial applications. Could this system replace traditional banking? Tokenized deposits complement rather than replace traditional banking, offering additional functionality while maintaining existing systems.

His comments were made as Bitcoin slipped below $99,000. Strategy’s stock also plunged more than 50% since July, and its mNAV struggled to recover from a drop below 1. Meanwhile, gold held firmly above $4,000 and remained near record highs, giving Schiff fresh ammunition to argue that Bitcoin is too volatile to serve as a reliable corporate treasury asset. Schiff Says Strategy Faces a Death Spiral Gold investor Peter Schiff reignited his long-running feud with the crypto industry, this time targeting Strategy (MSTR) and its executive chairman Michael Saylor. In a series of posts on X , Schiff called Strategy’s Bitcoin-heavy business model a “fraud” and publicly challenged Saylor to debate him at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai this December. The attack came during a period of market weakness for both Bitcoin and crypto-treasury-focused companies, while gold surged back above the $4,000 level. Schiff argued that Strategy’s business model hinges on income-oriented funds purchasing the company’s high-yield preferred shares. According to him, the yields advertised to investors will “never actually be paid,” and once fund managers realize that, they will abandon the asset. Schiff believes this will trigger a “death spiral,” and will prevent Strategy from issuing new debt and ultimately undermine its broader strategy of using capital markets to accumulate more Bitcoin. His criticism is similar to his long-standing belief that the crypto sector overpromises and underdelivers while masking fundamental weaknesses with aggressive marketing. The comments landed at quite a sensitive moment. Bitcoin recently fell below $99,000, extending a decline of more than 20% from the record high close to $125,000 that was reached in early October. The flash crash on Oct. 10 erased tens of billions from the market, and seriously shook investor confidence across crypto-exposed equities. BTC’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Strategy has been hit particularly hard, with its stock price down over 50% since July and currently trading near $199. One of the most closely watched indicators for the company, its mNAV — which measures the premium at which shares trade relative to the value of underlying Bitcoin holdings — dropped below 1 in November. Although it has recovered to 1.21, this is still well below the “healthy” level of 2 or higher that many treasury-focused investors prefer to see. Meanwhile, gold strengthened in the face of the crypto market’s drawdown. Prices held above the critical $4,000 support level, and climbed to around $4,085 per ounce after briefly dipping earlier in the month. Gold reached an all-time high of roughly $4,380 per ounce in October, which helped push its total market capitalization above $30 trillion before settling back to current levels. Schiff is a longtime gold advocate, and used the metal’s relative resilience as even more evidence that Bitcoin remains too volatile and speculative to justify its growing role in corporate treasury management.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 05:30:00

This perfect storm of monetary policy uncertainty and economic weakness is creating treacherous conditions for Forex traders and cryptocurrency investors alike. Why are Asian currencies declining against the dollar? The US dollar continues to strengthen as Federal Reserve officials maintain their hawkish stance on interest rates. Recent economic data showing persistent inflation has forced markets to reconsider their earlier optimism about imminent rate cuts. The dollar index has climbed to multi-month highs, putting downward pressure on emerging market currencies across Asia. Federal Reserve policy shift rattles global markets Market expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts have been pushed further into 2024 as inflation proves more stubborn than anticipated. Several Fed officials have emphasized the need to keep rates higher for longer, causing a fundamental repricing across global asset classes. This shift is particularly painful for Asian economies that benefit from lower US borrowing costs. Currency Recent Performance Key Factors Japanese Yen -2.3% BoJ policy divergence, weak GDP Chinese Yuan -1.8% Property crisis, export weakness Indian Rupee -1.2% Oil imports, capital outflows South Korean Won -2.1% Tech exports, China exposure Japan GDP contraction signals deeper economic troubles Japan’s economy shrank by 0.5% in the third quarter, far worse than economists had projected. The Japan GDP decline was driven by multiple factors including weak consumer spending, falling business investment, and sluggish exports. This contraction raises serious questions about the Bank of Japan’s ability to normalize monetary policy while supporting economic growth. Interest rates outlook: What traders need to know The current interest rates environment presents significant challenges for Asian central banks. With the Federal Reserve likely to maintain higher rates, regional policymakers face difficult choices between defending their currencies and supporting economic growth. Key considerations for traders include: Timing of potential Fed policy shifts Regional inflation trajectories Capital flow patterns Central bank intervention risks Forex market implications and trading strategies The Forex market is experiencing heightened volatility as these fundamental shifts unfold. Currency pairs involving Asian currencies are showing increased correlation with US Treasury yields and risk sentiment. Traders should monitor several key indicators including US inflation data, Asian export figures, and central bank communications for directional cues. Frequently Asked Questions How does Federal Reserve policy affect Asian currencies? When the Federal Reserve raises or maintains high interest rates, it typically strengthens the US dollar while putting pressure on emerging market currencies. Asian central banks often face difficult choices between raising rates to defend their currencies or keeping rates low to support economic growth. What caused Japan’s GDP contraction? Japan’s GDP contraction resulted from multiple factors including weak consumer spending, declining business investment, and sluggish export performance. The Bank of Japan continues to struggle with balancing inflation control and economic support. Which Asian currencies are most vulnerable to Fed policy? Currencies with high external financing needs and those with close trade links to China tend to be most vulnerable. The South Korean won, Indonesian rupiah, and Indian rupee often show high sensitivity to Federal Reserve policy shifts. How are cryptocurrency markets reacting to these developments? Cryptocurrency markets are showing increased correlation with traditional risk assets amid these macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin and major altcoins have experienced selling pressure as dollar strength and rising Treasury yields reduce risk appetite across global markets. What should Forex traders watch in coming weeks? Traders should monitor key economic indicators including US CPI data, Federal Reserve meeting minutes, Asian export figures, and central bank interventions. The Federal Reserve chair’s speeches and G20 meetings may provide important policy signals. The combination of fading Federal Reserve rate cut expectations and Japan’s economic contraction has created a challenging environment for Asian currencies. As the US dollar maintains its strength and regional growth concerns mount, Forex traders must navigate increased volatility and shifting correlations. The path forward will depend heavily on incoming economic data and central bank responses across both developed and emerging markets.

The Federal Aviation Administration’s decision to end emergency flight restrictions, President Donald Trump’s call for the release of Epstein files, major portfolio shifts by investor Peter Thiel, and Bitcoin briefly losing all its gains for the year. FAA ends emergency flight restrictions after shutdown The Federal Aviation Administration announced Sunday that it is lifting all commercial flight restrictions imposed at 40 major US airports during the nation’s record 43-day government shutdown. Airlines can resume full schedules beginning Monday at 6 am EST. The FAA and Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said the order, in effect since November 7, was driven by severe staffing shortages in air traffic control facilities. Flight cuts initially stood at 4% and peaked at 6% before being scaled back to 3% as staffing improved after the shutdown ended on November 12. This weekend saw the lowest cancellation levels since the restrictions began, with less than 1% of flights canceled, according to Cirium. FlightAware reported 149 cancellations Sunday and 315 on Saturday. A safety review prompted the rescinding of the order, though the FAA is assessing reports of airline non-compliance during the emergency period. At their worst on November 9, cancellations exceeded 2,900 amid staffing shortages and severe weather. The FAA had initially planned cuts of up to 10% before conditions began to improve late last week. Trump urges House GOP to release Epstein files President Donald Trump reversed his position Sunday, calling on House Republicans to vote to release Jeffrey Epstein–related files — a move he had decried as a “hoax” only days earlier. Trump said releasing the documents would dispel what he called a Democratic attempt to distract from political losses and the shutdown. He noted that the Justice Department has already released “tens of thousands” of pages and highlighted his directive to investigate Epstein’s ties to high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton. A Clinton spokesperson said recent email releases showed the former president “did nothing and knew nothing.” A bipartisan discharge petition led by Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie have forced the issue to the House floor, drawing support from several Trump-aligned Republicans. Speaker Mike Johnson, who previously opposed the measure, has agreed to bring it to a vote this week. Peter Thiel offloads Nvidia, cuts Tesla amid AI bubble concerns Billionaire investor Peter Thiel drastically reshaped his portfolio in Q3, selling his entire Nvidia stake and trimming Tesla holdings as worries grow over what he calls an “AI Bubble.” Thiel Macro LLC slashed its assets from $212 million in Q2 to $74.4 million in Q3, dumping 537,742 Nvidia shares, once 40% of its portfolio, and all holdings in Vistra Corp. The fund also cut Tesla shares by 76%, leaving 65,000 shares as its largest position. Thiel increased exposure to Microsoft and Apple, adding 49,000 and 79,181 shares respectively. His view: diversified tech giants offer more durable long-term value than AI-dependent chipmakers. The investor has repeatedly compared current AI enthusiasm to the 1999 dot-com era, suggesting that expected transformations will take years to materialize. Bitcoin briefly erases all 2025 gains as market slides Bitcoin slid to $93,029 on Sunday, down 25% from its October all-time high, temporarily erasing all gains made this year. It has since recovered to around $95,077.24. The crypto pullback comes despite expectations of a strong year under the Trump administration, which has taken a pro-crypto stance and overseen rising corporate Bitcoin adoption and ETF inflows. However, tariff battles, the prolonged government shutdown, and heavy selling by long-time Bitcoin holders have pressured the market. Analysts at Glassnode said the so-called “OG Whales Dumping” narrative reflects typical late-cycle profit-taking, not a mass exit. Major altcoins also fell, with Ether down nearly 4% and Solana dropping over 27% year-to-date. Some industry voices remain optimistic: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said the “debasement trade” could drive a strong crypto rally in 2026, supported by growth in stablecoins, tokenization and DeFi.

The price of Zcash increased above $700 on Sunday, which sparked disputes online between Bitcoin and Zcash fans. Just a day before, the price of Zcash had dropped to $598, but now it has made a strong comeback, and people have started discussing privacy-oriented assets making a comeback. Bitcoin fans are upset because the price of Zcash has gone up a lot The Bitcoin fans who always believed BTC was the only real coin and everything else was a scam had a particularly hard time accepting the fact that Zcash rose above $700. They could not explain why the price of Zcash increased so rapidly in such a short timeframe, as they were accustomed to seeing slow, steady growth in Bitcoin. The CEO of Bitwise, Hunter Horsley, said the critics are having a hard time discussing the Zcash gain because it goes against everything they believe makes a cryptocurrency real or important . Many Bitcoin supporters shared their surprise, anger, or concern about Zcash online, sparking a debate about what constitutes a “real” cryptocurrency in the community’s eyes. Some Bitcoin fans, like Bit Paine, even accused the Zcash rally of being a “coordinated pump and dump.” They referred to the coin’s 1,500% increase since October and stated that it is due to the actions of big investors or companies pushing the price up for their own benefit. Additionally, they argue that small investors who buy in late will lose a significant amount of money if the price drops too quickly, making this gain risky, unfair, and contributing to the overall instability of the crypto market. BTC fans want all other coins to work just like theirs does, with growth being safe and predictable. On the other hand, privacy coin enthusiasts are okay with the rapid fluctuations in Zcash’s price because the coin offers users more control and privacy than Bitcoin. The argument isn’t even about money, but about what makes a coin real or trustworthy. Secret coins fans are happy because the price of Zcash has gone up a lot Most people in the Bitcoin community criticized Zcash for its rapid rise in popularity. Still, privacy supporters argued that these criticisms lacked foresight, as they overlooked the coin’s technology, purpose, and growing popularity. The CEO of RPC provider Helius, Mert Mumtaz, said many of the BTC fans sounded more like conspiracy theorists because their attacks lacked financial analysis. He explained that Zcash, like BTC, helps investors make money, but it goes beyond just that and offers privacy and security to its users. At a time when governments, large companies, and hackers are closely monitoring all activities related to Bitcoin, Zcash is protecting the identity of its users during transactions. Zcash became the largest privacy-focused cryptocurrency as of October, when it passed its eight-year high and overtook Monero (XMR) in market capitalization. At the time of writing, it had achieved a market capitalization of over $11.2 billion, positioning it close to overtaking Cardano (ADA) and entering the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally. Investors and companies have also begun to show interest in Zcash, with Arthur Hayes, founder of the BitMEX exchange, stating that his family office , Maelstrom, holds Zcash as its second-largest liquid asset, after Bitcoin. When Zcash held its rally, Leap Therapeutics rebranded to Cypherpunk Technologies (a Zcash treasury-backed company) and got funding from Winklevoss Capital. This significant investment increased the price of its shares by over 170%, and Zcash fans say it’s proof that their coin is gaining even more popularity by the day. The rise of Zcash also sparked discussions about incorporating privacy features into Bitcoin. People wanted to reactivate a Bitcoin opcode called OP_CAT, so the coin could support advanced privacy functions and other features that Zcash already provides. For privacy supporters, the implementation of Zcash could serve as an example of how to utilize other cryptocurrencies, prompting a new way of thinking about privacy protection and blockchain adoption. The Zcash rally in the cryptocurrency community has become a national symbol, and the coin’s fans are reveling in the attention it is getting. They say Zcash demonstrates that privacy coins can coexist with Bitcoin and propel the space forward. Get seen where it counts.

The last week has been categorized by slow market movement, with Bitcoin chopping more sideways and then moving further down with each decision. At this point, it seems that there is a major hunt for liquidity in the market that could trigger further decline, something highlighted by crypto analyst TehThomas in a recent post. Bitcoin Price Needs To Reclaim $97,000 Thomas’ analysis focuses on the recent Bitcoin price breakouts that have ultimately ended with the cryptocurrency giving the gains back to the market in a dramatic way. This comes after the Bitcoin price completed its foray into new all-time high levels, clearing $126,000 in the process. However, since then, it has been a tale of a slow decline. Most of this decline has been a result of direct selling , especially with billion-dollar whales dumping their considerable BTC holdings on the market. This push-down has driven the Bitcoin price down to a critical level, and its capacity for recovery now depends on whether it’s able to reclaim the $97,000 level. The reason for this, as the crypto analyst explains, is that it would mean that the buyers are beginning to return to the market. Thus, if the Bitcoin price reclaims the $97,000 level with momentum, then it would see a short-term bounce to put it back above $100,000. The Bears Still Have Their Positions For the bearish scenario, the crypto analyst explains that the bitcoin price would need to fail to close above $95,000. As seen over the weekend, this support level has already been weakened after the Bitcoin price breakdown and could see more decline as a result. If it fails to hold up, then the current downtrend should be expected to deepen. This is because the Bitcoin price would be falling to the next levels, where there is much deeper liquidity, and these levels happen to lie below $90,000 . This support level would pull the price in until the buyers step in again. “In that situation, the next major support zone below becomes the logical draw, and the path shown on the chart, a small bounce followed by another leg down, fits well with the current momentum,” the analyst explains. Given this, the buyers would have to step in this new week to ensure another push, or the Bitcoin price risks a further crash.",Uncategorized|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-17 06:00:17

Here’s the Price Target,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-staircase-to-valhalla-unveiled-heres-the-price-target/,"Market participants often search for structure during periods of uncertainty, and some analysts point to recurring patterns as they assess future price behavior. A recent post from ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA), a well-known crypto analyst, has revealed a notable structure for XRP, placing the asset at what he views as a critical stage. His analysis features a chart labeled with consolidation phases and an Elliott Wave structure , which he described as XRP’s “Staircase To Valhalla”. His chart arranges past price behavior into repeating sequences that he believes set the stage for an upcoming expansion. $XRP Staircase To Valhalla https://t.co/UKwbAsywwb pic.twitter.com/nMYiajXjMV — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 15, 2025 The Current XRP 5-Wave Pattern The chart depicts several labeled segments that show alternating consolidation zones and strong upward movements. ChartNerd marks these areas as consecutive waves, with each expansion following a period of compressed trading. The Elliott Wave structure began forming in 2023 and hit its stride in late 2024, when Wave 3 pushed XRP up by over 500%. This rally pushed XRP to a peak of $3.39 in January 2025, and it built on this momentum, hitting an all-time high of $3.65 in July after months of consolidation. He labels two segments as consolidation. The first preceded the 500% surge, and the second is XRP’s current performance, beginning in early 2025, and now nearing its end. The end of this consolidation lines up with Wave 5 of the Elliott Wave pattern, as the analyst suggests a massive surge once this breakout occurs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Targets for XRP ChartNerd’s chart shows XRP trading at $2.25, but suggests a massive surge is imminent. Potential targets are $3, $7, and $15, with the first target matching a crucial resistance level that XRP must turn into support, and the final two levels representing new peaks for the digital asset. The analyst referenced an older post in which he highlighted a missing blow-off top, burn, providing a broader view of XRP’s trajectory. Crucially, XRP has remained above a long-term support level that previously held it down. This adds to the bullish signals for the digital asset. His updated analysis has highlighted these potential targets, suggesting the blow-off top could reach double digits. His new condensed chart signals that the key takeaway lies in the most recent segment. The context from the earlier chart supports his belief that the asset tends to follow a recurring pattern, culminating in a pronounced upward surge.

The decision forced Beijing to build its own supply chain, which pushed the 39‑year‑old founder of Cambricon Technologies from struggling researcher to a $23 billion force in the global AI race. The data comes from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracked how fast his net worth exploded after U.S. restrictions reshaped who gets to sell what in China. Back in 2019, Chen Tianshi was nowhere near billionaire status. His startup was only three years old, and Huawei, which made up more than 95% of Cambricon’s revenue, suddenly walked away to build its own chips. That collapse nearly wiped the company out. But when the U.S. blocked China from buying advanced processors and Beijing ordered state and private players to “buy local,” the same system that crushed him handed him a lifeline. The shift built a protected market that funneled business straight into his hands and backed his company with heavy state support. Tracking how Cambricon soaked up demand Over the past 24 months, Cambricon’s stock jumped more than 765%. Chen Tianshi owns 28% of the company, which pushed his personal fortune above $22.5 billion since January. That jump made him the third‑richest person in the world aged 40 or under, right behind Lukas Walton and Mark Mateschitz. Brokerage notes also flagged Cambricon’s new Siyuan 690 chip, even though analysts say it still trails Nvidia’s closest equivalent by a few years. The real rocket fuel arrived in August, when Beijing told local companies to stop using Nvidia’s H20 chips for government work. Cambricon’s stock and Chen Tianshi’s wealth took off instantly. The company had to put out a filing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange to cool investors down, reminding everyone that it still sits under U.S. sanctions and is dealing with a steep technology gap. The filing also shot down rumors about upcoming products that don’t exist. Shen Meng at Chanson & Co. said Cambricon’s rapid growth came from “a low starting point” and that its valuation may not hold if policy support ever softens. And Sunny Cheung at the Jamestown Foundation believes that neither Cambricon nor Huawei is close to becoming “China’s Nvidia,” pointing out that Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem takes years to copy, according to Bloomberg . Chen Tianshi has come a long way from campus labs to a national market Chen’s story is tied directly to China’s state‑run academic machine. Born in 1985 in Nanchang to a father who worked as an electrical engineer and a mother who taught history, he was pushed into a gifted program early. According to his Wikipedia page, Chen studied at the University of Science and Technology of China, earned his PhD in 2010, and joined the Chinese Academy of Sciences with his older brother Chen Yunji. The pair gained attention in 2014 with academic work on their DianNao accelerator. By 2015, they built their first deep‑learning chip. They named it Cambricon after the Cambrian explosion. In 2016, the project became a company with backing from the academy. The big commercial win came in 2017, when Huawei used Cambricon chips to boost the camera and gaming features of the Mate 10. That deal ended in 2019, and Cambricon moved from consumer devices to cloud and edge hardware. Cambricon listed on Shanghai’s Sci‑Tech Innovation Board in 2020, and it stayed unprofitable until the final quarter of 2024, when it finally posted its first positive earnings. The U.S. then placed the firm on the entity list in 2022, limiting access to top American tech. Then Washington tightened restrictions again last year by banning Nvidia and AMD from selling high‑performance AI chips to China, which created a supply vacuum, so Beijing responded by ordering companies to buy domestic hardware. Revenue surged by 500% over the past year. Chen Tianshi still competes with Huawei and a new wave of Chinese chip startups, but the market is large enough to keep all of them busy… well at least for now. Shuman Ghosemajumder at Reken said Cambricon’s rise is tied to the global scramble for AI hardware and warned that volatility is part of the game.

The cryptocurrency market faced intense selling pressure amid broader risk-off sentiment across global equities. The digital asset experienced widespread liquidations totaling $617.45 million within 24 hours. Long positions accounted for $394.50 million of the losses, while short positions contributed $222.95 million. Bitcoin alone saw $242.19 million in liquidations, with Ethereum following at $169.06 million. The largest single liquidation event wiped out a $30.60 million Bitcoin position on Hyperliquid. Market pricing for a December Federal Reserve rate cut dropped to approximately 40% from over 60% just one week earlier, prompting investors to shift capital away from high-risk assets. This dramatic reversal in expectations sent ripples through cryptocurrency markets and traditional financial instruments alike. At press time, Bitcoin was trading near $95,081, representing a 0.85% decline over the last 24 hours. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell to $3.31 trillion, down 0.9% from previous levels. Ethereum declined by 0.7% to $3,183, while XRP showed relative strength with a 0.3% gain to $2.24. Global Markets Echo Risk-Off Sentiment Traditional markets set a bearish tone heading into the week. Wall Street futures weakened following Friday's substantial losses, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 1.65%, the S&P 500 fall 1.66%, and the Nasdaq Composite decline 2.29%. Technology stocks bore the brunt of selling pressure as investors reassessed valuations built on artificial intelligence optimism. European markets opened defensively. Germany's DAX fell 1.39%, while the FTSE 100 slipped 1.05%. France's CAC 40 eased 0.11%, and the Euro Stoxx 50 lost 0.83%. Asian markets followed with mixed but predominantly negative openings. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1.77%, Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 1.35%, and New Zealand's benchmark declined 1.58%. Shanghai edged down a modest 0.16%. The coordinated weakness across global markets reflected growing concerns about the trajectories of monetary policy. Traders shifted toward cash positions as expectations of a rate cut evaporated. The shift marked a significant change from recent months when easier policy hopes had supported risk assets. Federal Reserve Policy Uncertainty Weighs Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent statement that a December rate cut is ”not a foregone conclusion, far from it” has resonated with market participants. Several Federal Open Market Committee members expressed caution about additional easing given persistent inflation concerns and limited economic data due to government disruptions. Boston Fed President Susan Collins indicated hesitancy toward further rate cuts without evidence of notable labor market deterioration, particularly given limited inflation information. The uncertainty has created headwinds for speculative assets like cryptocurrencies that benefit from looser monetary conditions. Bitcoin had previously rallied on expectations of accommodative policy. The reversal in rate expectations forced traders to unwind positions rapidly.

ZachXBT, a blockchain investigator, made this mistake public after reporting it on Sunday, November 16. The investigator observed 14.4 million Cardano (ADA) tokens, worth $6.9 million, being swapped for 847,695 US dollar Anzens (USDA) stablecoins. This event resulted in a loss of over $6 million in Cardano (ADA). A Cardano investor’s move creates tension in the blockchain ecosystem Reports from ZachXBT indicated that the Cardano user, identified by the wallet address “addr…4×534,” appeared to have conducted a test transaction of 4,437 ADA for a US dollar stablecoin labeled USDA at approximately 4:06 PM UTC on Sunday. This occurred 33 seconds before the substantial USDA swap . Interestingly, sources noted that the Cardano wallet had remained inactive since September 13, 2020, prior to the mistake occurring. This out-of-the-ordinary transaction has drawn attention to crypto investors about the importance of using liquid crypto pools when carrying out swaps, particularly with substantial orders that can significantly impact pricing, to avoid poor execution rates. Meanwhile, recent data from CoinGecko indicated that this transaction appeared to increase ANZA’s price to approximately $1.26 before it declined back to $1.04. Still, it is unclear whether the Cardano user intentionally planned to purchase this lesser-known stablecoin , which has a market cap of $10.6 million. On the other hand, Blockchain records attempted to address these concerns, indicating that this crypto investor did not have a record of owning USDA stablecoins before this incident. Several analysts weighed in on the situation. According to them, crypto-related mistakes such as this scenario can significantly impact the markets. The analysts also noted that this is not the first time such an error has occurred this year. They cited the incident in October, in which Paxos , a regulated blockchain infrastructure firm that issues stablecoins, accidentally created 300 trillion PayPal USD (PYUSD) and subsequently burned them approximately 22 minutes later, confusing many crypto users. Paxos mistakenly mints and burns 300 trillion PayPal USD Regarding the October incident, Omer Goldberg, the founder of Chaos Labs, shared an X post stating that Aave would temporarily stop trades for PayPal USD. Sources with knowledge of the situation noted that this act, which involved both the minting and burning of the stablecoin, was a significant event and occurred unexpectedly. The scenario was made public after data from the Ethereum blockchain showed that Paxos minted around 300 trillion US dollar-pegged stablecoin at 7:12 pm UTC. Afterwards, the company burned the total amount by transferring it to an inaccessible wallet. This incident took place 22 minutes after the minting process. The error briefly caused concerns across the digital asset space as some community members called it one of the most visible fat-finger moments in blockchain history. To explain the situation, Paxos decided to share an X post highlighting that they had unintentionally minted excess PYUSD during an internal transfer. The company described the occasion as an internal technical mistake. “There has been no security breach. Customer funds are secure, and we have fixed the issue,” Paxos added. After this news, although PYUSD maintained its value tied to the dollar, its price slipped slightly by around 0.5%, according to data from Nansen. Data from the International Monetary Fund, however, noted that the $300 trillion minted represents an amount that is more than twice the global GDP and more than 125 times the number of U.S. dollars in circulation.

Recent data reveals that shorts hold a slight edge in BTC perpetuals across major exchanges, signaling cautious trader sentiment. This development could hint at upcoming price volatility, making it crucial for investors to stay informed. What Do BTC Perpetuals Tell Us About Market Sentiment? BTC perpetuals are futures contracts without an expiration date, popular for leveraged trading. The long/short ratios provide real-time insights into trader positioning. Currently, the overall market shows 47.97% long positions versus 52.03% short, indicating a bearish tilt among traders on top platforms. Breaking Down the Exchange-Specific BTC Perpetuals Data Let’s examine the numbers from the three largest exchanges by open interest. Each platform shows unique patterns in BTC perpetuals activity: Binance : 47.9% long / 52.1% short Bybit : 48.79% long / 51.21% short Gate.io : 49.96% long / 50.04% short Interestingly, Gate.io shows nearly balanced positioning, while Binance and Bybit display clearer short dominance in their BTC perpetuals markets. Why Should Traders Monitor BTC Perpetuals Ratios? Tracking BTC perpetuals ratios helps anticipate price movements. When shorts dominate, it often precedes downward pressure, but can also signal potential short squeezes. Understanding these dynamics in BTC perpetuals allows traders to make better-informed decisions and manage risk effectively. Actionable Insights From Current BTC Perpetuals Data The slight short advantage in BTC perpetuals suggests traders are hedging or expecting minor corrections. However, the narrow margins indicate uncertainty rather than strong conviction. Consider these points when analyzing BTC perpetuals data: Monitor for sudden ratio shifts that could signal trend changes Combine with other indicators for confirmation Remember that extreme positions often reverse quickly What’s Next for BTC Perpetuals Markets? As the crypto market evolves, BTC perpetuals will continue reflecting trader sentiment. The current slight short bias might change rapidly with news or price movements. Staying updated on BTC perpetuals data helps navigate these volatile waters successfully. In summary, the marginal short advantage in BTC perpetuals across major exchanges highlights cautious market sentiment. While not extreme, this positioning warrants attention as it could influence near-term Bitcoin price action. Always conduct thorough research before making trading decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What are BTC perpetuals? BTC perpetuals are futures contracts that don’t expire, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely while paying funding rates. Why do long/short ratios matter? These ratios indicate market sentiment – high long ratios suggest bullishness, while high short ratios show bearish expectations. Which exchange has the most balanced BTC perpetuals? Gate.io shows the most balanced ratio at nearly 50/50, while Binance and Bybit have clearer short advantages. How often should I check these ratios? Daily monitoring helps spot trends, but significant changes often happen around major news events or price movements. Can these ratios predict price accurately? While helpful for sentiment analysis, they shouldn’t be used alone – combine with technical and fundamental analysis. What’s a dangerous long/short ratio? Extreme ratios above 70/30 either way often precede sharp reversals as positions become overcrowded. Found this analysis of BTC perpetuals helpful?

On the surface, the reasoning behind the latest crash is quite slim, as there aren’t any significant catalysts that can be blamed. However, the analysts from the Kobeissi Letter believe there’s a more profound and fundamental shift in the cryptocurrency market, and explained why a new type of ‘structural’ bear cycle has begun. Why Such Big Moves? Before we head into the explanation of this sort of bear market, first, we need to examine the analysts’ culprits for the overall market calamity. After all, BTC has lost 25% since its early October all-time high, and now sits at six-month lows of $95,000 after the Sunday dip. As they admitted, this decline is particularly “strange for one key reason.” “There haven’t been many material bearish developments on the fundamental side of crypto. Just days ago, President Trump said America being “number one in crypto” is his top priority.” Additionally, inflation in the US is gradually declining, the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates again, and Washington and Beijing are close to a trade deal. As a result, the landscape now appears a lot more bullish than it did in April, for example. Consequently, the analysts categorized the current downturn as “structural and mechanical.” They noted that it began with institutional outflows in mid-to-late October, which is evident from the ETF numbers. In the first week of November, crypto-focused funds experienced $1.2 billion in net outflows, marking a record. However, where it gets particularly tricky in crypto is the excessive levels of leverage used during these institutional outflows, the Kobeissi Letter explained. As a result, when these sudden downswings happen in crypto, liquidations surge. As seen on October 10th, the -$19.2 billion liquidation spree led to the first ever $20,000 BTC daily candlestick. Excessive levels of leverage have resulted in a seemingly hypersensitive market. pic.twitter.com/oJtnYQNQTm — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) November 16, 2025 What’s Next? The post added that 3 out of the last 16 trading days have seen liquidations skyrocketing to over $1 billion. Moreover, the analysts noted that daily liquidations of more than $500 million have become an everyday occurrence. As such, they indicated that when this is combined with ‘thin’ volume, the price swings in either direction become violent. This also explains the massive shift in market sentiment. As reported over the weekend, the Fear and Greed Index has gone to its lowest levels since February, even though BTC is up by 25% since the April bottom. “Leverage is amplifying shifts in investor sentiment,” the analysts said. Nevertheless, the team concluded that the fundamental value of the cryptocurrency market has only improved. They predicted that the bottom is near, as these wrinkles “will work their way out.” Therefore, when you really zoom out, it seems that crypto is in a “structural” bear market. The fundamental value of crypto has only improved, but market dynamics are shifting. As with any efficient market, the wrinkles will work their way out. We think the bottom is near. pic.twitter.com/ra2QaFwoHy — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) November 16, 2025 The post Bitcoin Just Entered ‘Structural’ Bear Market: What Does It Mean and What’s Next? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Top News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Bear Market,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-17 06:43:58

Key Takeaways: Tom Lee says Ether may be entering a “Supercycle” similar to Bitcoin’s 100x rally that began in 2017. ETH is approaching the average cost basis of long-term holders, a level historically linked to strong accumulation. Long-term wallets now hold 27 million ETH, signaling growing conviction despite the recent market pullback. In an X post on Sunday , Lee said the current Ether market resembles Bitcoin’s setup eight years ago, a period marked by deep volatility that ultimately preceded one of the strongest bull cycles in crypto history. Tom Lee: Bitcoin’s 100x Run Began With a $1,000 Call in 2017 Lee noted that his firm first recommended Bitcoin to Fundstrat clients in 2017 when BTC traded near $1,000. Since then, Bitcoin suffered several drawdowns of up to 75%, yet still surged more than 100-fold from that initial call. “We believe ETH is embarking on that same Supercycle,” he wrote, arguing that Ether’s recent weakness reflects doubt, not deterioration. “To have gained from that 100x Supercycle, one had to stomach existential moments to HODL.” ETH has trailed Bitcoin for much of 2025, even as the market reached new record highs. Ether notched its all-time high of $4,946 in August, while Bitcoin topped out above $126,000 in October. Both assets have since pulled back sharply, with BTC down 25% from its peak and ETH sliding more than 35%. Lee framed the retreat as part of the “discounting of a massive future.” Bitcoin is a volatile asset. We first recommended Bitcoin to Fundstrat clients in 2017 (1%-2% allocation) – Bitcoin 2017 ~$1,000 Since then (past 8.5 years), $BTC : – 6 declines > -50% – 3 declines > – 75% 2025, Bitcoin 100x from our first recommendation TAKEAWAY: To have… pic.twitter.com/xtIRGLdnWM — Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) November 16, 2025 On-chain data suggests Ether may be nearing a critical level for long-term holders. CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci said ETH’s current price , around $3,150, sits just $200 above the average cost basis of long-term accumulators, whom he described as investors who have been “patiently stacking.” Ether has only fallen below this level once this year, during April’s market shock triggered by President Donald Trump’s global tariff rollout. According to Kesmeci, long-term conviction in Ether is stronger than ever. Roughly 17 million ETH has moved into accumulation addresses in 2025, pushing the total balance held by long-term wallets to 27 million ETH, up from 10 million at the start of the year. If ETH slips to the $2,900 level, he said, history suggests it would represent “one of the strongest long-term accumulation opportunities.” Ether briefly touched a 24-hour low of $3,023 but has since steadied, trading flat around $3,185. Ethereum Whales Accumulate 7.6M ETH as Market Enters Compression Phase As repored, Ethereum whales have significantly increased their exposure as ETH hovers near $3,000, a trend analysts say has historically preceded major market reversals. CryptoQuant data shows wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have accumulated 7.6 million ETH since April, a 52% jump, while smaller holders continue to trim their balances. The divergence suggests institutional-sized players are positioning for a potential rebound, even as retail remains cautious. Analysts also point to repeated spikes in Ethereum’s spot trading volume since early November, a pattern commonly seen in late-stage compression phases before large price moves. Meanwhile, Ethereum network fees have plunged to some of their lowest levels in years, with gas prices dropping to 0.067 Gwei last week as onchain activity slowed following October’s market-wide crash. During the 2021 bull run, transaction costs on Ethereum’s base layer frequently exceeded $100–$150, driving users toward cheaper alternatives and layer-2 solutions. However, since the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which optimized gas fees for layer-2 rollups, Ethereum’s fee revenue has collapsed by 99%, according to Token Terminal.

New York Times: $28 Billion in Illicit Funds Flowed into Global Stock Exchanges According to the report, leading exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Bybit have become major flow points for funds generated by North Korean hacker groups, Southeast Asian-based fraud networks, and globally widespread “pig butchering” investment scams. The investigation revealed that Binance continued to accept transactions from risky entities despite previously pleading guilty to money laundering and sanctions violations and paying a $4.3 billion fine. It was also reported that over $400 million in inflows into the exchange came from high-risk entities, particularly Cambodia-based Huione. The report also cited US President Donald Trump’s signing of a $2 billion cooperation agreement with Binance and his pardon of the company’s founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), as developments that raised concerns that regulations could be loosened. The NYT investigation reveals that the crypto market remains significantly vulnerable to illicit fund flows and that regulatory pressure is likely to intensify in the coming period. Industry experts warn that such findings could pave the way for stricter global oversight. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency market holds its breath as Bitcoin teeters on the edge of critical support levels, with all eyes turning to this week’s Federal Reserve minutes. The Bitcoin price action has turned increasingly bearish, creating tension among investors who fear a potential drop below the psychological $90,000 mark. Why Is Bitcoin Price Under Pressure? Multiple factors are converging to create headwinds for the Bitcoin price. First, U.S. tech stocks have experienced a sharp decline, dragging crypto markets lower. Second, institutional buying through crypto ETFs has slowed significantly for two consecutive weeks. Moreover, selling pressure from long-term holders is increasing while retail investor liquidity remains weak. The situation creates a perfect storm for Bitcoin price volatility. When institutional flows weaken and long-term holders begin selling, it typically signals potential trouble ahead for any asset’s price stability. Critical Bitcoin Price Levels to Watch According to derivatives firm Bitunix, several key technical levels will determine the Bitcoin price direction in coming days: Short-term support: $93,000 – $95,000 range Breakdown target: $89,600 if support fails Resistance levels: $100,200 and $107,300 The Bitcoin price currently tests these crucial support zones. A break below could trigger further selling as stop-loss orders activate and sentiment turns more negative. How FOMC Minutes Could Impact Bitcoin Price The Federal Open Market Committee minutes release represents the week’s most significant event for the Bitcoin price. Nick Ruck, director of research at LVRG, emphasizes that whether the $92,000 level holds depends largely on a dovish stance being confirmed in the upcoming Fed communications. Market participants closely watch for any hints about future interest rate policy. Higher rates typically pressure risk assets like Bitcoin, while dovish signals could provide the catalyst for a Bitcoin price recovery. What This Means for Your Bitcoin Strategy Given the current Bitcoin price uncertainty, consider these actionable insights: Monitor the $93,000-$95,000 support zone closely Watch for institutional flow data in crypto ETFs Prepare for increased volatility around FOMC release Consider dollar-cost averaging if adding positions The Bitcoin price often finds direction after major economic events like FOMC minutes. However, remember that short-term price movements don’t necessarily reflect Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Navigating Bitcoin Price Volatility While the current Bitcoin price action appears concerning, experienced investors understand that volatility comes with cryptocurrency investing. The key is maintaining perspective and not making emotional decisions based on short-term price movements. The Bitcoin price has weathered numerous storms throughout its history. Each correction eventually gave way to new highs as the technology’s fundamental value proposition remained intact. Final Thoughts on Bitcoin Price Outlook The Bitcoin price stands at a critical juncture. The combination of technical breakdown risks and fundamental headwinds creates a challenging environment. However, the upcoming FOMC minutes could provide the clarity markets need to establish a new direction. Whether you’re a long-term holder or active trader, understanding these Bitcoin price dynamics helps you make informed decisions rather than reacting to fear or greed. Frequently Asked Questions What is causing the Bitcoin price decline? The Bitcoin price faces pressure from multiple factors including declining tech stocks, slowing institutional ETF inflows, increased selling from long-term holders, and weak retail participation. How low could Bitcoin price drop? If Bitcoin breaks below the $93,000-$95,000 support zone, analysts project a potential drop to $89,600. However, this depends on market sentiment and upcoming economic data. When are the FOMC minutes released? The Federal Reserve releases FOMC minutes approximately three weeks after each policy meeting. Traders watch these closely for clues about future interest rate policy. Could Bitcoin price recover quickly? Yes, the Bitcoin price has historically shown rapid recovery capability. A dovish Fed stance or positive institutional flow data could trigger a swift rebound toward resistance levels. Should I buy Bitcoin during this dip? This depends on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Some investors see price dips as buying opportunities, while others prefer waiting for clearer technical signals. How does ETF flow affect Bitcoin price? Institutional flows through Bitcoin ETFs significantly impact price. Net inflows typically support higher prices, while outflows or slowing inflows create selling pressure. Found this Bitcoin price analysis helpful?

Binance just revealed an astonishing $9 billion stablecoin inflow over the past month, creating waves of excitement among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This massive movement of digital assets signals something significant brewing in the crypto space. What Does This Massive Stablecoin Inflow Mean? The recent $9 billion stablecoin inflow represents one of the largest capital movements we’ve seen since the 2021 bull market peak. According to CryptoOnChain, a respected CryptoQuant contributor, this substantial stablecoin inflow indicates that investors are positioning themselves for potential market moves. The analyst emphasized on X that this creates strong buying pressure for both Bitcoin and major altcoins. When we examine this stablecoin inflow pattern, several key insights emerge: Accumulation phase – Investors are building positions Market confidence – Large capital movements signal trust Buying pressure – Ready capital waiting for entry points Historical parallels – Similar patterns preceded previous bull runs Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Stablecoin Movements? Stablecoins serve as the lifeblood of cryptocurrency trading, acting as digital dollars that investors use to quickly enter and exit positions. Therefore, when we see such a substantial stablecoin inflow into major exchanges like Binance, it typically indicates that traders are preparing to make significant moves. This massive stablecoin inflow essentially represents ‘dry powder’ waiting to be deployed into various cryptocurrencies. The current stablecoin inflow situation mirrors what we witnessed during previous market cycles. However, the scale and timing make this particular movement especially noteworthy. Market analysts suggest that this level of stablecoin accumulation often precedes substantial price movements across multiple cryptocurrency assets. How Does This Impact Bitcoin and Altcoin Prices? The relationship between stablecoin inflows and cryptocurrency prices is well-documented in market analysis. When exchanges experience significant stablecoin inflow, it creates immediate buying pressure that can drive prices upward. This recent $9 billion stablecoin inflow positions Binance as a potential catalyst for the next major market movement. Consider these market dynamics: Bitcoin dominance – Large stablecoin reserves often benefit BTC first Altcoin rotation – Excess capital typically flows into alternative coins Market liquidity – Increased trading volume improves market efficiency Price discovery – More capital leads to better price determination What Can We Learn From Historical Stablecoin Inflow Patterns? Historical data reveals that substantial stablecoin inflow events often serve as reliable indicators of upcoming market trends. The current stablecoin inflow magnitude suggests we might be approaching a similar scenario to the 2021 bull market conditions. However, market participants should remember that while history often rhymes, it rarely repeats exactly. This stablecoin inflow represents more than just numbers – it reflects market psychology and investor sentiment. The fact that this massive capital movement is occurring now suggests that sophisticated investors see potential opportunities in the current market environment. Conclusion: Riding the Wave of Capital Inflows The $9 billion stablecoin inflow into Binance represents a powerful vote of confidence in the cryptocurrency markets. This substantial capital movement creates a foundation for potential growth across Bitcoin and major altcoins. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the historical correlation between stablecoin inflows and market movements provides valuable context for current conditions. The market now watches closely to see how this massive stablecoin inflow will translate into actual buying activity and price movements across the cryptocurrency landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What is a stablecoin inflow? A stablecoin inflow occurs when investors transfer stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) into cryptocurrency exchanges, typically indicating preparation for future trading activity. Why does stablecoin inflow matter? Stablecoin inflow represents ready capital that can quickly enter cryptocurrency markets, creating immediate buying pressure and potentially driving prices upward. How does this compare to previous bull markets? The current $9 billion stablecoin inflow approaches levels seen during the 2021 bull market peak, suggesting similar market conditions might be developing. Should I invest because of this stablecoin inflow? While substantial stablecoin inflow can indicate market optimism, investment decisions should consider multiple factors including risk tolerance and financial goals. Which cryptocurrencies benefit most from stablecoin inflows? Bitcoin typically sees immediate benefits, followed by major altcoins as capital rotates through different market segments. How long do stablecoin inflow effects last? Market impacts can vary from immediate price movements to longer-term trends, depending on how quickly the capital gets deployed into actual purchases.

These declines have left the leading meme coin by market cap in the red, pushing it back down to levels not seen since 2023. As a result, the Dogecoin price is now in a precarious position where it needs to make a major move or DOGE investors risk more decline as the altcoin struggles to find support. Next Trajectory For The Dogecoin Price Bitguru, in an analysis on X, outlined where the Dogecoin price is and what could determine the next move for the cryptocurrency. This all comes back to a critical level that would send the price in either direction, making it the point where both bulls and bears are now fighting for dominance, and this level is at 0.166. Related Reading: Analyst Breaks Down Why There Can’t Be 7 Million XRP Holders As the crypto analyst explains, the Dogecoin price has been in a clear downtrend already, and there has been no indication that it will actually pull out of this soon. If anything, sideways movement has been the order of the day, and catalysts that could trigger another rally have not been forthcoming. It so happens that the Dogecoin price ended up being rejected at $0.1823, which has been established to be a major high for the digital asset. Hence, it puts the sellers in control once again as the price moves toward $0.166. This $0.166 level lies above the major support at $0.16, meaning that it is imperative for bulls to actually reclaim and hold it. Another problem that the digital asset is facing at this point is that it continues to form lower highs. Naturally, this is a bearish development for any cryptocurrency as it means that buyers are weakening and sellers are gaining control in the market. If these lower highs continue, then it could see further decline for the Dogecoin price as opposed to a possible recovery. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Falling Because Of Strategy Sell-Offs? On-Chain Data Fuels Debate The Dogecoin price did try to rebound over the weekend, but was ultimately pushed back down as the Bitcoin price struggled at $95,000. Now, reclaiming the $0.166 is the next major task for bulls if the meme coin is to continue its ascent. In the event of a failure to reclaim $0.166 with momentum, then the Dogecoin price could correct lower. As the decline deepens, the next major support level lies firmly at $0.15, where there could be a wave of buying to trigger a short-term rise.

When asked about a potential XRP ETF shortly after the launch of ETH ETFs, Fink responded with caution, stating, “I can’t. And you don’t want me to.” Pumpius interpreted Fink’s evasiveness as evidence that BlackRock may have been restricted by a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) tied to Ripple or other stakeholders. Ripple is well known for having more than 1,700 NDAs , and commentary around the clip suggests that BlackRock’s refusal to speak on XRP ETFs at that time may have stemmed from such legal obligations. BLACKROCK IS BOUND BY XRP NDAs! “I CAN’T” His face says it all! pic.twitter.com/CxYHUty5qf — Pumpius (@pumpius) November 15, 2025 The XRP ETF Race In the years since the interview, the situation has changed considerably. XRP-based ETFs have now entered the market. Notably, the Rex Osprey ETF and the Canary Capital ETF have recently launched, with Canary’s XRPC ETF experiencing a record-breaking debut . Furthermore, heavyweight institutions, such as Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, CoinShares, and others, are reportedly preparing to introduce their own XRP ETFs in the coming weeks, potentially opening the floodgates for institutional participation in the XRP market. BlackRock’s Position Today BlackRock has not publicly acknowledged involvement in any XRP ETF initiative, and the company has made no formal statements confirming that it is preparing such a product. Yet, the resurfaced video has sparked speculation. A continued NDA could have kept BlackRock silent even as other firms moved ahead, as Fink’s tone in the interview could reflect ongoing internal deliberations about entering the XRP ETF space. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is BlackRock Under an NDA? Ripple’s extensive use of NDAs reinforces the idea. If such a contract bound BlackRock, it might explain Fink’s refusal to elaborate during the interview. He refused to comment despite pressure from the interviewer, and as XRP ETF competition grows BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, and the XRP army has been vocal about its desire to see the company join the XRP ETF race . The resurfaced interview raises new questions about BlackRock’s strategy. Will the firm eventually join the growing cohort of providers in the XRP ETF market? If legal barriers once prevented public acknowledgment, many market participants now wonder whether these barriers still exist as other major institutions prepare for their ETF launches .

According to SoSoValue data , BlackRock’s ETF IBIT bled $532.41 million, recording the largest net outflow last week. Currently, the cumulative net inflow of IBIT funds has reached $63.79 billion. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) logged a net weekly outflow of nearly $290 million, ending November 14. Meanwhile, the fund’s total historical net inflow touched $63.79 billion.

ETFs Are Kind of “Static Exposure:” Simon Gerovich Simon Gerovich, CEO of Japanese Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet, noted that ETFs do not undermine the strengths of Bitcoin treasury companies. “A BTC ETF provides fixed exposure to Bitcoin,” he wrote on X, adding that the amount of BTC it holds will not increase unless it gets fund inflows to support it. 「ETFはメタプラに逆風」と言われることがありますが、これは事実ではありません。 BTC ETFは固定されたビットコインのエクスポージャーです。自分で追加しない限り、その保有BTC量が増えることはありません。… https://t.co/1EIow41m82 — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) November 16, 2025 Przemysław Kral, CEO of one of the large European crypto exchanges zondacrypto, shared his thoughts on the ongoing BTC outflows. “We must beware of weekend liquidity, which is always thinner with fewer active traders letting each forced sale move the market more,” Kral told Cryptonews. “Long-term investors now have a chance to accumulate tokens at lower rates, while short-term traders will face challenges in timing a recovery.” Bitcoin Hits Six Months Low at $95K Unsurprisingly, massive Bitcoin ETF outflows have coincided with the recent BTC price decline. ETF outflows suggest institutional demand cooling post-Trump tariff concerns. Besides, cryptos experienced widespread liquidations , totalling $617.45 million within 24 hours. Bitcoin alone accounted for $243.56 million in liquidations, with Ethereum following at $169.06 million. At press time, Bitcoin was trading near $95,200 , representing a 0.59% decline over the last 24 hours.

This substantial Bitcoin holdings position, disclosed in their recent quarterly report, represents a significant vote of confidence in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Why Are Bitcoin Holdings Becoming Crucial for Public Companies? Public companies worldwide are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value and hedge against inflation. Boyaa Interactive’s Bitcoin holdings strategy demonstrates how forward-thinking corporations are diversifying their assets beyond traditional investments. The company’s approach reflects a growing trend where businesses allocate portions of their treasury to digital assets. This move follows similar strategies by other major corporations who have integrated cryptocurrency into their balance sheets. The decision to maintain substantial Bitcoin holdings shows confidence in the long-term value proposition of digital currencies. What Makes Boyaa’s Bitcoin Strategy So Impressive? Boyaa Interactive’s latest financial report reveals they increased their Bitcoin holdings by 738 BTC during the third quarter. This aggressive accumulation strategy indicates strong belief in Bitcoin’s future potential. Their Bitcoin holdings now represent one of the largest corporate cryptocurrency positions in the Asian markets. The company’s approach to Bitcoin holdings includes: Strategic accumulation during market opportunities Secure storage solutions for long-term preservation Regular portfolio rebalancing to optimize position size How Do Bitcoin Holdings Impact Corporate Valuation? Substantial Bitcoin holdings can significantly influence a company’s market valuation and investor perception. As digital assets gain mainstream acceptance, corporations with meaningful Bitcoin holdings often attract different types of investors. These Bitcoin holdings provide exposure to cryptocurrency markets without direct trading. Moreover, Bitcoin holdings serve as a diversification tool against traditional market volatility. Companies maintaining Bitcoin holdings demonstrate innovative financial management approaches that can enhance their competitive positioning. What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Adoption? Boyaa Interactive’s growing Bitcoin holdings signal a broader acceptance trend among publicly traded companies. Their consistent accumulation of Bitcoin holdings suggests confidence in cryptocurrency’s long-term viability. This development could encourage other Asian companies to consider similar Bitcoin holdings strategies. The increasing institutional Bitcoin holdings create positive momentum for overall market development. As more corporations establish Bitcoin holdings, liquidity improves and market stability increases.

These tokens mirror airline miles or in-game currencies, enabling loyalty and activity without speculative volatility. a16z notes that arcade tokens aren’t necessary for speculative projects or layer-1 networks with established tokens. In a report published Thursday , researchers at the venture capital firm argued that these tokens, designed to function more like airline miles or credit-card points than speculative assets, could become a foundational tool for scaling digital economies. Arcade Tokens Offer Stable, Spendable Fuel for Digital Economies Arcade tokens hold relatively stable value within a specific software or product ecosystem and are meant to be spent, not hoarded. They give users access to functions or rewards inside a network, helping projects grow user activity without exposing them to the volatility associated with most cryptoassets. “Just as stablecoins unlock new forms of commerce, and network tokens enable decentralized value-sharing and governance, arcade tokens can power digital economies at scale,” wrote a16z researcher Scott Duke Kominers, CTO Eddy Lazzarin and others. One example cited in the report is Blackbird, a hospitality-tech startup that launched a Web3 payments platform for restaurants in 2024. Its FLY token acts as a reward asset: customers earn it through spending and can redeem it at participating restaurants. The redemption process runs on a purpose-built blockchain layer, while a separate network token ensures security and incentives among service providers. a16z argued that this split model, using a network token for infrastructure and an arcade token for user-facing activity, mirrors traditional reward systems that drive loyalty programs. More on what is — and isn’t — an arcade token pic.twitter.com/FRqkRSNUlX — a16z crypto (@a16zcrypto) November 16, 2025 Airline miles and in-game currencies were highlighted as analogues that encourage repeat engagement without giving holders ownership stakes. Crucially, arcade tokens have “programmatically bounded” value, preventing extreme price swings. The report also pointed to broader opportunities. For “spend-centric economies” or applications that connect to real-world businesses, arcade tokens offer price stability, predictable accounting, and simpler token design. Developers can also issue new arcade tokens on demand to support growth, whether through user incentives, grants or developer subsidies, while keeping value circulating inside the ecosystem instead of leaking out. However, the firm cautioned that not every project requires them. Highly speculative environments or layer-1 blockchains with established network tokens often gain little from adding an arcade layer. a16z and DeFi Fund Urge SEC to Create Safe Harbor for Blockchain Apps As reported, the DeFi Education Fund and a16z are calling on the SEC to establish a regulatory “safe harbor” for blockchain-based applications. In an Aug. 13 blog post, a16z said both groups submitted formal proposals urging the SEC to clarify that developers of decentralized apps should not automatically be treated as brokers. Their request follows years of SEC enforcement actions and Wells notices suggesting that software interfaces enabling peer-to-peer transactions could fall under broker-dealer rules. The groups argue that the SEC should grant a “rebuttable presumption” that neutral blockchain apps are not engaged in brokerage activity unless proven otherwise. According to the proposal, forcing developers to register as brokers would impose responsibilities they never agreed to, such as taking custody of user assets or acting as intermediaries, which would undermine blockchain’s core design and introduce new risks to users.

His comment came after months of internal pressure from lawmakers who want stronger moves against nations buying Russian energy. He added another line before leaving Florida, saying, “The Republicans are putting in legislation that is very tough sanctioning, etcetera, on any country doing business with Russia.” That statement showed that he knows who is pushing the bill, where it is coming from, when it started gaining speed, why it exists, and which source delivered the quote. The people behind the idea include Senator Lindsey Graham, who has pushed the measure for years, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said back in October he was ready to bring the bill to a vote but did not want to commit to a deadline. Tariffs hit nations buying Russian oil The legislation would give Trump the power to impose tariffs of up to 500% on imports from nations that keep buying Russian oil and do not help Ukraine. The focus is clear: China and India, who both buy large volumes of Russian crude. He also said, “We may add Iran to that,” without giving details on where he got that information or when that call would be made. Lawmakers from both parties have pushed for new steps to hurt Russia’s economy as the war passes the four‑year mark. For months, Trump held back on supporting this plan because he wanted to push Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy toward peace talks. He even hosted Putin at a summit in Alaska, but the Russian leader has not eased his assault. Ukraine is striking more Russian energy sites, but Russia has increased its own attacks and is trying to take the rail hub of Pokrovsk. Ukraine said it hit Rosneft PJSC’s Novokuybyshevsk refinery in the Samara region, more than 1,300 kilometers northeast of Kyiv, and reported explosions and fire in the area. Oil flows shift as attacks hit Russia’s supply routes Russia’s Black Sea port at Novorossiysk restarted oil loading after a two‑day shutdown caused by a Ukrainian cruise‑missile strike, according to Bloomberg and LSEG. The ship‑tracking data showed two crude tankers, the Arlan and the Rodos, plus the Yanbu oil‑products carrier, were moored at the terminal on November 16. Ukraine’s General Staff said the attack in Samara was part of an effort to limit Russia’s ability to supply fuel and ammunition to its military. Russia’s seaborne crude exports dropped for a third straight week, falling to a two‑month low. Vessel‑tracking data compiled by Bloomberg showed shipments at 3.45 million barrels per day in the four weeks to November 9, down by 130,000 barrels per day compared to the earlier period ending November 2. A large amount of Russian oil is stuck on tankers because of slow discharge rates caused by U.S. sanctions. More delays may come after November 21, the deadline for receiving oil tied to sanctioned giants Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC . The Aframax tanker Ailana sat idle off Mumbai for a week before transferring its cargo to the Fortis, which first headed toward Kochi but is now going to China after India did not take the cargo. Russian crude at sea has climbed to over 350 million barrels, rising 22 million barrels, or 7%, since September, according to Bloomberg’s tanker‑tracking data. At the same time, crude available for export is increasing because Russia has boosted production by 450,000 barrels a day since March as eight OPEC+ nations ease earlier cuts. Fuel that cannot be refined due to damaged facilities is being funneled to export terminals instead.

This token has begun to emerge in the 2025 market as it gears up to make significant changes. Most investors claim that it is becoming one of the most observed new crypto projects of the year, and the initial signs are that it could grow at an astonishing rate and be high-demand at launch. Although the project is just developing, it has experienced a lot of traction in the past few months that it has been difficult to overlook. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance(MUTM) is developing a two-side lending platform that is meant to be used in the DeFi crypto market. The project is based on the Peer-2-Contract and Peer-2-Peer markets within a single ecosystem. In the Peer-2-Contract market, assets are contributed to common pools by the users. On depositing, they get one of the tokens which are the mtTokens, which are kind of ERC-20 receipt tokens but increase in value over time. Assuming that a user has deposited $1,000 U.S. dollars in the form of USDT at an estimated 5% APY, the balance of the assets held as the mtTokens will automatically increase over time as interest accrues. Peer-2-Peer is a model which will be used with borrowers that wish to do an isolated lending. Borrowers can select individual terms like type of rate and period. Loan-to-value (LTV) settings define the amount of a person who can borrow in their collateral. When a borrower is unable to sustain the collateral level required, the protocol leads to the liquidation process which protects the lenders against incurring a loss. Good Demand and Momentum Mutuum Finance has already been able to get off with an organized presale. The project has already collected $18.7M funds and has 18,000 holders, which is growing its community around the token rapidly. Out of the overall number of 4 billion tokens a total of 45.5% or 1.82 billion tokens is designated to the presale. This will provide their early participants with a big portion of supply before the protocol becomes active. The presale was initiated in early 2025 at $0.01. At phase 6, the price is shown at $0.035 implying that the price has gone up by nearly 3x compared to the initial phase. There is a fixed allocation on every stage. With rise in demand, the supply in every stage is filled faster forcing the price to the next level. Phase 6 is already exceeding 88%, which puts pressure on the remaining supply because it is limited. There is also the daily engagement system used in the presale. The 24-hour leaderboard will incentivize the best contributor with $500 in MUTM, and it brings about constant contributions and maintains the token in the greater top crypto discussion. Having an established price of launching at the discounted price of $0.06, numerous early adopters are considering the present stage as the final form of a pre-release discounted entrance to the general release. Analyst Expectations and Securities Milestones The first major milestone has already been proved by Mutuum Finance. Based on the official announcement on X , the V1 testnet will be launched in Q4 2796 on Sepolia. This prototype consists of the liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens and the liquidator bot. It will provide users with the initial opportunity to touch upon the essentials of the protocol. Another area of interest has been security. Mutuum Finance also underwent a CertiK audit where it received a 90/100 on its Token Scan. Through such developments, analysts have indicated huge upward prospects in case the platform becomes popular once it gets started. Long-Term Projection A native stablecoin is one of the largest motivations making MUTM become a palpable name in the newly emerging crypto-related discussions. This stablecoin will involve utilization of interest in borrowing markets to sustain the structure. In the case of the protocol, this is a second growth channel following the core lending system. Mutuum Finance also specified its strategies of layer-2 expansion which is relevant to scalability in the long term. The system does this by operating on various networks saving more on gas bills and increasing speed on which transactions are made hence gaining more users in the long run. According to analysts, the additions might help the token to increase its value when the ecosystem transitions to an open release. A Speedy Altcoin with Increasing Publicity Having a high amount of presale demand, a fast community growth rate, and a proven V1 launch date, Mutuum Finance is one of the most discussed new crypto projects of 2025. The dual-market lending, storage and deployment of stablecoins, and integration into Layer-2 has made MUTM one of the leading crypto competitors to be in the upcoming cycle. And an acquisition of MUTM at $0.035 has a very soon expiry with Phase 6 almost sold out.

54516412,628834,1763364613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54516412.jpeg,Cardano Founder Hoskinson Tells Crypto Traders To ‘Hold The Line’,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-hoskinson-crypto-traders-hold-the-line/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has responded to the latest market downturn with one of his most forceful defenses of crypto to date, urging investors not to panic-sell and portraying exits to fiat as a vote for a dystopian future. Speaking from Colorado in a video dated November 15, he noted that “since October, you know, we lost about a trillion dollars of value,” but stressed he has “lived through” multiple boom-and-bust cycles. Reviewing long-term Bitcoin charts, the Cardano founder mocked the recurring emotional swings of the market. “It goes up, it goes down and everybody freaks the f*** out. Paper hands. So papery,” he said, comparing himself to a calm rider on a violent amusement-park drop, reading a book while others scream. Cardano Founder Predicts 1 Billion Users By 2030 Hoskinson argued that the sell-off has not been driven by deteriorating fundamentals for crypto, but by leverage, manipulation and trader behavior. “Have any of the fundamentals changed between now and a month ago or 12 months ago about crypto? Have any of the fundamentals changed? Any?” he asked. Instead, he pointed to rising US debt , declining trust in the dollar and worsening geopolitical tensions, describing governments as “morally bankrupt, fiscally bankrupt, and destined for Armageddon.” He ridiculed those selling into dollars amid such a macro backdrop. “You paper hand sons of […] want to go exit into a currency that has nearly $40 trillion of debt,” he said, questioning whether that exit is just to “go buy a car,” “buy some real estate,” or pay down “a little credit card debt.” He called this behavior “collective Stockholm syndrome,” arguing that people are returning to institutions that systematically exploit them. “Crypto is the opt out. Crypto is the exit. Crypto is the solution,” Hoskinson said. In his view, blockchain systems provide “honest money,” verifiable votes and auditable institutions where “no one can ever change the record to their own convenience.” He claimed there are “550 million people in the cryptocurrency ecosystem” and predicted “there’s going to be a billion by 2030,” adding that “the majority of the world’s stocks and bonds and equities will be in the cryptocurrency space by 2030.” On markets, he repeated that volatility is secondary to long-term direction. “Goes down, goes up, goes down, goes up […] But it goes up because there’s people,” he said, arguing that adoption and migration of financial markets into crypto will push the asset class toward 10 trillion in value. “Trillion doesn’t even mean anything anymore. The dollar doesn’t mean anything anymore. Everything ought to be priced in crypto because it’s the only place left where there’s a semblance of objectivity and honesty.” Hoskinson extended his critique to fiat money creation, calling the existing system “a Ponzi scheme.” “The money is worthless because when they print it, they use it themselves, extract all the value, get hard assets with it, and then dump the worthless […] on you, and your wages don’t go up,” he said. In contrast, he argued, “No one can turn off your ADA. No one can turn off your Bitcoin. No one can turn off your Ether.” He framed on-chain governance and transparency as prerequisites for legitimate institutions, claiming that “no voting in the United States will ever be legitimate again until it’s on a blockchain” and “no company in the United States will ever be fully legitimate, trustworthy, and honest until it’s a DAO.” He also highlighted privacy-focused technologies such as Zcash , Monero and Cardano’s Midnight sidechain , which he described as “real privacy” and said is being designed to be “fully programmable and soon to be postquantum.” Despite describing himself as “so thoroughly done” with market panic, Hoskinson said he continues to work in crypto because he believes it is the only realistic path to preserving individual autonomy. “There’s a reason I’m still around and I haven’t retired,” he said. “I honestly still believe we can win.” For traders unnerved by red candles, his message was uncompromising: “Hold the line. Bring people in. Get crypto going. Get the markets going again.” Selling, he warned, is not a neutral act but “voting to permanently live in that world” of surveillance and control. “Don’t sign up for it. Sign up for crypto. That’s all I’m going to say.” At press time, Cardano traded at $0.49.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-17 07:30:13

The movement represents one of the largest single-day outflows in recent months. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that 121 billion SHIB exited exchanges on November 15 alone, with the pattern continuing through November 16. Technical Resistance Holds Despite Outflows Despite the significant supply reduction on exchanges, SHIB's price remains constrained by technical barriers. At the time of writing, the token trades at $0.000008995, a support zone that has held multiple tests without triggering upward breakouts. All major moving averages sit above current price levels, creating a convergent downward-sloping resistance structure. SHIB price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap The Relative Strength Index hovers around 39, indicating weak momentum without capitulation. Trading volume remains steady rather than collapsing, suggesting holders maintain positions instead of rushing toward exits. This stability in volume during a consolidation phase often precedes directional moves once catalysts emerge. SHIB must reclaim $0.0000105 to challenge the first resistance cluster where moving averages converge. Beyond that level, $0.0000112 represents the next critical breakpoint. Neither threshold has been tested during the current outflow period, leaving the token in a technically bearish posture despite improving on-chain metrics. Supply Dynamics Point to Accumulation The disconnect between price action and exchange data reveals competing forces at work. Tokens leaving exchanges at accelerated rates typically reduce available supply for sellers. When this occurs without corresponding price increases, accumulation phases often develop beneath the surface. Current holder behavior supports this interpretation. Source: Tradingview Market participants removing tokens from exchanges demonstrate willingness to weather volatility rather than liquidate positions. This behavior contrasts sharply with distribution phases, where tokens flood onto exchanges ahead of selling pressure. The current pattern suggests conviction among existing holders and potential positioning for future price appreciation. Historical precedents show that sustained exchange outflows frequently precede trend reversals in cryptocurrency markets. While timing remains uncertain, the magnitude of recent withdrawals exceeds typical baseline activity. If outflows continue at current rates while price maintains support, conditions for upward momentum may develop. Market Context and Future Outlook Shiba Inu remains nearly 90% below its all-time high, placing the token deep into bear market territory by traditional metrics. The broader cryptocurrency market has experienced volatility throughout November, creating unstable sentiment conditions. Against this backdrop, the exchange outflow data provides a counterpoint to the bearish price structure. The Shiba Inu development team recently teased new initiatives , though specific details remain undisclosed. Such announcements can catalyze renewed interest when combined with improving supply dynamics. However, concrete developments rather than speculation typically drive sustained rallies in the current market environment. Trading activity shows holders adopting wait-and-see positions rather than aggressive accumulation or distribution.

Our ENA price prediction expects a maximum of $0.82 in 2025. In 2031, we expect the ENA price to achieve $7.38. Ethena is a stablecoin project built on Ethereum that offers USDe, a fully decentralized coin pegged to the US dollar. Unlike stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, USDe doesn’t depend on banks or centralized companies for reserves. Instead, it uses a cash-and-carry trading strategy to keep its value equal to the dollar. For investors who prioritize decentralization, USDe could be an appealing choice — especially since it currently offers staking rewards above 9%. However, critics caution that since the project is still new, it’s uncertain whether USDe’s high yields and dollar peg can remain stable during a market downturn. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Ethena price prediction from 2025-2031. In this article, we’ll find out “Will ENA reach $10?” and explore the factors behind ENA price prediction.

Currently, the ENA price is preparing for a bearish rally. Ethena price analysis 1-day chart: ENA price triggers bearish momentum Analyzing the daily price chart of ENA tokens, ENA witnessed a bearish correction after sellers pushed the price toward support lines. Sellers are now aiming for a hold below the immediate Fib channels around $0.27. The 24-hour volume surged to $52.6 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. Ethena’s price is currently trading at $0.276, which has dropped by over 0.6% in the last 24 hours. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and hovers within the neutral level at 30.7, showing that bears control price momentum slightly. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. ENA/USDT 4-hour price chart: Buyers aim big above EMA levels The 4-hour ENA price chart suggests that ENA experienced a bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, buyers aim for a strong rebound above the EMA20 trend line. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.08, suggesting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost downward correction. However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for positive momentum, strengthening buying positions.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the ENA price from an immediate surge. However, if the ENA price successfully breaks above $0.3557, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.4061. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, ENA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2549, resulting in a correction to $0.2087. Is ENA a good investment? Whether ENA is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. Ethena has been ranked among the 100 cryptocurrencies. Still, there are questions about its demand, given its similarity to algorithmic stablecoins — a concept that lost trust after LUNA’s collapse in 2022. Even so, Ethena has shown strong performance during market surges, making it a solid project in the crypto market. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the ENA price down today? ENA’s price gained selling pressure around recent highs, resulting in a minor downward push. This created a decline toward $0.276. Will Ethena price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.3 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will ENA reach $10? ENA price might reach the $10 mark in 2032 if buying demand surges and ENA attracts altcoin investors. Will ENA reach $100? The $100 mark is a distant dream for ENA. This price level is achievable in the long run if ENA continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Ethena a good long-term investment? ENA has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on ENA Terminal Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) incubated by Ethena Labs, has attracted more than $262 million in total value locked (TVL) ahead of its upcoming launch. Ethena (ENA) price prediction November 2025 Over the last few days, ENA prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $120K in November, we might see a solid surge in the ENA price. According to technical analysis, the ENA price might record a maximum level of $0.44 and a minimum of $0.25, with an average value of $0.35 throughout November.

ENA historical price sentiment ENA Price History: Coinmarketcap Ethena’s price history from mid-2024 to late 2025 shows a period of intense volatility marked by sharp fluctuations in both price and market capitalization. In early 2024, Ethena traded strongly, reaching highs around $1.20 in April, supported by high trading volumes exceeding $8 billion. However, by mid-2024, the token began to decline steadily, closing near $0.38 by July as investor sentiment weakened and market activity cooled. The latter half of 2024 saw further instability. Ethena’s price dropped as low as $0.20 in September, reflecting a major correction phase in the broader crypto market. Despite these setbacks, the token demonstrated resilience, climbing back above $1.00 by December 2024. This late-year rally suggested renewed interest from traders and potential ecosystem developments. In 2025, Ethena continued to experience wide swings. The token opened the year near $1.25 but faced sustained downward pressure through the spring, dipping below $0.30 by June. A strong recovery followed in the third quarter, with prices surpassing $0.70 in August and stabilizing near $0.50 by October. Throughout this period, Ethena’s market cap ranged from $1 billion to over $5 billion. In early November, the price of ENA declined toward $0.3.",Crypto Price Predictions|ENA|Ethena,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ENA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-17 07:32:34

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/crypto-analysis-firm-matrixport-says-crypto-market-enters-deleveraging-process-here-are-the-details/,"Crypto analytics firm Matrixport has announced that the cryptocurrency market has entered a distinct deleveraging phase, with the risks of maintaining highly leveraged positions rapidly increasing. Matrixport: Crypto Market Enters Clear Deleveraging Process, Bitcoin Approaches Critical Support Level The company noted that the recent 50% drop in open interest in Ethereum futures indicates that leveraged funds are beginning to unwind significantly. This suggests a weakening of overall risk appetite and increasing selling pressure in the market. According to Matrixport, Bitcoin is currently approaching the critical $93,000 level. The company emphasized that liquidity in this price range could become more fragile in the short term, and volatility could increase. The large-scale liquidation of long futures positions, which had accumulated rapidly, particularly in the fourth quarter, helped alleviate some of the short-term pressure in the market. However, Matrixport notes that the key element the market will need to monitor from now on will be ETF positions. If the general market trend remains weak, spot Bitcoin ETFs may also be pressured to reduce their positions, which could create a new liquidity shortage in the market. While the company considers the current situation to be an important threshold for the crypto market, it emphasizes that investors should be more cautious about leverage risks. *This is not investment advice.

BTC maxis went even further along the way, which was supported by TradFi experts and regulators who categorized the cryptocurrency as a commodity, just like gold. If that’s the case, then the two should move in sync, right? Such identical moves have occurred in the past, but that hasn’t been the case since the October 10 massacre, as shown by new data from the Kobeissi Letter. Gold Link Broken The gap in performance between the two began after the massive crash mentioned above. At the time, BTC plunged from over $121,000 to $101,000 on some exchanges in the span of just hours, a move that wiped out over $19 billion in leveraged positions. Since then, the cryptocurrency’s situation has only worsened, as it dipped to a six-month low of $93,000 yesterday. In contrast, the precious metal has marked some gains and even managed to tap a new all-time high in the meantime. As such, the Kobeissi Letter determined that after more than 12 months, during which the two assets moved in high correlation as safe havens, the link had broken. Still not convinced? Take a look at the chart of Bitcoin versus Gold since the October 10th liquidation occurred. For 12+ months, Gold and Bitcoin moved with high correlation; the safe haven assets. Since early-October, Gold has outperformed Bitcoin by 25 percentage points. pic.twitter.com/cMd17JFGuL — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) November 16, 2025 The analysts believe the main reason behind BTC’s nosedive, as well as its entirely different moves compared to gold, is the amount of excessive leverage used in the crypto markets. US Tech Sector Link Grows At the same time, the Kobeissi Letter noted another growing positive correlation with a different asset class – the US technology sector. The 30-day correlation between BTC and the Nasdaq 100 Index reached its highest level in over three years at 0.80. It’s also the second-highest in the past 10 years. Over the past five years, the correlation has been positive except for a brief period in 2023. Consequently, BTC’s 5-year correction to the Nasdaq has exceeded 0.5, while its relationship with cash and gold has been “essentially zero.” “Bitcoin is increasingly behaving like a leveraged tech stock,” concluded the Kobeissi Letter.

Therefore, this development could mark a significant milestone in bridging traditional financial systems with blockchain-based payment networks. Ripple’s ILP, a protocol designed for seamless, cross-ledger payments, enables instant transfers across different payment networks without relying on intermediaries. By connecting traditional financial rails like VISA to ILP, financial institutions could achieve faster, more efficient, and cost-effective transaction processing. The integration promises to reduce the friction and delays that often plague cross-border payments, which currently rely on legacy systems such as SWIFT. The report indicates that VISA could leverage Ripple’s Interledger Protocol to enable near-instant, transparent payments across banks, digital wallets, and financial networks, offering faster fund access, lower fees, and a seamless payment experience for businesses and consumers. Notably, Ripple’s Interledger Protocol is built for seamless interoperability, enabling real-time connections across diverse ledgers. This positions VISA to modernize its payment infrastructure while maintaining regulatory compliance and operational reliability, bridging traditional finance and digital assets. Beyond speed and efficiency, integrating Ripple’s ILP with VISA could bridge traditional finance and blockchain, creating a seamless hybrid ecosystem. This move could drive mainstream adoption of digital currencies, positioning ILP as a key infrastructure for global payments. Therefore, the report highlights the rising convergence of traditional finance and decentralized networks. Integrating VISA transactions with Ripple’s ILP could usher in a new era of cross-border payments, delivering unmatched speed, transparency, and scalability. XRP Eyes $5–$8 as Strong Support Zone Bolsters Institutional Confidence According to prominent market analyst Crypto Patel, XRP has established a decisive support zone between $1.85 and $2, signaling a robust foundation for both retail and institutional investors. This range, Patel notes, represents a strong liquidity and accumulation base, creating a favorable environment for potential price expansion in the months ahead. XRP’s $1.85–$2 support zone is proving pivotal with the current price being $2.27. Historically, areas of high liquidity and concentrated institutional accumulation absorb selling pressure and anchor markets during volatility. As Crypto Patel notes, XRP’s consolidation here reflects strong investor confidence and positions the coin for potential structural growth. XRP continues its bullish momentum across multiple timeframes, with strong trading volumes and clear institutional accumulation signaling strategic positioning. Analyst Patel suggests that if the $1.85–$2 support holds, XRP could see a structural surge toward $5–$8, representing substantial upside potential. Therefore, XRP’s $1.85–$2 support zone is more than a floor, it signals strong institutional backing, deep liquidity, and bullish momentum. If trends hold, a structural move toward $5–$8 is well-supported by market dynamics and investor activity, reinforcing XRP’s upward trajectory. Conclusion Integrating VISA transactions with Ripple’s Interledger Protocol could transform payments, combining traditional network reliability with blockchain’s speed, transparency, and interoperability. This leap promises a faster, more efficient ecosystem and marks a major step toward a truly connected global financial landscape. On the other hand, XRP’s $1.85–$2 support zone highlights strong institutional interest and deep liquidity. With bullish momentum intact, this level not only defends current valuations but also positions XRP for a potential surge toward $5–$8.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 07:56:48

XRP Army Responds,https://timestabloid.com/what-will-xrp-be-worth-by-2030-xrp-army-responds/,"Levi Rietveld recently revisited XRP’s historical price path in a short video on X, and his comparison of past milestones created renewed interest in where the asset might head next. He linked XRP’s earlier valuations to simple real-world references and used these points to frame a projection that extended its long-term growth rate. His remarks set the stage for a wider discussion about the digital asset’s long-term performance and whether its previous gains can guide price expectations for 2030. What $XRP will be worth by 2030? COMMENT NOW!! pic.twitter.com/CWqe3L26C7 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 15, 2025 Rietveld’s View on Historical Movement Rietveld reviewed XRP’s price trend from 2016 to 2025 and pointed to the scale of its long-term increase. He noted that the token traded at “half of a single cent” in 2016. He also referenced its performance during the 2021 bull market, when XRP approached $2, and its position during the current cycle, which capped off at $3.65 in July . Rietveld then calculated that XRP rose about 4,380% from 2016 to 2025. According to his comparison, a repeat of this historical performance could send the price to $100.35 within roughly five years. He closed his remarks with a direct question to viewers: “Will XRP be $100 by 2030?” Community Expectations and Varying Projections Rietveld’s calculation led many community members to share their own long-range views. Some investors suggested targets ranging from $15 to $1,000 or $5,000. These estimates reflect different assumptions about adoption, market structure, regulatory developments, and overall liquidity in the digital asset sector. The range of predictions also shows how wide opinions remain regarding the token’s trajectory, especially in a market influenced by technology, regulatory policy, major institutional players, adoption, and global financial conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Assessing the Path Toward 2030 XRP’s chance of reaching $100 by 2030 depends on factors that extend beyond past growth. Now that XRP has legal clarity, its integration into payment systems and cross-border transaction platforms continues to influence long-term interest. Market cycles, liquidity conditions, and competitive pressures from other digital assets also affect price behavior. Institutions are beginning to flood the XRP market through products like the recently launched XRP ETF by Canary Capital, and their influence could help XRP reach this lofty target. While Rietveld’s video focused primarily on the mathematical extension of previous gains, these fundamental drivers could support or limit such price outcomes.

54517707,https://cryptonews.com/?p=452552,1763367127,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54517707.jpeg,ECB Warns $300B Stablecoin Market Could Trigger Global Financial Crisis,https://cryptonews.com/news/ecb-warns-300b-stablecoin-market-could-trigger-global-financial-crisis/,"A potential run on stablecoins could force the European Central Bank to reconsider its monetary policy approach, according to Dutch central bank governor Olaf Sleijpen , who warned that dollar-pegged digital tokens are rapidly approaching systemic relevance. The $300 billion stablecoin market , which has surged over 48% this year following new U.S. regulations under President Trump, now poses direct risks to European financial stability, economic growth, and inflation control that may require ECB intervention. “ If stablecoins in the US increase at the same pace as they have been increasing, they will become systemically relevant at a certain point, ” Sleijpen told the Financial Times, noting that instability in these tokens could trigger mass sell-offs of underlying assets, primarily U.S. Treasuries. While the central bank would likely deploy financial stability tools first, he acknowledged uncertainty over whether rate cuts or increases would follow, stating, “ I don’t know in which direction we would be going. “ Dutch central bank governor Olaf Sleijpen. | Source: Bloomberg Dollar-Backed Tokens Threaten European Monetary Sovereignty The explosive growth of dollar-denominated stablecoins has sparked alarm among European institutions, with officials warning that the bloc faces conditions similar to those in emerging markets, where widespread foreign currency use undermines domestic monetary policy. A senior ECB official warned this summer that dollar stablecoin dominance could hamper European policymakers’ ability to set interest rates or control money supply, while Nobel Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole cautioned that token failures could force governments into multibillion-dollar bailouts. These concerns intensified after the U.S. enacted the GENIUS Act in July , establishing federal oversight for stablecoin issuers and spurring rapid market expansion. DefiLama data shows euro-pegged stablecoins remain marginal at under $549 million in circulation, representing just 0.18% of the global market compared to dollar tokens’ 99.58% dominance. Source: DefiLama The European Systemic Risk Board, chaired by ECB President Christine Lagarde, escalated warnings in October by identifying “ built-in vulnerabilities ” in multi-issuer stablecoin models. During its 59th General Board meeting, the ESRB endorsed a recommendation to ban structures where EU-regulated issuers hold local reserves while non-EU partners manage identical tokens backed abroad. They warned that stress-driven redemptions could overwhelm European reserves and expose the bloc to offshore liabilities. European Banking Consortium Launches Counter-Strategy Despite their concerns about stablecoins, nine major European lenders responded by forming a consortium to launch a euro-backed stablecoin in the second half of 2026, targeting MiCA licensing under the Netherlands’ regulatory framework. ING, UniCredit, CaixaBank, Danske Bank, SEB, Raiffeisen Bank International, Banca Sella, KBC, and DekaBank established a joint company to house the project, aiming to create a European alternative to U.S.-dominated markets. “ We believe this development requires an industry-wide approach, and it’s imperative that banks adopt the same standards ,” said Floris Lugt, Digital Assets lead at ING. The consortium’s stablecoin promises near-instant transactions at lower costs, along with round-the-clock cross-border settlement capabilities. European Stability Mechanism Managing Director Pierre Gramegna reinforced this push during an October hearing , stating, “ Europe should not be dependent on U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, which are currently dominating markets. ” Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe supported this stance, noting that the ECB’s digital euro project, expected to be launched by 2029, could further modernize regional payments. Momentum behind the digital euro continues to build, with ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone describing recent consensus among finance ministers on customer holding limits as a “ major breakthrough. ” The European Parliament is expected to establish a legislative framework position by May 2026, while member states aim for general agreement by year-end. The initiative seeks to reduce reliance on Visa and PayPal while limiting dollar-stablecoin influence. The @EU_Commission wants ESMA to directly supervise all crypto firms, replacing MiCA’s national regulator model. #MiCA #ESMA https://t.co/iOR7YOdqah — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 14, 2025 Despite Europe’s regulatory preparations, the European Commission now proposes shifting MiCA supervision from national authorities to the European Securities and Markets Authority, potentially disrupting the framework just as full implementation approaches next year. Industry groups warn that this reopening risks introducing legal uncertainty, though French officials argue that centralized oversight would close regulatory loopholes inherent in the current passporting system.

Key Takeaways: CZ says any refund of Binance’s $4.3 billion DOJ settlement would be reinvested in the United States. His comments follow a presidential pardon that triggered political backlash from Democratic lawmakers. Critics accuse CZ and Binance of financial ties to Trump’s family venture, raising concerns about the pardon’s integrity. The comment came after author and crypto commentator Anndy Lian publicly asked whether CZ expected the US government to return the multibillion-dollar penalty following his presidential pardon. CZ called it a “delicate question,” saying that he was already grateful for the pardon and suggested there is a balance between seeking fairness and appreciating the outcome. CZ Says Any Refund of DOJ Fine Would Be Reinvested in the US Addressing the issue directly, CZ said any refunded amount would be put to work inside the United States. “If we get any refund, we will be investing that in America anyway, to show our appreciation,” he said, adding that he has not yet asked for one. Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at Binance, a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. He was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024. Binance paid over $4.3 billion in settlements , while CZ personally paid $50 million and served four months in prison before his release in September 2024. ah, delicate question. 1. I appreciate the pardon already. There is a balance in asking for more vs ""what is fair"" vs appreciate what you got already. 2. IF we get any refund, we will be investing that in America anyway, to show our appreciation. Haven't asked yet, I think — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) November 17, 2025 In October 2025, Zhao was given a presidential pardon by President Donald Trump, which instantly sparked massive backlash . Senator Elizabeth Warren led opposition to the pardon, writing that “the convergence of Mr. Zhao’s pardon application and Binance’s financial entanglements with the President’s family presents urgent concerns regarding the integrity of our justice system.” She posted that CZ “pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge” before financing Trump’s stablecoin and lobbying for clemency. A group of Democratic senators , including Bernie Sanders, Chris Van Hollen, Jack Reed, and Mazie Hirono, sent a letter to Attorney General Pamela Bondi demanding explanations about how the pardon impacts future white-collar prosecutions. Representative Maxine Waters particularly called the pardon “an appalling but unsurprising reflection of his presidency.” CZ’s Lawyer Rejects Corruption Claims As reported, CZ’s attorney, Teresa Goody Guillén, has pushed back against allegations that the former Binance CEO’s presidential pardon was influenced by improper financial ties, calling recent media reports “false statements” based on fundamental misunderstandings of blockchain technology. Guillén argued that CZ “never should have been prosecuted,” saying he faced harsher treatment than banking executives who committed similar compliance violations. She emphasized that the case involved no victims or fraud and attributed the prosecution to the previous administration’s broader “war on crypto” following the fallout from FTX. Addressing claims of corruption, Guillén dismissed connections between Binance and Trump-backed World Liberty Financial as misinterpretations of normal blockchain activity. Critics had cited USD1, a stablecoin operating on Binance Smart Chain, and a $2 billion investment settlement involving the token as evidence of quid pro quo. She countered that USD1 runs across multiple chains and is not exclusive to Binance, comparing the assumption of a special relationship to claiming someone has ties to Craigslist simply for posting an item on the platform.

This currency movement comes as traders worldwide await crucial economic data releases that could reshape the entire forex market landscape. The unfolding scenario presents both opportunities and challenges for investors engaged in currency trading across global markets. What’s Driving the Dollar Strength Against Major Currencies? The greenback’s upward momentum reflects growing market confidence in the US economy’s resilience. Several factors contribute to this dollar strength : Anticipation of strong economic data releases Diverging central bank policies between the Fed and other major banks Safe-haven flows amid global uncertainty Interest rate differential expectations Understanding the Yen Retreat in Current Market Conditions The Japanese yen’s decline represents one of the most significant movements in the forex market . This yen retreat stems from multiple pressures: Factor Impact on Yen Market Reaction Bank of Japan policy stance Negative Increased selling pressure US-Japan yield differential Strongly negative Carry trade attractiveness Risk appetite recovery Moderately negative Reduced safe-haven demand Key Economic Data Releases That Could Reshape Currency Trading Market participants in currency trading closely monitor several upcoming economic data points: US inflation figures (CPI and PCE) Employment reports from major economies Central bank meeting minutes Manufacturing and services PMIs Retail sales data across G7 nations Forex Market Dynamics: Opportunities in Currency Trading The current forex market environment offers distinct opportunities for informed traders. The combination of dollar strength and yen retreat creates interesting pair dynamics. Successful currency trading in these conditions requires: Careful monitoring of economic data releases Understanding central bank communication patterns Risk management around volatility events Technical analysis of key support and resistance levels Actionable Insights for Navigating Current Market Conditions Traders can implement several strategies to capitalize on the ongoing dollar strength and yen retreat : Strategy Risk Level Potential Reward Dollar-long positions Medium High Yen-carry trades High Very High Range trading Low Medium Breakout plays High Extreme Frequently Asked Questions What central bank policies are affecting the dollar-yen pair? The Federal Reserve’s relatively hawkish stance compared to the Bank of Japan ‘s continued accommodative policy creates fundamental divergence driving the pair higher. How important are the upcoming economic data releases? Critical. The Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data and inflation figures will significantly influence Fed policy expectations and currency valuations. What technical levels should traders watch? Key resistance for USD/JPY sits near the 150.00 psychological level, while support appears around 147.50. Breakouts from these levels could signal extended moves. Are other major currencies showing similar patterns? While the yen retreat is most pronounced, the euro and pound also face pressure from dollar strength , though to a lesser extent due to their respective central bank policies. What risk management strategies are recommended? Position sizing, stop-loss orders, and correlation analysis remain essential given the elevated volatility around major economic data releases. Conclusion: Navigating the Currency Crossroads The current forex market presents a fascinating landscape where dollar strength meets significant yen retreat at a critical juncture for global economic data . Successful currency trading in this environment demands careful analysis, disciplined execution, and continuous monitoring of evolving fundamental drivers. The coming data releases will likely determine whether these trends accelerate or reverse, making this one of the most exciting periods for forex participants in recent months.

However, according to financial newsletter Kobeissi, wealthy asset holders are feeling a much “nerfed” impact compared to households strained by rising debts, stagnant wages, and job cuts. The Kobeissi Letter, sharing a chart from Moody Analytics, reported that 23 states are now in recession or at high risk of entering one. Those states represent almost a third of total US economic output, a deterioration from September’s findings which counted 22 states, with the addition of Michigan. 23 US states are fighting a losing battle with recession Struggling parts of the country are states in the Midwest, Northeast, and Northwest, where those marked in red include Washington, Oregon, Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maine. States supposedly in the clear include Texas , Florida, Louisiana, Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia. Those mentioned to be in the “water,” which meant they are holding steady but no longer posting meaningful growth, were California, New York, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. According to the report, the nation’s two largest state economies California and New York are no longer expanding at earlier rates, and MarketWatch economist Mark Zandi believes the two could turn the whole US into recession if the situation deteriorates. Moody Analytics’ research also found that the top 10% of households control about two-thirds of the nation’s wealth, while the bottom half of Americans hold less than 3%. The wealth of asset holders, the struggle of hand-to-mouth workers Households with investment portfolios, rising home values, or business equity are benefiting from appreciating financial markets. Meanwhile, families whose spending goes primarily toward rent, insurance, utilities, and groceries are struggling because prices are not coming down, and wages are not getting any better. “While there is some distress at the household level, in line with that K-shaped economy where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The macro picture is fairly bright,” wrote Bankrate senior industry analyst Ted Rossman in a note to investors last Wednesday. Total US household debt reached a record $18.59 trillion this year, with heavy reliance on loans for cars, education, homes, and day-to-day living. Credit bureau Experian estimated that Americans owed $17.57 trillion in the third quarter of 2024, a 2.4% increase from the previous year and more than $105,000 in liabilities per consumer. Millennials carried the largest total average debt at $371,864 mostly from home loans. But when mortgages are excluded, Generation X leads instead, owing about $68,038 in non-housing balances. Without the ability to buy appreciating assets, lower-income Americans are dependent on credit. “If you spend on rent, groceries, insurance, utilities, you will feel like the economy is collapsing. But if you spend on stocks, real estate, 401(k), business ownership, you feel like the economy is booming,” said one trader on social platform X. Unemployment, job losses, and inflation takes a toll on the US economy According to data collected by the Economic Policy Institute from state labor departments, there is a dramatic surge in continued unemployment insurance filings across Washington, Maryland, Virginia, Connecticut, and Oregon. Federal claims in DC jumped more than 1,000% compared with 2024’s tallies, while Maryland recorded an increase of more than 500%. When looking at claims in all state-managed programs, the year-over-year gains for DC, Virginia, and Maryland were 53%, 29%, and 25% respectively. US employers cut more than 150,000 jobs last month, the largest October reduction in more than twenty years. This will certainly become a talking point in the Federal Reserve’s December 9-10 FOMC meeting, after the longest US government shutdown blinded Jerome Powell and his camp with delayed key economic indicators. Traders using the CME FedWatch Tool have reduced the probability of a December interest rate cut to below 50%, down from the nearly 96% probability priced in just one month ago. Investors had hoped for another rate reduction to support borrowing, consumer spending, and corporate investment during the slowdown. However, several Fed officials insist inflation is too high to justify more cuts at the end of 2025.

Coinbase is fighting back against banking groups trying to ban stablecoin rewards, calling the move un-American, while Bitfarms stock tanked 18% after ditching Bitcoin mining for AI. And DeepSnitch AI is already at the helm. The presale has raised over $527K at $0.02289, with 51% gains from $0.01510. Its SnitchFeed agent is now live and catching whale moves in real time, with 100x potential backed by operational tools, not illusions or false promises. DeFi gets regulated, miners abandon Bitcoin Aave’s Push service can now convert euros to crypto with zero fees after securing MiCA approval from Ireland’s Central Bank. That’s a direct shot at traditional exchanges charging merchants billions annually. Meanwhile, US banking lobbyists asked regulators to ban cashback tied to stablecoin payments, worried that widespread adoption could drain over $6 trillion from traditional banking. Coinbase called it protectionism disguised as regulation. And Bitfarms announced its shuttering of Bitcoin operations over the next two years to pivot entirely into AI compute. The company posted a $46 million Q3 loss, and its stock dropped 18% on the news. DeepSnitch AI 100x potential, Ethereum and Chainlink outlooks DeepSnitch AI 100x potential and tools shipping already Although still in the early days of its presale, with plenty of room to run, DeepSnitch AI is already operational. One of its snitches, or AI agents designed by on-chain experts to source crucial information for retail traders, SnitchFeed is streaming live alerts in the internal environment, catching whale moves and sentiment shifts before they cascade through Twitter. The DSNT growth outlook holds so much promise with this utility-driven, working infrastructure. Its rare and sophisticated AI-based market prediction capability gives traders a sharp edge, one they’ve needed for a long time to contend with elite intelligence until now only accessible to whales and institutions. The presale raised over $527K and delivered 51% gains at $0.02289 while most competitors are still in testnet at this stage. Its AI-based market prediction infrastructure is audited, operational, and shipping features early enough to prove its trustworthiness beyond a shadow of a doubt. November launches crypto’s historically best six months. DeepSnitch AI holds AI-based market prediction capabilities that retail needs in a market littered with scams. This is its holding power, and at this early stage in the presale, it’s a clear mark of a moonshot in the making. 2. Ethereum: Network activity declines amid ETF competition Priced at around $3,170 in mid-November, ETH has declined substantially since earlier in the month, and even more so since October. The network saw transactions drop 23% over 30 days while active addresses fell 3%. Network fees also collapsed 88% from their late-2024 peak of $70 million per week, hammering staking yields. The Ethereum price prediction for 2026 will be contingent on whether the Fusaka upgrade delivers clarity on how ETH holders benefit from layer-2 scaling solutions. Traders are questioning whether Ethereum’s dominance in total value locked will translate into higher DApp revenues. With XRP, BNB, and Cardano launching ETFs, Ethereum faces intensifying competition for institutional capital. 3. Chainlink: Oracle infrastructure eyes ETF and institutional growth Trading at approximately $14.2 on November 14, Chainlink has been maintaining its position as the industry-standard oracle network. Recent momentum includes potential for a Chainlink ETF and integrations with institutions like the US Department of Commerce and S&P Dow Jones. The protocol has secured tens of trillions in transaction value since launch and actively secures the majority of DeFi protocols across blockchains. And mainstream organizations like Swift, J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and Euroclear have partnered with Chainlink to build tokenization infrastructure. But whether Chainlink maintains oracle dominance as competitors emerge remains to be seen. And with a market cap approaching $10B, explosive gains are far easier found elsewhere, especially among utility-based presales with all the room in the world still to run. Last reflections Aave unlocked zero-fee euro-to-crypto conversions. Coinbase is battling banks over stablecoin rewards, and Bitfarms abandoned mining for AI. At the centre of this infrastructure change, DeepSnitch AI has 100x potential and is backed by operational tools, not speculation, and no smoke and mirrors. At $0.02289 with 51% gains delivered and over $527K raised, the DSNT growth outlook offers asymmetry that mature coins can’t match. With AI-based market prediction infrastructure already deployed and the presale launching during November’s historically strong crypto period, DeepSnitch AI offers infrastructure in a sector projected to hit $1.5 trillion in AI spending by year’s end. Visit the website for more info or to buy into the presale, or keep up with X and Telegram for official updates. FAQs Does DeepSnitch AI have 100x potential? With working AI agents, live staking, 51% presale gains, and a $0.02289 entry price, there’s plenty of reason to believe in DeepSnitch AI’s 100x potential as the platform scales and institutional AI spending accelerates toward $1.5 trillion. What is the DSNT growth outlook for 2026? The DSNT growth outlook is supported by its operational tools, over 10.9 million tokens already staked, regulatory compliance through audits, and positioning as infrastructure in the AI x crypto sector during typically strong market months. Is AI-based market prediction accurate through DeepSnitch AI? AI-based market prediction through DeepSnitch AI uses live data feeds, sentiment analysis, whale tracking, and contract scanning to provide real-time intelligence, giving traders an edge through information asymmetry rather than speculation.

The framework establishes a structured environment for early participants while the project advances toward its mainnet release. The rollout coincides with the active presale phase. Round 1 lists BTCM at $0.35, anchored to an internal launch benchmark of $6.00, which corresponds to an anticipated 1614% ROI. These figures define the financial conditions at the project’s initial entry stage. Structural Design Supporting Portfolio Efficiency Bitcoin Munari’s structural framework connects distribution mechanics, market setup, and network participation into an integrated system. The approach reduces concentration among internal holders and establishes operational pathways before the mainnet phase. Key structural components include: Public-first distribution , directing a majority of circulating supply to early participants Liquidity allocation , forming the initial trading environment for BTCM on Solana Validator provisions , forming the reward base for long-term network activity The structure minimizes early-stage bottlenecks and forms a pathway from presale entry to functional asset use. Token distribution, liquidity management, and validator preparation operate as interconnected components instead of isolated processes. Economic Framework Anchored to Fixed Supply Principles Bitcoin Munari’s economy is defined by a fixed supply of 21,000,000 BTCM, establishing a scarcity-based model without inflationary issuance. The presale forms the primary distribution event, including public access and allocations tied to long-term network operations. Primary allocation groups include: Public presale: 11,130,000 BTCM Validator rewards: 6,090,000 BTCM Liquidity reserves: 1,680,000 BTCM Team allocation under vesting: 1,050,000 BTCM Marketing and ecosystem development: 1,050,000 BTCM Round 1 introduces BTCM at $0.35, measured against the internal reference level of $6.00, establishing an anticipated 1,614% ROI for first-round participants. Subsequent rounds follow predetermined increments until the full allocation is complete. The structure places network security, liquidity management, and community distribution into defined categories instead of relying on ad-hoc supply release. Each segment carries a specific function within the long-term operational plan. Technical Components Enabling High-Performance Execution The technical framework begins with BTCM operating as a Solana SPL token. Solana’s throughput, low transaction costs, and established tooling enable immediate circulation and integration with existing DeFi infrastructure during the project’s initial phase. The dedicated Bitcoin Munari Layer-1 mainnet represents the second phase of the technical roadmap. The chain uses a delegated proof-of-stake model, an EVM-compatible execution layer, and a structured governance mechanism designed to manage protocol adjustments through community voting. Core components of the architecture include: Solana SPL deployment during Phase 1 Delegated proof-of-stake consensus on the mainnet EVM-compatible smart contract engine Integrated privacy and governance modules Solana-to-Munari 1:1 migration bridge The investment platform functions as the operational entry point connecting presale distribution to the broader technical rollout. Each component fits within a sequential release plan that moves BTCM from early circulation into full-chain functionality. Portfolio Return Mechanics Within the Munari Development Roadmap The roadmap links asset acquisition, network development, and ecosystem activation into distinct stages. Presale entry forms the first phase. BTCM then moves into the Solana liquidity environment, where trading activity and wallet integrations begin. The testnet period introduces validator onboarding, transaction stress procedures, bridge verification, and economic modeling. BTCM operates as the reference asset for simulation activities, governance tests, and network configuration. Mainnet activation enables validator rewards, smart contract deployment, DeFi integrations, and cross-chain functionality. The 1:1 migration bridge maintains continuity between SPL BTCM and native BTCM on the completed chain. After migration, BTCM interacts with staking functions, governance modules, privacy features, and DeFi protocols released under the project’s ecosystem plan. The roadmap links each stage to tangible operational components rather than speculative milestones. Every phase carries a defined function within the broader network architecture and portfolio structure.

The talks center on how BTC should be utilized and whether non-financial transactions should be exempt from regulation. It was reignited by the recent Bitcoin Core v30 update, which some critics argue could open the door to blockchain “spam.” Knots supporters want this type of activity filtered out to prevent bad actors from embedding illegal or immoral content into the blockchain. Bitcoin Core proponents, however, argue that imposing restrictions risks network fragmentation, user confusion, and undermines one of Bitcoin’s core principles. Bitcoin’s Core vs. Knots battle echoes past technical disputes such as the block-size wars and SegWit adoption, both of which prompted heated debate and were settled without disrupting adoption. These historical episodes demonstrate that while protocol changes can have significant consequences for network stability, once the change has become normalized, institutional investors tend to treat it as a low-priority issue. Most institutional investors are unfazed by the Bitcoin Core vs Knots debate In a recent X post, Thorn shared results from a poll of 25 institutional Bitcoin investors working with Galaxy. He found that 46% were unaware of the debate, 36% were ambivalent, and only 18% expressed support for Bitcoin Core. Thorn noted that Real capital, real investors, service providers, and even government officials seem unbothered or are unaware that there’s even a debate; at best, it’s a hypothetical problem. Their proposed solution does nothing to solve the (fake) problem they claim is real. He continues to say that even if it is implemented, all their legal theories are mumbo jumbo, and the concerns about them are ones that everyone adjusted to years ago during early debates over the legality of permissionless decentralized systems. Some analysts questioned the number of institutions polled. The questions were directed to 25 institutional Bitcoin investors. When they inquired about the validity of the poll’s sample size, Thorn responded that it was a “ fair question ,” however, he noted that his poll reflected what he had been seeing. “I won’t reveal their identities, but I will say yes, and the results from that poll line up exactly with my conversations with other whales, investors, leaders at miners and service providers, and government officials over the last several months,” he said. Thorn added that, although he didn’t poll miners directly, he follows most of the major ones closely and confirmed that none are paying attention or concerned. Soft fork debate could impact Bitcoin adoption Earlier, a BTC improvement proposal for a soft fork drew backlash on X over a section that seemed to suggest legal consequences for those who failed to support the fork. Thorn bel ieves the argument will conclude in one of three ways, one of which could potentially cause significant harm to Bitcoin adoption. According to Thorn, the first issue fades into obscurity as no one pays attention. The second is that the debate instills fear around Bitcoin, scaring people away, while the proposed forks ultimately fail. Lastly, in a very unlikely scenario, the changes are adopted, but the solutions fall short, and Bitcoin adoption suffers long-term damage due to the fear created around permissionless systems. Although the Bitcoin Core vs Knots debate has been of high technical intensity, Thorn’s findings underscore a crucial truth: institutional investors, rather than differing nodes, care most for Bitcoin’s financial performance, regulatory clarity, and adoption trends. Developers are still discussing the forks and filtering of transactions, but these discussions among most of the market participants are mostly theoretical. The realities of security, liquidity, and compliance have proved much more compelling than the emerging software disputes in the long term to BTC’s establishment, adoption, and legitimacy in the mainstream financial ecosystem.

54520492,https://cryptonews.com/?p=452589,1763372503,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54520492.jpeg,XRP Whales Offload Nearly 200M Tokens After Splashy ETF Debut,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-whales-offload-nearly-200m-tokens-after-splashy-etf-debut/,"XRP whales have unloaded nearly 200 million tokens in the 48 hours following the debut of the first US spot XRP ETF, dampening the excitement from one of the most anticipated launches in the asset’s history. Key Takeaways: XRP whales dumped nearly 200 million tokens within 48 hours of the ETF launch, signaling heavy selling pressure. Despite a blockbuster ETF debut, XRP’s price slipped as whales sold and technical indicators turned bearish. The divergence between whale selling and institutional inflows reflects broader risk-off sentiment across the crypto market. In a recent post on X, on-chain analyst Ali said large holders “dumped nearly 200 million XRP in just 48 hours,” a signal that the biggest wallets are selling into the post-ETF rally rather than accumulating. XRP’s SEC Triumph Paves Way for Blockbuster ETF Launch on Nasdaq The selling comes at a pivotal moment for XRP, now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of roughly $136 billion. Its community has been celebrating a years-long legal victory over the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which in 2023 led a federal court to rule that XRP is not a security when traded on exchanges. That ruling helped push institutions back toward XRP and set the stage for Thursday’s launch of the Canary Capital XRP ETF on Nasdaq, the strongest ETF debut of the year with $58 million in first-day trading volume and more than $250 million in inflows . However, whales appear unmoved by the milestone. XRP has fallen 4.3% in 24 hours, sliding from $2.31 to $2.22 and forming a clear lower-highs pattern that suggests near-term bearish pressure. Crypto trader Tara warned that XRP is breaking down toward key buy levels around $2 and could drop further to $2.05 or even $1.88 unless Bitcoin stabilizes. She said volatility is likely to increase as XRP approaches these zones. #XRP is starting to break down and will be reaching buy targets soon! This could REALLY be one of the LAST buying opportunities that we get around $2! Remember, we've added in that possible subwave 3 fib at ~$2.10 – We need to watch #Bitcoin closely (and the RSI!) when XRP… — TARA (@PrecisionTrade3) November 16, 2025 The ETF’s strong inflows have not been reflected in trading volume because the product uses in-kind creations, allowing institutions to exchange ETF shares directly for XRP without activity showing up on public order books. ETF analyst Nate Geraci said this explains how the ETF posted low visible volume but high inflows. At the same time, data from Nansen shows that top-performing “smart money” wallets added $44 million in long positions over the past day. The disconnect between whale selling and institutional interest may come down to broader market conditions. Crypto remains in a risk-off phase, with Bitcoin ETFs seeing $866 million in outflows on the same day, one of their worst sessions on record. Ripple Welcomes Fed Proposal Giving Crypto Firms Access to Payment Rails Last week, Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stu Alderoty, said a proposal from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller to allow crypto companies access to “skinny” Fed accounts could reshape the US digital asset landscape. Waller argued that stablecoin issuers and other crypto firms should be able to tap directly into the Fed’s payment systems, reducing reliance on traditional banks that often hesitate to serve the sector. He urged regulators to “embrace the disruption — don’t avoid it,” signaling a more open stance toward decentralized finance. Ripple, which previously applied for a Fed master account to support its RLUSD stablecoin, sees the idea as transformative. Alderoty told Reuters the proposal could speed up settlement, lower costs and help RLUSD gain traction in a competitive stablecoin market dominated by Tether and Circle. He added that having direct access to the Fed would improve stability and redeemability, enabling firms to move quickly between U.S. Treasuries and dollars without banking middlemen.

His recent statements highlight potential vulnerabilities in the network's legal infrastructure. Szabo posted his concerns on X, stating that Bitcoin and other layer-1 networks possess a ”legal attack” surface. This vulnerability allows governments and large corporations to disrupt operations through regulatory channels. The cryptocurrency veteran dismissed the notion that Bitcoin functions as a completely autonomous system. He described the belief that blockchain protocols can withstand any governmental interference as ”insanity.” His position directly contradicts the common narrative of Bitcoin as an unstoppable financial network. Szabo's perspective carries substantial weight in the cryptocurrency community. He developed the concept of Bit Gold in 1988, predating the creation of Bitcoin. His pioneering work on smart contracts established him as a foundational figure in the development of digital currency. Speculation has long circulated that Szabo might be Satoshi Nakamoto , the anonymous creator of Bitcoin. He has consistently denied these claims. Legal Pressure Points in the Bitcoin Network The Bitcoin pioneer identified specific targets for potential government action. Miners, node operators, and wallet service providers represent critical infrastructure points vulnerable to regulatory pressure. These entities operate within established legal frameworks, making them susceptible to coordinated enforcement actions. Szabo focused his analysis on jurisdictions that maintain a strong rule of law. In these regions, authorities possess clear mechanisms to compel network participants into compliance. His warning centered on the potential for forced manipulation of network data. The ability to insert or remove ”arbitrary data” emerged as Szabo's primary concern. Regulators could mandate that network participants alter blockchain content. This scenario would undermine Bitcoin's core promise of immutable record-keeping. The Ordinals and Runes Controversy Szabo's comments connect to ongoing debates within the Bitcoin development community. The discussion revolves around non-financial content stored on the blockchain through Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 transactions. These protocols enable users to embed images, videos, and audio files directly onto the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots represent two competing visions for the network's future. Bitcoin Knots has gained market share among node validators in recent months. This shift reflects growing dissatisfaction with Bitcoin Core's approach to network data. The OP_RETURN function stands at the center of the controversy. Bitcoin Core developers implemented this feature, expanding the capacity for non-financial data on the blockchain. Critics argue that it enables ”spam” transactions, which congest the network and inflate storage requirements. Supporters argue that restricting data types contradicts Bitcoin's philosophy of being censorship-resistant. They view attempts to filter content as antithetical to the network's founding principles. The technical community remains divided on striking a balance between functionality and network efficiency. Szabo's warnings drew immediate criticism from Bitcoin advocates. Chris Seedor, CEO of Bitcoin seed storage provider Seedor, challenged the assessment. He characterized Szabo's concerns as an overestimation of regulatory capabilities. Seedor argued that Bitcoin's strength lies in minimizing technical vulnerabilities to coercion. He pointed to other resilient technologies as precedents. Protocols like PGP encryption and Tor remain operational despite government opposition. According to Seedor, these examples demonstrate the limits of regulatory power against decentralized systems.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 09:44:53

The country’s Financial Services Agency has announced plans to reclassify 105 major cryptocurrencies as financial products while implementing a massive cryptocurrency tax cut that could revolutionize investor returns. What does Japan’s cryptocurrency tax cut mean for investors? The proposed changes represent one of the most significant regulatory shifts in crypto history. Japan aims to slash the maximum cryptocurrency income tax rate from a staggering 55% down to just 20%. This dramatic cryptocurrency tax cut could unlock billions in investment potential and position Japan as a global crypto hub. Under the current system, cryptocurrency profits face some of the highest tax rates worldwide. The new framework would align crypto taxation with traditional financial instruments, creating a more level playing field. This cryptocurrency tax cut initiative demonstrates Japan’s commitment to fostering innovation while protecting investors. Which cryptocurrencies will benefit from this classification? The FSA has identified 105 digital assets for reclassification, including market leaders like: Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Other major altcoins Exchanges listing these assets will face new transparency requirements. They must disclose critical information including issuer details, underlying blockchain technology, and price volatility metrics. This enhanced transparency combined with the cryptocurrency tax cut creates a safer environment for both retail and institutional investors. How will Japan prevent market manipulation? The regulatory overhaul includes robust measures to combat insider trading. The proposal specifically prohibits executives at issuing companies or exchanges from trading based on non-public information. These protections work alongside the cryptocurrency tax cut to build market integrity and investor confidence. Authorities recognize that sustainable growth requires both attractive incentives and strong safeguards. The cryptocurrency tax cut alone wouldn’t be sufficient without these complementary regulatory enhancements that address potential abuse scenarios. When will these changes take effect? The timeline for implementation extends into 2026, with the FSA planning to submit amendments during the regular Diet session that year. This gives market participants adequate time to prepare for the cryptocurrency tax cut and associated regulatory changes. The extended timeline also allows for thorough consultation with industry stakeholders. The gradual implementation approach ensures the cryptocurrency tax cut and reclassification process occurs smoothly without disrupting existing market operations. What broader reforms accompany the cryptocurrency tax cut? Japanese authorities view this initiative as a catalyst for comprehensive cryptocurrency tax system reform. The cryptocurrency tax cut serves as the centerpiece of a larger strategy to modernize Japan’s approach to digital assets. Future reforms may address additional aspects of cryptocurrency taxation and regulation. The government’s proactive stance signals recognition of cryptocurrency’s growing importance in global finance. This cryptocurrency tax cut positions Japan competitively against other nations developing their own digital asset frameworks. Conclusion: A new era for cryptocurrency in Japan Japan’s proposed cryptocurrency tax cut and regulatory reclassification represent a monumental shift in how digital assets are perceived and treated. By lowering barriers and increasing transparency, these changes could accelerate mainstream adoption while protecting market participants. The combination of significant tax relief and enhanced regulatory oversight creates a balanced approach that could serve as a model for other nations considering similar reforms. Frequently Asked Questions When will Japan’s cryptocurrency tax cut take effect? The changes are scheduled for submission to the Diet in 2026, with implementation likely following legislative approval. Which cryptocurrencies qualify for the tax reduction? 105 specific digital assets including Bitcoin and Ethereum will be reclassified as financial products eligible for the lower tax rate. How much will investors save with the new tax rate? The tax reduction from 55% to 20% represents substantial savings, potentially increasing net returns by over 60% for high-earning investors. Will all crypto transactions qualify for the lower tax rate? The tax cut applies specifically to the 105 reclassified cryptocurrencies traded on compliant exchanges that meet new disclosure requirements. What disclosure requirements will exchanges face? Exchanges must provide information about issuers, underlying blockchain technology, and price volatility for each listed asset. How will Japan prevent insider trading in crypto markets? The regulations prohibit executives at issuing companies and exchanges from trading based on non-public information. Found this analysis of Japan’s groundbreaking cryptocurrency tax cut helpful?

Peter Schiff: “No Matter What Happens to Bitcoin, MicroStrategy Will End Up Bankrupt” Schiff published an article claiming that STR's business model was “a complete scam” and that the company would inevitably go bankrupt. Schiff announced that he will speak at the Binance Blockchain Week event in Dubai in early December and participate in a discussion on the topic with Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor. The renowned economist stated that regardless of what Bitcoin's long-term fate will be, MicroStrategy's financial sustainability is at serious risk. Schiff's allegations have reignited criticism of Strategy's aggressive Bitcoin strategy, which has been known to divert all of its cash flow and borrowing resources to Bitcoin acquisitions in recent years. While this approach is seen as an innovative corporate strategy by crypto advocates, critics like Schiff have criticized it for involving high leverage and excessive risk. Peter Schiff summarized his controversial statements by saying, “It doesn't matter if Bitcoin's ultimate value drops to zero or rises; Strategy has no chance of surviving with this model.” His discussion with Saylor at the Dubai event is expected to reshape discussions of Bitcoin and corporate strategy. *This is not investment advice.

This landmark initiative brings the discipline, trust and transparency of global financial markets to crypto's most dynamic products, setting a new standard for the industry. Launching on 24 November 2025, these innovative contracts provide a continuous, no-expiry structure favoured by crypto-native communities, combined with the robust clearing and margining standards of listed derivatives. With this launch, investors[1] can access institutional-grade crypto perpetual futures within a regulated, exchange-cleared framework – marking a major step forward in bridging traditional finance and digital asset markets. A Game-Changer for Crypto Markets Perpetual futures account for more than US$187 billion[2] in daily average volumes globally, with Asia at the epicentre of this growth. Yet these flows remain largely priced off and settled on offshore platforms outside of Asia. By bringing these flows on-exchange, SGX will enable institutions to trade and gain exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum with confidence and scale. Michael Syn, President, SGX Group, said, ""Digital assets have made their way into institutional investors' portfolio. We have taken the next logical and deliberate step – applying the same institutional discipline that underpins global markets to crypto's most traded pay-off. By bringing the perpetuals into an exchange-cleared, regulated framework, we offer institutions the trust and scalability they have been waiting for."" The crypto perpetual contracts are benchmarked to iEdge CoinDesk Crypto Indices[3], aligning price discovery with institutional-grade benchmarks widely recognised across the industry. Andy Baehr, Head of Product and Research, CoinDesk Indices, said, ""More than two-thirds of all crypto trading is in derivatives, and perpetual futures offer unique features and benefits that have made them a favourite. We are excited to see SGX Derivatives bring perpetual futures onshore with traditional margining and clearing and are delighted to support the benchmark rate for this innovative contract."" Industry Welcomes Move to Expand institutional Access The launch has drawn encouraging feedback from market participants who view this as a timely and strategic step in advancing access to crypto markets which have become increasingly mainstream. Leonard Hoh, General Manager, Bitstamp by Robinhood – Asia Pacific, said, ""This launch is reflective of how market infrastructure and participation are evolving, and it is exciting to see a Singapore-anchored benchmark to reflect the liquidity we see in Asia. This is an important step for institutions to trade at scale, and we are proud to partner with SGX to provide connectivity to the global crypto ecosystem."" Patrick Yeo, Head of Digital Assets, Global Financial Markets, DBS Bank, said, ""Crypto perpetuals offer institutional traders enhanced precision and capital efficiency when managing their digital asset portfolios as compared to spot trading. In addition, clearing and margining these derivatives under the same standards as traditional instruments paves the way for broader adoption, and marks a new milestone in the growing maturation of the digital asset ecosystem. DBS is pleased to support SGX's launch as a member of its cryptocurrency index committee, and we are committed to sharing our expertise and insights as a pioneer in this space to foster a robust and responsible digital asset ecosystem in Singapore."" Joseph Chang, Co-Founder and CEO, Liquibit Capital, said, ""We are excited to support SGX's crypto perpetual futures launch, a key step in bringing regulated liquidity to Asia's growing digital asset markets. Exceptional performance begins with robust risk management, and SGX's move delivers exactly that."" CJ Fong, APAC General Manager, GSR, said, ""Institutional-grade perpetual futures are a critical milestone in the evolution of crypto markets. By combining SGX's global credibility with crypto-native innovation, we are creating the foundation for scaled, regulated participation in digital assets."" Gracie Lin, CEO, OKX Singapore, said, ""We have seen growing demand for regionally anchored benchmarks, especially as institutions look to integrate crypto exposure alongside other asset classes. It is a natural step in Singapore's market evolution, and this deeper reference point adds transparency and confidence for institutional participants, helping to support long-term growth of the ecosystem."" Melvin Deng, CEO, QCP, said, ""SGX's entry into perpetual futures is a defining moment for Asia digital asset markets. Institutional participants have long sought a regulated venue that combines the familiarity of traditional market infrastructure with the innovation of crypto-native products.

Yet, new projects are emerging with even higher growth potential. Among them, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out the most. Analysts predict that it could surge as much as 28,831% by 2026, which is enough to catch the attention of any early investor. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Best Buy For 2026 Little Pepe isn’t just another meme coin trying to ride the frog wave. It’s a comprehensive ecosystem built on an Ethereum-based Layer 2, specifically designed for meme tokens. This setup means faster, cheaper trades and a fair system that blocks sniper bots. Currently, LILPEPE’s presale is in Stage 13, priced at $0.0022, and it has already sold out 96.49% after raising over $27.4 million out of a $28.7 million target. The presale began back in June 2025, and every stage has sold out quickly. Whales are quietly stacking positions, and retail investors are catching on fast. The project has passed a Certik audit, adding more credibility. What really sets Little Pepe apart is its ability to blend fun with function: offering zero tax on trading, a locked vesting schedule for stability, and a “zero market cap” advantage that provides early buyers with massive upside potential. Its giveaways are also creating waves. The $777k giveaway already has over 524,500 entries, while the Mega Giveaway has over 87,600 entries with prizes worth more than 15 ETH. Add to that upcoming CEX listings and heavy community engagement, and it’s easy to see why experts are calling it the best presale of 2025. If the 28,831% projection plays out, LILPEPE could hit around $0.634 by 2026, turning small investors into early legends. Ethereum (ETH): Still Strong and Rising As of November 12, Ethereum trades around $3,440. ETH recently cooled off after strong gains earlier this year. Still, data from Reuters indicates that major banks and institutions expect it to move toward $6,000 by 2026, provided market conditions remain positive. The network continues to dominate DeFi and AI-based projects, with staking and institutional adoption keeping it a relevant player. So, yes, Ethereum isn’t done rallying but compared to some smaller tokens, its growth might look modest. Pippin (PIPPIN): Small Cap with Big Moves At $0.0347, Pippin has been one of the liveliest new coins on Bybit . Its market cap sits near $34.7 million, and it’s already jumped more than 143% in the last month. PIPPIN is gaining traction as an AI-meme blend coin with strong community backing. With continued bullish momentum, PIPPIN could see aggressive growth by 2026. Analysts believe a move toward $1.20 is possible which would be roughly 34 times the current level. Real (REAL): A Quiet Gem with Upside Potential REAL trades at $0.196 with a small market cap, which means it has plenty of room to grow. It’s part of the new wave of tokens connecting blockchain finance and DeFi innovation. If adoption rises and listings improve, REAL could make some noise in 2026. An optimistic outlook places it between $5.00 and $7.50 in a strong bull run, translating to approximately 38 times growth. With its small base and ties to financial tech trends, REAL could surprise many investors who look beyond the usual names. Look (LOOK): The Underdog of the Group At just $0.0295, LOOK is another small-cap token catching traders' attention. Its market cap hovers near $27 million and its low price gives it massive percentage potential if demand picks up. Recent data from CoinGecko indicate an increase in trading volume, suggesting that investors are starting to take notice.

A Hyperliquid whale has moved in with long bets on a basket of altcoins. A Hyperliquid whale injected over $3.6M to go long on a selection of altcoins. While the market is still volatile and sentiment is low, the whale bets on a directional move, or at least a short-term recovery. A Hyperliquid whale made a selection of altcoins, allocating $3.6M on long positions. The whale chose trending tokens, as well as riskier memes with the potential for a rapid recovery. | Source: Hyperliquid . The whale selected blue chip tokens like ETH and BNB, as well as recently active coins like LTC. The mix also included meme tokens, expecting a directional move for FARTCOIN, PEPE, BONK, PNUT, and POPCAT. The whale also took up new movers like ASTER and MET, but also an older asset, AVAX, in expectations of a breakout. The whale’s selection signals that a market-wide rally may not be possible, but some altcoins are still seen as capable of moving forward with clear moves. The whale holds onto the positions, with an unrealized loss of $276K net , offset by some of the smaller altcoin gains. Hyperliquid whale bets on HYPE Overall, the whale carried a net unrealized loss, mostly based on the performance of HYPE. The position carried an unrealized loss of $293K, while the whale paid over $8,400 in fees to keep holding. HYPE traded at $38.49, near its usual range, still awaiting a more significant breakout. HYPE open interest fluctuates around $1.4B, after a series of liquidations. HYPE carries over 68% long positions among Hyperliquid whales, in the third spot after BTC and ETH. The coin has constant support from traders, despite its mindshare dropping by over 46% recently. The return of whales to Hyperliquid also signals that the risk of the perpetual futures DEX has not discouraged all traders. Hyperliquid currently carries $7.4B in open interest, of which around $2.5B is allocated to smaller altcoins. Traders look for forgotten coins awaiting a breakout The altcoin season index has recently recovered from a local low of 25 points to 43 points. While not all top 100 assets are expanding, there are enough coins and tokens with directional rallies. The long bets on AVAX also grew on Hyperliquid , with trading volumes increasing to a one-month peak. Open interest also grew to $257M, from a recent low of $200M. While altcoins are risky, a bounce from their recent lows, combined with leveraged trading, may produce bigger gains. Perpetual DEXs allow traders to bet on a breakout, without ending up with token holdings. Trending tokens also ensure there is sufficient liquidity to complete trades. Other recent shifts in sentiment show traders see altcoins as viable once again, after the October 11 liquidation. Among potential runners, UNI is seen as making a breakout to a new range, based on the platform’s success in 2025 and eventual profit sharing. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

54520799,628908,1763373110,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54520799.jpeg,Bitcoin Hyper Presale Nears $28M As Harvard Triples Bitcoin ETF Bet,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-presale-harvard-triples-bitcoin-etf-holdings/,"Quick Facts: Harvard’s endowment has made a spot Bitcoin ETF its largest reported US equity holding, signaling growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin. Expanding ETF ownership strengthens the case for Bitcoin-aligned infrastructure that can support faster transactions, DeFi, and more complex on-chain activity. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve Bitcoin’s speed and fee limits with a Bitcoin-anchored Layer 2 powered by Solana Virtual Machine technology. The $HYPER presale, nearing $28M raised, offers early exposure to a utility-driven Bitcoin Layer 2 narrative. Harvard University’s endowment has sent a market signal so loud that you could hear it across Wall Street. Fresh filings just dropped , and they show the Ivy League giant is seriously bullish on crypto. They absolutely massive-ed their stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), boosting it by a whopping 257% from the last quarter when they held 1.9M shares ! That means they now own around 6.8M shares, valued at roughly $442.8M making the ETF its biggest reported US stock holding ahead of names like Microsoft and Amazon. So why is this such a big deal? Well, endowments traditionally only invest in assets such as private equity, real estate, and strategies designed to last 50 years. They hate volatility. When a massive $57B fund lets a Bitcoin product become its flagship asset , it’s not a gamble; it’s a strategic declaration. It means Bitcoin is officially graduating from some nerdy tech toy to a bona fide, long-term portfolio anchor. The gatekeepers are letting it in. The timing is telling. Bitcoin has cooled dramatically to below $95K since its peak near $120K, and ETF flows have been volatile. But what are the smartest, biggest money managers, from Harvard to even some sovereign wealth funds, doing? They’re quietly buying the dip through these easy ETF rails. So, if institutions are buying, what’s the next bottleneck? The ETFs solve the easy parts: access and custody. But they don’t fix the underlying plumbing of Bitcoin: it’s slow, fees can be high, and it can’t run complex smart contracts. That gap is exactly what projects are jumping on. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin Layer 2, is trying to fill that need. And it’s already successfully raised nearly $28M in presale funding, signaling strong confidence. $HYPER Cures Bitcoin’s Ailments, Allowing the OG Digital Asset to Start Swinging Big Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is built around a simple idea: keep Bitcoin’s security, fix its user experience. The project aims to handle everyday transactions, DeFi, and smart contracts on a dedicated Layer 2 while periodically anchoring state back to Bitcoin for final settlement. To do that, the network plans to use a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) execution layer on top of Bitcoin. Execution moves off the base chain, so you get near-instant confirmations and very low fees, while Bitcoin remains the ultimate settlement and security layer. The core pitch is straightforward: send, receive, and interact with Bitcoin in real time, at roughly cent-level fees, without abandoning Bitcoin’s trust model. That design specifically addresses Bitcoin’s most notable pain points. On the base layer, throughput sits around seven transactions per second , and block times average ten minutes. That is fine for a long-term store of value. It is painful for payments, gaming, on-chain trading, or NFTs. By shifting these activities to a high-throughput Layer 2 and anchoring them to Bitcoin every few hours, Bitcoin Hyper aims to transform ‘digital gold’ into usable collateral for an entire application stack. If you want a further project breakdown of the ‘how’, we’ve got you covered in our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide. This is where Harvard’s move and similar ETF flows come back into play. As more capital treats Bitcoin as pristine collateral and macro hedge, demand grows for infrastructure that lets $BTC actually do something useful: earn yield, back stablecoins, move cross-border instantly, or sit inside $BTC-denominated DeFi rails. A Bitcoin-anchored L2 that can support those flows sits right in that narrative. Find out ‘How to Buy Bitcoin Hyper’ here. $HYPER: What the Whales Gather For The market seems to be noticing. The $HYPER presale is nearing the $28M mark and offers staking rewards of approximately 41% for early participants. For a presale, that is deep liquidity and a clear vote of confidence from early backers. Whale buys have been consistently high, with one topping $500K . Big tickets like that do not prove the thesis, but they do show that high-net-worth investors are willing to treat $HYPER as a leveraged bet on the same macro drivers pulling institutions into spot Bitcoin ETFs. From a numbers standpoint, the upside case is easy to understand, even if it remains speculative. Our experts see a potential end-of-2026 high of $0.20 for $HYPER , which would give you a whopping 1405% ROI if you invested at today’s price. If you’re looking beyond pure meme plays, $HYPER offers a mix of narrative, utility, and early-stage entry pricing. Buy your $HYPER today for $0.013285, but hurry, a price increase is coming soon. Remember, this is not intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before making any investments.

Following the market crash, cryptos are regaining momentum. While the major cryptocurrencies dominate the market, the five new altcoins are delivering massive potential. AI-based cryptos are emerging as the next wave of cryptos, with the potential to deliver massive gains. Ozak AI is an AI-based cryptocurrency with a high growth potential and widespread token adoption. Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), XRP (Ripple), Chainlink (LINK), and Avalanche (Avax) are the top five hottest cryptos set to dominate in 2025. Top 5 Cryptos Dominating the 2025 Market With Strong Fundamentals and Real-World Utility Solana (SOL)—Solana is known for its high-speed transactions and very low fees. It now expands across the DeFi and NFTs. Currently the Solana is trading at $154.30 with a market cap of $85.30 billion with a total supply of 613.4 million SOL. After its downfall, the Solona has regained its position and could cross its all-time high by the end of this year. Cardano (ADA) - It is a research-driven blockchain built for its scalability and sustainability. It is focused on real-world adoption through innovation and education. Currently ADA is trading at $0.52 with a massive market cap of $18.95 billion, with a total supply of 44.99 billion ADA. With Hydra upgrades, the Cardona will enter its high-priced range. XRP (Ripple) - It is designed for global payments and cross-border transactions. XRP is currently trading at $2.20 with the $133.30 billion market cap. It is backed by Partnerships with banks and financial institutions. XRP’s regulatory clarity drives the mainstream adoption. Chainlink (LINK)—Chainlink plays a major role in the decentralized data connectivity in the web3 system. It provides trusted oracles that connect smart contracts to real-world data. Currently, Chainlink is trading at $14.60 with a market cap of $10.21 billion. As tokenized assets grow, the demand of Chainlink will increase, and this will make the price surge. Avalanche (Avax) - It is a highly scalable, low-latency blockchain for enterprises. Its subnet enables custom high-performance blockchain networks. Currently, Avalanche is trading at $16.32 with a market cap of $6.97 billion. Avalanche is leading in real-world asset tokenization and has the ability to boom in 2025 and in the upcoming years. Ozak AI Takes the Lead among Top 5 Altcoins Ozak AI is an AI-based early-stage token. Its Core Technology merges AI and blockchain to produce AI predictive tools that can analyze real-time blockchain data. Currently, the token is in its presale phase , priced at $0.014. More than 1 billion tokens have been sold, and $4.46 million has been raised as presale funding so far. Investors believe that AI will rule the cryptocurrency market in the upcoming years, and Ozqak AI will dominate among all the AI-based cryptos. At the time of launch, Ozak AI was launched at the price of $0.001, and now it has a 1,300% increase from the current launch phase. The token's target price is $1. Analysts predict that the token will reach its target price by the end of 2026 and will deliver more than 500x after the launch. Innovative Technology and Partnerships Driving Ozak AI’s Expansion The Ozak AI advanced technology and strong features increase the token's potential and attract investors to invest in it. The primary feature of Ozak AI is the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN). It is made up of three layers, each of which serves a different function. The OSN layer connects to on-chain and off-chain data to provide news and blockchain events. The data layer securely stores all encrypted data. AI later performs AI calculations on a GPU. Another feature is that Ozak Data Vaults are secure storage lockers for Ozak AIb. It stores all financial data in an encrypted format, which is both fast and secure. Collaboration with Echobit , an exchange designed for microsecond-order matching, combined with Ozak AI's 30-ms market prediction. Partnering with Hive Intel , which is a multichain data API, the Ozak AI predictive tools can now analyze the on-chain behavior deeper, which includes NFT, Defi events. Conclusion The top altcoins have the potential to grow, but Ozak AI is in its early stages and has the potential to deliver the highest ROI. These altcoins have already established themselves in the market and have a massive market cap; however, Ozak AI has a strong technology background, strategic partnerships, a very small cap, and a low presale price that makes the early-stage investors wait; if the token launches at a price of $1, they can gain more than these altcoins.

The Singapore Exchange is launching perpetual futures for Bitcoin and Ethereum on November 24, marking a significant milestone in crypto adoption. This strategic move opens new doors for professional investors seeking regulated exposure to digital assets through Singapore Exchange perpetual futures products. What Makes Singapore Exchange Perpetual Futures So Important? Singapore Exchange perpetual futures represent a major step forward for institutional crypto participation. Unlike traditional futures that have expiration dates, perpetual futures continue indefinitely, making them ideal for long-term positions. The Singapore Exchange derivatives arm will offer these products specifically tailored for institutional investors, providing a regulated environment that traditional finance players demand. These innovative contracts will track the iEdge CoinDesk Crypto Indices, which serve as institutional-grade benchmarks. This ensures pricing transparency and reliability that major financial institutions require. Moreover, the Singapore Exchange perpetual futures launch demonstrates how established financial markets are embracing cryptocurrency innovation. Why Should Institutional Investors Pay Attention? The Singapore Exchange perpetual futures offering addresses several key concerns that have previously limited institutional participation: Regulated Environment: Trading occurs within an established, regulated exchange framework Institutional-Grade Infrastructure: Professional trading tools and settlement systems Transparent Pricing: Based on reputable iEdge CoinDesk Crypto Indices Risk Management: Familiar derivatives structure for portfolio protection This development comes at a crucial time when institutions increasingly seek crypto exposure but require traditional market safeguards. The Singapore Exchange perpetual futures platform provides exactly this bridge between conventional finance and digital assets. How Will This Impact Crypto Market Dynamics? The introduction of Singapore Exchange perpetual futures could significantly influence market liquidity and price discovery. Institutional participation typically brings substantial trading volume, which may reduce volatility and improve market efficiency. Additionally, the credibility of the Singapore Exchange name lends legitimacy to cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Market analysts predict this move could trigger similar offerings from other major exchanges worldwide. As more institutions gain comfortable access through regulated venues like Singapore Exchange perpetual futures, we may see increased capital flows into the crypto space. What Challenges Might Investors Face? While Singapore Exchange perpetual futures offer numerous advantages, investors should consider potential challenges. Regulatory requirements may limit participation to qualified institutions initially. Additionally, traders must understand the unique mechanics of perpetual futures, including funding rates that maintain contract prices close to spot market values. However, the Singapore Exchange has extensive experience in derivatives markets, suggesting they’ve designed these products with proper risk management protocols. The use of established indices further mitigates pricing manipulation concerns. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Derivatives The Singapore Exchange perpetual futures launch represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption. By providing institutional investors with regulated access to Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives, this development bridges traditional finance with digital assets. The November 24 launch date marks the beginning of a new chapter where major financial institutions can participate in crypto markets through familiar, trusted channels. Frequently Asked Questions What are perpetual futures? Perpetual futures are derivative contracts without expiration dates, allowing traders to maintain positions indefinitely while paying funding rates to balance long and short positions. Who can trade Singapore Exchange perpetual futures? Initially, these products target institutional investors, though retail access may follow depending on regulatory approvals and exchange policies. How do perpetual futures differ from traditional futures? Traditional futures have specific settlement dates, while perpetual futures continue rolling forward with funding mechanisms instead of expiration. What indices do these futures track? Singapore Exchange perpetual futures track the iEdge CoinDesk Crypto Indices, providing institutional-grade Bitcoin and Ethereum pricing benchmarks. When does trading begin? The official launch date is November 24, as announced by the Singapore Exchange derivatives division. Why is this launch significant?

Following the strong performance of Stage 3, the platform has rolled out the Stage 4 (Harvest) airdrop program and will launch the “ Double Harvest ” trading competition on November 17 with a total reward pool of $10 million. At the same time, Aster continues to scale its early-asset product Rocket Launch , expanding the pipeline of new token activities. These incentive tracks run in parallel, enabling users to earn multiple rewards from the same trading activity, substantially increasing platform engagement and trading depth. The Stage 4 reward pool represents 1.5% of the total $ASTER supply (approximately 120,000,000 $ASTER tokens), distributed evenly across six weekly Epochs. Running concurrently, the $10 million “Double Harvest” competition features five independent weekly leaderboards, allowing users to earn both airdrop rewards and competition rewards from identical trading behavior. Rocket Launch Shows Strong Traction, Emerging as a Key Growth Engine Beyond the airdrop and trading competition, Aster Rocket Launch continues to gain momentum. The product is designed to accelerate early-stage projects by driving liquidity and trading activity. Within its first month, the platform launched 5 new token campaigns, with a cumulative reward pool of more than $3 million. This highlights the growing market demand for early-stage liquidity and ignition mechanisms. Rocket Launch is quickly becoming a gateway for new projects to attract initial liquidity and users, while simultaneously evolving into a major driver of Aster’s broader ecosystem growth. Advancing Infrastructure: Building an On-Chain Order-Book Layer-1 Alongside short-term incentive programs, Aster is accelerating progress on its long-term infrastructure roadmap. During a recent official AMA, the team revealed active development of a high-performance, optionally private on-chain order-book Layer-1, designed to process order placement, matching, and cancellation directly at the protocol layer. The goal is to recreate a CEX-like trading experience fully on-chain—combining transparency, self-custody, and privacy with high-speed execution. Internal testing and an initial public testnet are planned for late 2025, with mainnet launch targeted for Q1 2026. On the product side, Aster will further expand $ASTER’s utility over the next two quarters, including staking, governance, fee discounts, VIP tier benefits, airdrop eligibility, and yield-enhanced integrations with DeFi protocols. The platform has also introduced gold and index perpetuals and plans to broaden its lineup of commodities and equity-related instruments, while deepening integrations with Trust Wallet, Safepal, Math Wallet, Lista DAO, and other ecosystem partners. Expanding Global Presence and Industry Influence Aster’s international visibility also continues to grow. CEO Leonard recently spoke at Binance Campus APAC in Korea, presenting the platform’s infrastructure plans to regional industry leaders. Aster is also set to participate in Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai this December, further strengthening its global footprint. With multi-track incentives, an expanding product ecosystem, and ongoing investment in foundational infrastructure, Aster is shaping a steeper growth curve heading into 2026.

The $BEST presale ends in 11 days, on November 28, with $17M+ already raised and $BEST valued at $0.025955. Investors are already FOMO-diving into the presale, with a recent whale buy of $30,744 setting the pace for the remainder of the presale stage. Self custody is back in fashion. As regulation tightens and exchange blowups fade yet never quite disappear from memory, more users are parking assets in Web3 wallets. And they’re doing everything from swapping to staking without handing over their keys. That shift has put a spotlight on wallet-native tokens. Assets like Trust Wallet Token have shown that fee discounts, early access, and governance can give a wallet coin real staying power when the market turns risk on. This is the backdrop for Best Wallet Token ($BEST), the utility asset behind the Best Wallet ecosystem. The $BEST presale has already raised more than $17M, with the current token price at $0.025955 and headline staking yields in the high double digits, at 76% APY. The sale will reach its final conclusion on November 28, which leaves less than two weeks before the next phase of the project begins. Crucially, much of Best Wallet’s roadmap is still ahead of it. Features like a staking aggregator, Best Card, advanced trading tools, and gas-free transactions are mapped out but not fully live. That makes this final stretch of the presale effectively a bet on whether Best Wallet can turn its existing app into a full DeFi ecosystem over the next couple of years. ➡️ Discover more about the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) in our full review. Best Wallet Aims To Become A DeFi Control Center The Best Wallet app is already live as a non-custodial mobile crypto wallet with coming support for thousands of assets across more than 60 chains. 🔐 It uses Fireblocks’ MPC security, biometric login, and decentralized recovery rather than seed phrases, which is the kind of UX upgrade that helps new users stay on chain without sweating over losing a 12-word backup. The roadmap pushes that idea much further. Phase 3 will bring a portfolio management suite, browser extension, NFT gallery, derivatives trading, and a dedicated staking aggregator that promises higher yields with no extra wallet fees. Phase 4 will add market analytics, limit and stop loss orders, dollar cost averaging, MEV protection, and gas-free transactions, effectively turning the wallet into a full trading terminal. On top of this, Best Wallet hooks into iGaming partnerships and a planned Best Card debit product. 🏆 $BEST holders can earn higher cashback, better bonuses and reduced card fees, which pulls the token into real-world spending and gaming flows rather than leaving it as a pure governance chip. All of that utility revolves around $BEST. The token unlocks reduced swap and purchase fees, higher staking rewards, access to the best crypto presales in the in-app launchpad, and governance rights over future upgrades. If Best Wallet makes good on its plan to grow into a DeFi control center, that value should accrue first to long-term $BEST holders. ➡️ Check out our guide to buying $BEST. Final BEST Presale Phase Targets Yield And Upside The $BEST presale began in November 2024 and has moved through a long ladder of incremental price steps. 💰 After passing the $17M mark and climbing to $0.025955, the token now sits in its final stage, with the presale due to end on November 28. The global crypto wallet market, currently valued at around $15.5B, is forecast to have a hefty CAGR of 26.3%, reaching $110.7B by 2033. Best Wallet plans to dominate 40% of that market by the end of next year, which is why a fully funded roadmap is key. That’s where $BEST’s capital raise matters. Its tokenomics are relatively simple. There is a fixed supply of 10B $BEST. One-quarter is earmarked for product development, more than a third for marketing, and 8% for staking rewards, with the rest split between airdrops, exchange liquidity, community incentives and treasury. That mix leans heavily into growth and user acquisition, which makes sense for a wallet trying to win that 40% share in a crowded market. 🚀 Given Best Wallet’s ecosystem utility and long-term goals, our price prediction for $BEST sees it potentially reaching $0.05106175 by the end of 2026, once the implementation phase kicks off. Using the current presale price of $0.025955, that implies potential upside of close to 97% to the 2026 high, although actual performance will depend on adoption, listings and macro conditions. This performance and price projection makes $BEST one of the best crypto presales of 2025. Investors continue to tune in, with a recent $30,744 whale buy setting the pace for the rest of the remaining 11 days. Ready to jump in? Buy $BEST before the presale ends.

While this new regulation enhances anti–money laundering measures by making certain transactions traceable, it also introduces new challenges in maintaining user convenience. The question now is how Japan can protect investor trust while increasing transparency—a balance the market continues to search for. Explore Japan’s crypto regulations and market transparency on https://oncasitown.com/ The Travel Rule and “Partial Transparency” In 2023, Japan implemented the Travel Rule based on international standards, requiring the sharing of sender and recipient information in crypto transfers. This measure plays a crucial role in preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, marking a step forward in strengthening trust across the crypto industry. However, full traceability has not yet been achieved. While information sharing among exchanges has improved, transfers between personal wallets remain partly opaque—resulting in what can be called “partial transparency.” This policy has improved transaction safety, but users who value privacy have raised concerns. The Japanese market is currently in a transition phase, trying to balance regulatory control with the freedom of financial movement. Stricter Regulations and Shifts in Investor Sentiment Japan is known for having some of the strictest crypto regulations in Asia. Under the Financial Services Agency (FSA), exchanges must be registered and are required to segregate customer funds. This framework has significantly enhanced security, but also imposed limitations that some investors view as restrictive. In 2024, Japan eased token listing standards, fueling optimism for market revitalization. Yet, complex tax rules and restrictions on overseas exchanges remain psychological and operational barriers for many investors. As a result, market activity and capital flows have fluctuated, with more individual investors adopting a cautious approach. Striking the right balance between safety and freedom has become one of the key challenges for Japan’s crypto ecosystem. Balancing Transparency and Privacy Finding harmony between “transparency” and “privacy” remains one of Japan’s biggest crypto challenges. While improving transaction traceability enhances fraud prevention and user protection, excessive oversight risks undermining individual freedom. The real question is where to draw the line between assurance and anonymity. Some welcome stronger oversight, but others worry about privacy violations as personal data sharing expands. Japan must build systems that strengthen trust without unnecessary intrusion. Meanwhile, new approaches are emerging to combine fairness and privacy through blockchain’s inherent transparency. Ongoing collaboration between technology and regulation will determine how mature and resilient Japan’s crypto market becomes. Future Outlook — Oncasitown’s Perspective Looking ahead, Japan’s crypto market is expected to evolve in line with global standards, particularly through alignment with FATF guidelines. These reforms will likely enhance transparency, safety, and international cooperation. At the same time, the number of domestic and international users seeking both transparency and transactional freedom continues to grow. The challenge is to create a regulatory framework that protects trust while accommodating diverse user needs. At Oncasitown, we analyze these developments from both an investment and entertainment perspective, delivering insights that help readers navigate Japan’s fast-changing crypto environment. Providing reliable, accessible information in this evolving landscape remains our mission. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This strategic partnership combines Ant Group’s fintech expertise with UBS’s banking prowess, promising faster and more efficient international money transfers. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and financial professionals alike, this collaboration signals a major step toward mainstream adoption of blockchain technology in traditional banking systems. What Makes This Blockchain-Based Cross-Border Payments Partnership Unique? The memorandum of understanding between Ant International and UBS represents more than just another fintech collaboration. These industry giants plan to leverage UBS Digital Cash, the bank’s proprietary blockchain payment platform launched last year. Moreover, they will explore tokenized deposits using Ant’s blockchain platform called Whale. This dual-platform approach creates a comprehensive solution for blockchain-based cross-border payments that addresses both immediate transaction needs and future financial innovations. How Will Blockchain Technology Transform Cross-Border Transactions? Traditional international payments often face significant challenges including: Slow processing times spanning multiple days High transaction fees eating into transfer amounts Complex regulatory compliance requirements Limited transparency throughout the payment journey Blockchain-based cross-border payments directly address these pain points by enabling near-instant settlements, reducing intermediary costs, and providing transparent tracking. The UBS Digital Cash platform specifically designed for institutional use brings regulatory compliance built into its architecture, making blockchain-based cross-border payments more accessible to traditional financial institutions. What Benefits Can Users Expect From This Collaboration? This partnership promises substantial advantages for businesses and individuals conducting international transactions. The integration of Ant’s Whale platform for tokenized deposits could create seamless bridges between traditional banking and digital assets. Furthermore, blockchain-based cross-border payments typically offer: Enhanced security through distributed ledger technology Reduced costs by eliminating multiple intermediaries Faster processing with near real-time settlement Greater transparency with immutable transaction records These improvements could make international business more accessible to smaller enterprises and individual users who previously found cross-border transactions prohibitively expensive or complex. What Challenges Might This Initiative Face? Despite the promising potential, implementing blockchain-based cross-border payments at scale presents several hurdles. Regulatory alignment across different jurisdictions remains a complex challenge, as financial authorities worldwide approach blockchain technology with varying levels of acceptance. Additionally, integrating legacy banking systems with new blockchain infrastructure requires significant technical expertise and investment. However, the combined resources of Ant International and UBS position them well to navigate these obstacles and advance blockchain-based cross-border payments toward widespread adoption. The Future of Blockchain-Based Cross-Border Payments This partnership between Ant International and UBS represents a significant milestone in the evolution of global finance. As these established financial players embrace blockchain technology, they lend credibility to the entire ecosystem. The success of their blockchain-based cross-border payments initiative could encourage other traditional institutions to explore similar solutions, potentially accelerating the transformation of global financial infrastructure. This collaboration demonstrates that blockchain technology has matured beyond theoretical potential into practical, enterprise-grade solutions for real-world financial challenges. Frequently Asked Questions What is UBS Digital Cash? UBS Digital Cash is a blockchain-based payment platform developed by UBS that enables institutional clients to conduct transactions using digital tokens representing real-world currencies. How does Ant’s Whale platform work? Whale is Ant Group’s blockchain platform designed to support tokenized assets, including deposits, enabling seamless conversion between traditional and digital financial instruments. When will these blockchain payment services become available? Specific timelines haven’t been announced, as the partnership is currently at the memorandum of understanding stage, indicating further development and regulatory approvals are needed. Will individual consumers benefit from this partnership? While initially focused on institutional clients, successful implementation could eventually lead to consumer-facing products offering improved cross-border payment options. How secure are blockchain-based cross-border payments? Blockchain technology provides enhanced security through cryptographic protection and distributed ledger systems that make transactions tamper-resistant and transparent. What makes this partnership different from other blockchain payment initiatives? The combination of Ant’s extensive fintech experience in Asian markets with UBS’s global banking presence creates a uniquely positioned collaboration with potential for widespread impact.

Harvard Triples Stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs as Bitcoin Hyper Becomes the Next Crypto to Explode November 17, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Harvard Management Company just tripled its stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs as the company pumped its share holdings to 6.8M IBIT , worth over $442.8M. This comes several months after Harvard announced it was holding $116M-worth of IBIT in 1.9M shares. Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, stated that Harvard’s involvement validates BlackRock’s IBIT: It’s super rare/difficult to get an endowment to bite on an ETF- esp a Harvard or Yale, it’s as good a validation as an ETF can get. —Eric Balchunas, X Post The announcement could cause some of the hype to spill into Bitcoin, which is currently trading at little over $95K. Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $27.8M presale will likely leech some of the hyper, as the $HYPER is on track to become the next crypto to explode.

54521374,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/falcon-finance-commits-to-higher-transparency-standard-for-its-usdf-stablecoin,1763373659,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/54521374.jpeg,Falcon Finance Commits to Higher Transparency Standard for Its USDf Stablecoin,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/falcon-finance-commits-to-higher-transparency-standard-for-its-usdf-stablecoin,"Falcon Finance, the synthetic dollar protocol whose TVL has been climbing all year, has unveiled a new transparency and security framework for USDf. The all-new standard being rolled out by Falcon is a reflection of both demand from its users and the level it aspires to reach now that the supply of its yield-bearing stablecoin has surpassed $2B. No longer the plucky contender, USDf has evolved into a major player and serious rival to USDe. Falcon’s stablecoin protocol enables users to lock crypto assets as collateral – including plain stablecoins such as USDT and USDC – and to mint USDf. After minting the synthetic stablecoin, they can then earn yield on it through staking it in the Falcon Finance dashboard – and additionally utilize the liquid token they receive in return to explore further earning opportunities across the DeFi ecosystem. The launch of a new transparency framework attests to the progress USDf has made this year – and indicates where Falcon’s DeFi protocol is headed next. Transparency as a Service While USDf has had a very good year, the broader yield-bearing stablecoin sector has encountered the occasional speed-bump, the latest being the depeg of Stream’s xUSD, whose yield strategies were found to be deviating from delta-neutral sources – despite what its founders had claimed to the contrary. While not a USDf problem, it’s understandable that Falcon Finance should have used the opportunity to reassure users that USDf is fully backed – and that its yield is fully sustainable. Unveiling its new risk management framework, Falcon’s Andrei Garchev said: “Users should never have to guess what is backing their assets or how risk is being managed. If USDf is to serve as collateral and a yield instrument for serious builders and institutions, its reserves, custody, and controls must be transparent by default and validated by independent experts.” Putting It All on the Table Falcon Finance had already released a transparency dashboard that reveals key metrics concerning the backing for its native stablecoin, full breakdown of reserves, and yield strategy allocation. This framework has since been further enhanced by the addition of new metrics that provide an unprecedented insight into the security and risk-management parameters built into USDf . After staking USDf to create sUSDf, Falcon users can tap into a yield-bearing token that leverages diversified, institutional-grade trading strategies. Not only does Falcon enable users to view near real-time data points concerning USDf’s backing and supply, but it enlists independent auditors to provide attestation. Coupled with third-party smart contract audits, these measures have bolstered confidence in USDf, contributing to its growing adoption by retail DeFi users and institutions too. Falcon Finance believes that it can attract clients, including Web3 projects overseeing Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), seeking yield that beats the returns available from ETH staking. With yield for staked USDf currently standing at over 9%, it’s currently delivering around 2x that benchmark. Falcon’s decision to provide full transparency into its operations should help to further grow TVL while driving greater institutional adoption of yield-bearing stablecoins, now a $15B sector.

54521161,https://timestabloid.com/?p=89811,1763373659,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analysts Say This $0.035 Altcoin Could Outperform Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2026, Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/analysts-say-this-0-035-altcoin-could-outperform-dogecoin-doge/,"A growing number of crypto analysts believe a new low-priced DeFi token could see stronger growth in 2026 than some of the biggest meme coins on the market. One name keeps coming up in these discussions, and many early buyers say its early traction is hard to ignore. The token is still under $0.05, but its roadmap progress and rising demand have made it a major topic in the altcoin market. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin remains one of the largest meme coins in the market. At the moment, DOGE trades near $0.16 with a market cap of around $24 billion, which already puts it among the top crypto assets. This also makes Dogecoin one of the hardest tokens to push higher in percentage terms. DOGE continues to face heavy resistance in the $0.20 to $0.22 range. Each time the price approaches this zone, sellers step in and slow down any momentum. Dogecoin is also still far below its all time high near $0.73. With its current market cap, analysts say a major surge is unlikely. Some even project that DOGE may only see a mild recovery of around 1.5x in 2026-2027 due to its limited utility and strong competition from newer tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new DeFi crypto project that is building a dual lending system designed to support both simple lending markets and more flexible borrowing tools. The protocol aims to offer a safer and more open lending experience for everyday users. It focuses on transparent smart contracts and a roadmap that explains how the system will evolve from testnet to full deployment. The MUTM presale has gained strong traction. The token is priced at $0.035 in Phase 6. So far, the project has raised $18.7 million, gathered 18,000 holders, and sold about 800 million tokens. Out of the 4 billion total supply, 45.5%, or roughly 1.82 billion, is allocated to the presale. Phase 6 is already over 88% allocated, showing consistent demand. 3 Reasons Why MUTM Could Outperform DOGE in 2026 1. Dogecoin’s High Market Cap Limits Growth, MUTM Has More Room to Expand DOGE sits at a massive market cap. Large assets with such size usually move much slower because it takes far more liquidity and interest to lift the price. Dogecoin’s early runs were possible because it had a tiny market cap and gained hype quickly. That phase is now over. MUTM is the opposite. It is still in its early stages with a low entry price and ongoing development. This gives it much more room for higher percentage growth as the protocol expands and the product reaches testnet and mainnet. 2. Dogecoin Is a Meme Coin, MUTM Is Utility Driven Dogecoin remains a meme coin with limited real use. It is mostly driven by social trends, and this can be unreliable. It also does not offer meaningful utility features such as yield generation or borrowing tools. It has no built-in mechanics that support long term growth. Mutuum Finance is built around real utility. The protocol uses mtTokens, which represent a user’s share in the liquidity pool. These mtTokens increase in value as interest is generated. The platform also uses a buy and distribute model where part of the platform revenue is used to buy MUTM from the market and redistribute it to users who stake mtTokens. This creates steady buy pressure that DOGE does not have. 3. Timing: Early DOGE Buyers Are Rotating Into MUTM Many early Dogecoin investors are now looking for new opportunities because they know DOGE’s growth window has slowed. With Mutuum Finance preparing for its first testnet release and gaining strong presale momentum, more investors are paying attention. The official statement on X confirmed that the V1 launch is set for Q4 2025, which adds even more excitement around the project. Presale Strength Mutuum Finance continues to show fast progress. The presale is advancing rapidly with Phase 6 nearing full allocation. The platform has a daily 24 hour leaderboard, where the top contributor receives rewards. This system keeps the presale active and transparent. The project also accepts MUTM payment by card, making entry easier for new buyers and removing limits on purchase size. This has helped accelerate the adoption rate. Security is another key point. The protocol completed a CertiK audit with a 90 out of 100 score, which gives investors confidence as development moves forward. Dogecoin’s massive market cap and lack of utility make high percentage gains difficult. Mutuum Finance, by contrast, is at an early growth stage with a working roadmap, strong token mechanics, and a presale that continues to expand at a fast pace. With V1 approaching in Q4 2025 and more investors rotating from older meme coins into utility projects, analysts believe MUTM could see stronger performance in 2026.

Here’s Why He’s Not Bearish,https://timestabloid.com/expert-spots-incoming-xrp-death-cross-heres-why-hes-not-bearish/,"Ledger Man (@strivex_), a crypto influencer and commentator on X, has highlighted the appearance of a death cross on XRP’s daily chart. While this signal is bearish, he offered a view that compares common expectations, adding another angle for market participants to consider. $XRP DEATH CROSS INCOMING! History repeat itself. pic.twitter.com/bXzQNnw2Mr — Ledger Man (@strivex_) November 15, 2025 Historical Context of the Signal In his video, he stated that the recent death cross should not cause concern because similar events preceded significant rallies in prior cycles. He said the pattern in 2017 “marked the exact low” of that market period before XRP advanced sharply. During that cycle, XRP rose from $0.006 to $3.36 in early 2018. The increase reached about 55,900%. He also noted that a similar death cross in 2020 “marked the exact low” of that bear market. XRP then moved from about $0.115 to $1.96 in 2021, gaining roughly 1,604%. His comments reflect a view that the current setup may repeat those earlier moves even though many traders usually interpret a death cross as a negative signal. He emphasized that the same pattern now appears again and suggested that XRP “is most likely about to go much higher.” XRP Potential Price Projections Market observers now evaluate how the historical gains compare with today’s price. XRP recently traded near $2.18. Applying the percentage increase from the 2017 cycle would produce a theoretical target far above typical market expectations. A gain of 55,900% from $2.18 would place XRP at about $1,220. Using the 1,604% rise recorded after the 2020 death cross would generate a target of over $37. While other traders have warned about a potential decline due to this death cross , Ledger Man’s analysis suggests a massive bull run for the digital asset. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These figures rely on historical percentage changes and do not consider new conditions, but they illustrate the magnitude of the moves that followed earlier death crosses. Market Outlook Current sentiment varies as traders assess technical signals in market activity. Some might dig deeper, monitoring trading volume and momentum to determine whether the present setup matches earlier cycles. Others may take a cautious approach to evaluate macro conditions alongside chart patterns. Ledger Man expressed confidence in this prediction, backed by historical data.

However, with the advent of on-chain tech, this status quo is going through a major revamp, with ‘personal intelligence layers’ (PIL) representing one of the more intriguing evolutions in this context (at least over the last couple of years). Rather than forcing users to choose between privacy and participation, these layers allow users to maintain encrypted control over their data while simultaneously enabling AI systems to process that information for personalized insights. In fact, the privacy-preserving AI market has fast gained traction and is expected to grow at an annual rate of 27% over the next four year stretch. The broader implications of these PILs, therefore, challenges fundamental assumptions about ownership and monetization because rather than accepting the notion that personal information needs to be surrendered to access digital services, decentralized models can treat data as assets users can control, selectively share, and potentially monetize. All of this is especially pertinent in light of recent policy shifts such as the EU's Data Act, (implemented in 2023) which encourage open access to financial data while maintaining privacy protections. Therefore, as AI agents become more capable of executing complex tasks, they need negotiation frameworks and commitment mechanisms to interact with each other as well as human users. In this regard, intent-based architectures are perfect as they allow agents to operate across different systems while maintaining security and reliability guarantees.​ Exploring the industry’s evolution toward actionable insights Since the turn of the decade, specific implementations have begun translating personal intelligence concepts into accessible consumer products, with products like ConsumerFi building infrastructure that converts fragmented consumer data into what can be best described as ""user-owned intelligence."" The system operates through an encrypted data structure called ‘ConsumerGraph,’ which functions as a portable memory bank of digital activity, leveraging NEAR AI for private data processing and NEAR Intents for executing actions across multiple blockchains. This transforms everyday interactions into financial opportunities, be it earning rewards for data sharing or making investment decisions based on personalized insights. Most recently, ConsumerFi made its debut on the popular launchpad Calyx, making these privacy-centric concepts even more accessible to a broader audience. The token sale began on November 13, offering 25 million CFI tokens (approx 2.5% of its total billion-token supply), with participation requiring only connecting a wallet on any supported chain and deploying assets through a single transaction. The sale reached its funding target in just 1.5 hours. Notably, the funding target was reached ahead of schedule, with seven days remaining in the sale window, thus unearthing a lot of market validation for the technology. In addition to this, ConsumerFi has also secured investments for major crypto-native entities such as Animoca Brands, Morningstar Ventures, Cypher Capital, Shima Capital, and the NEAR Foundation. 🪷 Funding Target Reached! 🪷Meaning: you still have 7 days to participate in the @ConsumerFi sale ✨Calyx 🪷 pic.twitter.com/i3EkT1dirE — Calyx (@Calyxdotxyz) November 13, 2025 That said, what distinguishes this launch from other token offerings is the existing scale operating behind it as ConsumerFi already operates across applications totaling more than 170 million downloads. A market shift toward personal intelligence layers is in the offing As agentic solutions continue to proliferate, it is only natural that the infrastructure managing consumer data worldwide (and therefore enabling private AI processing) will become increasingly critical.​ And while scalability and interoperability concerns definitely exist, platforms like ConsumerFi are ushering in a much required shift, one where privacy and verification can be balanced. That said, the fundamental proposition that individuals should be able to own their data and benefit monetarily when it creates value, seems to be resonating with demographics and geographies across the board. Therefore, as the landscape matures and more implementations reach production scale, personal intelligence layers will increasingly represent an inevitable evolution of how the internet handles information for the years to come.

The HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) said last week that the launch transitions the initiative from a sandbox experiment to a live value-bearing settlement. The HKMA described the project as pivotal for the country’s crypto roadmap, adding that the city is working towards becoming the region’s crypto hub. The new pilot is expected to operate through 2026 and will initially focus on treasury management, tokenized money-market fund transactions, and real-time liquidity. The Hong Kong de facto central bank initiated the sandbox for Project Ensemble in August 2024, aiming to integrate tokenization into traditional banking through the e-HKD. The sandbox has enabled banks and industry partners to experiment with tokenized deposits and test end-to-end crypto settlement. The HKMA also stated that the HKD Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system will support inter-bank settlements under the pilot. It pointed out that the environment will be upgraded over time to support around-the-clock (24/7) tokenized central bank money (CeBM) settlement. Yue says Ensemble Sandbox concepts are now live The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Eddie Yue, said EnsembleTX marks a pivotal moment in the HKMA’s journey. He pointed out that the concepts and details tested in the Ensemble Sandbox are now live and being applied in real-value transactions to deliver tangible benefits. Meanwhile, the HKMA said this milestone reinforces Hong Kong’s role as a pioneer in shaping the future of digital finance. The central bank institution has invited stakeholders with innovative, real-world use cases that leverage tokenized deposits to participate in this collaborative effort to develop the tokenization ecosystem in Hong Kong. “To scale tokenization of investment products, interoperability is key…A critical step in that direction is today’s initiative announced by the HKMA which will gradually allow interbank settlement of tokenized deposits in real time 24/7.” – Julia Leung , CEO of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) Leung said the SFC is committed to working with the HKMA and market participants in driving tokenization use cases leveraging Ensemble TX forward. She believes this will help establish a dynamic and future-ready financial ecosystem in Hong Kong. HSBC completes first transaction in EnsembleTX The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation completed the first transaction in EnsembleTX on November 13. Ant International transferred $489,000 (~HK$3.8M) in this inaugural transaction to its wallet held at another domestic bank. Vincent Lau, HSBC’s global head of Digital Money and Global Payments Solutions, said the interoperability marks a crucial step for Hong Kong to become a global hub for innovation in crypto. Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong), a subsidiary of Standard Chartered PLC, also completed two transactions leveraging two real-value use cases in EnsembleTX. The first case involved interbank tokenized deposit transfers among Ant International entities. Meanwhile, the second case involved the transfer of tokenized deposits to help Futu Securities International (Hong Kong) subscribe to China Asset Management (Hong Kong)’s tokenized money market fund (MMF). Mary Huen, the CEO of Standard Chartered (Hong Kong) and Greater China and North Asia, said the success of these real-value transactions use cases demonstrated the massive potential of tokenized assets in facilitating interbank settlements. She also noted that tokenized deposits will play an integral role in the next generation of financial market infrastructure. The 2025 Policy Address unveiled plans to push Project Ensemble, encouraging commercial banks to introduce tokenized deposits and promote the live trading of tokenized assets. The HKMA and the SFC will collaborate to advance the practical applications of tokenization across a diverse range of asset classes. The two have also vowed to expand EnsembleTX’s use cases to cover more sectors within the financial industry.

Digital asset funds just witnessed their largest weekly outflow since February, with a staggering $2 billion pulled out in just seven days. This massive movement signals growing investor concern and highlights the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments. Why Are Digital Asset Funds Bleeding Money? According to CoinShares’ latest report, the outflow from digital asset funds reached alarming levels last week. The United States dominated these withdrawals, accounting for nearly 98% of the total outflows. This represents the most significant capital flight from cryptocurrency investment products we’ve seen in months. The breakdown by asset reveals even more concerning patterns: Bitcoin investment products suffered $1.38 billion in outflows Ethereum products recorded $689 million in withdrawals Total assets under management dropped 27% to $191 billion What’s Driving This Massive Capital Flight? CoinShares points to two primary factors behind this dramatic outflow from digital asset funds. First, uncertainty surrounding monetary policy has made investors increasingly cautious. Second, broader selling pressure across cryptocurrency markets has created a domino effect. The timing couldn’t be more telling. Total assets under management in digital asset exchange-traded products have fallen sharply from their October peak of $264 billion. This represents a significant contraction in the institutional cryptocurrency space. How Does This Impact Your Crypto Investments? When digital asset funds experience such substantial outflows, it affects the entire ecosystem. Large-scale withdrawals can: Increase market volatility Put downward pressure on prices Signal changing investor sentiment Impact liquidity across exchanges However, it’s crucial to remember that outflows from digital asset funds don’t necessarily predict long-term trends. Historical data shows that cryptocurrency markets often experience cycles of inflows and outflows. What Does the Future Hold for Digital Asset Funds? The current situation with digital asset funds reflects broader market uncertainties. While the $2 billion outflow seems dramatic, it represents a natural market correction following previous growth periods. Institutional interest in digital asset funds remains strong despite short-term fluctuations. As regulatory frameworks evolve and market infrastructure improves, digital asset funds are likely to continue attracting institutional capital. The current outflow may present buying opportunities for long-term investors who believe in the fundamental value of blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the $2 billion outflow from digital asset funds? The outflow resulted from combined factors including monetary policy uncertainty and broader selling pressure across cryptocurrency markets. Which country saw the largest withdrawals? The United States accounted for $1.97 billion of the total $2 billion outflow from digital asset funds. How much did Bitcoin and Ethereum products lose?

This essentially indicates a growing divergence between activity on Binance and behavior in institutional channels. Retail Selling vs Institutional Absorption Data shows Bitcoin exchange inflows on Binance have surged sharply in recent days, as the figure rose from 5,500 BTC to nearly 15,000 BTC on November 14. CryptoQuant stated that this spike points to intense selling pressure from short-term holders and traders unwinding long positions as prices fell. Additionally, the Binance BTC RHODL Inflow indicator shows a notable increase in the share of younger coins entering the exchange, alongside an almost complete collapse in older coin inflows. Such a pattern is evidence that panicked short-term investors, not long-term holders, are behind the selling. The same cannot be said for institutional activity, which appears far more measured. Balances at OTC desks have been found to have climbed to roughly 156,000 BTC, after rising by nearly 7,300 BTC over the past month. This has been identified as the highest level since August. While this does not indicate aggressive institutional buying, CryptoQuant explained that institutions are not selling into the downturn and are instead quietly absorbing liquidity off-exchange. This steady accumulation is occurring without any major acceleration in demand, which could mean that institutions are using the pullback to reposition rather than exit. Redistribution Or Bear Market? Even as prices retreat, long-term investor appetite for Bitcoin is only strengthening. For instance, the Accumulator Addresses Demand indicator has now climbed past 352,000 BTC, with its 30-day moving average rising steadily. This trend shows that committed, long-horizon buyers are continuing to add to their positions, which confirms that Bitcoin is slowly moving out of weaker hands and into more resilient, patient portfolios. According to the analytics platform, the market is now in a redistribution phase, where Bitcoin moves out of speculative, short-term holdings and into the portfolios of larger and more committed investors. Such transitions have historically led to periods of stabilization and can help lay the groundwork for renewed upside momentum if institutional demand continues. However, not all interpret the recent market behavior through the same lens. Kobeissi Letter, for one, believes that the crypto asset has officially entered a structural bear market, one driven not by weak fundamentals but by deep mechanical pressures. Excess leverage, thin liquidity, and more than $1 billion wipeouts across multiple sessions clearly mean that the market is breaking under its own weight.
