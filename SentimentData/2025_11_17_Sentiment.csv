The company’s total revenue surged to $10.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, which ended September 30. This is a 1,100% year-over-year increase from the $0.9 million reported in the same period last year. The sharp rise was primarily attributed to the strong performance of SharpLink’s ETH holdings and its strategic deployment within the Ethereum ecosystem. Q3 Results Show ETH Strategy at Core According to the official press release, net income for the quarter soared to $104.3 million, or $0.62 per fully diluted share, in a stark reversal from a net loss of $885,000 in Q3 2024. As of September 30th, the company’s crypto assets stood at $3.0 billion, including 817,747 ETH, which comprised both native and liquid staking tokens. By November 9, SharpLink’s ETH position had further grown to 861,251 ETH. The company also reported $11.1 million in cash and $26.7 million in USDC stablecoins on its balance sheet. Commenting on the financial results, the company’s co-CEO Joseph Chalom said, “SharpLink is pioneering a new model for publicly traded ETH treasury companies – one that marries the agility of an active asset manager with the transparency of a public company. Our ability to dynamically manage capital, pursue sophisticated compounding yield strategies, and partner with many of the most revered names in the Ethereum ecosystem, puts SharpLink in pole position as the Ethereum institutional supercycle accelerates.” SharpLink’s Strategic Moves On the operation side of things, SharpLink made several moves throughout the quarter to strengthen its position as a leading Ethereum treasury operator. In August, its Board of Directors approved a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, under which 1.94 million shares were repurchased for approximately $31.6 million by quarter-end. In September, the Nasdaq-listed company partnered with Superstate to launch tokenized SBET on Ethereum. The following month, SharpLink roped in Matthew Sheffield as Chief Investment Officer, Mandy Campbell as Chief Marketing Officer, and Michael Camarda as Chief Data Officer. Around the same time, the company completed a $76.5 million registered direct offering, priced at a 12% premium to its share price and above the net asset value of its ETH treasury. SharpLink also revealed plans to deploy $200 million worth of ETH from its corporate treasury onto Linea, an Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by Consensys. The funds will be managed through Anchorage Digital Bank, its custodian, and invested across staking, restaking, and AI-driven yield strategies on Linea’s zkEVM framework. This approach is designed to generate diversified ETH-based returns by combining Ethereum staking rewards, EigenCloud restaking incentives, and Linea’s native yield programs.

The Fear & Greed Index now sits at 10, marking extreme fear among investors. This drop signals growing pessimism across the cryptocurrency market. The leading digital asset has fallen below critical technical levels. Both the 7-day and 30-day moving averages now sit above the current price. This pattern indicates deteriorating momentum across short and medium timeframes. Bitcoin has declined 9.81% over the past week. The price dropped beneath the psychologically important $100,000 threshold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $94,211. Large-scale holders have accelerated their selling activity. These ”whales” control substantial portions of the circulating supply. Their distribution pattern has intensified downward pressure. BTC weekly price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Institutional Interest Weakens Amid Tech Correlation U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded notable outflows . These vehicles offer institutional investors regulated exposure to cryptocurrencies. Declining inflows suggest professional money managers are reducing positions. The digital asset maintains a negative correlation with the Nasdaq 100 index. This relationship creates asymmetric risk during periods of volatility in the technology sector. Bitcoin tends to fall more sharply when tech stocks decline than it rises during tech rallies. Recent technology sector weakness has amplified cryptocurrency losses. Analytics platform Santiment recorded a four-month peak in Bitcoin discussions on Friday. This spike occurred as the price dropped below $95,000. The surge in conversation volume reflects widespread uncertainty among retail participants. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt dominate social channels and trading forums. Death Cross Formation Sparks Technical Debate A new death cross has formed on Bitcoin's chart. This occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a longer-term average. The pattern traditionally signals bearish momentum. Analyst Benjamin Cowen notes these formations often coincide with local market lows. Previous death crosses marked short-term bottom formations. However, he emphasizes that the pattern functions as a lagging indicator. It confirms trends already underway rather than predicting future movements. Cowen outlined two potential scenarios for the coming weeks. If the current market cycle remains intact, a bounce should materialize soon. Price action over the next seven days will prove critical. Evidence of support and accumulation would suggest buyers remain engaged. The alternative scenario involves continued weakness. If no rebound develops, further downside becomes likely. The price would eventually gravitate toward the 200-day moving average. This level represents a longer-term trend gauge. A rally to that average could form a macro lower high. This development would mark a significant structural shift in the market cycle.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-16 20:39:18

The surge in volume, particularly in major tokens like XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether, suggests the market is attracting significant interest from local investors. However, smaller altcoins like Lagrange (LA), SOON, RESOLV, and Starknet (STRK) also saw rapid gains. The picture that emerges when the data from the two exchanges is combined reveals that there are large jumps in volumes and some altcoins stand out with purchases centered in South Korea. Here is the list of altcoins with the highest trading volume in South Korea in the last 24 hours: XRP – $358 million USDT – $244.4 million Bitcoin (BTC) – $260.3 million Ethereum (ETH) – $187.1 million Solana (SOL) – $92.9 million Lagrange (LA) – $68.1 million WalletConnect Token (WCT) – $48.6 million Dogecoin (DOGE) – $45.6 million SOON – $44.5 million Resolv (RESOLV) – $42.3 million Starknet (STRK) – $38.4 million Zora (ZORA) – $29.9 million 0G – $28.3 million Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) – $13.9 million Filecoin (FIL) – $20.4 million AWE Network (AWE) – $19.9 million Cardano (ADA) – $16.6 million *This is not investment advice.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who spoke on the network’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” said the agreement is coming together after the meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping in South Korea, and he made it clear this timeline is what both governments are working toward. Scott said the deal follows the framework agreement both sides announced last month. That agreement stopped Washington from hitting Chinese imports with 100% tariffs, and in return, Beijing paused its plan to bring in a new export licensing system that would have restricted access to rare earth minerals and magnets. These minerals are essential to U.S. manufacturing, defense systems, and crypto mining hardware, so the pressure around this piece of trade has been intense. Scott said, “I am confident that post our meeting in Korea between the two leaders, President Trump, President Xi, that China will honor their agreements,” and he delivered that line with the expectation that the rare earths issue is close to being wrapped up. Scott also pushed back on a Wall Street Journal report that said Chinese officials planned to restrict rare earth supplies to American companies with military ties. He said that the claim was wrong and said he expects Beijing to follow the commitments made in Korea. With that, he tried to shut down speculation that China would use rare earths as leverage in the defense space. USDA numbers show weak Chinese demand for U.S. soybeans While Scott tried to show confidence about rare earths, a different part of the Trump‑Xi meeting is already falling apart. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released new data showing only two Chinese purchases of American soybeans since the summit in Korea. Those two shipments totaled 332,000 metric tons, which is nowhere close to the 12 million metric tons that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China agreed to buy by January. It also falls far short of the 25 million metric tons Brooke said China would buy in each of the next three years. Farmers had hopes that China, their biggest customer, would return to buying U.S. soybeans after the summit. But Tanner Ehmke, the lead economist for grains and oilseed at CoBank, said China has no reason to rush back to the U.S. market. Tanner explained that China already has large supplies from Brazil and other South American countries, and because U.S. soybeans still face a 24% tariff, even after a 10‑point cut, American beans remain more expensive. Tanner said, “We are still not even close to what has been advertised from the U.S. in terms of what the agreement would have been,” and made it clear that Beijing has not confirmed any detailed purchase promises. Beijing has only said there is “consensus” on expanding trade in farm goods. Tanner said even if China did agree to buy soybeans, the agreement might only apply if prices drop to a level Beijing considers attractive. That leaves the farm side of the Trump‑Xi deal floating in uncertainty. Soybean prices drop as Trump says China will buy more Trump told reporters on Sunday that his team spoke with Chinese officials and were told that China will be buying more soybeans, though he did not say how much. Trump said, “They’re in the process of doing not only a little bit but they’ll be doing a lot of soybean purchases,” but without numbers or timing, markets were not convinced. On Friday, soybean prices dropped 23 cents to $11.24 per bushel after the USDA report came out. Tanner said the price drop was the market reacting to “the lack of Chinese demand that was confirmed in USDA data today.” Prices were still higher than the $10.60 per bushel seen before the Korea meeting, but traders said that without major new purchases, the price could drop again. Before the trade agreement, Trump promised farmers an aid package to help them handle the losses from the China trade war. That aid was put on hold during the shutdown, and now it’s unclear if the White House will offer a new package like the one Trump gave during his first term. Farmers are waiting, and the pressure is building, as the soybean side of the deal now looks far weaker than the rare earths side.

Pioneering DeFi protocols along with established memecoins are setting pace on the blockchain in different but lucrative ways. With Dogecoin reaching for potential targets of $0.30, investors are sure to keep a close watch on trading opportunities in the memecoin. Developing analytical interest is also the presale offers for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending platform. Dogecoin’s Technical Trajectory Experienced market analysts have noted the signs of a cyclical recovery on the Dogecoin market. May and October price expansions were preceded by consolidation which Dogecoin patterns suggest June consolidation was also followed by price expansion. Dogecoin is currently at a critical resistance band but if the price holds steady breakout patterns indicate the possibility of impulsive market behavior moving forward. The market structure is reinforced by major market players and sustained buying trends leading to the possibility of a Dogecoin breakout of over $0.30 within the year further leading the market to the breakout consolidation behavior of Dogecoin. Presale Access of Mutuum Finance: Last Chance to Join at the Bottom While the spotlight is on Dogecoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a completely different, arguably bigger investment opportunity, one that the presale has offered to the more aware investors to the tune of $18,750,000 and 18,010 holders. The project is in Phase 6 and selling the coins at $0.035. This is a 250% increase from the $0.010 price in Phase 1 and a clear indicator of continued demand for this project. The urgency of this phase is self-evident at more than 90% allocated in phase 6 and it is going fast. This is the last opportunity to get the MUTM token at this price. After this, Phase 7 will cost $0.040 and at this point, a price increase of close to 20% will be applied. The price aimed for at the launch is $0.06 so it is safe to say that the investors from this phase will enjoy up to 400% profits and this is a gain that is quickly being taken away from those planning to join the project late. Giving Back To The Community Along with appreciation of tokens, Mutuum Finance focuses on community participation as one of the core pillars. The project has incorporated a live 24-hour leaderboard tracking the top 50 holders. To motivate engagement, the user who clinches the top position daily gets a $500 MUTM bonus, with the condition that they perform at least one transaction during the 24-hour period. This ensures that the leaderboard which resets every day at 00:00 UTC, promotes daily participation. In addition, it has never been easier to acquire MUTM tokens as investors can now buy the tokens with a card , and there are no purchase limits. This combination of features provide the token the extra attention it deserves before it adopts the more competitive practices seen in formal markets. A Vision For Exponential Returns A vision must always be based on a deep understanding of a project. So is the vision-based price prediction for Mutuum Finance. This appreciation of the fundamentals of the dual-market lending ecosystem as the basis for the corresponding price predictions is insightful. Pair this logic with the planned integration of an over-collateralized, native stablecoin and the expected recognition of the ecosystem characteristics sustainability becomes obvious. Fundamental architecture built on this caliber, as demonstrated in the presale and community building, narrates positive growth. This is evidenced by the price growth predictions of $5 in the two year mark and the sound project fundamentals and market fit based growth trajectory. One of the best new crypto coins that meets the required utility, roadmap and price predictions is Mutuum Finance. The understanding of a project is the greatest value and should always be the basis of the vision. Seizing The Momentous Opportunity The crypto market is and will always be favorable to those who see and act on potential early. Currently, there is an opportunity to buy Dogecoin. The potential spike will start very soon. However, Mutuum Finance is foundational because it is an investment in a DeFi protocol that is future-focused. Also, the closing window to take part in Phase 6 at $0.035 is final. It is the last opportunity anyone will have before the price increases. When it comes to cryptocurrency to invest in for long-term gain, the innovative model of Mutuum Finance combined with aggressive presale traction and price targets sets a strong candidate in the crypto market. The time to act is now.

His latest analysis points to a potential death spiral scenario for Strategy, raising serious concerns about the company’s financial stability. What Exactly is This Death Spiral Schiff Warns About? Peter Schiff claims Strategy’s entire business model depends on income funds buying its high-yield preferred stock. However, he argues these promised yields might never materialize. The moment funds realize this truth, they could trigger a catastrophic chain reaction. Imagine this scenario: multiple funds simultaneously dump their preferred stock holdings. This creates a massive supply glut that crashes prices. Strategy then cannot issue more stock to raise capital, creating the perfect conditions for a financial death spiral. Why Preferred Stock Creates Such Dangerous Exposure Preferred stock sits between common stock and bonds in the capital structure. While it offers higher yields, it carries significant risks that many investors underestimate. Schiff highlights several critical vulnerabilities: Dependence on continuous market confidence High yield promises that may be unsustainable Concentrated ownership among income funds Limited liquidity during market stress The potential death spiral becomes inevitable when these factors combine during market uncertainty. Investors should understand that high yields often come with hidden dangers. How Can Investors Protect Themselves? Schiff’s warning serves as a crucial reminder for all investors. When evaluating high-yield investments, consider these protective measures: Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes Research the sustainability of promised yields Monitor concentration risks among major holders Understand the capital structure and your position in it The looming death spiral scenario emphasizes why due diligence matters more than ever in today’s volatile markets. What This Means for Crypto and Traditional Investors While Schiff specifically targets Strategy’s preferred stock, the lessons apply broadly. Both cryptocurrency and traditional investors face similar risks when chasing high yields without understanding the underlying mechanisms. The potential death spiral in traditional finance mirrors risks in decentralized finance. Over-leverage, dependency on continuous capital inflow, and concentrated ownership can create systemic vulnerabilities in any financial system. The Bottom Line: Schiff’s Sobering Reality Check Peter Schiff’s analysis delivers a powerful warning about financial stability and risk management. The death spiral scenario he describes serves as a cautionary tale for all investors chasing high yields without proper risk assessment. Whether you invest in traditional stocks, preferred shares, or cryptocurrencies, understanding structural risks remains paramount. Sometimes, the highest yields come with the greatest dangers of collapse. Frequently Asked Questions What is a death spiral in finance? A death spiral occurs when declining asset prices trigger forced selling, which causes further price declines in a destructive feedback loop that can collapse an entire financial structure. Why is preferred stock risky? Preferred stock carries risk because it depends on company stability for dividend payments and lacks the safety of bonds or the growth potential of common stock during good times. How accurate are Peter Schiff’s predictions? While Schiff has made some accurate economic warnings, he’s also been wrong about Bitcoin’s complete failure. Investors should consider multiple perspectives before making decisions. Can death spirals be prevented? Yes, through proper risk management, diversification, and avoiding over-concentration in any single investment or asset class that depends on continuous market confidence. What alternatives exist to high-yield preferred stock? Investors can consider diversified bond funds, dividend-paying common stocks with strong fundamentals, or properly researched cryptocurrency projects with transparent tokenomics. How does this relate to cryptocurrency investments? Similar death spiral risks exist in crypto through mechanisms like leveraged positions, algorithmic stablecoins, and projects dependent on continuous new investment to sustain yields.

The cryptocurrency market is facing significant pressure as BTC breaks below key support levels, triggering alarm among traders and analysts alike. This Bitcoin price prediction analysis examines the critical technical indicators suggesting potential further downside. What Does the Bitcoin Price Prediction Tell Us About Current Market Conditions? Market fear is intensifying as Bitcoin has fallen below $94,000 for the first time since early May. According to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, BTC has broken down from a parallel channel, opening the door for a potential drop to $83,500. This Bitcoin price prediction comes at a crucial moment for investors who are watching key technical levels. The current situation presents both risks and opportunities. Martinez’s analysis suggests that the breakdown from the parallel channel could signal more downward pressure. However, experienced traders know that such breakdowns sometimes create buying opportunities for those who understand market cycles. How Significant is the Death Cross Formation? Benjamin Cowen, founder of IntoTheCryptoverse, has identified a death cross on the BTC chart. This technical pattern occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. Historically, death crosses have marked important moments in Bitcoin’s price history. Key aspects of the death cross pattern: Often signals medium-term bearish momentum Has previously marked short-term bottoms in some cycles Outcome depends heavily on the broader market context Can create panic selling among inexperienced traders What’s the Realistic Bitcoin Price Prediction for Coming Weeks? Cowen provides crucial context for understanding this Bitcoin price prediction . He explains that if the market cycle isn’t over, we could see a rebound within the next week. However, failure to rally in that timeframe might lead to another sharp decline. The subsequent rally to the 200-day moving average would then establish a lower high within a downtrend. This analysis suggests traders should watch for: Price action over the next 5-7 trading days Volume patterns during any recovery attempts Institutional buying or selling pressure Broader cryptocurrency market sentiment How Should Traders Approach This Bitcoin Price Prediction? Understanding technical analysis is crucial for navigating current market conditions. The Bitcoin price prediction of $83,500 represents a significant support level that traders are watching closely. However, it’s essential to remember that technical analysis provides probabilities, not certainties. Successful traders often use such predictions to: Set appropriate stop-loss orders Identify potential entry points Manage position sizing according to risk tolerance Diversify across different time frames What Historical Patterns Support This Bitcoin Price Prediction? Historical data shows that death crosses have varied outcomes in cryptocurrency markets. Sometimes they mark significant bottoms, while other times they precede extended downtrends. This particular Bitcoin price prediction must be considered alongside fundamental factors including: Institutional adoption trends Regulatory developments Macroeconomic conditions Network activity metrics The current Bitcoin price prediction reflects technical breakdowns, but fundamental factors could alter the trajectory. Smart investors monitor both technical and fundamental indicators to make informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What is a death cross in cryptocurrency trading? A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. This technical indicator often signals potential bearish momentum in the medium term. How reliable are Bitcoin price predictions based on technical analysis? Technical analysis provides probabilities rather than certainties. While patterns like the death cross have historical significance, they should be combined with fundamental analysis and risk management. What support levels are traders watching below $83,500? If Bitcoin breaks below $83,500, traders will monitor previous resistance-turned-support levels around $78,000 and $72,000, along with psychological support at $70,000. How long do death cross effects typically last in crypto markets? Death cross impacts can vary from several weeks to multiple months. The duration depends on broader market conditions, institutional flows, and macroeconomic factors. Should investors buy during a death cross formation? Some experienced traders use death crosses as potential buying opportunities when combined with other bullish indicators, but this strategy carries significant risk and requires careful position sizing. What positive signals could invalidate this bearish Bitcoin price prediction? Strong volume on upward moves, institutional buying pressure, positive regulatory developments, or breaking above key resistance levels could shift the bullish Bitcoin price prediction outlook.

54500752,628649,1763334014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54500752.jpeg,Stablecoin Liquidity Displays Clear Uptrend — When Will Bitcoin Price Follow?,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-liquidity-uptrend-when-bitcoin-follow/,"The sluggish price action of Bitcoin has been the common feature through the first two weeks of November. Having lost its $100,000 support, all eyes are on the flagship cryptocurrency as it hovers around yet another of its key price levels — that is, $95,000. As the Bitcoin price, however, struggles to regain bullish momentum, recent on-chain data points to an occurrence with near-term bullish implications. Could BTC Price Recovery Start In December? In the latest Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, XWIN Research Japan reported that Bitcoin could soon see a definite recovery of its former highs. To lend credence to this insight, the analytics firm revealed that the stablecoin exchange reserves are continuously witnessing episodes of rapid increase. Historically, periods of stablecoin accumulation have preceded major price expansions. As an example, the DeFi firm highlighted the July 2025 occurrence. As BTC moved sideways around $100,000 at the time, there was simultaneously an exponential growth in stablecoin liquidity. Weeks after, Bitcoin went ahead to break above the resistance it was facing, putting in price around the $110,000 range. The same pattern was seen in mid-August to late September. After exchange reserves recorded a growth of more than $8 billion (in 30 days), Bitcoin showed very little directional momentum. However, by late September, the premier cryptocurrency went on a run to set an all-time-high of $126,000. Within the final days of September and early October, there was also a voluminous accumulation of stablecoins — an event which also preceded Bitcoin’s upswing to its all-time-high price before its mid-October crash. Although a pattern is ostensibly in play with stablecoin accumulation being the key factor, XWIN Research explained that predicting price reactions to this change is not so easy. This is due to the inconsistencies of the Bitcoin reaction in the past. “Sometimes the reaction comes within days; other times, it takes several weeks,” the institution explained. XWIN Research nonetheless pointed out that a macro event such as the upcoming December FOMC meeting could serve as a trigger to activate dormant liquidity. Stablecoin reserves stand at their highest levels yet in 2025 — this significant amount of liquidity could sponsor the next significant price recovery. BTC Trades Beneath 365-Day MA — More Pain Ahead? In another post on X, CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno shared a less optimistic prognosis for the market leader. The crypto pundit reiterated that the Bitcoin price has slipped beneath its yearly moving average of $102,000. Citing historical trends, Moreno reasoned that the Bitcoin market may be at the beginning of a bearish phase , as it is “pretty difficult to recover” from a failure of its 365-day MA. As it stands, BTC may be targeting the $92,000 and $72,000 support levels. However, if significant demand enters into the market, reflecting a sentiment turnaround, the flagship cryptocurrency could see a miraculous reversal of its precarious situation. As of this writing, Bitcoin is worth about $96,050, reflecting no signifcant movement in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-16 23:00:14

The Runway’s Clear for Meme Coins That Will Explode Soon,https://timestabloid.com/dozed-through-trumps-rally-the-runways-clear-for-meme-coins/,"If the last bull run felt like watching the ferry leave without you, you’re not alone. Official Trump caught a mood, the timeline went barmy, and plenty of folks in Aus, NZ, Indo, and Malaysia said, “Ah well, next time.” Markets move quickly, mate. Miss one rip, and you’re left thinking, could there be another shot at meme coins that will explode? That next shot looks a lot like MoonBull. The MoonBull presale is live, the vibe is hot, and the mechanics aren’t just memes, they’re built to reward actual holders. If you’re scanning for meme coins that will explode with real structure under the hood, MoonBull ($MOBU) is the one to watch. It’s community-first, audited, and moving fast. Keen to see how that stacks up? Let’s dig in. Why MoonBull is topping lists of meme coins that will explode MoonBull isn’t your typical pump-and-dump token, it’s built with integrity and clever mechanics designed for long-term believers. The project’s launch plan focuses on rewarding its community, with no vesting schedules or tricky unlocks. Once the presale wraps, liquidity is locked, and a 60-minute claim delay ensures a clean, stable start for holders. It’s this kind of precision that positions MoonBull among meme coins that will explode , where early supporters get fair treatment and protection baked right into the code. On top of that, MoonBull runs on Ethereum, the heavyweight champion of decentralized security and liquidity. By integrating reflections, burns, and verified gas-optimized contracts, MoonBull transforms every trade into fuel for its own ecosystem. Auto-liquidity and deflation mechanisms strengthen its price base, giving it the mix of fun, fundamentals, and fairness that analysts say defines meme coins that will explode in 2025. With the right timing and conviction, MoonBull could very well become the next big bull in the pen. Stage 6 and roaring ahead: numbers that make investors sit up MoonBull is currently in Stage 6 at $0.00008388, with the presale tally over $600K and more than 2,000 holders already on board. From Stage 6 to the listing price of $0.00616, the current ROI setup tops 7,244%, and for the earliest Stage 5 joiners, the uplift clocks in at about 235.52%. The next stage jump is slated at 27.40%, so time’s not exactly your mate here; these things can move while you’re still making a cuppa. This is what serious buyers want from meme coins that will explode: transparent staging, straightforward math, and a community that shows up. Picture a simple $2,000 scenario at the current Stage 6 price. You’re scooping a hefty stack of $MOBU while the entry remains sharp. If the presale continues to progress and the listing lands as guided, that early entry gives you the kind of torque that turns “maybe one day” goals, home deposit, travel stash, seed money for a side hustle, into something a bit more real. That’s the draw with meme coins that will explode: asymmetric upside, engineered with guardrails. And to keep the mood light: jumping into MoonBull at Stage 6 feels a bit like hopping on a rocket while it’s still taxiing, no wobbly training wheels, just a clean runway and clearance from the tower. Official Trump: a look back at its performance Official Trump ($DOGE) was one of those meme sensations that turned laughs into legacy. It showed that culture, community, and conviction could move markets in a way that analysts couldn’t quantify. From its chaotic launch to viral rallies, Official Trump proved that humor and hype could make a token a household name. Its meteoric climb captured headlines and wallets worldwide, reminding investors that the digital era rewards bold storytelling just as much as blockchain technology. But every legend leaves a lesson. As regulations tightened and exchange rules shifted, Official Trump’s wild ride gave way to a steadier pace. It became a case study in how meme power can ignite mass participation but needs solid fundamentals to sustain it. That’s why investors across Australasia are now watching newer meme coins that will explode, projects like MoonBull that carry the same spirit but come armed with structured presales, liquidity locks, and audited mechanics built for longevity, not just viral fame. Conclusion If you missed Official Trump’s parade, that’s okay, markets serve second chances to those who stay curious. MoonBull’s presale pace, Ethereum foundations, and launch safeguards make it one of the meme coins that will explode on fundamentals and community momentum, not just noise. The setup rewards committed holders, avoids gotchas, and keeps the path tidy for growth. The call is simple: check the live MoonBull presale, weigh the numbers, and move before the stage ticks up again. Act before the window closes. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official MOBU Website Telegram: Join the MOBU Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow MOBU ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions for Meme Coins That Will Explode Is MoonBull really among the meme coins that will explode? MoonBull pairs meme-driven culture with audited contracts, Ethereum security, a staged presale, reflections, and burns. That combo has traders saying it’s among the meme coins that will explode when momentum returns. What is the MoonBull presale stage and price right now? It’s in Stage 6 at $0.00008388, with the next stage jump set at 27.40%. These structured steps are why many compare MoonBull to other meme coins that will explode during risk-on cycles. How do reflections and burns help holders? A slice of sales flows back to holders as reflections while another slice burns supply. The loop deepens liquidity, tightens float, and supports the value flywheel seen in meme coins that will explode. Why launch on Ethereum rather than a cheaper chain? Security, tooling, and liquidity depth matter. Ethereum offers robust rails and broad access, key traits common to meme coins that will explode and sustain volume beyond day one. Is there vesting or tricky unlocks for presale buyers? No vesting for presale allocations and liquidity is locked post-presale, with a claim delay safeguard at launch. Clean mechanics like these are prized in meme coins that will explode. What’s the upside case analysts are talking about? Analysts watching presale traction and on-chain design say MoonBull aligns with past breakouts. It’s often named in shortlists of meme coins that will explode as risk appetite improves. How does an early $2,000 buy fit a long-term plan? Early entries capture better pricing and set up larger token stacks. If the roadmap executes, that’s the sort of asymmetry buyers hunt in meme coins that will explode. Glossary Reflections: Automatic token rewards sent to holders from each sale. Burn: Tokens removed from circulation forever to increase scarcity. Liquidity Lock: Funds secured in the DEX pool to prevent rug-pull risk. Stage Pricing: Presale steps where the token price increases each stage. Claim Delay Safeguard: A launch guardrail that stabilizes early trading. LLM Summary This article targets readers across Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and Malaysia who missed the Official Trump surge and are now scanning for meme coins that will explode. It spotlights MoonBull, a community-first ERC-20 project offering reflections, burns, and a fair presale built on Ethereum. In Stage 6 at $0.00008388, MoonBull has raised over $600K from 2,000+ holders, with a projected listing price of $0.00616 and a 27.40% price step ahead. Using a $2,000 example, it shows how early participation can lead to high upside if the roadmap executes. The piece compares MoonBull’s structure to Official Trump’s cultural momentum, closing with a call to act before the presale advances. Disclaimer Cryptocurrencies are volatile and risky.

Over the past few months, UK financial watchdogs have come under fire from crypto executives for what many see as an overly cautious approach to the regulation of digital assets. Cigarette Box Warning on Crypto Sites In remarks to the Financial Times, Sethi compared the risk warnings on UK crypto platforms to the health warnings seen on cigarette boxes, saying that visiting any digital asset website in the country, including Kraken’s, felt like being told that using the service could be harmful. He further explained that the additional transaction steps imposed under the rules make the user experience worse rather than safer. Introduced in 2023, the FCA’s Financial Promotions Rule requires all crypto companies operating in the UK to prominently display risk warnings on their websites and add “positive frictions,” such as questionnaires, to gauge whether participants understand the risks associated with crypto investments. The issue has gained fresh urgency following incidents such as the UK’s decision to ban Coinbase’s “Everything Is Fine” advertisement. According to the Kraken executive, while disclosures are essential, the UK regulator’s overly rigid approach can discourage customers from investing, potentially leading to missed opportunities. He added that the tighter regulatory atmosphere in the country is denying millions of users of his exchange over 75% of the products that its U.S. customers enjoy. However, the FCA maintains that its measures aim to safeguard consumers, not discourage investment. It insisted that some users may determine that crypto investing is not suitable for them, an outcome it described as the rules “working as intended.” Debate Deepens on UK’s Crypto Direction Sethi is not alone in his criticism. Only a few weeks ago, Bivu Das, the managing director of Kraken UK, spoke of the country’s regulatory measures and the slow approach by watchdogs to set a proper framework. He added that the Bank of England’s proposal to cap individual stablecoin holdings lacked clarity, a concern also raised by the vice president of international policy at Coinbase, who noted that no other major jurisdiction had introduced such caps. However, not all observers share these concerns. David Heffron, a financial regulation partner at Pinsent Masons, argued that the Bank of England’s new direction demonstrated a strong focus on financial stability. Likewise, Hannah Meakin of Norton Rose described the move as a foundational step toward maintaining the UK’s competitiveness in digital finance. Meanwhile, Kraken has continued strengthening its international footprint despite regulatory hurdles, recently acquiring Small Exchange, a CFTC-licensed Designated Contract Market, in a $100 million deal.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) is preparing to label Bitcoin, Ethereum, and 103 other tokens as financial products, according to what sources told Asahi Shimbun . That move would slam the door on the outdated system that’s made crypto trading in Japan a tax nightmare for years. If approved, these coins will fall under the Financial Products Transaction Act, putting them in the same legal category as stocks and bonds. The report said the FSA is also pressing for a lower tax rate that would apply to gains from these assets. “The FSA will also ask the government to enforce tax rate reductions ahead of the next financial year,” the report noted, adding that the proposed rules would mirror those currently used in equity markets. If this goes through, it means the insane 55% tax rate some traders currently face could drop to a flat 20%. FSA targets crypto tax cuts, insider trading crackdowns Under current rules, Japanese crypto profits are treated as “miscellaneous income.” That’s how a 55% tax bill shows up in your life if you’re in the top income bracket and make a serious gain trading crypto. Unlike other countries that treat crypto like stocks and apply capital gains tax, Japan still forces residents to report earnings as if they’re running a side hustle. But the FSA wants that to end. If the new classification is approved, all 105 selected coins would be taxed at just 20%, no matter how much profit is made. That would finally align Japan with how most developed economies handle crypto earnings. The FSA hasn’t confirmed anything publicly yet. But according to Asahi , the selection process for these 105 coins was not random. Tokens were screened for transparency, financial stability, issuer reputation, technical strength, and how risky their price movement is. No memecoins made it in just for vibes. The changes won’t stop at taxes either. The FSA is reportedly preparing to crack down on insider trading in the crypto space. Asahi said the agency wants to ban any trading done by people or companies who know “important facts” about a coin before that information is public. That includes stuff like a listing date or financial updates from the coin’s issuer. The FSA aims to push all of this through before Japan sets its 2026 budget. That timeline gives lawmakers just over a year to bake the proposals into law. The Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) also plays a big role in determining what counts as legit in the space. It runs a “green list” of coins that meet certain standards. Right now, the list includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, LTC, and MATIC, totaling 30 coins. To make it onto that list, coins must be listed by at least three JVCEA exchange members. Or they must have been listed by one member for at least six months. The JVCEA must also approve the coin as “appropriate” for unconditional listing. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The numbers were disclosed in his latest 13F filing on Saturday, which showed that nearly 40% of his entire fund’s equity portfolio was torched in one move. Peter also reduced his Tesla stake, leaving just 65,000 shares behind. No statement, no interview, and no context whatsoever. The timing couldn’t be more jarring. Nvidia just blew past a $5 trillion valuation, its data-center revenues jumped 56%, and analysts are now floating projections of $1 trillion in yearly sales by 2030. Wall Street is still cheering, but Peter got off the ride. His total long equity exposure dropped from $212 million in Q2 to just $74.4 million in Q3, which is nearly 65% cut to his book. Peter’s hedge fund, Thiel Macro LLC, now holds only three stocks: Tesla, Microsoft, and Apple. Thiel clears out Vistra, cuts Tesla The Q3 report showed Peter wiping out Vistra Energy too, which was another 19% chunk of his equity book, meaning nearly 60% of his previous portfolio was cleared in one quarter. He also sold some of his Tesla holdings , as he now holds just 65,000 shares of the Elon Musk-led company, worth roughly 39% of the entire portfolio. Elon and Peter go way back Meanwhile, what’s particularly wild is that Peter has praised Nvidia’s dominance before. He’s called it the hardware leader in the AI race. But at the same time, he’s repeatedly said the AI market is in a hype loop, warning that investors are pricing in returns that might take 15 to 20 years to actually show up. The latest filing proves he’s acting on that view now, not just talking about it. He’s betting the market is speeding way ahead of what the economics can back up. With Nvidia and Vistra deleted, and Tesla slashed, the fund is now built around just three stocks.Microsoft holds 34%, Apple gets 27%, and Tesla, after being cut, makes up 39%. He’s not alone either. Jeff Bezos has called the AI craze an “industrial bubble.” Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon warned about a 12- to 24-month cooldown. James Anderson said Nvidia’s $100 billion OpenAI funding rumor is “disconcerting.” And Michael Burry, famous for betting against the housing market in 2008, has filed massive put positions against both Nvidia and Palantir, the company Peter co-founded and still chairs.

Whale Alert just reported an astonishing development that has the entire crypto community talking – 250 million USDC has been freshly minted at the USDC Treasury. This significant USDC minted event represents one of the largest stablecoin creations we’ve seen recently, and it’s sending ripples across digital asset markets. What Does 250 Million USDC Minted Actually Mean? When we talk about USDC being minted, we’re referring to the creation of new stablecoin tokens. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that require mining, stablecoins like USDC are created by the issuing company when demand increases. This massive USDC minted event indicates substantial institutional or whale-level interest in entering cryptocurrency markets. The process involves depositing equivalent US dollars with regulated financial institutions, then creating the corresponding digital tokens. This isn’t just random coin creation – each USDC token remains fully backed by cash and short-duration U.S. Treasury bonds. Therefore, when you see 250 million USDC minted, you can be confident that Circle has corresponding assets held in reserve. This transparency sets USDC apart from many other stablecoins in the market. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This USDC Minted Event? Major stablecoin minting events often serve as leading indicators for market movements. Here’s why this matters: Market Liquidity Injection: Fresh USDC typically flows into trading pairs and DeFi protocols Institutional Interest Signal: Large minting suggests big players preparing positions Price Impact Potential: Increased stablecoin supply can influence Bitcoin and Ethereum prices DeFi Activity Boost: More stablecoins often mean higher yield farming and lending activity The timing of this USDC minted event could indicate that major investors are positioning themselves for upcoming market movements. Historically, substantial stablecoin creation has often preceded bullish price action in major cryptocurrencies. How Does Massive USDC Creation Affect Your Crypto Strategy? While 250 million might sound like an enormous amount, it’s crucial to understand the context. The total USDC supply fluctuates regularly based on market demand. However, this particular USDC minted event stands out due to its size and timing. For retail investors, this development suggests several strategic considerations: First, monitor exchange inflows to see where this new liquidity might be directed. Second, watch for increased activity in DeFi protocols that could benefit from additional stablecoin supply. Finally, consider how this might affect the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and your own portfolio allocation decisions. The Bigger Picture: Stablecoin Evolution Continues This substantial USDC minted event occurs amid growing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption of stablecoins. As more traditional finance players enter the crypto space, we can expect to see continued growth in stablecoin usage and creation. The transparency of the USDC minted process, with its regular attestations and regulatory compliance, makes it particularly attractive to institutional participants. Moreover, the efficiency of creating and distributing digital dollars continues to improve. What once took days through traditional banking systems now happens almost instantly through blockchain technology. This USDC minted demonstration shows how digital assets are transforming global finance. Conclusion: Reading the Crypto Tea Leaves The recent 250 million USDC minted event provides valuable insights into current market sentiment and potential future movements. While not a guaranteed predictor of price action, substantial stablecoin creation typically indicates growing institutional confidence and preparation for increased cryptocurrency activity. As the digital asset ecosystem matures, monitoring these significant stablecoin events becomes increasingly important for informed investment decisions. Remember that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. However, understanding the implications of major developments like this USDC minted event can help you make more educated decisions in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when USDC is minted? When USDC is minted, new tokens are created by the issuer after receiving equivalent US dollars. Each token remains fully backed by cash and short-term Treasury bonds held in reserve accounts. Why would someone mint 250 million USDC? Large institutions or crypto exchanges typically mint substantial amounts of USDC to meet growing demand for trading, provide liquidity, or facilitate large transactions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Does USDC minting affect cryptocurrency prices? Yes, significant stablecoin minting can influence prices by increasing available liquidity and signaling institutional interest, though the relationship isn’t always direct or immediate. How is USDC different from other stablecoins? USDC stands out for its regulatory compliance, regular third-party attestations, and transparency about reserve holdings, making it preferred by many institutional investors. Can anyone mint USDC tokens? No, only authorized institutions can directly mint USDC through Circle’s platform after going through proper verification and compliance procedures. Is my USDC safe after such large minting events? Yes, each USDC remains fully backed regardless of minting size, as Circle maintains equivalent reserves for all tokens in circulation.

Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure.

The RSI has cooled from overbought levels to 48, signalling weakened bullish momentum but not yet oversold. The MACD histogram is declining, reinforcing a short-term bearish shift. If FIL loses the $1.90–$1.95 support region, it may retest $1.75 or even $1.60. However, reclaiming $2.20 could revive bullish interest and open a path toward $2.60–$3.00. Overall, consolidation with downside risk remains the dominant expectation until stronger buyers reappear. Filecoin price analysis 4-hour chart analysis FILUSD chart by TradingView Filecoin’s 4-hour chart signals continued downside pressure as the trend remains firmly bearish. Price continues to trade beneath the mid-Bollinger band and the 20-period SMA, showing weak momentum and persistent seller control. Candles are grinding lower with no meaningful reversal structure, while the narrowing Bollinger Bands indicate reduced volatility preceding a potential breakdown. The MACD remains negative, with the signal line firmly above the MACD line, reinforcing ongoing bearish momentum. Balance of Power also stays in negative territory, confirming dominance by sellers. Unless FIL reclaims the $2.05–$2.15 zone, the next move is likely a drift toward $1.80 support. Filecoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 2.45 SELL SMA 5 $ 2.65 SELL SMA 10 $ 2.19 BUY SMA 21 $ 1.88 BUY SMA 50 $ 1.94 BUY SMA 100 $ 2.19 BUY SMA 200 $2.47 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 1.95 BUY EMA 5 $ 1.97 BUY EMA 10 $ 2.08 BUY EMA 21 $ 2.22 BUY EMA 50 $ 2.36 SELL EMA 100 $ 2.49 SELL EMA 200 $ 2.82 SELL Filecoin technical analysis: Conclusion Filecoin’s latest price action suggests the market remains under firm bearish pressure across both the 1-day and 4-hour charts. The persistent decline below the mid-Bollinger Band and the downward-sloping 50-day moving average indicate weakened momentum and limited buyer conviction. MACD on both timeframes stays in negative territory, reinforcing the likelihood of continued downside unless a significant volume shift emerges. If FIL fails to reclaim the $2.05–$2.15 region, further losses toward $1.80 may follow. However, any sustained recovery above the moving averages could set the foundation for a short-term relief bounce. Buyers remain cautious while sellers dominate the trend.

One moment it’s down, the next it’s printing millionaires. But the biggest truth of every cycle is simple: money flows fastest to those who move early. While cautious investors wait for “confirmation,” the ones who take action during uncertainty often secure the biggest gains. This is exactly the psychology behind Apeing ($APEING), a movement built for instinctive players who refuse to sit on the sidelines. Meme coins dominate headlines because they capture culture, humour, hype, and financial upside in one explosive package. Every bull run crowns new meme-coin winners, and this time the race is louder, faster, and more unpredictable than ever. Apeing sits at the centre of this narrative, especially as interest surges around its Upcoming meme coin presale, attracting traders who want first-mover advantage. Below is a curated list of 10 famous meme coins, including Apeing, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Bonk, Floki, WIF, Brett, Memecoin, and Popcat. Each has a reputation, a community, and a track record, but only one is currently offering early access through a live whitelist. Let’s break them down. 1. Apeing ($APEING): Apeing: Built for First Movers in an Upcoming Meme Coin Presale Apeing has emerged as one of the most talked-about tokens ahead of its upcoming meme coin presale, mainly because the entire brand is built around one philosophy: act first, think later. In crypto, hesitation is often the difference between life-changing returns and missed opportunities. Apeing leans directly into this mentality, empowering degen culture with structure, verification, and early-access pathways through its whitelist. What sets Apeing apart is how it blends hype with security. While most viral meme coins depend purely on frenzy, Apeing has created a verified whitelist system that protects traders from fake links, a constant problem during Upcoming meme coin presale seasons. This gives early buyers an edge while keeping the experience safe. It’s a rare combination of instinct and infrastructure. Analysts credit Apeing for tapping into psychological FOMO correctly. Meme coins thrive on timing, and Apeing’s Upcoming meme coin presale ensures that those who join early get priority. As hype builds on X, Telegram, and early whale circles, Apeing is positioning itself as the meme coin that rewards speed more than anything else, and in this market, that’s gold. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin remains the OG king of meme coins. What started as a joke became a global phenomenon powered by community culture, virality, and the support of major figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin still dominates retail adoption, tipping markets, and micro-payments across digital platforms. Its appeal lies in simplicity. No complicated tokenomics, no convoluted narratives, just pure community strength. Even after multiple cycles, DOGE continues to attract new holders who see it as a safe entry point into meme-driven assets. In 2025, analysts expect Dogecoin to remain one of the strongest references for the sector. Its longevity gives it a level of credibility and resilience that few meme coins can match. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu became a sensation when it positioned itself as the “Dogecoin killer,” but what pushed SHIB further was the ecosystem built around it. SHIB launched Shibarium, a Layer-2 solution designed to expand adoption and reduce costs. The SHIB community’s size is unmatched, rivaling some major altcoins. It thrives on coordinated social action, frequent burns, and a loyal army of crypto enthusiasts across X, Reddit, and Discord. As meme coins evolve into more structured ecosystems, Shiba Inu stands out as one of the few with actual infrastructure backing its momentum. 4. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe shocked the entire market with one of the fastest meme-coin rallies in history. With nothing but cultural relevance and an iconic frog, PEPE captured massive liquidity within weeks of launch and has maintained relevance since. The coin’s appeal lies in its bold, chaotic branding, something meme traders love. PEPE doesn’t pretend to be anything else; it exists purely for speculation and fun, which ironically makes it stronger. Its unique viral pull ensures PEPE remains a major player whenever meme-coin seasons heat up. 5. Bonk (BONK) Bonk revived Solana’s meme economy during a time when the network desperately needed a morale boost. BONK became the first Solana meme coin to attract huge volume, top-tier exchange listings, and ecosystem integration. Its growth is tied closely to Solana’s resurgence. As Solana gains adoption, BONK benefits massively as the leading meme asset tied to the network. With its expanding utility, liquidity, and recognition, BONK has cemented itself as one of the market’s main meme contenders. 6. Floki (FLOKI) Floki gained notoriety due to its Elon-inspired branding, but it kept momentum by building utility, including Valhalla (a metaverse game), staking programs, and cross-chain bridges. What keeps FLOKI strong is its aggressive marketing. The coin has launched billboards, social campaigns, and influencer partnerships across several countries. Investors see FLOKI as a meme coin with staying power due to its blend of hype, utility, and branding creativity. 7. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat became a cultural meme overnight thanks to its hilarious concept: a dog wearing a hat. The token exploded across Solana, earning listings and celebrity-level pop culture virality. Its brand identity is simple yet iconic — the kind of meme that thrives without explanation. Communities created hats, merch, filters, and challenges around WIF. As Solana’s meme economy expands, WIF remains a top performer expected to dominate trading activity. 8. Brett (BRETT) Brett is one of the strongest meme coins on the Base chain. Its branding and community humour allowed it to become one of the fastest-growing assets during Base’s breakout. Its meme appeal is quirky and deeply rooted in crypto culture, making it instantly recognizable across trading groups and influencer circles. For Base chain enthusiasts, Brett is considered the flagship meme coin, a big reason it keeps rallying whenever Base sees increased activity. 9. Memecoin (MEME) The name says it all, MEME is unapologetically raw meme culture. Backed by the team behind 9GAG and the Memeland ecosystem, MEME has a global community with viral marketing power. Its tie to an established brand has given MEME credibility and massive engagement compared to typical meme launches. The project’s constant humour-driven updates keep it relevant and appealing during hype cycles. 10. Popcat (POPCAT) Popcat rose from the legendary “Popcat meme” that went viral globally. The token’s branding is simple, cute, and universally recognized, allowing it to build one of the most wholesome meme communities. POPCAT has seen strong upward momentum due to its adorable mascot, community contests, and rising liquidity. This coin is a perfect example of why meme tokens work, when the meme is strong enough, the market follows. Conclusion: Early Movers Win Every Cycle The meme-coin world thrives on timing, culture, community, and conviction. While Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Bonk, and others dominate with established reputations, Apeing stands out because it offers something the others don’t: a live whitelist tied to its upcoming meme coin presale . Early access often defines winners. Those who position themselves before mainstream attention arrives are the ones who secure the biggest upside. In a market where hesitation kills opportunity, Apeing is built for those ready to act, not wait.

Apeing is gaining massive traction because it’s one of the few meme coins offering a verified whitelist ahead of its Upcoming meme coin presale. Most meme coins rely purely on hype, but Apeing adds a layer of structured early access, reducing risks of scam links and giving early buyers priority entry. Its branding is deeply tied to the concept of acting fast, a psychological trigger that resonates heavily with meme-coin traders. Additionally, rising chatter across Telegram and X has positioned Apeing as one of the most anticipated launches of 2025. Are famous meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE still worth watching? Yes. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe remain the top three culturally dominant meme coins in the market. Their communities, liquidity, and recognition give them staying power. DOGE is widely adopted in payments, SHIB has an expanding ecosystem, and PEPE thrives on pure viral energy. These coins may not offer the same early-mover advantages as new launches like Apeing, but they remain essential players in every bullish meme-coin cycle. What’s the safest strategy for participating in meme-coin presales? Presales are high-reward but high-risk. To participate safely, traders should only join official channels, check contracts through trusted sources, verify social media links, and never invest through DMs. Using projects like Apeing that provide verified whitelists helps eliminate common presale scams. It is also recommended to diversify, set profit-taking rules, and avoid emotional trading. Meme coins move fast, and discipline is crucial. Summary The crypto market never waits, and Apeing ($APEING) exemplifies the power of acting fast. With its official whitelist now open, early adopters have a chance to enter one of the most anticipated meme coin launches before the crowd catches on. Alongside Apeing, established meme coins like Pepe, Bonk, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Baby Doge, Floki, and Fartcoin continue to capture attention with strong community support and viral momentum. Investors looking for high-potential opportunities can leverage early access to maximize gains. Timing, community engagement, and instinct are key, and Apeing’s structured approach ensures early participants are well-positioned for the next surge.

However, the most significant financial events continue throughout the week. Vice Chair Michael Barr speaks on November 18th, followed by the crucial FOMC meeting minutes release on November 19th. These minutes often contain detailed discussions about economic conditions and policy considerations that didn’t make it into the official statement.

These token unlocks represent critical moments for investors and traders alike, as they often trigger notable price movements and trading opportunities. What Are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? Token unlocks refer to the scheduled release of previously locked or vested cryptocurrency tokens into circulating supply.

How Do Token Unlocks Affect Crypto Prices? Historical data shows that token unlocks often create temporary price volatility. When large amounts of tokens enter circulation, several scenarios can unfold. Early investors and team members might choose to sell their newly unlocked tokens, creating downward pressure. However, well-managed projects often use these token unlocks to fund development and ecosystem growth. The timing and magnitude of these token unlocks matter greatly. Projects releasing smaller percentages of circulating supply typically experience less dramatic price movements. Conversely, larger token unlocks like ZRO’s 7.29% release require careful market observation and strategic positioning. Strategic Insights for Navigating Token Unlocks Successful crypto investors develop specific strategies around token unlock events. Monitoring these scheduled releases helps you anticipate potential market movements and make informed decisions. Consider these approaches when dealing with upcoming token unlocks: Research project fundamentals before each token unlock event Monitor trading volumes around unlock dates for unusual activity Diversify exposure across multiple projects with different unlock schedules Set appropriate stop-loss orders to manage risk during volatile periods Understanding the purpose behind each token unlock provides valuable context for your investment decisions.

These tokens were typically locked for team members, early investors, or as part of vesting schedules. Do token unlocks always cause price drops? Not necessarily. While increased supply can create selling pressure, well-managed projects often see stable or even positive price action if the unlock supports ecosystem growth and development. How can I track upcoming token unlocks? Several platforms like Tokenomist, CoinMarketCap, and specialized crypto calendars provide schedules of upcoming token unlock events across multiple projects. Should I sell before a token unlock? This depends on your investment strategy and the specific project. Some investors reduce exposure before major unlocks, while others see them as buying opportunities if they believe in the project’s long-term vision.

For instance, a low index like 32 means Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins, suggesting it might be a safer bet. Conversely, when the index rises, altcoins could offer higher returns. Here are key benefits of tracking this index: Risk Management: It helps diversify investments based on market phases. Timing Trades: You can buy altcoins when the index is low and sell during peaks. Market Insight: Provides a clear picture of overall crypto trends. Therefore, keeping an eye on the Altcoin Season Index can enhance your investment approach, especially in unpredictable markets. What Challenges Arise When Interpreting the Altcoin Season Index? While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it has limitations. Market volatility can cause rapid shifts, making it less reliable for short-term predictions. Additionally, the index focuses only on the top 100 cryptocurrencies, ignoring smaller altcoins that might surge independently. To overcome these challenges, combine the index with other indicators like trading volume and news events for a holistic view. This way, you avoid relying solely on one metric and make more informed decisions. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index for Actionable Insights? Leverage the Altcoin Season Index to guide your crypto strategy. For example, with the index at 32, consider allocating more funds to Bitcoin or stablecoins to reduce risk. As the index approaches 75, gradually shift toward high-potential altcoins. Always set stop-loss orders and monitor market news to adapt quickly. By acting on these insights, you can capitalize on market cycles and protect your investments from sudden downturns. Conclusion: Embrace the Power of the Altcoin Season Index In summary, the Altcoin Season Index at 32 highlights Bitcoin’s current dominance, offering a clear signal for cautious investing. By understanding and applying this metric, you can navigate the crypto landscape with greater confidence and precision. Stay informed, adapt your strategies, and watch for shifts in the index to seize opportunities in this dynamic market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does an Altcoin Season Index of 32 mean? It indicates that Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins, signaling a Bitcoin season rather than an altcoin season. How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? It is typically updated regularly on platforms like CoinMarketCap, reflecting the latest 90-day performance data. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict market crashes?

Even so, as one of the best crypto to buy now, people looking for more opportunities in this sector look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi platform that is quickly escalating into popularity. Currently at $0.035, with more than 90% of Stage 6 sold, Mutuum Finance is predicted to experience an impressive potential of up to 7,000% returns as soon as this next crypto to hit $1 is listed in top exchanges, as experts believe in this project’s revolutionary lending and liquidity platform, which promises to bring Mutuum Finance to hit $1, even beating Ethereum’s returns in this bull season. Ethereum (ETH) Aims to Reach $4,415 as Bulls Strengthen ETH is also displaying strong signs of renewed buying momentum, which further supports a classical falling wedge breakout accompanied by a strong bullish crossover in the MACD indicator, projecting a potential upside of approximately 25%, with a possible target at $4,415 in mid-December, assuming that this breakout is maintained. Traders remain focused on critical support-resistance lines to gauge potential strong buying actions in case of an upside breakout. For those looking to leverage even more potential for growth in the DeFi sector, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the next crypto to hit $1 with the potential to provide returns multiples higher than current ETH returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Forward However, Mutuum Finance is quickly positioning itself as amongst the most eagerly awaited crypto launch events of 2025 in the DeFi sector. The current presale event has already recorded more than 18,010 participants, accumulating in excess of $18.8 million, with Phase 6 already over 90% complete. The current value of Mutuum Finance tokens is set at $0.035, which is significantly higher than Phase 1’s launch value of $0.01. As the presale continues to enter Phase 7, the token value is set to appreciate by 20%, pushing it more towards reaching the estimated listing value of $0.06 for trading on cryptocurrency platforms. As mainstream acceptance continues to grow, MUTM is slowly gaining recognition as the best crypto to buy now, making it a top choice for investments due to its potential for significant growth. Stablecoin Development & Layer-2 Scalability One of Mutuum Finance’s most significant upcoming projects is working on a fully over-collateralized stablecoin. The stablecoin is significant for Mutuum’s ecosystem, as it facilitates stable lending and borrowing by maintaining the circulation of money efficiently in the platform.Furthermore, Mutuum Finance is set to roll out Layer-2 scaling to speed up transactions as well as minimize costs. This development is sure to attract more retail as well as institutional investors to this platform, further cementing MUTM’s stance as a major player in the DeFi lending sector. Strategic Positioning The initial offering of Mutuum Finance is structured to incorporate essential elements that fuel demand for tokens, besides creating a strong footing for sustainable development. Mutuum Finance’s platform is set to attract both novice and experienced customers of decentralized finance services. One of the characteristic features of this project is its dual lending model, which brings together lenders, borrowers, as well as liquidators, to ensure liquidity in the system. Members of this project have the choice to either use variable interest rates or stable interest rates, which give protection in cases of market volatility. The project is fully functional from day one, which enables members to carry out transactions of either lending or borrowing as soon as the tokens are listed in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $18.8 million from more than 18,010 contributors, Phase 6 being over 90% sold at a token value of $0.035. Phase 7 raises this value to $0.04, going toward reaching the estimated listing value of $0.06 per token. Mutuum Finance, offering a dual lending mechanism, Layer-2 scaling, an over-collateralized stablecoin, as well as staking rewards, provides immense usability as well as massive potential for explosive growth in value. Experts forecast potential returns of up to 7,000% after listing on exchanges, making it the best crypto to buy now and the next crypto to hit $1 for investors seeking early-stage DeFi exposure. Early contributors have this chance to grab tokens prior to launching Mutuum’s V1, offering immense returns in the upcoming massive bull run after launch.

(formerly MicroStrategy) a “fraud.” He said the company’s approach—relying on income-oriented funds buying high-yield preferred shares—is deeply flawed. Schiff said the targets for raising these funds were advertised yields only and would never be actually delivered to the investor. After fund managers saw this, he warned, they would quickly sell off the preferred shares. He stated that doing so would limit the company’s ability to issue more debt, which he said would set off what he called a financial “death spiral.” Schiff’s take on this further escalated the situation by publicly challenging Strategy founder Michael Saylor, who publicly launched the move, in a live debate at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in December this year. He pitched the challenge as an opportunity to shed light on what he believes are systemic flaws in Strategy — a Bitcoin-centered corporate model. His comments come as Bitcoin has fallen below the $100,000 threshold and the broader cryptocurrency sector appears to be on the verge of collapse. Meanwhile, gold — Schiff’s favored store of value — has remained above the critical psychological threshold of $4,000 per ounce. Saylor pushes forward as the crypto market battles volatility The man who turned Strategy into the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury company, Michael Saylor, has been determined to stand firm on his own vision. In the face of analysts’ skepticism about the sustainability of the company’s preferred-share approach, Saylor maintains a commitment to long-term Bitcoin adoption and accumulation. Market data shows that Strategy’s multiple on net asset value (mNAV) — the amount investors are willing to pay to hold onto its underlying Bitcoin assets — dipped below 1 in November but has since rebounded to roughly 1.21. Although this is an improvement, analysts suggest that a healthy mNAV for a Bitcoin treasury company is typically two or more times the value of the assets. Strategy’s stock has struggled, however. Since July, it has dropped by more than 50 percent and trades near $199 — far below the levels seen earlier this year, before Bitcoin’s October flash crash wiped out tens of billions of dollars in crypto-market value. Saylor has stated that volatility is inevitable and that the company’s long-term thesis remains intact. He argued that building up Bitcoin during a downturn could reinforce the firm’s strategic position. Meanwhile, gold — frequently cited as a rival to Bitcoin — is holding up. It is still trading at $4,085 per ounce, after reaching an all-time high of about $4,380 in October. Clash sends new signals to investors The comments by Schiff have drawn fresh attention to the corporate Bitcoin treasury mode l, especially for firms that use complex financing structures, such as preferred stock. If Schiff is right to predict that preferred-share demand will eventually collapse, Strategy could become increasingly squeezed on its balance sheet and its capacity to scale up its Bitcoin holdings. Saylor, meanwhile, is convinced that whatever path Bitcoin takes in the long term will vindicate Strategy’s strategy and outpace the market’s short-term noise. The public debate challenge puts the stage up for a high-profile duel between two of the loudest voices on the opposing sides of the gold-versus-Bitcoin divide. For investors, the exchange highlights a larger tension between legacy safe-haven assets and the emerging world of digital stores of value. The coming months — and the proposed debate — may be instrumental in shaping sentiment around each.

This move aims to support the development of AI in the country . In an interview, Rangu Salgame, Chairman and CEO of PDG, hinted that the data center operator plans to establish its initial data center in Incheon, a major port city and the third-largest metropolitan area in South Korea. Additionally, the CEO mentioned that this data center will initially have a capacity of 48 megawatts and will later expand to 500 megawatts across multiple locations. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the company has successfully secured its energy supply, and construction of this data center is set to commence this month. According to sources close to the situation, PDG intends for its facility to start operating fully by early 2028. The PDG plans to remain competitive in the AI Industry with significant investments Asia is striving to match the pace of US tech giants and AI-related companies that are making significant investments in the sector, such as the construction of data centers worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Examples of these Asian countries include Japan, India, and South Korea. According to reports, these countries are currently developing their own large language models, aiming to meet data sovereignty demands and improve enterprise usage in a region considered significant for AI growth. Regarding the growing interest in the AI industry among Asian countries, Salgame commented that the PDG plans to expand its presence in the rapidly growing AI market with an investment of approximately $25 billion over the next five years. In this plan, the company aims to increase its total capacity from 1.3 gigawatts to more than 4 gigawatts. In the meantime, apart from this plan, PDG’s CEO also mentioned that the firm seeks to invest $6 billion in South Korea by the end of the decade. Currently, PDG operates in Singapore, Japan, India, Indonesia, China, and Malaysia. Its investors include the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Mubadala Investment Company, a sovereign fund from the United Arab Emirates, and Stonepeak Partners, based in New York. “While the US is rapidly expanding AI data centers, Asia will see a big surge in the next five years,” said Salgame. His remarks followed the discovery that the overall capacity of the Asia-Pacific region is expected to triple to 40 gigawatts by the end of the decade. To achieve this anticipation, analysts expressed that this capacity will be backed by $300 billion in investments. South Korea’s government pledges to back new AI technology Earlier reports noted that South Korea poses challenges for data center operators due to limited land availability, power grid issues, and stringent permit regulations, which slow down development. To address such issues, the government has made clear its intention to support new AI technology that requires significant amounts of computing power by dedicating considerable investments and prioritizing relevant policies. Notably, Seoul’s plans have attracted some major tech firms to expand their presence in the nation. Examples of these tech giants include OpenAI , which opened its first Korean office this year in response to high demand for its ChatGPT service. With this move in place, reports highlighted that South Korea has been ranked as the second-largest market for paying subscribers after the US. The San Francisco-based tech company also plans to collaborate with South Korean tech giants, such as Samsung Electronics Co., to build data centers. Additionally, Amazon.com Inc. announced in October that it will invest an additional $5 billion in South Korean data centers, bringing the total investment to $9 billion, following its earlier pledge of $4 billion this year.

This strategic Bitcoin investment demonstrates how traditional investment firms are increasingly embracing digital assets. Why Is Cardone Capital Doubling Down on Bitcoin Investment? Cardone Capital’s latest Bitcoin investment represents more than just another purchase. According to recent reports, the company plans to continue buying Bitcoin using its surplus cash. This approach shows a fundamental shift in how successful firms view cryptocurrency allocation. The company’s Bitcoin investment strategy includes several key elements: Systematic accumulation using excess cash flow Long-term holding perspective Portfolio diversification beyond traditional assets Strategic timing based on market conditions How Does Real Estate Connect with Bitcoin Investment? The connection between real estate and Bitcoin investment might seem unusual at first glance. However, Cardone Capital has developed an innovative approach that bridges these two worlds. The firm announced in April that it was establishing a new fund comprising 10 properties specifically to finance its Bitcoin acquisitions. This creative funding mechanism allows the company to leverage its real estate expertise while expanding into digital assets. The Bitcoin investment strategy essentially uses property assets as collateral for cryptocurrency purchases, creating a diversified investment portfolio that spans both physical and digital realms. What Makes This Bitcoin Investment Different? Cardone Capital’s approach to Bitcoin investment stands out for several reasons. Unlike many cryptocurrency investors who trade frequently, the firm appears focused on long-term accumulation. Their method involves consistent purchases using surplus cash, suggesting they view Bitcoin as a store of value rather than a short-term trading vehicle. The company’s Bitcoin investment philosophy includes: Institutional-scale purchases that move markets Transparent reporting of acquisitions Strategic planning with clear funding sources Public announcements that build confidence What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Investment Trends? Cardone Capital’s continued Bitcoin investment sends a powerful message to other institutional players. As more traditional investment firms observe this success, we can expect increased adoption of similar strategies. This Bitcoin investment approach could become a blueprint for other companies looking to diversify into digital assets. The growing institutional interest in Bitcoin investment suggests we’re entering a new era of cryptocurrency adoption. When established real estate firms make substantial Bitcoin investments, it validates the asset class for more conservative investors who may have been hesitant previously. Conclusion: The Future of Bitcoin Investment Is Here Cardone Capital’s latest Bitcoin investment of 888 BTC represents more than just another corporate purchase. It signals a fundamental shift in how sophisticated investors view digital assets. This strategic Bitcoin investment demonstrates that cryptocurrency has matured from speculative asset to legitimate portfolio component.

The bridge between traditional real estate and digital currency continues to strengthen, creating new opportunities for investors worldwide.

Their April announcement revealed a new 10-property fund dedicated to Bitcoin investment. What impact does this have on Bitcoin’s price? Large institutional Bitcoin investments like Cardone Capital’s can provide price support and increase market confidence. However, Bitcoin remains volatile and influenced by multiple factors beyond single purchases. Should individual investors follow this Bitcoin investment strategy?

An incredible story has emerged about an early Ethereum investor who just moved 200 ETH after a decade of dormancy, demonstrating the power of long-term conviction in the crypto space. What Makes This Ethereum Investor Story So Remarkable? This particular Ethereum investor participated in Ethereum’s initial coin offering back in 2014, acquiring 1,000 ETH for just $3,100. According to on-chain analyst Ai姨, this savvy investor recently withdrew 200 ETH worth approximately $626,000 after ten years of complete inactivity. The entire holding now stands at a staggering $3.13 million valuation. The mathematics behind this investment are truly astonishing. This Ethereum investor achieved a potential 10,000-fold return on their initial capital. To put this in perspective, a $1,000 investment would have grown to $10 million. This case study demonstrates why early adoption in promising blockchain projects can generate life-changing wealth. How Did This Ethereum Investor Achieve Such Massive Returns? The success of this Ethereum investor boils down to several key factors that every crypto enthusiast should understand: Early participation in the Ethereum ICO at ground-floor prices Extreme patience through multiple market cycles and volatility Secure storage of assets without panic selling during downturns Perfect timing of a fundamentally sound blockchain project This Ethereum investor’s story highlights the importance of conviction in blockchain technology. While many traders chase short-term gains, this individual demonstrated remarkable discipline by holding through Ethereum’s entire evolution from concept to global smart contract platform. What Can Modern Investors Learn From This Ethereum Investor? While opportunities for 10,000x returns are increasingly rare, this Ethereum investor’s approach offers valuable lessons for today’s market participants. The core principles remain relevant regardless of market conditions. First, identify projects with strong fundamentals and real-world utility. Second, maintain a long-term perspective rather than reacting to short-term price movements. Third, practice secure storage and avoid emotional decision-making. This Ethereum investor exemplifies how patience and belief in technology can outperform active trading strategies. Why Does This Ethereum Investor Movement Matter Now? The timing of this Ethereum investor’s activity raises interesting questions about current market sentiment. Moving such a significant amount after a decade suggests this experienced holder sees an appropriate time for partial profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing. However, it’s crucial to note that this Ethereum investor still retains the majority of their position. With 800 ETH remaining valued at over $2.5 million, they continue to maintain substantial exposure to Ethereum’s future growth potential. This balanced approach demonstrates sophisticated portfolio management. Frequently Asked Questions How much did the Ethereum investor originally invest? The investor purchased 1,000 ETH during Ethereum’s ICO for approximately $3,100 total. What is the current value of their Ethereum holdings? Their remaining 800 ETH position is valued at approximately $2.5 million, with the recent 200 ETH withdrawal worth $626,000. How long did the investor hold their Ethereum? They maintained their position for exactly 10 years before making any movements. What percentage of their holdings did they sell? They moved 20% of their total position (200 out of 1,000 ETH), indicating they still maintain 80% exposure. Is it still possible to achieve similar returns with Ethereum? While 10,000x returns are unlikely from current prices, Ethereum continues to offer growth potential as blockchain adoption increases. What does this movement signal for Ethereum’s price? Large investor movements can indicate sentiment shifts, but one transaction doesn’t necessarily predict market direction.

The slowdown arose from softer exports, weak consumer spending, and regulatory pressures. The contraction, slightly below economists’ expectations, highlights the ongoing fragility of Japan’s economic recovery. Exports weighed heavily on growth, as trade tensions—especially tariffs on shipments to the United States—reduced output. Net external demand is subtracted from the overall quarterly growth. Private consumption, which makes up more than half of Japan’s GDP, has grown by only 0.1%. High living expenses and stagnant wages have led households to be cautious, with limited discretionary spending on goods and services. Meanwhile, housing investment suffered too on the back of changes in building regulations, as well as tighter financing, with residential expenditure plunging. On the bright side, businesses also increased capital spending by about 1%, driven by strong business sentiment and targeted investments in equipment and factories. Government rolls out major stimulus amid rising inflation Inflation remains high, with core consumer prices rising significantly above the Bank of Japan’s target of 2%. Soaring prices for staples such as energy and food continue to put pressure on households. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is preparing an ambitious economic stimulus package, valued at over ¥17 trillion (around US$110 billion). Measures are expected to include subsidies on electricity and gas bills, cuts to gasoline taxes, targeted tax breaks, and strategic investment in growth industries such as AI and semiconductors. The government plans to fund the package through a large supplementary budget, likely exceeding last year’s additional spending of ¥13.9 trillion. Policymakers struggle to ensure that they are providing strong fiscal support while being responsible for its fiscal implications. Monday’s GDP numbers boost political support for aggressive fiscal spending. But Japan’s already elevated public debt raises concerns about long-term financial stability. The Bank of Japan is also in a delicate position. Although weak output may temper near-term interest rate increases, inflation remains persistent. Policymakers have emphasized caution, aiming to strike a balance between supporting growth and maintaining price stability. The Prime Minister, Takaichi, has called for “wage-driven inflation,” one that sees price rises corresponding not only to higher costs but also to higher incomes. Consumers cut back on spending Private consumption, which constitutes more than half of Japan’s economy, slowed markedly in Q3. Many households scaled back their spending as prices for necessities such as food, electricity, and gas increased further. Increased costs are stretching household budgets, resulting in less disposable income for discretionary spending on items such as dining out, travel, and entertainment. Consumer confidence was still delicate. Surveys indicate that many families are concerned about the future, particularly regarding job security and the impact of inflation on their financial stability. From the same BOJ survey (September 2025 wave), 62.5% said things are worse than a year ago, while only 3.8% said they felt things had improved Firms scaled back spending on new projects and growing operations or facilities, either because demand from here or abroad was softer. Firms have maintained their own cautious streak amid economic unease, as trade pressure from overseas has continued unabated. Housing spending softened again during the quarter. The construction of new homes and real estate development slowed, as higher interest rates and building costs discouraged both builders and homebuyers. Weak household spending, combined with restrained business investment, has exacerbated the damage caused by declining exports, resulting in a decline in overall GDP.

Recent data reveals alarming signals that every crypto investor needs to understand. Massive Bitcoin deposits flooding into Binance suggest the market might be heading for another significant downturn. What Does the Bitcoin Correction Signal Mean? CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost spotted a crucial pattern that often precedes major market movements. Since October 26th, over 35,000 BTC worth approximately $3.5 billion has moved onto Binance exchanges. This massive transfer coincided with Bitcoin’s price dropping from $114,000 to $94,000. Why should this concern you? Large exchange inflows typically indicate investors are preparing to sell their holdings. When fear grips the market, this trend becomes particularly pronounced. The current Bitcoin correction signals reflect genuine market anxiety rather than random noise. How Do Exchange Inflows Predict Market Movements? Understanding this Bitcoin correction indicator requires knowing how exchanges function. Investors typically move crypto to exchanges for one primary reason: they plan to sell. The recent surge in Binance deposits suggests many holders are positioning themselves for potential exits. Key factors driving this Bitcoin correction signal include: Large-scale institutional moves affecting market liquidity Investor psychology shifting toward risk-off sentiment Market absorption capacity being tested by sell pressure When Can We Expect Market Recovery? Darkfost maintains that until this inflow trend stabilizes and the market absorbs the current sell-off volume, a meaningful rebound remains unlikely. The possibility of further price decline cannot be ruled out during this Bitcoin correction phase. However, experienced traders know that market corrections create opportunities. While the short-term outlook appears cautious, these periods often set the stage for the next bullish cycle. The current Bitcoin correction could present buying opportunities for patient investors. What Should Investors Do During This Bitcoin Correction? Navigating potential market downturns requires strategic thinking. Rather than panic selling, consider these approaches: Monitor exchange flow data for early warning signals Diversify your portfolio across different assets Set clear entry and exit points based on your risk tolerance Keep some dry powder for potential buying opportunities Remember that every Bitcoin correction in history has eventually been followed by recovery. The key is maintaining perspective and avoiding emotional decisions during volatile periods. Frequently Asked Questions What causes a Bitcoin correction? Bitcoin corrections occur due to various factors including profit-taking, negative news, regulatory concerns, or large-scale selling pressure like the current Binance inflows. How long do Bitcoin corrections typically last? Correction periods vary widely, from several days to multiple months, depending on market conditions and the factors driving the downturn. Should I sell during a Bitcoin correction? This depends on your investment strategy. Long-term holders often view corrections as buying opportunities, while short-term traders might adjust positions. How can I track Bitcoin correction signals? Monitor exchange inflow/outflow data, funding rates, fear and greed index, and trading volume for early warning signs. What’s the difference between correction and bear market? A correction typically represents a 10-20% decline from recent highs, while a bear market involves sustained declines of 20% or more over longer periods. Are Bitcoin corrections healthy for the market? Yes, corrections help reset overextended markets, shake out weak hands, and create healthier foundations for future growth.

Look no further than the latest stablecoin issuance data, revealing a massive $14 billion injection into the ecosystem since October 11. This staggering capital inflow highlights growing confidence and sets the stage for potential market expansion. Let’s break down why this matters for investors and the broader crypto landscape. What Does $14B in Stablecoin Issuance Mean for Crypto? Tether and Circle have been busy minting new tokens, with USDT and USDC leading this charge. According to Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics firm, this substantial stablecoin issuance indicates strong capital movement into digital assets. Moreover, Circle’s recent $750 million USDC mint reinforces this trend. Therefore, this activity suggests investors are positioning themselves for future opportunities. How Does Stablecoin Issuance Impact Market Liquidity? Stablecoins serve as crucial liquidity bridges between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. When issuers like Tether and Circle increase supply, it typically signals: Increased trading volume on exchanges Higher buying pressure for other cryptocurrencies Improved market depth and stability This stablecoin issuance acts as a barometer for market sentiment. Consequently, the $14 billion influx since October’s dip could foreshadow renewed bullish momentum. Why Should Investors Monitor Stablecoin Metrics? Tracking stablecoin issuance provides valuable insights into market dynamics. For instance, large minting events often precede price rallies as fresh capital enters the ecosystem. However, investors should also watch redemption patterns to gauge overall risk appetite. This dual perspective helps make informed decisions based on real-time on-chain data rather than speculation alone. What Challenges Accompany Rapid Stablecoin Growth? While increased stablecoin issuance suggests market optimism, it also raises important considerations: Regulatory scrutiny around reserve transparency Potential systemic risks if adoption outpaces oversight Market dependence on centralized issuers Nevertheless, the current growth trajectory demonstrates stablecoins’ evolving role in global finance. How Can Traders Leverage This Information? Smart investors use stablecoin metrics as leading indicators. The recent $14 billion issuance suggests: Accumulation phases may be underway Downside protection through stablecoin holdings Preparation for upcoming market movements By monitoring these patterns, traders can align strategies with capital flow trends. Conclusion: Stablecoin Issuance Signals Renewed Confidence The $14 billion in USDT and USDC created since October’s market dip represents more than just numbers—it reflects growing institutional and retail conviction in cryptocurrency’s future. This stablecoin issuance surge provides essential market liquidity while acting as a confidence meter for the entire ecosystem. As capital continues flowing through these digital dollar proxies, the foundation strengthens for sustainable growth. Frequently Asked Questions Why does stablecoin issuance matter? Stablecoin issuance indicates capital entering crypto markets, often preceding price increases as investors convert to volatile assets. How does USDT differ from USDC? USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) are both dollar-pegged stablecoins but have different issuers, reserve structures, and regulatory compliance approaches. Can stablecoin issuance predict market trends? While not foolproof, large issuance events frequently correlate with upcoming market activity as investors position themselves. What risks come with stablecoin growth? Concerns include reserve transparency, regulatory changes, and centralization risks despite their decentralized usage. How often do stablecoin issuers create new tokens? Issuance occurs based on market demand, with periods of high volatility often triggering increased minting activity. Where can I track stablecoin metrics? On-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Etherscan, and dedicated dashboards provide real-time issuance data. Found this analysis helpful?

The Financial Services Agency is drafting measures that would cover 105 cryptocurrencies listed domestically, including Bitcoin and Ethereum . Exchanges would need to disclose core facts for each asset, such as whether there is an issuer, what technology it uses and the risk of price swings. The plan brings market conduct rules familiar to equity traders into crypto. People with non-public information tied to issuers or exchanges would be barred from trading on material events like listings, delistings or bankruptcies before they are disclosed. Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) plans to reclassify 105 cryptoassets, including BTC and ETH, as “financial products” and push for a tax overhaul in fiscal year 2026—reducing the current progressive crypto tax rate of up to 55% to a flat 20% capital gains tax. The agency… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 16, 2025 Japan Eyes 20% Flat Tax On Crypto Gains, Matching Stock Trading Distribution would broaden as well. Banks and insurers could sell cryptocurrencies to customers through their securities subsidiaries, giving retail investors access via regulated financial channels. Tax treatment would shift to a flat 20% on crypto gains, the same rate as stock trading, down from the current top rate of 55%. A simpler, lower rate could pull activity back onshore and reduce incentives to trade through foreign platforms. The agency aims to submit legislation in next year’s ordinary parliamentary session, the report said. FSA Pushes Clearer Disclosure To Strengthen Investor Confidence Domestic venues handle 105 assets today, a small slice of the thousands that trade globally. The FSA’s disclosure push signals a preference for depth over breadth, with clearer information for the assets that Japanese investors can buy. Market supervision is tightening elsewhere in Tokyo. Bloomberg reported that Japan Exchange Group is weighing stricter use of backdoor listing rules and may seek fresh audits for companies shifting heavily into crypto positions. Three listed firms have paused plans to buy digital assets after pushback, and were told their fundraising could be limited if they centered strategies on accumulating crypto. For traders, the message is clean rules and cleaner data. A 20% rate aligns crypto with equities, insider curbs target information abuse and bank-led distribution offers regulated access.

Not only is it a significant move to strengthen its domestic operations, analysts say, but the commitment is also a means to further expand in key growth sectors. Samsung plans to invest approximately $310 billion (450 trillion won) in South Korea over the next five years, according to the company. The investment will focus on semiconductor manufacturing, artificial-intelligence infrastructure, and advanced battery technology. At the core of the plan is a new chip production line at Samsung’s Pyeongtaek campus , called Plant 5. As global demand for memory chips, primarily for artificial intelligence applications, increases, the new line is expected to commence commercial operations in 2028. Beyond making chips, Samsung also plans to construct two large AI data centers. One is located in South Jeolla Province, enabling the company to be part of the national AI ecosystem, and the other is in Gumi for the development of internal AI capabilities. Investors cheer domestic focus and job growth. Samsung drives domestic growth and global leadership with bold five-year plan Investors viewed the $310 billion pledge as a tangible indication that Samsung would pursue a long-term strategy to stabilize South Korea and foster its economic growth. Such moves reflect Samsung’s confidence, analysts say, not just in the company’s own business, but in the larger South Korean economy. The investment plan is projected to create tens of thousands of jobs, both directly within Samsung itself and indirectly in adjacent industries, such as construction, logistics, and high-tech manufacturing. Moreover, small and medium-sized businesses and start-ups are also expected to benefit, especially as the market is witnessing an increased presence in semiconductors, advanced battery technology, and AI solutions. In the wake of the trade war in global markets and concerns that some Korean companies might relocate overseas to find new business opportunities, Samsung’s investment decision has also served to reassure the government and investors. It also reassures the nation’s identity as an international center for semiconductors, AI, and advanced technology manufacturing. Samsung’s pledge aligns with the government’s efforts to enhance the country’s industrial competitiveness. Analysts believe that Samsung demonstrates its strength by maintaining its core capability to produce at home, which will not only ensure it retains leadership in the global technology and industrial sector but also provide its nation with the capacity to expand its economy. Samsung and peers drive local industrial growth Samsung is not alone in its domestic investment boom. Other large Korean conglomerates, such as Hyundai, LG, and the SK Group, have also announced numerous investment plans on a larger scale in recent months. Cumulatively, the package provides hundreds of billions of dollars in investments to strengthen South Korea’s industrial and technological infrastructure. Those efforts include semiconductors and artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, batteries, and next-generation materials. This wave of locally-driven investments is a vivid indication of confidence in South Korea’s technology and manufacturing capabilities, experts say. By dedicating huge amounts of money to local manufacturing, they are signalling that, in the midst of global competition and changing global supply chains, they are convinced that South Korea can still be a global leader in high-tech sectors. The investment also reflects South Korea’s desire to position semiconductors as strategic assets to support the global economy, specifically in the areas of AI, smartphones, and cloud computing. In particular, artificial intelligence is propelling demand for high-performance memory chips, which puts Samsung’s growth in Pyeongtaek, as well as its AI data centers, at an even more timely moment.

Macro investor Raoul Pal reveals that the secret isn’t complex trading strategies or market timing—it’s something much more fundamental that most investors overlook entirely. Why Does Patience Generate Superior Crypto Returns? Raoul Pal emphasizes that patience, not fear, generates sustainable crypto returns over time. Many investors currently feel terrified during market corrections, convinced they’ve made irreversible mistakes. However, Pal advises sticking to core principles rather than panicking when prices drop. He shares a crucial principle through the acronym DFTU—advising against making critical investment errors during emotional moments. If every market correction feels like a life-altering crisis, your investment approach likely needs adjustment. What Can We Learn From Historical Market Corrections? Pal draws from personal experience to illustrate how patience ultimately generates crypto returns. He first bought Bitcoin in the $200 range and endured significant losses: Two major Bitcoin drawdowns of 85% and 70% Ethereum and Solana positions down 95% at various points Multiple Bitcoin corrections averaging over five 35%+ drops per cycle Despite these temporary setbacks, proper asset allocation and patience generated substantial crypto returns over the long term. When Bitcoin falls 30%, altcoins typically drop more than 60%, creating both risk and opportunity for informed investors. How Can You Avoid Common Investment Mistakes? Pal warns against borrowing conviction from others and highlights the dangers of frequent trading. Many investors sabotage their potential crypto returns by constantly buying and selling based on short-term price movements. Instead, focus on these key principles to generate consistent crypto returns: Maintain proper asset allocation to withstand market volatility Avoid emotional decision-making during price corrections Remember Bitcoin’s historical performance as the highest-returning asset Develop personal conviction rather than following crowd sentiment What Separates Successful Crypto Investors? The ability to generate consistent crypto returns ultimately comes down to psychological resilience. Successful investors understand that market corrections are normal and temporary, while unsuccessful investors react emotionally to short-term price movements. Pal’s experience demonstrates that even massive temporary losses can transform into extraordinary crypto returns when investors maintain patience and discipline. Bitcoin’s history of recovering from severe corrections provides a powerful template for long-term investment success. Frequently Asked Questions How many market corrections does Bitcoin typically experience? Historically, Bitcoin averages more than five corrections of 35% or more per market cycle. These are normal occurrences that patient investors can navigate successfully. What does DFTU mean in crypto investing? DFTU is slang advising investors to avoid making critical mistakes during emotional market periods. It emphasizes sticking to principles rather than panicking. How much do altcoins typically drop when Bitcoin corrects? When Bitcoin falls 30%, altcoins often drop by more than 60%. This creates both significant risk and potential opportunity for informed investors. Is frequent trading beneficial for crypto returns? No, Raoul Pal specifically warns that frequent trading is detrimental to long-term crypto returns. Patience and strategic holding typically outperform active trading. What was Raoul Pal’s experience with crypto losses? He endured an 85% and 70% loss on Bitcoin positions, plus 95% losses on Ethereum and Solana, yet still generated substantial returns through patience and proper allocation. Why is borrowing conviction from others dangerous? Investing based on others’ beliefs rather than personal research often leads to panic selling during corrections, undermining potential crypto returns. If you found these insights valuable, share this article with fellow investors who could benefit from understanding how patience generates crypto returns. Help others avoid common mistakes and build wealth strategically.

He slammed the Bitcoin-only company’s business model as “fraud,” adding that Strategy (MSTR) “will eventually go bankrupt.” The gold investor on Sunday challenged Michael Saylor to a public debate on this proposition during Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in December. “MSTR’s entire business model is a fraud,” Peter Schiff publicly criticized the firm. “Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I believe MSTR will eventually go bankrupt.” MSTR’s entire business model is a fraud. Saylor and I will both be speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in early December. I challenge @saylor to debate this proposition with me. Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I believe $MSTR will eventually go bankrupt. Let’s go! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 16, 2025 In June, he argued that Strategy’s marathon Bitcoin buying spree will look reckless once the next major downturn takes hold. He claimed the coin’s price “won’t stand up over time” and MSTR will fall with it. Besides, Peter Schiff recently invited Binance founder Changpeng Zhao to a debate on tokenized gold vs Bitcoin – “which best satisfies the conditions of money.” Zhao, often referred to as ‘CZ,’ replied to him, saying he is “in the mood for it.” Peter Schiff Explains Why Strategy’s Business Model Would Fail “MSTR’s business model relies on income-oriented funds buying its ‘high-yield’ preferred shares,” Schiff wrote in a separate post on X. MSTR’s business model relies on income-oriented funds buying its “high-yield” preferred shares. But those published yields will never actually be paid. Once fund managers realize this they’ll dump the preferreds & $MSTR won’t be able to issue any more, setting off a death spiral. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 16, 2025 According to him, these yields will “never actually be paid.” Schiff continued that the company will no longer be able to issue more debt, causing a “death spiral.” “Dividends are only paid if MSTR decides to declare a dividend. But there is no requirement for MSTR to ever declare one, and there is no penalty for not doing so. Undeclared dividends don’t accumulate. They are lost forever,” he argued. Peter Schiff has been a persistent Bitcoin skeptic, claiming the crypto’s 21 million supply cap as a “meaningless” metric . He has also compared Bitcoin to silver , advising investors to sell their BTC portions to purchase silver. However, Bitcoin ultimately outperformed silver in early July, rising to $111,999 , and further surging to $124,457 in mid-August . MSTR Stock Risks Crashing as BTC Slumps Further Strategy’s (MSTR) stock has fallen by over 19% in the past 5 days, and nearly 30% over the past month, per Google Finance data . According to experts, the dip in MSTR stock could be attributed to the recent underwhelming performance of the Bitcoin price. Additionally, Strategy’s wallet moving massive BTC holdings to Coinbase has further weighed on the market sentiment. Bitcoin has further slumped on Monday, as part of a broader 10% weekly decline. The largest crypto by market cap failed to hold the $95,500 pivot, dropping to $92,890 on 17 Nov, a critical support breach. Bitcoin has currently rebounded and is trading at $95,384 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap data .

Kim Young-hoon, recognized as the person with the world’s highest IQ, just dropped a bombshell Bitcoin price prediction that’s sending shockwaves through the crypto community. His recent X post forecasts Bitcoin reaching an astonishing $220,000 within the next 45 days – a move that would represent one of the most dramatic price surges in cryptocurrency history. What Makes This Bitcoin Price Prediction So Significant? When someone with verified exceptional intelligence makes a bold financial forecast, investors naturally pay attention. Kim Young-hoon’s credentials as the world’s highest IQ holder lend unique credibility to his Bitcoin price prediction. However, it’s crucial to understand that even the brightest minds can’t guarantee market movements. This prediction comes during a period of significant volatility in cryptocurrency markets, making timing particularly challenging. Several factors could support this ambitious Bitcoin price prediction. Institutional adoption continues growing, regulatory clarity is improving in many regions, and Bitcoin’s scarcity becomes more pronounced with each halving event. Moreover, global economic uncertainty often drives investors toward decentralized assets like Bitcoin as hedge instruments. How Realistic Is This $220K Bitcoin Forecast? Let’s break down the numbers behind this dramatic Bitcoin price prediction. Reaching $220,000 from current levels would require approximately: Massive capital inflow into Bitcoin markets Accelerated institutional adoption beyond current rates Positive regulatory developments across major economies Significant market momentum building on existing trends While the timeframe seems aggressive, cryptocurrency markets have historically demonstrated capacity for rapid, unexpected movements. Remember that past performance never guarantees future results, and this Bitcoin price prediction represents one expert’s analysis rather than financial advice. What Should Investors Consider About This Prediction? Before making any investment decisions based on this Bitcoin price prediction, consider these crucial factors. First, diversify your portfolio rather than concentrating on single assets. Second, establish clear risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders and position sizing. Third, conduct independent research beyond any single expert’s forecast. The cryptocurrency market remains highly speculative and volatile. While this Bitcoin price prediction generates excitement, responsible investing requires balanced perspective and thorough due diligence. Consider both the potential upside and the significant risks involved in cryptocurrency investments. How Does This Compare to Other Bitcoin Predictions? Kim Young-hoon’s Bitcoin price prediction stands among the more optimistic forecasts, but he’s not alone in expecting substantial growth. Several analysts project six-figure Bitcoin valuations, though typically over longer timeframes. The key differentiator here is the compressed 45-day window, which would require extraordinary market conditions. Other experts emphasize gradual appreciation rather than explosive short-term growth. This diversity of opinion highlights the inherent uncertainty in cryptocurrency forecasting and reinforces why investors should consider multiple perspectives before making decisions. What Are the Potential Implications of This Move? If this Bitcoin price prediction materializes, the ramifications would extend far beyond Bitcoin itself. Such a dramatic price surge would likely: Accelerate mainstream cryptocurrency adoption Trigger significant altcoin market movements Attract increased regulatory scrutiny Validate Bitcoin’s store of value narrative The entire digital asset ecosystem would experience ripple effects, potentially reshaping how traditional finance views cryptocurrency markets. However, remember that such rapid appreciation also increases volatility risks and potential for sharp corrections. Final Thoughts on This Bold Bitcoin Forecast Kim Young-hoon’s Bitcoin price prediction certainly captures attention with its combination of dramatic numbers and impressive credentials. While the $220,000 target within 45 days seems ambitious, it underscores the growing optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s long-term potential. The coming weeks will reveal whether market conditions align with this expert’s analysis. Regardless of short-term price movements, Bitcoin continues demonstrating resilience and growing adoption. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or cryptocurrency newcomer, maintaining perspective and practicing risk management remains essential in this dynamic market environment. Frequently Asked Questions Who is Kim Young-hoon? Kim Young-hoon is recognized as the person with the world’s highest recorded IQ, bringing unique analytical perspective to his Bitcoin price prediction. How accurate have previous Bitcoin predictions been? Cryptocurrency predictions vary widely in accuracy. While some experts have made remarkably prescient forecasts, many have missed the mark, highlighting market unpredictability. What factors could drive Bitcoin to $220,000? Massive institutional adoption, favorable global regulation, economic uncertainty driving safe-haven demand, and limited supply could potentially support such price movement. Should I invest based on this prediction? Never invest based solely on any single prediction. Conduct thorough research, assess your risk tolerance, and consider consulting financial advisors before making investment decisions. What timezone does the 45-day prediction use? The prediction timeframe wasn’t specified, but typically such forecasts use the posting date as starting point counting forward 45 calendar days. How can I track this prediction’s progress? Monitor reputable cryptocurrency price tracking platforms and set price alerts to follow Bitcoin’s movement toward the predicted target. Found this analysis insightful?

Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.3879 Market Cap $732.14M Trading Volume $89.24M Circulating Supply 1.89B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.3986 24-hour Low $0.3679 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.84% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.5033 14-Day RSI 40.62 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 10 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.7105 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is stabilizing above $0.38 but still needs to reclaim $0.398 for stronger upside confirmation. The 4-hour chart supports a short-term bounce, but resistance at $0.392 remains a barrier. Optimism 1-day price chart As of November 17, OP is experiencing a slow recovery after multiple days of selling, with today’s candle holding around $0.3887 and stabilizing above the mid-range of the recent consolidation. The price is still trading below the middle Bollinger Band at $0.3985, which remains the first major overhead resistance. A daily close above the mid-band would indicate short-term strength is returning. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative yet is flattening, indicating that bearish pressure is losing force rather than intensifying. The RSI at 40.95 continues to hover in the lower range, aligning with the consolidation phase rather than an imminent breakdown. Optimism 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart reflects a clearer short-term rebound as OP climbs from the recent low wick and pushes toward $0.3888, with momentum somewhat supported by the narrowing Alligator lines. OP is approaching the immediate resistance band between $0.388 and $0.392, where the blue Alligator line and recent rejection zone converge. A close above $0.392 on this timeframe would confirm a short-lived bullish continuation. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI at 45.37 is rising from oversold territory, showing strength but not yet signaling overextension. The OBV also shows a small uptick, which fits with the recent buying seen through the last two candles. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4967 SELL SMA 5 $0.4629 SELL SMA 10 $0.4571 SELL SMA 21 $0.4299 SELL SMA 50 $0.5033 SELL SMA 100 $0.6245 SELL SMA 200 $0.7105 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.4399 SELL EMA 5 $0.4886 SELL EMA 10 $0.5670 SELL EMA 21 $0.6367 SELL EMA 50 $0.6750 SELL EMA 100 $0.7003 SELL EMA 200 $0.8411 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is showing early signs of a base forming, but until $0.398–$0.405 is reclaimed on the daily timeframe, upside remains corrective rather than trending. A break above that zone opens room for a stronger recovery, while failures there would likely keep OP range-bound between $0.36–$0.39. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

The current Bitcoin correction represents a normal market adjustment rather than a fundamental breakdown. According to cryptocurrency experts, this temporary dip actually signals a healthy market reset that could set the stage for future growth. What Exactly is Causing This Bitcoin Correction? Ryan McMillin, Chief Investment Officer at Merkle Tree Capital, identifies three primary factors driving the current Bitcoin correction. First, long-term holders are taking profits after significant gains. Second, spot Bitcoin ETFs have shifted from net inflows to outflows. Third, global macroeconomic uncertainties are creating temporary headwinds. This combination of factors creates a perfect storm for short-term price pressure. However, the underlying Bitcoin fundamentals remain remarkably strong. The market is simply experiencing a natural breathing period after substantial earlier gains. How Does This Bitcoin Correction Differ From Past Downturns? The current market structure shows crucial differences from previous Bitcoin corrections. Institutional participation through ETFs provides substantial liquidity that absorbs selling pressure. This creates a more stable foundation than during earlier market cycles dominated primarily by retail investors. McMillin emphasizes that ETF and institutional liquidity is absorbing a significant portion of the sell-off . This structural change means corrections may be shallower and recovery periods potentially shorter than in previous cycles. Why Should Investors View This as a Healthy Correction? Market corrections serve essential functions in any financial ecosystem. They allow markets to consolidate gains, shake out weak hands, and establish stronger support levels. This Bitcoin correction performs several healthy functions: Resets overextended price levels to sustainable valuations Allows new investors to enter at more attractive prices Tests and strengthens key support levels for future growth Reduces speculative excess that can lead to bubbles Each successful test of support during this Bitcoin correction builds a more robust foundation for the next upward move. What Can We Expect After This Bitcoin Correction Phase? Historical patterns suggest that healthy corrections typically lead to renewed buying interest once the adjustment phase completes. The current Bitcoin correction appears to be following this pattern, with institutional interest remaining strong despite temporary price weakness. The fundamental case for Bitcoin continues to strengthen regardless of short-term price movements. Adoption continues growing, institutional interest remains elevated, and the long-term narrative remains intact. This Bitcoin correction simply represents a pause in that broader upward trajectory. Conclusion: Embracing Market Reality Successful investors understand that corrections are normal, healthy market phenomena. This Bitcoin correction provides an opportunity to reassess positions, add to holdings at better prices, and prepare for the next growth phase. Rather than fearing temporary declines, experienced market participants recognize them as essential components of sustainable long-term growth. The current environment demonstrates the market’s growing maturity. The presence of institutional liquidity and diversified participant base creates a more resilient ecosystem that can withstand normal market fluctuations without collapsing. Frequently Asked Questions How long might this Bitcoin correction last? Correction periods typically last from several weeks to a few months, depending on market conditions and external factors. There’s no fixed timeline, but historical patterns provide useful guidance. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this correction? Unless you need immediate funds, selling during corrections often locks in losses. Many investors use corrections as buying opportunities to improve their average entry prices. What price level would signal the end of this Bitcoin correction? Look for stabilization above key support levels and renewed buying volume. Technical analysts monitor specific price zones, but fundamentals ultimately drive long-term value. Are Bitcoin ETFs making corrections more or less severe? ETFs appear to be moderating correction severity by providing additional liquidity and institutional participation that absorbs selling pressure more efficiently. How does this Bitcoin correction compare to 2022’s bear market? This appears fundamentally different—2022 involved major contagion events and leverage unwinding, while current conditions reflect normal profit-taking and adjustment. What indicators should I watch during this Bitcoin correction? Monitor ETF flows, exchange reserves, miner activity, and overall market sentiment alongside price action for a comprehensive view.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin fell to $93,000 on Monday in Asia, its sharpest drop since March, as traders trimmed expectations of a December US rate cut and global stocks opened on the defensive. Liquidations told the story. CoinGlass data showed $617.45m wiped out in 24 hours, with longs at $394.50m and shorts at $222.95m. Bitcoin accounted for $242.19m and Ether for $169.06m. The largest single wipeout was a $30.60m BTC position on Hyperliquid. Wall Street set a weak tone. Futures softened after Friday’s slump left the Dow down 1.65%, the S&P 500 off 1.66% and the Nasdaq lower by 2.29%. Total crypto market cap falls below $3.3T. pic.twitter.com/vpTo1Sojll — CoinGecko (@coingecko) November 16, 2025 Market snapshot Bitcoin : $95,051, down 0.7% Ether : $3,172, down 0.7% XRP : $2.25, up 0.4% Total crypto market cap: $3.31 trillion, down 0.9% Markets Pare Risk As Fed Cut Bets Shrink To 40% Europe added to the caution. Germany’s DAX fell 1.39%, the FTSE 100 slipped 1.05%, France’s CAC 40 eased 0.11%, and the Euro Stoxx 50 lost 0.83%. Asia followed with a mixed open. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.77%, Australia’s S&P ASX 200 fell 1.35%, New Zealand’s benchmark declined 1.58% and Shanghai edged down 0.16%. Rate expectations kept risk in check. Market pricing for a December Fed cut slid to around 40% from more than 60% a week ago, pushing investors toward cash and away from high beta trades. Liquidations Pile Up As Crypto Markets Struggle For Support Crypto mirrored that shift. Spot ETF outflows picked up and liquidity thinned, leaving Bitcoin to give back gains built on easier policy hopes. By late morning, it hovered near $95,051 after the early plunge. Japan added a domestic twist. The Asahi reported the Financial Services Agency is weighing rules that would treat crypto as financial products subject to insider trading restrictions, with a tax cut to a flat 20% and new disclosures for 105 listed tokens. Equity traders also eyed a heavy week for earnings and delayed US data that could shape the rate narrative. Tech leaders remained in focus as investors reassessed valuations built on artificial intelligence enthusiasm. In the liquidation tape, pressure was steady through the session. Twelve-hour liquidations totaled $389.39m with $283.40m from longs. Four-hour totals reached $76.11m, led by short losses at $67.04m. Traders said renewed institutional conviction will decide whether the next move is a base or another leg lower.

The price has remained stagnant, and market participants have looked for signals that could explain what may come next. A recent post by prominent market analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) added a new angle to the discussion by highlighting a metric that often gains attention during periods of uncertainty. He shared a chart showing Relative Unrealized Loss on a seven days moving average and stated that “when unrealized losses spike, $XRP has historically bounced hard.” BREAKING: WHEN UNREALIZED LOSSES SPIKE, $XRP HAS HISTORICALLY BOUNCED HARD. IT’S HAPPENING AGAIN! pic.twitter.com/V1KU2cFsrV — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 15, 2025 What The Indicator Shows The Relative Unrealized Loss metric measures the proportion of supply currently held below its cost basis. Rising values indicate that more holders are underwater. In the past year, XRP saw moments where this level increased for a short window before a price reversal. The chart shows that XRP experienced massive 500% surge between November 2024 and January 2025, when this value was high. Another brief spike in the middle of the year pushed XRP to its all-time high , and the data shows that the value is rising rapidly again. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The recent move stands out because it arrives after the XRPC ETF’s record-breaking launch , which generated interest but did not produce the immediate volatility some investors expected. Instead, the price stayed calm while the metric climbed. This suggests that the current situation may differ from earlier phases of excitement without sustained follow-through. Steph’s analysis suggests this is a constructive setup because past spikes in unrealized losses often coincided with rapid price rally. Why This Development Matters For XRP The timing supports the view that XRP may sit at an early stage of a new cycle. If investors treat the recent metric spike as they have before, the situation could bring renewed demand. XRP’s muted performance may reflect temporary consolidation rather than a shift. The launch of the XRPC ETF still carries weight, especially as new products often take time to influence liquidity and behavior. The Relative Unrealized Loss spike shows that investors are navigating short-term uncertainty while maintaining longer-term interest.

According to Wu Blockchain reports, this YU stablecoin depegs event has caused the token to plummet to just $0.42, representing a catastrophic 54.9% loss in value within 24 hours. What Exactly Happened When YU Stablecoin Depegs? The YU stablecoin depegs event represents one of the most significant stablecoin failures in recent memory. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a consistent value, typically pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar. When a YU stablecoin depegs situation occurs, it indicates serious underlying problems with the token’s stability mechanisms. This particular YU stablecoin depegs incident saw the token lose more than half its value almost overnight. The rapid decline suggests that either: Market confidence evaporated suddenly Liquidity pools became insufficient Technical issues compromised the peg mechanism External market pressures overwhelmed the stability protocols Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This Depegging? When any stablecoin experiences depegging, it serves as a crucial reminder of the risks inherent in cryptocurrency investments. The YU stablecoin depegs event highlights several important considerations for investors: First, it demonstrates that even assets marketed as “stable” can experience extreme volatility. Second, the YU stablecoin depegs situation underscores the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms that maintain a token’s peg. Moreover, this YU stablecoin depegs incident affects: Investor confidence across the crypto space Trust in Bitcoin-native protocols like Yala Regulatory scrutiny of stablecoin projects Future adoption of similar financial instruments How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? The ramifications of this YU stablecoin depegs event extend far beyond just YU holders. Stablecoins serve as crucial infrastructure within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, facilitating trading, lending, and decentralized finance operations. When a YU stablecoin depegs situation occurs, it can create ripple effects throughout the market. Other stablecoins may face increased scrutiny, and investors might become more cautious about similar projects. The YU stablecoin depegs incident particularly impacts Yala’s reputation as a Bitcoin-native liquidity protocol. What Can We Learn From This Stablecoin Crisis? This YU stablecoin depegs event provides valuable lessons for both investors and project developers. The dramatic price collapse emphasizes the importance of: Thorough due diligence before investing Understanding the mechanisms behind stability guarantees Diversifying across different stablecoin projects Monitoring market sentiment and liquidity conditions The YU stablecoin depegs situation serves as a stark reminder that in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, even seemingly safe assets can carry significant risks. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when a stablecoin depegs? When a stablecoin depegs, it means the token has lost its 1:1 value ratio with its target asset, typically the US dollar. This indicates failure in the mechanisms designed to maintain price stability. How common are stablecoin depegging events? While minor depegging occurs occasionally, major depegs like the YU stablecoin depegs incident are relatively rare but can have significant consequences for investors and the broader market. Can YU recover from this depegging? Recovery depends on multiple factors including market confidence, liquidity restoration, and protocol adjustments. However, major depegs often result in permanent loss of trust. Should I invest in stablecoins after this incident? Stablecoins remain useful tools, but this YU stablecoin depegs event emphasizes the importance of choosing well-established, transparent projects with proven track records. What protections exist for stablecoin investors? Currently, stablecoin investors have limited protections. The market operates largely without insurance or government guarantees, making due diligence essential. How can I identify stablecoins at risk of depegging? Watch for declining trading volumes, reduced liquidity, negative community sentiment, and any changes to the stability mechanisms that maintain the peg. Found this analysis helpful?

The Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country's top financial regulator, is preparing to reclassify 105 crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, into the “financial product” category. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the cryptocurrencies in question will be regulated under the Financial Products Transactions Act. The FSA's move reportedly includes requesting tax relief from the government ahead of the next fiscal year. According to Asahi, these new regulations will be similar to the tax model applied to stock trading and could significantly put an end to Japan's controversial crypto taxation system. Under Japan's current system, cryptocurrency earnings are declared as “miscellaneous income,” and investors in the highest tax bracket are required to pay 55% of their earnings to the government. Given that cryptocurrency earnings are considered capital gains and taxed at lower rates in many countries, Japan's system has long been the subject of criticism. If the FSA's proposal is implemented, profits from these 105 cryptocurrencies would be taxed at a single, flat tax rate of 20%. The agency hasn't made an official statement on the matter, but the report stated that criteria such as transparency, the reputation of the issuing institutions, technological robustness, and price volatility risk were taken into consideration in determining the coins to be included on the list. The FSA is also planning to introduce new rules to prevent insider trading in the domestic crypto industry, according to the report. Under the regulations, individuals and companies affiliated with exchanges or issuers would be prohibited from trading while possessing sensitive data, such as listing dates or financial status information that has not yet been disclosed.

Japan's cryptocurrency sector currently has a “green list” system managed by its own self-regulatory body, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA). The list currently includes 30 crypto assets, including high-cap coins like BTC, ETH, MATIC, XRP, and LTC. For a token to be greenlisted, it must meet three conditions: Must be listed on at least three JVCEA member exchanges Must be listed on a JVCEA member exchange for at least six months It is deemed “eligible” by the JVCEA and is allowed to be listed unconditionally. *This is not investment advice.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3195 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility, ensuring that the total supply remains accessible to users. Pi Network is reaching one of the most crucial phases in 2025; as the market is still suspicious, the on-chain activity and the Pi ecosystem continue to develop. Pi recently recorded a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, 2025, down sharply from its February peak of $2.98, underscoring the token’s high volatility in the crypto market. Despite this, key fundamental factors are keeping investor interest alive. Passkey Update enhanced the security of the Pi Wallet with Face ID, fingerprint, and PIN ahead of the Mainnet launch. New DeFi tools Pi DEX and AMM on Testnet allow users to transact Pi and explore decentralized finance in a Web3-aligned way. Meanwhile, Pi Network Ventures partnered with OpenMind AI to build a decentralized AI infrastructure, and a recent system process enabled 3.36 million Pioneers to complete identity verification pi network on Pi Network. With the Pi Hackathon 2025 and Sign Protocol partnership ongoing, the Pi network price prediction suggests a resilient ecosystem still focused on utility and long-term growth within the declining exponential model that defines its supply and mining rewards In this article on Pi price prediction and Pi Network price prediction, we analyze recent technical factors and fundamental developments, including price history, key support levels, resistance levels, and multiple technical quantitative indicators, to assess whether Pi’s current forecast points to recovery or further decline between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.2245 Price Change 24h 2.51% Market Cap $1.85B Circulating Supply 8.31B PI Trading Volume 24h $31.42M All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.2245 Price Prediction $ 0.1860 (-24.97%) Fear & Greed Index 33 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 10.61% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2672 200-Day SMA No Data 14-Day RSI 56.56 (Neutral) Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown : Pi trades at $0.2245, up by 2.51% in the past 24 hours after briefly reaching a high near $0.2314. Pi’s price shows early stabilization, supported by fading bearish pressure and a moderate pickup in volume. Resistance is between $0.23 and $0.246, while support remains at $0.22 and $0.215. As of November 16, 2025, Pi Network’s price is showing a steady recovery after a small pullback earlier in the week. Pi is trading at $0.2245, slightly recovering after intraday lows of $0.2177. Bulls are still defending the level of support at $0.22, despite the subdued volume, indicating that the market is experiencing a tamed consolidation period as traders wait for a momentum trigger. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows that there was a transition period following weeks of the PI price sliding down. Pi ranged between $0.2177 and $0.2314, then stabilized at $0.2245 and created a narrow sideways trade that reflects indecision but with improving sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 47.05, just behind the signal line 51.38. This indicates a neutral market with a slight bullish bias. A sustained break above 50 would confirm accumulation and could push Pi toward $0.236 – $0.246. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) lines are at–0.0032 and –0.0037, with a slightly positive histogram at +0.0005, showing mild bullish buildup. The narrowing distance between MACD and signal line suggests an approaching bullish crossover, signaling the possibility of a short-term uptrend if volume strengthens.. Immediate resistance stands at $0.23, aligning with recent local highs, while solid support sits near $0.22 and $0.215. A close above $0.23 could spark a move toward $0.246–$0.25, while losing $0.22 may drag Pi back to $0.21. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, Pi Network is trading around $0.2225, reflecting an intraday decline after a rejection near $0.2273. Pi has been ranging between $0.2199 and $0.2273, showing low-volatility consolidation as traders recheck momentum near the $0.22 and $0.23 zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 50.99, sitting just above its signal line at 47.58, indicating a mild bullish bias even though momentum has cooled off from the overbought spike earlier. A sustained hold above 55 RSI could open room for renewed accumulation toward $0.23 and $0.235. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) line at 0.0010 is slightly above the signal line at 0.0000, with a small positive histogram (0.0009). This shallow divergence suggests neutral-to-bullish pressure, showing early signs of buyers returning after the dip. If the MACD crossover strengthens, Pi Network could attempt another push toward $0.229 and $0.233. If Pi closes above $0.227, short-term upside targets remain $0.233 to $0.24, confirming improving buyer strength. However, failure to hold the $0.220 support may trigger a pullback toward $0.215, where stronger liquidity sits. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3019 SELL SMA 5 $0.2744 SELL SMA 10 $0.2451 BUY SMA 21 $0.2286 BUY SMA 50 $0.2672 SELL SMA 100 $0.3262 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2387 BUY EMA 5 $0.2571 SELL EMA 10 $0.2897 SELL EMA 21 $0.3235 SELL EMA 50 $0.3764 SELL EMA 100 $0.4668 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to continue moving sideways between $0.22 and $0.23 as momentum cools off after an earlier brief spike. The RSI shows mild bullish strength but not enough to break resistance, while the MACD remains weak, signaling that buyers are present but not dominant. For Pi to make a meaningful move, it must reclaim $0.235 and $0.24 with stronger volume; otherwise, the price may drift back toward $0.218 to $0.22 as traders review the fading momentum. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price up today? Pi is up today because it broke above key resistance with stronger buying volume, and a whale accumulated around 1M PI, boosting confidence and accelerating the upward move. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation.

This groundbreaking initiative represents a significant step toward integrating digital assets into traditional banking systems. If you’re following cryptocurrency developments, this move signals a major shift in how financial institutions approach digital transformation. What Are Tokenized Deposits and Why Do They Matter? Tokenized deposits convert traditional bank deposits into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens maintain the same value as regular deposits but offer enhanced functionality. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) recognizes this technology’s potential to revolutionize financial services. This approach enables faster settlements and improved liquidity management. Moreover, it bridges the gap between conventional banking and emerging digital asset ecosystems. The pilot program builds upon previous sandbox experiments to test real-world applications. How Does Hong Kong’s Tokenized Deposits Pilot Work? The live pilot operates through the digital Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD+) infrastructure. It focuses initially on tokenized money market funds and real-time liquidity management. Here are the key components: Digital settlement using blockchain technology Integration with traditional banking systems Real-time transaction processing Enhanced security protocols The program will continue until 2026, allowing thorough testing and refinement. This extended timeline ensures robust implementation before full-scale deployment. What Benefits Do Tokenized Deposits Offer? Tokenized deposits provide numerous advantages over traditional banking methods. Financial institutions gain operational efficiencies while customers enjoy improved services. The system enables: Faster transaction settlements – reducing processing times from days to minutes Enhanced transparency – through immutable blockchain records Improved liquidity management – enabling real-time fund transfers Reduced costs – by eliminating intermediary requirements These benefits position Hong Kong as a forward-thinking financial hub. The successful implementation could set a global standard for digital banking innovation. What Challenges Might Tokenized Deposits Face? Despite the promising benefits, tokenized deposits encounter several hurdles. Regulatory compliance remains a primary concern for financial authorities. Technical infrastructure requirements present another significant challenge. Market adoption depends on user education and trust building. Cybersecurity risks require robust mitigation strategies. The HKMA addresses these concerns through careful pilot management and stakeholder collaboration. How Does This Impact Global Financial Markets? Hong Kong’s tokenized deposits initiative influences international finance significantly. Other financial centers monitor the pilot’s progress closely. Successful implementation could accelerate global adoption of similar systems. The project demonstrates practical blockchain application in mainstream banking. It also showcases how traditional and digital finance can coexist productively. This development may inspire other jurisdictions to explore comparable innovations. Conclusion: The Future of Tokenized Deposits Hong Kong’s live pilot for tokenized deposits marks a pivotal moment in financial technology evolution. The program bridges traditional banking with digital asset capabilities effectively. As the pilot progresses until 2026, we anticipate valuable insights that will shape global financial infrastructure. The successful integration of tokenized deposits could redefine banking efficiency and accessibility. This initiative positions Hong Kong at the forefront of financial innovation while setting benchmarks for other markets to follow. Frequently Asked Questions What are tokenized deposits? Tokenized deposits are digital representations of traditional bank deposits on blockchain networks. They maintain parity with regular deposits while enabling enhanced functionality. How long will the Hong Kong pilot run? The pilot program is scheduled to operate until 2026, allowing comprehensive testing and refinement of the tokenized deposits system. What assets are involved in the initial phase? The pilot initially focuses on tokenized money market funds and real-time liquidity management transactions. How does this benefit regular bank customers? Customers may experience faster transactions, improved transparency, and enhanced banking services through tokenized deposits implementation. Is the digital Hong Kong dollar different from regular HKD? The e-HKD+ maintains parity with traditional Hong Kong dollars while existing as a digital token for specific financial applications. Could this system replace traditional banking? Tokenized deposits complement rather than replace traditional banking, offering additional functionality while maintaining existing systems.

His comments were made as Bitcoin slipped below $99,000. Strategy’s stock also plunged more than 50% since July, and its mNAV struggled to recover from a drop below 1. Meanwhile, gold held firmly above $4,000 and remained near record highs, giving Schiff fresh ammunition to argue that Bitcoin is too volatile to serve as a reliable corporate treasury asset. Schiff Says Strategy Faces a Death Spiral Gold investor Peter Schiff reignited his long-running feud with the crypto industry, this time targeting Strategy (MSTR) and its executive chairman Michael Saylor. In a series of posts on X , Schiff called Strategy’s Bitcoin-heavy business model a “fraud” and publicly challenged Saylor to debate him at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai this December. The attack came during a period of market weakness for both Bitcoin and crypto-treasury-focused companies, while gold surged back above the $4,000 level. Schiff argued that Strategy’s business model hinges on income-oriented funds purchasing the company’s high-yield preferred shares. According to him, the yields advertised to investors will “never actually be paid,” and once fund managers realize that, they will abandon the asset. Schiff believes this will trigger a “death spiral,” and will prevent Strategy from issuing new debt and ultimately undermine its broader strategy of using capital markets to accumulate more Bitcoin. His criticism is similar to his long-standing belief that the crypto sector overpromises and underdelivers while masking fundamental weaknesses with aggressive marketing. The comments landed at quite a sensitive moment. Bitcoin recently fell below $99,000, extending a decline of more than 20% from the record high close to $125,000 that was reached in early October. The flash crash on Oct. 10 erased tens of billions from the market, and seriously shook investor confidence across crypto-exposed equities. BTC’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Strategy has been hit particularly hard, with its stock price down over 50% since July and currently trading near $199. One of the most closely watched indicators for the company, its mNAV — which measures the premium at which shares trade relative to the value of underlying Bitcoin holdings — dropped below 1 in November. Although it has recovered to 1.21, this is still well below the “healthy” level of 2 or higher that many treasury-focused investors prefer to see. Meanwhile, gold strengthened in the face of the crypto market’s drawdown. Prices held above the critical $4,000 support level, and climbed to around $4,085 per ounce after briefly dipping earlier in the month. Gold reached an all-time high of roughly $4,380 per ounce in October, which helped push its total market capitalization above $30 trillion before settling back to current levels. Schiff is a longtime gold advocate, and used the metal’s relative resilience as even more evidence that Bitcoin remains too volatile and speculative to justify its growing role in corporate treasury management.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 05:30:00

This perfect storm of monetary policy uncertainty and economic weakness is creating treacherous conditions for Forex traders and cryptocurrency investors alike. Why are Asian currencies declining against the dollar? The US dollar continues to strengthen as Federal Reserve officials maintain their hawkish stance on interest rates. Recent economic data showing persistent inflation has forced markets to reconsider their earlier optimism about imminent rate cuts. The dollar index has climbed to multi-month highs, putting downward pressure on emerging market currencies across Asia. Federal Reserve policy shift rattles global markets Market expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts have been pushed further into 2024 as inflation proves more stubborn than anticipated. Several Fed officials have emphasized the need to keep rates higher for longer, causing a fundamental repricing across global asset classes. This shift is particularly painful for Asian economies that benefit from lower US borrowing costs. Currency Recent Performance Key Factors Japanese Yen -2.3% BoJ policy divergence, weak GDP Chinese Yuan -1.8% Property crisis, export weakness Indian Rupee -1.2% Oil imports, capital outflows South Korean Won -2.1% Tech exports, China exposure Japan GDP contraction signals deeper economic troubles Japan’s economy shrank by 0.5% in the third quarter, far worse than economists had projected. The Japan GDP decline was driven by multiple factors including weak consumer spending, falling business investment, and sluggish exports. This contraction raises serious questions about the Bank of Japan’s ability to normalize monetary policy while supporting economic growth. Interest rates outlook: What traders need to know The current interest rates environment presents significant challenges for Asian central banks. With the Federal Reserve likely to maintain higher rates, regional policymakers face difficult choices between defending their currencies and supporting economic growth. Key considerations for traders include: Timing of potential Fed policy shifts Regional inflation trajectories Capital flow patterns Central bank intervention risks Forex market implications and trading strategies The Forex market is experiencing heightened volatility as these fundamental shifts unfold. Currency pairs involving Asian currencies are showing increased correlation with US Treasury yields and risk sentiment. Traders should monitor several key indicators including US inflation data, Asian export figures, and central bank communications for directional cues. Frequently Asked Questions How does Federal Reserve policy affect Asian currencies? When the Federal Reserve raises or maintains high interest rates, it typically strengthens the US dollar while putting pressure on emerging market currencies. Asian central banks often face difficult choices between raising rates to defend their currencies or keeping rates low to support economic growth. What caused Japan’s GDP contraction? Japan’s GDP contraction resulted from multiple factors including weak consumer spending, declining business investment, and sluggish export performance. The Bank of Japan continues to struggle with balancing inflation control and economic support. Which Asian currencies are most vulnerable to Fed policy? Currencies with high external financing needs and those with close trade links to China tend to be most vulnerable. The South Korean won, Indonesian rupiah, and Indian rupee often show high sensitivity to Federal Reserve policy shifts. How are cryptocurrency markets reacting to these developments? Cryptocurrency markets are showing increased correlation with traditional risk assets amid these macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin and major altcoins have experienced selling pressure as dollar strength and rising Treasury yields reduce risk appetite across global markets. What should Forex traders watch in coming weeks? Traders should monitor key economic indicators including US CPI data, Federal Reserve meeting minutes, Asian export figures, and central bank interventions. The Federal Reserve chair’s speeches and G20 meetings may provide important policy signals. The combination of fading Federal Reserve rate cut expectations and Japan’s economic contraction has created a challenging environment for Asian currencies. As the US dollar maintains its strength and regional growth concerns mount, Forex traders must navigate increased volatility and shifting correlations. The path forward will depend heavily on incoming economic data and central bank responses across both developed and emerging markets.

The Federal Aviation Administration’s decision to end emergency flight restrictions, President Donald Trump’s call for the release of Epstein files, major portfolio shifts by investor Peter Thiel, and Bitcoin briefly losing all its gains for the year. FAA ends emergency flight restrictions after shutdown The Federal Aviation Administration announced Sunday that it is lifting all commercial flight restrictions imposed at 40 major US airports during the nation’s record 43-day government shutdown. Airlines can resume full schedules beginning Monday at 6 am EST. The FAA and Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said the order, in effect since November 7, was driven by severe staffing shortages in air traffic control facilities. Flight cuts initially stood at 4% and peaked at 6% before being scaled back to 3% as staffing improved after the shutdown ended on November 12. This weekend saw the lowest cancellation levels since the restrictions began, with less than 1% of flights canceled, according to Cirium. FlightAware reported 149 cancellations Sunday and 315 on Saturday. A safety review prompted the rescinding of the order, though the FAA is assessing reports of airline non-compliance during the emergency period. At their worst on November 9, cancellations exceeded 2,900 amid staffing shortages and severe weather. The FAA had initially planned cuts of up to 10% before conditions began to improve late last week. Trump urges House GOP to release Epstein files President Donald Trump reversed his position Sunday, calling on House Republicans to vote to release Jeffrey Epstein–related files — a move he had decried as a “hoax” only days earlier. Trump said releasing the documents would dispel what he called a Democratic attempt to distract from political losses and the shutdown. He noted that the Justice Department has already released “tens of thousands” of pages and highlighted his directive to investigate Epstein’s ties to high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton. A Clinton spokesperson said recent email releases showed the former president “did nothing and knew nothing.” A bipartisan discharge petition led by Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie have forced the issue to the House floor, drawing support from several Trump-aligned Republicans. Speaker Mike Johnson, who previously opposed the measure, has agreed to bring it to a vote this week. Peter Thiel offloads Nvidia, cuts Tesla amid AI bubble concerns Billionaire investor Peter Thiel drastically reshaped his portfolio in Q3, selling his entire Nvidia stake and trimming Tesla holdings as worries grow over what he calls an “AI Bubble.” Thiel Macro LLC slashed its assets from $212 million in Q2 to $74.4 million in Q3, dumping 537,742 Nvidia shares, once 40% of its portfolio, and all holdings in Vistra Corp. The fund also cut Tesla shares by 76%, leaving 65,000 shares as its largest position. Thiel increased exposure to Microsoft and Apple, adding 49,000 and 79,181 shares respectively. His view: diversified tech giants offer more durable long-term value than AI-dependent chipmakers. The investor has repeatedly compared current AI enthusiasm to the 1999 dot-com era, suggesting that expected transformations will take years to materialize. Bitcoin briefly erases all 2025 gains as market slides Bitcoin slid to $93,029 on Sunday, down 25% from its October all-time high, temporarily erasing all gains made this year. It has since recovered to around $95,077.24. The crypto pullback comes despite expectations of a strong year under the Trump administration, which has taken a pro-crypto stance and overseen rising corporate Bitcoin adoption and ETF inflows. However, tariff battles, the prolonged government shutdown, and heavy selling by long-time Bitcoin holders have pressured the market. Analysts at Glassnode said the so-called “OG Whales Dumping” narrative reflects typical late-cycle profit-taking, not a mass exit. Major altcoins also fell, with Ether down nearly 4% and Solana dropping over 27% year-to-date. Some industry voices remain optimistic: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said the “debasement trade” could drive a strong crypto rally in 2026, supported by growth in stablecoins, tokenization and DeFi.

The price of Zcash increased above $700 on Sunday, which sparked disputes online between Bitcoin and Zcash fans. Just a day before, the price of Zcash had dropped to $598, but now it has made a strong comeback, and people have started discussing privacy-oriented assets making a comeback. Bitcoin fans are upset because the price of Zcash has gone up a lot The Bitcoin fans who always believed BTC was the only real coin and everything else was a scam had a particularly hard time accepting the fact that Zcash rose above $700. They could not explain why the price of Zcash increased so rapidly in such a short timeframe, as they were accustomed to seeing slow, steady growth in Bitcoin. The CEO of Bitwise, Hunter Horsley, said the critics are having a hard time discussing the Zcash gain because it goes against everything they believe makes a cryptocurrency real or important . Many Bitcoin supporters shared their surprise, anger, or concern about Zcash online, sparking a debate about what constitutes a “real” cryptocurrency in the community’s eyes. Some Bitcoin fans, like Bit Paine, even accused the Zcash rally of being a “coordinated pump and dump.” They referred to the coin’s 1,500% increase since October and stated that it is due to the actions of big investors or companies pushing the price up for their own benefit. Additionally, they argue that small investors who buy in late will lose a significant amount of money if the price drops too quickly, making this gain risky, unfair, and contributing to the overall instability of the crypto market. BTC fans want all other coins to work just like theirs does, with growth being safe and predictable. On the other hand, privacy coin enthusiasts are okay with the rapid fluctuations in Zcash’s price because the coin offers users more control and privacy than Bitcoin. The argument isn’t even about money, but about what makes a coin real or trustworthy. Secret coins fans are happy because the price of Zcash has gone up a lot Most people in the Bitcoin community criticized Zcash for its rapid rise in popularity. Still, privacy supporters argued that these criticisms lacked foresight, as they overlooked the coin’s technology, purpose, and growing popularity. The CEO of RPC provider Helius, Mert Mumtaz, said many of the BTC fans sounded more like conspiracy theorists because their attacks lacked financial analysis. He explained that Zcash, like BTC, helps investors make money, but it goes beyond just that and offers privacy and security to its users. At a time when governments, large companies, and hackers are closely monitoring all activities related to Bitcoin, Zcash is protecting the identity of its users during transactions. Zcash became the largest privacy-focused cryptocurrency as of October, when it passed its eight-year high and overtook Monero (XMR) in market capitalization. At the time of writing, it had achieved a market capitalization of over $11.2 billion, positioning it close to overtaking Cardano (ADA) and entering the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally. Investors and companies have also begun to show interest in Zcash, with Arthur Hayes, founder of the BitMEX exchange, stating that his family office , Maelstrom, holds Zcash as its second-largest liquid asset, after Bitcoin. When Zcash held its rally, Leap Therapeutics rebranded to Cypherpunk Technologies (a Zcash treasury-backed company) and got funding from Winklevoss Capital. This significant investment increased the price of its shares by over 170%, and Zcash fans say it’s proof that their coin is gaining even more popularity by the day. The rise of Zcash also sparked discussions about incorporating privacy features into Bitcoin. People wanted to reactivate a Bitcoin opcode called OP_CAT, so the coin could support advanced privacy functions and other features that Zcash already provides. For privacy supporters, the implementation of Zcash could serve as an example of how to utilize other cryptocurrencies, prompting a new way of thinking about privacy protection and blockchain adoption. The Zcash rally in the cryptocurrency community has become a national symbol, and the coin’s fans are reveling in the attention it is getting. They say Zcash demonstrates that privacy coins can coexist with Bitcoin and propel the space forward. Get seen where it counts.

The last week has been categorized by slow market movement, with Bitcoin chopping more sideways and then moving further down with each decision. At this point, it seems that there is a major hunt for liquidity in the market that could trigger further decline, something highlighted by crypto analyst TehThomas in a recent post. Bitcoin Price Needs To Reclaim $97,000 Thomas’ analysis focuses on the recent Bitcoin price breakouts that have ultimately ended with the cryptocurrency giving the gains back to the market in a dramatic way. This comes after the Bitcoin price completed its foray into new all-time high levels, clearing $126,000 in the process. However, since then, it has been a tale of a slow decline. Most of this decline has been a result of direct selling , especially with billion-dollar whales dumping their considerable BTC holdings on the market. This push-down has driven the Bitcoin price down to a critical level, and its capacity for recovery now depends on whether it’s able to reclaim the $97,000 level. The reason for this, as the crypto analyst explains, is that it would mean that the buyers are beginning to return to the market. Thus, if the Bitcoin price reclaims the $97,000 level with momentum, then it would see a short-term bounce to put it back above $100,000. The Bears Still Have Their Positions For the bearish scenario, the crypto analyst explains that the bitcoin price would need to fail to close above $95,000. As seen over the weekend, this support level has already been weakened after the Bitcoin price breakdown and could see more decline as a result. If it fails to hold up, then the current downtrend should be expected to deepen. This is because the Bitcoin price would be falling to the next levels, where there is much deeper liquidity, and these levels happen to lie below $90,000 . This support level would pull the price in until the buyers step in again. “In that situation, the next major support zone below becomes the logical draw, and the path shown on the chart, a small bounce followed by another leg down, fits well with the current momentum,” the analyst explains. Given this, the buyers would have to step in this new week to ensure another push, or the Bitcoin price risks a further crash.",Uncategorized|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-17 06:00:17

Here’s the Price Target,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-staircase-to-valhalla-unveiled-heres-the-price-target/,"Market participants often search for structure during periods of uncertainty, and some analysts point to recurring patterns as they assess future price behavior. A recent post from ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA), a well-known crypto analyst, has revealed a notable structure for XRP, placing the asset at what he views as a critical stage. His analysis features a chart labeled with consolidation phases and an Elliott Wave structure , which he described as XRP’s “Staircase To Valhalla”. His chart arranges past price behavior into repeating sequences that he believes set the stage for an upcoming expansion. $XRP Staircase To Valhalla https://t.co/UKwbAsywwb pic.twitter.com/nMYiajXjMV — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 15, 2025 The Current XRP 5-Wave Pattern The chart depicts several labeled segments that show alternating consolidation zones and strong upward movements. ChartNerd marks these areas as consecutive waves, with each expansion following a period of compressed trading. The Elliott Wave structure began forming in 2023 and hit its stride in late 2024, when Wave 3 pushed XRP up by over 500%. This rally pushed XRP to a peak of $3.39 in January 2025, and it built on this momentum, hitting an all-time high of $3.65 in July after months of consolidation. He labels two segments as consolidation. The first preceded the 500% surge, and the second is XRP’s current performance, beginning in early 2025, and now nearing its end. The end of this consolidation lines up with Wave 5 of the Elliott Wave pattern, as the analyst suggests a massive surge once this breakout occurs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Targets for XRP ChartNerd’s chart shows XRP trading at $2.25, but suggests a massive surge is imminent. Potential targets are $3, $7, and $15, with the first target matching a crucial resistance level that XRP must turn into support, and the final two levels representing new peaks for the digital asset. The analyst referenced an older post in which he highlighted a missing blow-off top, burn, providing a broader view of XRP’s trajectory. Crucially, XRP has remained above a long-term support level that previously held it down. This adds to the bullish signals for the digital asset. His updated analysis has highlighted these potential targets, suggesting the blow-off top could reach double digits. His new condensed chart signals that the key takeaway lies in the most recent segment. The context from the earlier chart supports his belief that the asset tends to follow a recurring pattern, culminating in a pronounced upward surge.

According to ZachXBT, a whale holding a large amount of Cardano traded 14.4 million ADA ($6.9 million) for 847,000 USDA, Cardano's dollar-pegged stablecoin, about two hours ago.

The cryptocurrency market faced intense selling pressure amid broader risk-off sentiment across global equities. The digital asset experienced widespread liquidations totaling $617.45 million within 24 hours. Long positions accounted for $394.50 million of the losses, while short positions contributed $222.95 million. Bitcoin alone saw $242.19 million in liquidations, with Ethereum following at $169.06 million. The largest single liquidation event wiped out a $30.60 million Bitcoin position on Hyperliquid. Market pricing for a December Federal Reserve rate cut dropped to approximately 40% from over 60% just one week earlier, prompting investors to shift capital away from high-risk assets. This dramatic reversal in expectations sent ripples through cryptocurrency markets and traditional financial instruments alike. At press time, Bitcoin was trading near $95,081, representing a 0.85% decline over the last 24 hours. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell to $3.31 trillion, down 0.9% from previous levels. Ethereum declined by 0.7% to $3,183, while XRP showed relative strength with a 0.3% gain to $2.24. Global Markets Echo Risk-Off Sentiment Traditional markets set a bearish tone heading into the week. Wall Street futures weakened following Friday's substantial losses, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 1.65%, the S&P 500 fall 1.66%, and the Nasdaq Composite decline 2.29%. Technology stocks bore the brunt of selling pressure as investors reassessed valuations built on artificial intelligence optimism. European markets opened defensively. Germany's DAX fell 1.39%, while the FTSE 100 slipped 1.05%. France's CAC 40 eased 0.11%, and the Euro Stoxx 50 lost 0.83%. Asian markets followed with mixed but predominantly negative openings. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1.77%, Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 1.35%, and New Zealand's benchmark declined 1.58%. Shanghai edged down a modest 0.16%. The coordinated weakness across global markets reflected growing concerns about the trajectories of monetary policy. Traders shifted toward cash positions as expectations of a rate cut evaporated. The shift marked a significant change from recent months when easier policy hopes had supported risk assets. Federal Reserve Policy Uncertainty Weighs Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent statement that a December rate cut is ”not a foregone conclusion, far from it” has resonated with market participants. Several Federal Open Market Committee members expressed caution about additional easing given persistent inflation concerns and limited economic data due to government disruptions. Boston Fed President Susan Collins indicated hesitancy toward further rate cuts without evidence of notable labor market deterioration, particularly given limited inflation information. The uncertainty has created headwinds for speculative assets like cryptocurrencies that benefit from looser monetary conditions. Bitcoin had previously rallied on expectations of accommodative policy. The reversal in rate expectations forced traders to unwind positions rapidly.
