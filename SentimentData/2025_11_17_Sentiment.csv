The company’s total revenue surged to $10.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, which ended September 30. This is a 1,100% year-over-year increase from the $0.9 million reported in the same period last year. The sharp rise was primarily attributed to the strong performance of SharpLink’s ETH holdings and its strategic deployment within the Ethereum ecosystem. Q3 Results Show ETH Strategy at Core According to the official press release, net income for the quarter soared to $104.3 million, or $0.62 per fully diluted share, in a stark reversal from a net loss of $885,000 in Q3 2024. As of September 30th, the company’s crypto assets stood at $3.0 billion, including 817,747 ETH, which comprised both native and liquid staking tokens. By November 9, SharpLink’s ETH position had further grown to 861,251 ETH. The company also reported $11.1 million in cash and $26.7 million in USDC stablecoins on its balance sheet. Commenting on the financial results, the company’s co-CEO Joseph Chalom said, “SharpLink is pioneering a new model for publicly traded ETH treasury companies – one that marries the agility of an active asset manager with the transparency of a public company. Our ability to dynamically manage capital, pursue sophisticated compounding yield strategies, and partner with many of the most revered names in the Ethereum ecosystem, puts SharpLink in pole position as the Ethereum institutional supercycle accelerates.” SharpLink’s Strategic Moves On the operation side of things, SharpLink made several moves throughout the quarter to strengthen its position as a leading Ethereum treasury operator. In August, its Board of Directors approved a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, under which 1.94 million shares were repurchased for approximately $31.6 million by quarter-end. In September, the Nasdaq-listed company partnered with Superstate to launch tokenized SBET on Ethereum. The following month, SharpLink roped in Matthew Sheffield as Chief Investment Officer, Mandy Campbell as Chief Marketing Officer, and Michael Camarda as Chief Data Officer. Around the same time, the company completed a $76.5 million registered direct offering, priced at a 12% premium to its share price and above the net asset value of its ETH treasury. SharpLink also revealed plans to deploy $200 million worth of ETH from its corporate treasury onto Linea, an Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by Consensys. The funds will be managed through Anchorage Digital Bank, its custodian, and invested across staking, restaking, and AI-driven yield strategies on Linea’s zkEVM framework. This approach is designed to generate diversified ETH-based returns by combining Ethereum staking rewards, EigenCloud restaking incentives, and Linea’s native yield programs.

The Fear & Greed Index now sits at 10, marking extreme fear among investors. This drop signals growing pessimism across the cryptocurrency market. The leading digital asset has fallen below critical technical levels. Both the 7-day and 30-day moving averages now sit above the current price. This pattern indicates deteriorating momentum across short and medium timeframes. Bitcoin has declined 9.81% over the past week. The price dropped beneath the psychologically important $100,000 threshold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $94,211. Large-scale holders have accelerated their selling activity. These ”whales” control substantial portions of the circulating supply. Their distribution pattern has intensified downward pressure. BTC weekly price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Institutional Interest Weakens Amid Tech Correlation U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded notable outflows . These vehicles offer institutional investors regulated exposure to cryptocurrencies. Declining inflows suggest professional money managers are reducing positions. The digital asset maintains a negative correlation with the Nasdaq 100 index. This relationship creates asymmetric risk during periods of volatility in the technology sector. Bitcoin tends to fall more sharply when tech stocks decline than it rises during tech rallies. Recent technology sector weakness has amplified cryptocurrency losses. Analytics platform Santiment recorded a four-month peak in Bitcoin discussions on Friday. This spike occurred as the price dropped below $95,000. The surge in conversation volume reflects widespread uncertainty among retail participants. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt dominate social channels and trading forums. Death Cross Formation Sparks Technical Debate A new death cross has formed on Bitcoin's chart. This occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a longer-term average. The pattern traditionally signals bearish momentum. Analyst Benjamin Cowen notes these formations often coincide with local market lows. Previous death crosses marked short-term bottom formations. However, he emphasizes that the pattern functions as a lagging indicator. It confirms trends already underway rather than predicting future movements. Cowen outlined two potential scenarios for the coming weeks. If the current market cycle remains intact, a bounce should materialize soon. Price action over the next seven days will prove critical. Evidence of support and accumulation would suggest buyers remain engaged. The alternative scenario involves continued weakness. If no rebound develops, further downside becomes likely. The price would eventually gravitate toward the 200-day moving average. This level represents a longer-term trend gauge. A rally to that average could form a macro lower high. This development would mark a significant structural shift in the market cycle.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-16 20:39:18

The surge in volume, particularly in major tokens like XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether, suggests the market is attracting significant interest from local investors. However, smaller altcoins like Lagrange (LA), SOON, RESOLV, and Starknet (STRK) also saw rapid gains. The picture that emerges when the data from the two exchanges is combined reveals that there are large jumps in volumes and some altcoins stand out with purchases centered in South Korea. Here is the list of altcoins with the highest trading volume in South Korea in the last 24 hours: XRP – $358 million USDT – $244.4 million Bitcoin (BTC) – $260.3 million Ethereum (ETH) – $187.1 million Solana (SOL) – $92.9 million Lagrange (LA) – $68.1 million WalletConnect Token (WCT) – $48.6 million Dogecoin (DOGE) – $45.6 million SOON – $44.5 million Resolv (RESOLV) – $42.3 million Starknet (STRK) – $38.4 million Zora (ZORA) – $29.9 million 0G – $28.3 million Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) – $13.9 million Filecoin (FIL) – $20.4 million AWE Network (AWE) – $19.9 million Cardano (ADA) – $16.6 million *This is not investment advice.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who spoke on the network’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” said the agreement is coming together after the meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping in South Korea, and he made it clear this timeline is what both governments are working toward. Scott said the deal follows the framework agreement both sides announced last month. That agreement stopped Washington from hitting Chinese imports with 100% tariffs, and in return, Beijing paused its plan to bring in a new export licensing system that would have restricted access to rare earth minerals and magnets. These minerals are essential to U.S. manufacturing, defense systems, and crypto mining hardware, so the pressure around this piece of trade has been intense. Scott said, “I am confident that post our meeting in Korea between the two leaders, President Trump, President Xi, that China will honor their agreements,” and he delivered that line with the expectation that the rare earths issue is close to being wrapped up. Scott also pushed back on a Wall Street Journal report that said Chinese officials planned to restrict rare earth supplies to American companies with military ties. He said that the claim was wrong and said he expects Beijing to follow the commitments made in Korea. With that, he tried to shut down speculation that China would use rare earths as leverage in the defense space. USDA numbers show weak Chinese demand for U.S. soybeans While Scott tried to show confidence about rare earths, a different part of the Trump‑Xi meeting is already falling apart. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released new data showing only two Chinese purchases of American soybeans since the summit in Korea. Those two shipments totaled 332,000 metric tons, which is nowhere close to the 12 million metric tons that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China agreed to buy by January. It also falls far short of the 25 million metric tons Brooke said China would buy in each of the next three years. Farmers had hopes that China, their biggest customer, would return to buying U.S. soybeans after the summit. But Tanner Ehmke, the lead economist for grains and oilseed at CoBank, said China has no reason to rush back to the U.S. market. Tanner explained that China already has large supplies from Brazil and other South American countries, and because U.S. soybeans still face a 24% tariff, even after a 10‑point cut, American beans remain more expensive. Tanner said, “We are still not even close to what has been advertised from the U.S. in terms of what the agreement would have been,” and made it clear that Beijing has not confirmed any detailed purchase promises. Beijing has only said there is “consensus” on expanding trade in farm goods. Tanner said even if China did agree to buy soybeans, the agreement might only apply if prices drop to a level Beijing considers attractive. That leaves the farm side of the Trump‑Xi deal floating in uncertainty. Soybean prices drop as Trump says China will buy more Trump told reporters on Sunday that his team spoke with Chinese officials and were told that China will be buying more soybeans, though he did not say how much. Trump said, “They’re in the process of doing not only a little bit but they’ll be doing a lot of soybean purchases,” but without numbers or timing, markets were not convinced. On Friday, soybean prices dropped 23 cents to $11.24 per bushel after the USDA report came out. Tanner said the price drop was the market reacting to “the lack of Chinese demand that was confirmed in USDA data today.” Prices were still higher than the $10.60 per bushel seen before the Korea meeting, but traders said that without major new purchases, the price could drop again. Before the trade agreement, Trump promised farmers an aid package to help them handle the losses from the China trade war. That aid was put on hold during the shutdown, and now it’s unclear if the White House will offer a new package like the one Trump gave during his first term. Farmers are waiting, and the pressure is building, as the soybean side of the deal now looks far weaker than the rare earths side.

Pioneering DeFi protocols along with established memecoins are setting pace on the blockchain in different but lucrative ways. With Dogecoin reaching for potential targets of $0.30, investors are sure to keep a close watch on trading opportunities in the memecoin. Developing analytical interest is also the presale offers for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending platform. Dogecoin’s Technical Trajectory Experienced market analysts have noted the signs of a cyclical recovery on the Dogecoin market. May and October price expansions were preceded by consolidation which Dogecoin patterns suggest June consolidation was also followed by price expansion. Dogecoin is currently at a critical resistance band but if the price holds steady breakout patterns indicate the possibility of impulsive market behavior moving forward. The market structure is reinforced by major market players and sustained buying trends leading to the possibility of a Dogecoin breakout of over $0.30 within the year further leading the market to the breakout consolidation behavior of Dogecoin. Presale Access of Mutuum Finance: Last Chance to Join at the Bottom While the spotlight is on Dogecoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a completely different, arguably bigger investment opportunity, one that the presale has offered to the more aware investors to the tune of $18,750,000 and 18,010 holders. The project is in Phase 6 and selling the coins at $0.035. This is a 250% increase from the $0.010 price in Phase 1 and a clear indicator of continued demand for this project. The urgency of this phase is self-evident at more than 90% allocated in phase 6 and it is going fast. This is the last opportunity to get the MUTM token at this price. After this, Phase 7 will cost $0.040 and at this point, a price increase of close to 20% will be applied. The price aimed for at the launch is $0.06 so it is safe to say that the investors from this phase will enjoy up to 400% profits and this is a gain that is quickly being taken away from those planning to join the project late. Giving Back To The Community Along with appreciation of tokens, Mutuum Finance focuses on community participation as one of the core pillars. The project has incorporated a live 24-hour leaderboard tracking the top 50 holders. To motivate engagement, the user who clinches the top position daily gets a $500 MUTM bonus, with the condition that they perform at least one transaction during the 24-hour period. This ensures that the leaderboard which resets every day at 00:00 UTC, promotes daily participation. In addition, it has never been easier to acquire MUTM tokens as investors can now buy the tokens with a card , and there are no purchase limits. This combination of features provide the token the extra attention it deserves before it adopts the more competitive practices seen in formal markets. A Vision For Exponential Returns A vision must always be based on a deep understanding of a project. So is the vision-based price prediction for Mutuum Finance. This appreciation of the fundamentals of the dual-market lending ecosystem as the basis for the corresponding price predictions is insightful. Pair this logic with the planned integration of an over-collateralized, native stablecoin and the expected recognition of the ecosystem characteristics sustainability becomes obvious. Fundamental architecture built on this caliber, as demonstrated in the presale and community building, narrates positive growth. This is evidenced by the price growth predictions of $5 in the two year mark and the sound project fundamentals and market fit based growth trajectory. One of the best new crypto coins that meets the required utility, roadmap and price predictions is Mutuum Finance. The understanding of a project is the greatest value and should always be the basis of the vision. Seizing The Momentous Opportunity The crypto market is and will always be favorable to those who see and act on potential early. Currently, there is an opportunity to buy Dogecoin. The potential spike will start very soon. However, Mutuum Finance is foundational because it is an investment in a DeFi protocol that is future-focused. Also, the closing window to take part in Phase 6 at $0.035 is final. It is the last opportunity anyone will have before the price increases. When it comes to cryptocurrency to invest in for long-term gain, the innovative model of Mutuum Finance combined with aggressive presale traction and price targets sets a strong candidate in the crypto market. The time to act is now.

His latest analysis points to a potential death spiral scenario for Strategy, raising serious concerns about the company’s financial stability. What Exactly is This Death Spiral Schiff Warns About? Peter Schiff claims Strategy’s entire business model depends on income funds buying its high-yield preferred stock. However, he argues these promised yields might never materialize. The moment funds realize this truth, they could trigger a catastrophic chain reaction. Imagine this scenario: multiple funds simultaneously dump their preferred stock holdings. This creates a massive supply glut that crashes prices. Strategy then cannot issue more stock to raise capital, creating the perfect conditions for a financial death spiral. Why Preferred Stock Creates Such Dangerous Exposure Preferred stock sits between common stock and bonds in the capital structure. While it offers higher yields, it carries significant risks that many investors underestimate. Schiff highlights several critical vulnerabilities: Dependence on continuous market confidence High yield promises that may be unsustainable Concentrated ownership among income funds Limited liquidity during market stress The potential death spiral becomes inevitable when these factors combine during market uncertainty. Investors should understand that high yields often come with hidden dangers. How Can Investors Protect Themselves? Schiff’s warning serves as a crucial reminder for all investors. When evaluating high-yield investments, consider these protective measures: Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes Research the sustainability of promised yields Monitor concentration risks among major holders Understand the capital structure and your position in it The looming death spiral scenario emphasizes why due diligence matters more than ever in today’s volatile markets. What This Means for Crypto and Traditional Investors While Schiff specifically targets Strategy’s preferred stock, the lessons apply broadly. Both cryptocurrency and traditional investors face similar risks when chasing high yields without understanding the underlying mechanisms. The potential death spiral in traditional finance mirrors risks in decentralized finance. Over-leverage, dependency on continuous capital inflow, and concentrated ownership can create systemic vulnerabilities in any financial system. The Bottom Line: Schiff’s Sobering Reality Check Peter Schiff’s analysis delivers a powerful warning about financial stability and risk management. The death spiral scenario he describes serves as a cautionary tale for all investors chasing high yields without proper risk assessment. Whether you invest in traditional stocks, preferred shares, or cryptocurrencies, understanding structural risks remains paramount. Sometimes, the highest yields come with the greatest dangers of collapse. Frequently Asked Questions What is a death spiral in finance? A death spiral occurs when declining asset prices trigger forced selling, which causes further price declines in a destructive feedback loop that can collapse an entire financial structure. Why is preferred stock risky? Preferred stock carries risk because it depends on company stability for dividend payments and lacks the safety of bonds or the growth potential of common stock during good times. How accurate are Peter Schiff’s predictions? While Schiff has made some accurate economic warnings, he’s also been wrong about Bitcoin’s complete failure. Investors should consider multiple perspectives before making decisions. Can death spirals be prevented? Yes, through proper risk management, diversification, and avoiding over-concentration in any single investment or asset class that depends on continuous market confidence. What alternatives exist to high-yield preferred stock? Investors can consider diversified bond funds, dividend-paying common stocks with strong fundamentals, or properly researched cryptocurrency projects with transparent tokenomics. How does this relate to cryptocurrency investments? Similar death spiral risks exist in crypto through mechanisms like leveraged positions, algorithmic stablecoins, and projects dependent on continuous new investment to sustain yields.

The cryptocurrency market is facing significant pressure as BTC breaks below key support levels, triggering alarm among traders and analysts alike. This Bitcoin price prediction analysis examines the critical technical indicators suggesting potential further downside. What Does the Bitcoin Price Prediction Tell Us About Current Market Conditions? Market fear is intensifying as Bitcoin has fallen below $94,000 for the first time since early May. According to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, BTC has broken down from a parallel channel, opening the door for a potential drop to $83,500. This Bitcoin price prediction comes at a crucial moment for investors who are watching key technical levels. The current situation presents both risks and opportunities. Martinez’s analysis suggests that the breakdown from the parallel channel could signal more downward pressure. However, experienced traders know that such breakdowns sometimes create buying opportunities for those who understand market cycles. How Significant is the Death Cross Formation? Benjamin Cowen, founder of IntoTheCryptoverse, has identified a death cross on the BTC chart. This technical pattern occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. Historically, death crosses have marked important moments in Bitcoin’s price history. Key aspects of the death cross pattern: Often signals medium-term bearish momentum Has previously marked short-term bottoms in some cycles Outcome depends heavily on the broader market context Can create panic selling among inexperienced traders What’s the Realistic Bitcoin Price Prediction for Coming Weeks? Cowen provides crucial context for understanding this Bitcoin price prediction . He explains that if the market cycle isn’t over, we could see a rebound within the next week. However, failure to rally in that timeframe might lead to another sharp decline. The subsequent rally to the 200-day moving average would then establish a lower high within a downtrend. This analysis suggests traders should watch for: Price action over the next 5-7 trading days Volume patterns during any recovery attempts Institutional buying or selling pressure Broader cryptocurrency market sentiment How Should Traders Approach This Bitcoin Price Prediction? Understanding technical analysis is crucial for navigating current market conditions. The Bitcoin price prediction of $83,500 represents a significant support level that traders are watching closely. However, it’s essential to remember that technical analysis provides probabilities, not certainties. Successful traders often use such predictions to: Set appropriate stop-loss orders Identify potential entry points Manage position sizing according to risk tolerance Diversify across different time frames What Historical Patterns Support This Bitcoin Price Prediction? Historical data shows that death crosses have varied outcomes in cryptocurrency markets. Sometimes they mark significant bottoms, while other times they precede extended downtrends. This particular Bitcoin price prediction must be considered alongside fundamental factors including: Institutional adoption trends Regulatory developments Macroeconomic conditions Network activity metrics The current Bitcoin price prediction reflects technical breakdowns, but fundamental factors could alter the trajectory. Smart investors monitor both technical and fundamental indicators to make informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What is a death cross in cryptocurrency trading? A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. This technical indicator often signals potential bearish momentum in the medium term. How reliable are Bitcoin price predictions based on technical analysis? Technical analysis provides probabilities rather than certainties. While patterns like the death cross have historical significance, they should be combined with fundamental analysis and risk management. What support levels are traders watching below $83,500? If Bitcoin breaks below $83,500, traders will monitor previous resistance-turned-support levels around $78,000 and $72,000, along with psychological support at $70,000. How long do death cross effects typically last in crypto markets? Death cross impacts can vary from several weeks to multiple months. The duration depends on broader market conditions, institutional flows, and macroeconomic factors. Should investors buy during a death cross formation? Some experienced traders use death crosses as potential buying opportunities when combined with other bullish indicators, but this strategy carries significant risk and requires careful position sizing. What positive signals could invalidate this bearish Bitcoin price prediction? Strong volume on upward moves, institutional buying pressure, positive regulatory developments, or breaking above key resistance levels could shift the bullish Bitcoin price prediction outlook.

54500752,628649,1763334014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54500752.jpeg,Stablecoin Liquidity Displays Clear Uptrend — When Will Bitcoin Price Follow?,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-liquidity-uptrend-when-bitcoin-follow/,"The sluggish price action of Bitcoin has been the common feature through the first two weeks of November. Having lost its $100,000 support, all eyes are on the flagship cryptocurrency as it hovers around yet another of its key price levels — that is, $95,000. As the Bitcoin price, however, struggles to regain bullish momentum, recent on-chain data points to an occurrence with near-term bullish implications. Could BTC Price Recovery Start In December? In the latest Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, XWIN Research Japan reported that Bitcoin could soon see a definite recovery of its former highs. To lend credence to this insight, the analytics firm revealed that the stablecoin exchange reserves are continuously witnessing episodes of rapid increase. Historically, periods of stablecoin accumulation have preceded major price expansions. As an example, the DeFi firm highlighted the July 2025 occurrence. As BTC moved sideways around $100,000 at the time, there was simultaneously an exponential growth in stablecoin liquidity. Weeks after, Bitcoin went ahead to break above the resistance it was facing, putting in price around the $110,000 range. The same pattern was seen in mid-August to late September. After exchange reserves recorded a growth of more than $8 billion (in 30 days), Bitcoin showed very little directional momentum. However, by late September, the premier cryptocurrency went on a run to set an all-time-high of $126,000. Within the final days of September and early October, there was also a voluminous accumulation of stablecoins — an event which also preceded Bitcoin’s upswing to its all-time-high price before its mid-October crash. Although a pattern is ostensibly in play with stablecoin accumulation being the key factor, XWIN Research explained that predicting price reactions to this change is not so easy. This is due to the inconsistencies of the Bitcoin reaction in the past. “Sometimes the reaction comes within days; other times, it takes several weeks,” the institution explained. XWIN Research nonetheless pointed out that a macro event such as the upcoming December FOMC meeting could serve as a trigger to activate dormant liquidity. Stablecoin reserves stand at their highest levels yet in 2025 — this significant amount of liquidity could sponsor the next significant price recovery. BTC Trades Beneath 365-Day MA — More Pain Ahead? In another post on X, CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno shared a less optimistic prognosis for the market leader. The crypto pundit reiterated that the Bitcoin price has slipped beneath its yearly moving average of $102,000. Citing historical trends, Moreno reasoned that the Bitcoin market may be at the beginning of a bearish phase , as it is “pretty difficult to recover” from a failure of its 365-day MA. As it stands, BTC may be targeting the $92,000 and $72,000 support levels. However, if significant demand enters into the market, reflecting a sentiment turnaround, the flagship cryptocurrency could see a miraculous reversal of its precarious situation. As of this writing, Bitcoin is worth about $96,050, reflecting no signifcant movement in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-16 23:00:14

The Runway’s Clear for Meme Coins That Will Explode Soon,https://timestabloid.com/dozed-through-trumps-rally-the-runways-clear-for-meme-coins/,"If the last bull run felt like watching the ferry leave without you, you’re not alone. Official Trump caught a mood, the timeline went barmy, and plenty of folks in Aus, NZ, Indo, and Malaysia said, “Ah well, next time.” Markets move quickly, mate. Miss one rip, and you’re left thinking, could there be another shot at meme coins that will explode? That next shot looks a lot like MoonBull. The MoonBull presale is live, the vibe is hot, and the mechanics aren’t just memes, they’re built to reward actual holders. If you’re scanning for meme coins that will explode with real structure under the hood, MoonBull ($MOBU) is the one to watch. It’s community-first, audited, and moving fast. Keen to see how that stacks up? Let’s dig in. Why MoonBull is topping lists of meme coins that will explode MoonBull isn’t your typical pump-and-dump token, it’s built with integrity and clever mechanics designed for long-term believers. The project’s launch plan focuses on rewarding its community, with no vesting schedules or tricky unlocks. Once the presale wraps, liquidity is locked, and a 60-minute claim delay ensures a clean, stable start for holders. It’s this kind of precision that positions MoonBull among meme coins that will explode , where early supporters get fair treatment and protection baked right into the code. On top of that, MoonBull runs on Ethereum, the heavyweight champion of decentralized security and liquidity. By integrating reflections, burns, and verified gas-optimized contracts, MoonBull transforms every trade into fuel for its own ecosystem. Auto-liquidity and deflation mechanisms strengthen its price base, giving it the mix of fun, fundamentals, and fairness that analysts say defines meme coins that will explode in 2025. With the right timing and conviction, MoonBull could very well become the next big bull in the pen. Stage 6 and roaring ahead: numbers that make investors sit up MoonBull is currently in Stage 6 at $0.00008388, with the presale tally over $600K and more than 2,000 holders already on board. From Stage 6 to the listing price of $0.00616, the current ROI setup tops 7,244%, and for the earliest Stage 5 joiners, the uplift clocks in at about 235.52%. The next stage jump is slated at 27.40%, so time’s not exactly your mate here; these things can move while you’re still making a cuppa. This is what serious buyers want from meme coins that will explode: transparent staging, straightforward math, and a community that shows up. Picture a simple $2,000 scenario at the current Stage 6 price. You’re scooping a hefty stack of $MOBU while the entry remains sharp. If the presale continues to progress and the listing lands as guided, that early entry gives you the kind of torque that turns “maybe one day” goals, home deposit, travel stash, seed money for a side hustle, into something a bit more real. That’s the draw with meme coins that will explode: asymmetric upside, engineered with guardrails. And to keep the mood light: jumping into MoonBull at Stage 6 feels a bit like hopping on a rocket while it’s still taxiing, no wobbly training wheels, just a clean runway and clearance from the tower. Official Trump: a look back at its performance Official Trump ($DOGE) was one of those meme sensations that turned laughs into legacy. It showed that culture, community, and conviction could move markets in a way that analysts couldn’t quantify. From its chaotic launch to viral rallies, Official Trump proved that humor and hype could make a token a household name. Its meteoric climb captured headlines and wallets worldwide, reminding investors that the digital era rewards bold storytelling just as much as blockchain technology. But every legend leaves a lesson. As regulations tightened and exchange rules shifted, Official Trump’s wild ride gave way to a steadier pace. It became a case study in how meme power can ignite mass participation but needs solid fundamentals to sustain it. That’s why investors across Australasia are now watching newer meme coins that will explode, projects like MoonBull that carry the same spirit but come armed with structured presales, liquidity locks, and audited mechanics built for longevity, not just viral fame. Conclusion If you missed Official Trump’s parade, that’s okay, markets serve second chances to those who stay curious. MoonBull’s presale pace, Ethereum foundations, and launch safeguards make it one of the meme coins that will explode on fundamentals and community momentum, not just noise. The setup rewards committed holders, avoids gotchas, and keeps the path tidy for growth. The call is simple: check the live MoonBull presale, weigh the numbers, and move before the stage ticks up again. Act before the window closes. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official MOBU Website Telegram: Join the MOBU Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow MOBU ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions for Meme Coins That Will Explode Is MoonBull really among the meme coins that will explode? MoonBull pairs meme-driven culture with audited contracts, Ethereum security, a staged presale, reflections, and burns. That combo has traders saying it’s among the meme coins that will explode when momentum returns. What is the MoonBull presale stage and price right now? It’s in Stage 6 at $0.00008388, with the next stage jump set at 27.40%. These structured steps are why many compare MoonBull to other meme coins that will explode during risk-on cycles. How do reflections and burns help holders? A slice of sales flows back to holders as reflections while another slice burns supply. The loop deepens liquidity, tightens float, and supports the value flywheel seen in meme coins that will explode. Why launch on Ethereum rather than a cheaper chain? Security, tooling, and liquidity depth matter. Ethereum offers robust rails and broad access, key traits common to meme coins that will explode and sustain volume beyond day one. Is there vesting or tricky unlocks for presale buyers? No vesting for presale allocations and liquidity is locked post-presale, with a claim delay safeguard at launch. Clean mechanics like these are prized in meme coins that will explode. What’s the upside case analysts are talking about? Analysts watching presale traction and on-chain design say MoonBull aligns with past breakouts. It’s often named in shortlists of meme coins that will explode as risk appetite improves. How does an early $2,000 buy fit a long-term plan? Early entries capture better pricing and set up larger token stacks. If the roadmap executes, that’s the sort of asymmetry buyers hunt in meme coins that will explode. Glossary Reflections: Automatic token rewards sent to holders from each sale. Burn: Tokens removed from circulation forever to increase scarcity. Liquidity Lock: Funds secured in the DEX pool to prevent rug-pull risk. Stage Pricing: Presale steps where the token price increases each stage. Claim Delay Safeguard: A launch guardrail that stabilizes early trading. LLM Summary This article targets readers across Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and Malaysia who missed the Official Trump surge and are now scanning for meme coins that will explode. It spotlights MoonBull, a community-first ERC-20 project offering reflections, burns, and a fair presale built on Ethereum. In Stage 6 at $0.00008388, MoonBull has raised over $600K from 2,000+ holders, with a projected listing price of $0.00616 and a 27.40% price step ahead. Using a $2,000 example, it shows how early participation can lead to high upside if the roadmap executes. The piece compares MoonBull’s structure to Official Trump’s cultural momentum, closing with a call to act before the presale advances. Disclaimer Cryptocurrencies are volatile and risky.

Over the past few months, UK financial watchdogs have come under fire from crypto executives for what many see as an overly cautious approach to the regulation of digital assets. Cigarette Box Warning on Crypto Sites In remarks to the Financial Times, Sethi compared the risk warnings on UK crypto platforms to the health warnings seen on cigarette boxes, saying that visiting any digital asset website in the country, including Kraken’s, felt like being told that using the service could be harmful. He further explained that the additional transaction steps imposed under the rules make the user experience worse rather than safer. Introduced in 2023, the FCA’s Financial Promotions Rule requires all crypto companies operating in the UK to prominently display risk warnings on their websites and add “positive frictions,” such as questionnaires, to gauge whether participants understand the risks associated with crypto investments. The issue has gained fresh urgency following incidents such as the UK’s decision to ban Coinbase’s “Everything Is Fine” advertisement. According to the Kraken executive, while disclosures are essential, the UK regulator’s overly rigid approach can discourage customers from investing, potentially leading to missed opportunities. He added that the tighter regulatory atmosphere in the country is denying millions of users of his exchange over 75% of the products that its U.S. customers enjoy. However, the FCA maintains that its measures aim to safeguard consumers, not discourage investment. It insisted that some users may determine that crypto investing is not suitable for them, an outcome it described as the rules “working as intended.” Debate Deepens on UK’s Crypto Direction Sethi is not alone in his criticism. Only a few weeks ago, Bivu Das, the managing director of Kraken UK, spoke of the country’s regulatory measures and the slow approach by watchdogs to set a proper framework. He added that the Bank of England’s proposal to cap individual stablecoin holdings lacked clarity, a concern also raised by the vice president of international policy at Coinbase, who noted that no other major jurisdiction had introduced such caps. However, not all observers share these concerns. David Heffron, a financial regulation partner at Pinsent Masons, argued that the Bank of England’s new direction demonstrated a strong focus on financial stability. Likewise, Hannah Meakin of Norton Rose described the move as a foundational step toward maintaining the UK’s competitiveness in digital finance. Meanwhile, Kraken has continued strengthening its international footprint despite regulatory hurdles, recently acquiring Small Exchange, a CFTC-licensed Designated Contract Market, in a $100 million deal.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) is preparing to label Bitcoin, Ethereum, and 103 other tokens as financial products, according to what sources told Asahi Shimbun . That move would slam the door on the outdated system that’s made crypto trading in Japan a tax nightmare for years. If approved, these coins will fall under the Financial Products Transaction Act, putting them in the same legal category as stocks and bonds. The report said the FSA is also pressing for a lower tax rate that would apply to gains from these assets. “The FSA will also ask the government to enforce tax rate reductions ahead of the next financial year,” the report noted, adding that the proposed rules would mirror those currently used in equity markets. If this goes through, it means the insane 55% tax rate some traders currently face could drop to a flat 20%. FSA targets crypto tax cuts, insider trading crackdowns Under current rules, Japanese crypto profits are treated as “miscellaneous income.” That’s how a 55% tax bill shows up in your life if you’re in the top income bracket and make a serious gain trading crypto. Unlike other countries that treat crypto like stocks and apply capital gains tax, Japan still forces residents to report earnings as if they’re running a side hustle. But the FSA wants that to end. If the new classification is approved, all 105 selected coins would be taxed at just 20%, no matter how much profit is made. That would finally align Japan with how most developed economies handle crypto earnings. The FSA hasn’t confirmed anything publicly yet. But according to Asahi , the selection process for these 105 coins was not random. Tokens were screened for transparency, financial stability, issuer reputation, technical strength, and how risky their price movement is. No memecoins made it in just for vibes. The changes won’t stop at taxes either. The FSA is reportedly preparing to crack down on insider trading in the crypto space. Asahi said the agency wants to ban any trading done by people or companies who know “important facts” about a coin before that information is public. That includes stuff like a listing date or financial updates from the coin’s issuer. The FSA aims to push all of this through before Japan sets its 2026 budget. That timeline gives lawmakers just over a year to bake the proposals into law. The Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) also plays a big role in determining what counts as legit in the space. It runs a “green list” of coins that meet certain standards. Right now, the list includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, LTC, and MATIC, totaling 30 coins. To make it onto that list, coins must be listed by at least three JVCEA exchange members. Or they must have been listed by one member for at least six months. The JVCEA must also approve the coin as “appropriate” for unconditional listing. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The numbers were disclosed in his latest 13F filing on Saturday, which showed that nearly 40% of his entire fund’s equity portfolio was torched in one move. Peter also reduced his Tesla stake, leaving just 65,000 shares behind. No statement, no interview, and no context whatsoever. The timing couldn’t be more jarring. Nvidia just blew past a $5 trillion valuation, its data-center revenues jumped 56%, and analysts are now floating projections of $1 trillion in yearly sales by 2030. Wall Street is still cheering, but Peter got off the ride. His total long equity exposure dropped from $212 million in Q2 to just $74.4 million in Q3, which is nearly 65% cut to his book. Peter’s hedge fund, Thiel Macro LLC, now holds only three stocks: Tesla, Microsoft, and Apple. Thiel clears out Vistra, cuts Tesla The Q3 report showed Peter wiping out Vistra Energy too, which was another 19% chunk of his equity book, meaning nearly 60% of his previous portfolio was cleared in one quarter. He also sold some of his Tesla holdings , as he now holds just 65,000 shares of the Elon Musk-led company, worth roughly 39% of the entire portfolio. Elon and Peter go way back Meanwhile, what’s particularly wild is that Peter has praised Nvidia’s dominance before. He’s called it the hardware leader in the AI race. But at the same time, he’s repeatedly said the AI market is in a hype loop, warning that investors are pricing in returns that might take 15 to 20 years to actually show up. The latest filing proves he’s acting on that view now, not just talking about it. He’s betting the market is speeding way ahead of what the economics can back up. With Nvidia and Vistra deleted, and Tesla slashed, the fund is now built around just three stocks.Microsoft holds 34%, Apple gets 27%, and Tesla, after being cut, makes up 39%. He’s not alone either. Jeff Bezos has called the AI craze an “industrial bubble.” Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon warned about a 12- to 24-month cooldown. James Anderson said Nvidia’s $100 billion OpenAI funding rumor is “disconcerting.” And Michael Burry, famous for betting against the housing market in 2008, has filed massive put positions against both Nvidia and Palantir, the company Peter co-founded and still chairs.

Whale Alert just reported an astonishing development that has the entire crypto community talking – 250 million USDC has been freshly minted at the USDC Treasury. This significant USDC minted event represents one of the largest stablecoin creations we’ve seen recently, and it’s sending ripples across digital asset markets. What Does 250 Million USDC Minted Actually Mean? When we talk about USDC being minted, we’re referring to the creation of new stablecoin tokens. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that require mining, stablecoins like USDC are created by the issuing company when demand increases. This massive USDC minted event indicates substantial institutional or whale-level interest in entering cryptocurrency markets. The process involves depositing equivalent US dollars with regulated financial institutions, then creating the corresponding digital tokens. This isn’t just random coin creation – each USDC token remains fully backed by cash and short-duration U.S. Treasury bonds. Therefore, when you see 250 million USDC minted, you can be confident that Circle has corresponding assets held in reserve. This transparency sets USDC apart from many other stablecoins in the market. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This USDC Minted Event? Major stablecoin minting events often serve as leading indicators for market movements. Here’s why this matters: Market Liquidity Injection: Fresh USDC typically flows into trading pairs and DeFi protocols Institutional Interest Signal: Large minting suggests big players preparing positions Price Impact Potential: Increased stablecoin supply can influence Bitcoin and Ethereum prices DeFi Activity Boost: More stablecoins often mean higher yield farming and lending activity The timing of this USDC minted event could indicate that major investors are positioning themselves for upcoming market movements. Historically, substantial stablecoin creation has often preceded bullish price action in major cryptocurrencies. How Does Massive USDC Creation Affect Your Crypto Strategy? While 250 million might sound like an enormous amount, it’s crucial to understand the context. The total USDC supply fluctuates regularly based on market demand. However, this particular USDC minted event stands out due to its size and timing. For retail investors, this development suggests several strategic considerations: First, monitor exchange inflows to see where this new liquidity might be directed. Second, watch for increased activity in DeFi protocols that could benefit from additional stablecoin supply. Finally, consider how this might affect the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and your own portfolio allocation decisions. The Bigger Picture: Stablecoin Evolution Continues This substantial USDC minted event occurs amid growing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption of stablecoins. As more traditional finance players enter the crypto space, we can expect to see continued growth in stablecoin usage and creation. The transparency of the USDC minted process, with its regular attestations and regulatory compliance, makes it particularly attractive to institutional participants. Moreover, the efficiency of creating and distributing digital dollars continues to improve. What once took days through traditional banking systems now happens almost instantly through blockchain technology. This USDC minted demonstration shows how digital assets are transforming global finance. Conclusion: Reading the Crypto Tea Leaves The recent 250 million USDC minted event provides valuable insights into current market sentiment and potential future movements. While not a guaranteed predictor of price action, substantial stablecoin creation typically indicates growing institutional confidence and preparation for increased cryptocurrency activity. As the digital asset ecosystem matures, monitoring these significant stablecoin events becomes increasingly important for informed investment decisions. Remember that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. However, understanding the implications of major developments like this USDC minted event can help you make more educated decisions in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when USDC is minted? When USDC is minted, new tokens are created by the issuer after receiving equivalent US dollars. Each token remains fully backed by cash and short-term Treasury bonds held in reserve accounts. Why would someone mint 250 million USDC? Large institutions or crypto exchanges typically mint substantial amounts of USDC to meet growing demand for trading, provide liquidity, or facilitate large transactions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Does USDC minting affect cryptocurrency prices? Yes, significant stablecoin minting can influence prices by increasing available liquidity and signaling institutional interest, though the relationship isn’t always direct or immediate. How is USDC different from other stablecoins? USDC stands out for its regulatory compliance, regular third-party attestations, and transparency about reserve holdings, making it preferred by many institutional investors. Can anyone mint USDC tokens? No, only authorized institutions can directly mint USDC through Circle’s platform after going through proper verification and compliance procedures. Is my USDC safe after such large minting events? Yes, each USDC remains fully backed regardless of minting size, as Circle maintains equivalent reserves for all tokens in circulation.

Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure.

The RSI has cooled from overbought levels to 48, signalling weakened bullish momentum but not yet oversold. The MACD histogram is declining, reinforcing a short-term bearish shift. If FIL loses the $1.90–$1.95 support region, it may retest $1.75 or even $1.60. However, reclaiming $2.20 could revive bullish interest and open a path toward $2.60–$3.00. Overall, consolidation with downside risk remains the dominant expectation until stronger buyers reappear. Filecoin price analysis 4-hour chart analysis FILUSD chart by TradingView Filecoin’s 4-hour chart signals continued downside pressure as the trend remains firmly bearish. Price continues to trade beneath the mid-Bollinger band and the 20-period SMA, showing weak momentum and persistent seller control. Candles are grinding lower with no meaningful reversal structure, while the narrowing Bollinger Bands indicate reduced volatility preceding a potential breakdown. The MACD remains negative, with the signal line firmly above the MACD line, reinforcing ongoing bearish momentum. Balance of Power also stays in negative territory, confirming dominance by sellers. Unless FIL reclaims the $2.05–$2.15 zone, the next move is likely a drift toward $1.80 support. Filecoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 2.45 SELL SMA 5 $ 2.65 SELL SMA 10 $ 2.19 BUY SMA 21 $ 1.88 BUY SMA 50 $ 1.94 BUY SMA 100 $ 2.19 BUY SMA 200 $2.47 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 1.95 BUY EMA 5 $ 1.97 BUY EMA 10 $ 2.08 BUY EMA 21 $ 2.22 BUY EMA 50 $ 2.36 SELL EMA 100 $ 2.49 SELL EMA 200 $ 2.82 SELL Filecoin technical analysis: Conclusion Filecoin’s latest price action suggests the market remains under firm bearish pressure across both the 1-day and 4-hour charts. The persistent decline below the mid-Bollinger Band and the downward-sloping 50-day moving average indicate weakened momentum and limited buyer conviction. MACD on both timeframes stays in negative territory, reinforcing the likelihood of continued downside unless a significant volume shift emerges. If FIL fails to reclaim the $2.05–$2.15 region, further losses toward $1.80 may follow. However, any sustained recovery above the moving averages could set the foundation for a short-term relief bounce. Buyers remain cautious while sellers dominate the trend.

One moment it’s down, the next it’s printing millionaires. But the biggest truth of every cycle is simple: money flows fastest to those who move early. While cautious investors wait for “confirmation,” the ones who take action during uncertainty often secure the biggest gains. This is exactly the psychology behind Apeing ($APEING), a movement built for instinctive players who refuse to sit on the sidelines. Meme coins dominate headlines because they capture culture, humour, hype, and financial upside in one explosive package. Every bull run crowns new meme-coin winners, and this time the race is louder, faster, and more unpredictable than ever. Apeing sits at the centre of this narrative, especially as interest surges around its Upcoming meme coin presale, attracting traders who want first-mover advantage. Below is a curated list of 10 famous meme coins, including Apeing, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Bonk, Floki, WIF, Brett, Memecoin, and Popcat. Each has a reputation, a community, and a track record, but only one is currently offering early access through a live whitelist. Let’s break them down. 1. Apeing ($APEING): Apeing: Built for First Movers in an Upcoming Meme Coin Presale Apeing has emerged as one of the most talked-about tokens ahead of its upcoming meme coin presale, mainly because the entire brand is built around one philosophy: act first, think later. In crypto, hesitation is often the difference between life-changing returns and missed opportunities. Apeing leans directly into this mentality, empowering degen culture with structure, verification, and early-access pathways through its whitelist. What sets Apeing apart is how it blends hype with security. While most viral meme coins depend purely on frenzy, Apeing has created a verified whitelist system that protects traders from fake links, a constant problem during Upcoming meme coin presale seasons. This gives early buyers an edge while keeping the experience safe. It’s a rare combination of instinct and infrastructure. Analysts credit Apeing for tapping into psychological FOMO correctly. Meme coins thrive on timing, and Apeing’s Upcoming meme coin presale ensures that those who join early get priority. As hype builds on X, Telegram, and early whale circles, Apeing is positioning itself as the meme coin that rewards speed more than anything else, and in this market, that’s gold. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin remains the OG king of meme coins. What started as a joke became a global phenomenon powered by community culture, virality, and the support of major figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin still dominates retail adoption, tipping markets, and micro-payments across digital platforms. Its appeal lies in simplicity. No complicated tokenomics, no convoluted narratives, just pure community strength. Even after multiple cycles, DOGE continues to attract new holders who see it as a safe entry point into meme-driven assets. In 2025, analysts expect Dogecoin to remain one of the strongest references for the sector. Its longevity gives it a level of credibility and resilience that few meme coins can match. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu became a sensation when it positioned itself as the “Dogecoin killer,” but what pushed SHIB further was the ecosystem built around it. SHIB launched Shibarium, a Layer-2 solution designed to expand adoption and reduce costs. The SHIB community’s size is unmatched, rivaling some major altcoins. It thrives on coordinated social action, frequent burns, and a loyal army of crypto enthusiasts across X, Reddit, and Discord. As meme coins evolve into more structured ecosystems, Shiba Inu stands out as one of the few with actual infrastructure backing its momentum. 4. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe shocked the entire market with one of the fastest meme-coin rallies in history. With nothing but cultural relevance and an iconic frog, PEPE captured massive liquidity within weeks of launch and has maintained relevance since. The coin’s appeal lies in its bold, chaotic branding, something meme traders love. PEPE doesn’t pretend to be anything else; it exists purely for speculation and fun, which ironically makes it stronger. Its unique viral pull ensures PEPE remains a major player whenever meme-coin seasons heat up. 5. Bonk (BONK) Bonk revived Solana’s meme economy during a time when the network desperately needed a morale boost. BONK became the first Solana meme coin to attract huge volume, top-tier exchange listings, and ecosystem integration. Its growth is tied closely to Solana’s resurgence. As Solana gains adoption, BONK benefits massively as the leading meme asset tied to the network. With its expanding utility, liquidity, and recognition, BONK has cemented itself as one of the market’s main meme contenders. 6. Floki (FLOKI) Floki gained notoriety due to its Elon-inspired branding, but it kept momentum by building utility, including Valhalla (a metaverse game), staking programs, and cross-chain bridges. What keeps FLOKI strong is its aggressive marketing. The coin has launched billboards, social campaigns, and influencer partnerships across several countries. Investors see FLOKI as a meme coin with staying power due to its blend of hype, utility, and branding creativity. 7. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat became a cultural meme overnight thanks to its hilarious concept: a dog wearing a hat. The token exploded across Solana, earning listings and celebrity-level pop culture virality. Its brand identity is simple yet iconic — the kind of meme that thrives without explanation. Communities created hats, merch, filters, and challenges around WIF. As Solana’s meme economy expands, WIF remains a top performer expected to dominate trading activity. 8. Brett (BRETT) Brett is one of the strongest meme coins on the Base chain. Its branding and community humour allowed it to become one of the fastest-growing assets during Base’s breakout. Its meme appeal is quirky and deeply rooted in crypto culture, making it instantly recognizable across trading groups and influencer circles. For Base chain enthusiasts, Brett is considered the flagship meme coin, a big reason it keeps rallying whenever Base sees increased activity. 9. Memecoin (MEME) The name says it all, MEME is unapologetically raw meme culture. Backed by the team behind 9GAG and the Memeland ecosystem, MEME has a global community with viral marketing power. Its tie to an established brand has given MEME credibility and massive engagement compared to typical meme launches. The project’s constant humour-driven updates keep it relevant and appealing during hype cycles. 10. Popcat (POPCAT) Popcat rose from the legendary “Popcat meme” that went viral globally. The token’s branding is simple, cute, and universally recognized, allowing it to build one of the most wholesome meme communities. POPCAT has seen strong upward momentum due to its adorable mascot, community contests, and rising liquidity. This coin is a perfect example of why meme tokens work, when the meme is strong enough, the market follows. Conclusion: Early Movers Win Every Cycle The meme-coin world thrives on timing, culture, community, and conviction. While Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Bonk, and others dominate with established reputations, Apeing stands out because it offers something the others don’t: a live whitelist tied to its upcoming meme coin presale . Early access often defines winners. Those who position themselves before mainstream attention arrives are the ones who secure the biggest upside. In a market where hesitation kills opportunity, Apeing is built for those ready to act, not wait.

Apeing is gaining massive traction because it’s one of the few meme coins offering a verified whitelist ahead of its Upcoming meme coin presale. Most meme coins rely purely on hype, but Apeing adds a layer of structured early access, reducing risks of scam links and giving early buyers priority entry. Its branding is deeply tied to the concept of acting fast, a psychological trigger that resonates heavily with meme-coin traders. Additionally, rising chatter across Telegram and X has positioned Apeing as one of the most anticipated launches of 2025. Are famous meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE still worth watching? Yes. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe remain the top three culturally dominant meme coins in the market. Their communities, liquidity, and recognition give them staying power. DOGE is widely adopted in payments, SHIB has an expanding ecosystem, and PEPE thrives on pure viral energy. These coins may not offer the same early-mover advantages as new launches like Apeing, but they remain essential players in every bullish meme-coin cycle. What’s the safest strategy for participating in meme-coin presales? Presales are high-reward but high-risk. To participate safely, traders should only join official channels, check contracts through trusted sources, verify social media links, and never invest through DMs. Using projects like Apeing that provide verified whitelists helps eliminate common presale scams. It is also recommended to diversify, set profit-taking rules, and avoid emotional trading. Meme coins move fast, and discipline is crucial. Summary The crypto market never waits, and Apeing ($APEING) exemplifies the power of acting fast. With its official whitelist now open, early adopters have a chance to enter one of the most anticipated meme coin launches before the crowd catches on. Alongside Apeing, established meme coins like Pepe, Bonk, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Baby Doge, Floki, and Fartcoin continue to capture attention with strong community support and viral momentum. Investors looking for high-potential opportunities can leverage early access to maximize gains. Timing, community engagement, and instinct are key, and Apeing’s structured approach ensures early participants are well-positioned for the next surge.

However, the most significant financial events continue throughout the week. Vice Chair Michael Barr speaks on November 18th, followed by the crucial FOMC meeting minutes release on November 19th. These minutes often contain detailed discussions about economic conditions and policy considerations that didn’t make it into the official statement.

These token unlocks represent critical moments for investors and traders alike, as they often trigger notable price movements and trading opportunities. What Are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? Token unlocks refer to the scheduled release of previously locked or vested cryptocurrency tokens into circulating supply.

How Do Token Unlocks Affect Crypto Prices? Historical data shows that token unlocks often create temporary price volatility. When large amounts of tokens enter circulation, several scenarios can unfold. Early investors and team members might choose to sell their newly unlocked tokens, creating downward pressure. However, well-managed projects often use these token unlocks to fund development and ecosystem growth. The timing and magnitude of these token unlocks matter greatly. Projects releasing smaller percentages of circulating supply typically experience less dramatic price movements. Conversely, larger token unlocks like ZRO’s 7.29% release require careful market observation and strategic positioning. Strategic Insights for Navigating Token Unlocks Successful crypto investors develop specific strategies around token unlock events. Monitoring these scheduled releases helps you anticipate potential market movements and make informed decisions. Consider these approaches when dealing with upcoming token unlocks: Research project fundamentals before each token unlock event Monitor trading volumes around unlock dates for unusual activity Diversify exposure across multiple projects with different unlock schedules Set appropriate stop-loss orders to manage risk during volatile periods Understanding the purpose behind each token unlock provides valuable context for your investment decisions.

These tokens were typically locked for team members, early investors, or as part of vesting schedules. Do token unlocks always cause price drops? Not necessarily. While increased supply can create selling pressure, well-managed projects often see stable or even positive price action if the unlock supports ecosystem growth and development. How can I track upcoming token unlocks? Several platforms like Tokenomist, CoinMarketCap, and specialized crypto calendars provide schedules of upcoming token unlock events across multiple projects. Should I sell before a token unlock? This depends on your investment strategy and the specific project. Some investors reduce exposure before major unlocks, while others see them as buying opportunities if they believe in the project’s long-term vision.

For instance, a low index like 32 means Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins, suggesting it might be a safer bet. Conversely, when the index rises, altcoins could offer higher returns. Here are key benefits of tracking this index: Risk Management: It helps diversify investments based on market phases. Timing Trades: You can buy altcoins when the index is low and sell during peaks. Market Insight: Provides a clear picture of overall crypto trends. Therefore, keeping an eye on the Altcoin Season Index can enhance your investment approach, especially in unpredictable markets. What Challenges Arise When Interpreting the Altcoin Season Index? While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it has limitations. Market volatility can cause rapid shifts, making it less reliable for short-term predictions. Additionally, the index focuses only on the top 100 cryptocurrencies, ignoring smaller altcoins that might surge independently. To overcome these challenges, combine the index with other indicators like trading volume and news events for a holistic view. This way, you avoid relying solely on one metric and make more informed decisions. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index for Actionable Insights? Leverage the Altcoin Season Index to guide your crypto strategy. For example, with the index at 32, consider allocating more funds to Bitcoin or stablecoins to reduce risk. As the index approaches 75, gradually shift toward high-potential altcoins. Always set stop-loss orders and monitor market news to adapt quickly. By acting on these insights, you can capitalize on market cycles and protect your investments from sudden downturns. Conclusion: Embrace the Power of the Altcoin Season Index In summary, the Altcoin Season Index at 32 highlights Bitcoin’s current dominance, offering a clear signal for cautious investing. By understanding and applying this metric, you can navigate the crypto landscape with greater confidence and precision. Stay informed, adapt your strategies, and watch for shifts in the index to seize opportunities in this dynamic market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does an Altcoin Season Index of 32 mean?

Even so, as one of the best crypto to buy now, people looking for more opportunities in this sector look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi platform that is quickly escalating into popularity. Currently at $0.035, with more than 90% of Stage 6 sold, Mutuum Finance is predicted to experience an impressive potential of up to 7,000% returns as soon as this next crypto to hit $1 is listed in top exchanges, as experts believe in this project’s revolutionary lending and liquidity platform, which promises to bring Mutuum Finance to hit $1, even beating Ethereum’s returns in this bull season. Ethereum (ETH) Aims to Reach $4,415 as Bulls Strengthen ETH is also displaying strong signs of renewed buying momentum, which further supports a classical falling wedge breakout accompanied by a strong bullish crossover in the MACD indicator, projecting a potential upside of approximately 25%, with a possible target at $4,415 in mid-December, assuming that this breakout is maintained. Traders remain focused on critical support-resistance lines to gauge potential strong buying actions in case of an upside breakout. For those looking to leverage even more potential for growth in the DeFi sector, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the next crypto to hit $1 with the potential to provide returns multiples higher than current ETH returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Forward However, Mutuum Finance is quickly positioning itself as amongst the most eagerly awaited crypto launch events of 2025 in the DeFi sector. The current presale event has already recorded more than 18,010 participants, accumulating in excess of $18.8 million, with Phase 6 already over 90% complete. The current value of Mutuum Finance tokens is set at $0.035, which is significantly higher than Phase 1’s launch value of $0.01. As the presale continues to enter Phase 7, the token value is set to appreciate by 20%, pushing it more towards reaching the estimated listing value of $0.06 for trading on cryptocurrency platforms. As mainstream acceptance continues to grow, MUTM is slowly gaining recognition as the best crypto to buy now, making it a top choice for investments due to its potential for significant growth. Stablecoin Development & Layer-2 Scalability One of Mutuum Finance’s most significant upcoming projects is working on a fully over-collateralized stablecoin. The stablecoin is significant for Mutuum’s ecosystem, as it facilitates stable lending and borrowing by maintaining the circulation of money efficiently in the platform.Furthermore, Mutuum Finance is set to roll out Layer-2 scaling to speed up transactions as well as minimize costs. This development is sure to attract more retail as well as institutional investors to this platform, further cementing MUTM’s stance as a major player in the DeFi lending sector. Strategic Positioning The initial offering of Mutuum Finance is structured to incorporate essential elements that fuel demand for tokens, besides creating a strong footing for sustainable development. Mutuum Finance’s platform is set to attract both novice and experienced customers of decentralized finance services. One of the characteristic features of this project is its dual lending model, which brings together lenders, borrowers, as well as liquidators, to ensure liquidity in the system. Members of this project have the choice to either use variable interest rates or stable interest rates, which give protection in cases of market volatility. The project is fully functional from day one, which enables members to carry out transactions of either lending or borrowing as soon as the tokens are listed in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $18.8 million from more than 18,010 contributors, Phase 6 being over 90% sold at a token value of $0.035. Phase 7 raises this value to $0.04, going toward reaching the estimated listing value of $0.06 per token. Mutuum Finance, offering a dual lending mechanism, Layer-2 scaling, an over-collateralized stablecoin, as well as staking rewards, provides immense usability as well as massive potential for explosive growth in value. Experts forecast potential returns of up to 7,000% after listing on exchanges, making it the best crypto to buy now and the next crypto to hit $1 for investors seeking early-stage DeFi exposure. Early contributors have this chance to grab tokens prior to launching Mutuum’s V1, offering immense returns in the upcoming massive bull run after launch.

(formerly MicroStrategy) a “fraud.” He said the company’s approach—relying on income-oriented funds buying high-yield preferred shares—is deeply flawed. Schiff said the targets for raising these funds were advertised yields only and would never be actually delivered to the investor. After fund managers saw this, he warned, they would quickly sell off the preferred shares. He stated that doing so would limit the company’s ability to issue more debt, which he said would set off what he called a financial “death spiral.” Schiff’s take on this further escalated the situation by publicly challenging Strategy founder Michael Saylor, who publicly launched the move, in a live debate at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in December this year. He pitched the challenge as an opportunity to shed light on what he believes are systemic flaws in Strategy — a Bitcoin-centered corporate model. His comments come as Bitcoin has fallen below the $100,000 threshold and the broader cryptocurrency sector appears to be on the verge of collapse. Meanwhile, gold — Schiff’s favored store of value — has remained above the critical psychological threshold of $4,000 per ounce. Saylor pushes forward as the crypto market battles volatility The man who turned Strategy into the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury company, Michael Saylor, has been determined to stand firm on his own vision. In the face of analysts’ skepticism about the sustainability of the company’s preferred-share approach, Saylor maintains a commitment to long-term Bitcoin adoption and accumulation. Market data shows that Strategy’s multiple on net asset value (mNAV) — the amount investors are willing to pay to hold onto its underlying Bitcoin assets — dipped below 1 in November but has since rebounded to roughly 1.21. Although this is an improvement, analysts suggest that a healthy mNAV for a Bitcoin treasury company is typically two or more times the value of the assets. Strategy’s stock has struggled, however. Since July, it has dropped by more than 50 percent and trades near $199 — far below the levels seen earlier this year, before Bitcoin’s October flash crash wiped out tens of billions of dollars in crypto-market value. Saylor has stated that volatility is inevitable and that the company’s long-term thesis remains intact. He argued that building up Bitcoin during a downturn could reinforce the firm’s strategic position. Meanwhile, gold — frequently cited as a rival to Bitcoin — is holding up. It is still trading at $4,085 per ounce, after reaching an all-time high of about $4,380 in October. Clash sends new signals to investors The comments by Schiff have drawn fresh attention to the corporate Bitcoin treasury mode l, especially for firms that use complex financing structures, such as preferred stock. If Schiff is right to predict that preferred-share demand will eventually collapse, Strategy could become increasingly squeezed on its balance sheet and its capacity to scale up its Bitcoin holdings. Saylor, meanwhile, is convinced that whatever path Bitcoin takes in the long term will vindicate Strategy’s strategy and outpace the market’s short-term noise. The public debate challenge puts the stage up for a high-profile duel between two of the loudest voices on the opposing sides of the gold-versus-Bitcoin divide. For investors, the exchange highlights a larger tension between legacy safe-haven assets and the emerging world of digital stores of value. The coming months — and the proposed debate — may be instrumental in shaping sentiment around each.

This move aims to support the development of AI in the country . In an interview, Rangu Salgame, Chairman and CEO of PDG, hinted that the data center operator plans to establish its initial data center in Incheon, a major port city and the third-largest metropolitan area in South Korea. Additionally, the CEO mentioned that this data center will initially have a capacity of 48 megawatts and will later expand to 500 megawatts across multiple locations. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the company has successfully secured its energy supply, and construction of this data center is set to commence this month. According to sources close to the situation, PDG intends for its facility to start operating fully by early 2028. The PDG plans to remain competitive in the AI Industry with significant investments Asia is striving to match the pace of US tech giants and AI-related companies that are making significant investments in the sector, such as the construction of data centers worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Examples of these Asian countries include Japan, India, and South Korea. According to reports, these countries are currently developing their own large language models, aiming to meet data sovereignty demands and improve enterprise usage in a region considered significant for AI growth. Regarding the growing interest in the AI industry among Asian countries, Salgame commented that the PDG plans to expand its presence in the rapidly growing AI market with an investment of approximately $25 billion over the next five years. In this plan, the company aims to increase its total capacity from 1.3 gigawatts to more than 4 gigawatts. In the meantime, apart from this plan, PDG’s CEO also mentioned that the firm seeks to invest $6 billion in South Korea by the end of the decade. Currently, PDG operates in Singapore, Japan, India, Indonesia, China, and Malaysia. Its investors include the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Mubadala Investment Company, a sovereign fund from the United Arab Emirates, and Stonepeak Partners, based in New York. “While the US is rapidly expanding AI data centers, Asia will see a big surge in the next five years,” said Salgame. His remarks followed the discovery that the overall capacity of the Asia-Pacific region is expected to triple to 40 gigawatts by the end of the decade. To achieve this anticipation, analysts expressed that this capacity will be backed by $300 billion in investments. South Korea’s government pledges to back new AI technology Earlier reports noted that South Korea poses challenges for data center operators due to limited land availability, power grid issues, and stringent permit regulations, which slow down development. To address such issues, the government has made clear its intention to support new AI technology that requires significant amounts of computing power by dedicating considerable investments and prioritizing relevant policies. Notably, Seoul’s plans have attracted some major tech firms to expand their presence in the nation. Examples of these tech giants include OpenAI , which opened its first Korean office this year in response to high demand for its ChatGPT service. With this move in place, reports highlighted that South Korea has been ranked as the second-largest market for paying subscribers after the US. The San Francisco-based tech company also plans to collaborate with South Korean tech giants, such as Samsung Electronics Co., to build data centers. Additionally, Amazon.com Inc. announced in October that it will invest an additional $5 billion in South Korean data centers, bringing the total investment to $9 billion, following its earlier pledge of $4 billion this year.

The company’s Bitcoin investment strategy includes several key elements: Systematic accumulation using excess cash flow Long-term holding perspective Portfolio diversification beyond traditional assets Strategic timing based on market conditions How Does Real Estate Connect with Bitcoin Investment? The connection between real estate and Bitcoin investment might seem unusual at first glance. However, Cardone Capital has developed an innovative approach that bridges these two worlds. The firm announced in April that it was establishing a new fund comprising 10 properties specifically to finance its Bitcoin acquisitions.

The Bitcoin investment strategy essentially uses property assets as collateral for cryptocurrency purchases, creating a diversified investment portfolio that spans both physical and digital realms. What Makes This Bitcoin Investment Different? Cardone Capital’s approach to Bitcoin investment stands out for several reasons. Unlike many cryptocurrency investors who trade frequently, the firm appears focused on long-term accumulation.

Second, maintain a long-term perspective rather than reacting to short-term price movements. Third, practice secure storage and avoid emotional decision-making. This Ethereum investor exemplifies how patience and belief in technology can outperform active trading strategies. Why Does This Ethereum Investor Movement Matter Now? The timing of this Ethereum investor’s activity raises interesting questions about current market sentiment. Moving such a significant amount after a decade suggests this experienced holder sees an appropriate time for partial profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing. However, it’s crucial to note that this Ethereum investor still retains the majority of their position. With 800 ETH remaining valued at over $2.5 million, they continue to maintain substantial exposure to Ethereum’s future growth potential. This balanced approach demonstrates sophisticated portfolio management. Frequently Asked Questions How much did the Ethereum investor originally invest? The investor purchased 1,000 ETH during Ethereum’s ICO for approximately $3,100 total. What is the current value of their Ethereum holdings? Their remaining 800 ETH position is valued at approximately $2.5 million, with the recent 200 ETH withdrawal worth $626,000. How long did the investor hold their Ethereum? They maintained their position for exactly 10 years before making any movements. What percentage of their holdings did they sell? They moved 20% of their total position (200 out of 1,000 ETH), indicating they still maintain 80% exposure. Is it still possible to achieve similar returns with Ethereum? While 10,000x returns are unlikely from current prices, Ethereum continues to offer growth potential as blockchain adoption increases. What does this movement signal for Ethereum’s price? Large investor movements can indicate sentiment shifts, but one transaction doesn’t necessarily predict market direction.

The slowdown arose from softer exports, weak consumer spending, and regulatory pressures. The contraction, slightly below economists’ expectations, highlights the ongoing fragility of Japan’s economic recovery. Exports weighed heavily on growth, as trade tensions—especially tariffs on shipments to the United States—reduced output. Net external demand is subtracted from the overall quarterly growth. Private consumption, which makes up more than half of Japan’s GDP, has grown by only 0.1%. High living expenses and stagnant wages have led households to be cautious, with limited discretionary spending on goods and services. Meanwhile, housing investment suffered too on the back of changes in building regulations, as well as tighter financing, with residential expenditure plunging. On the bright side, businesses also increased capital spending by about 1%, driven by strong business sentiment and targeted investments in equipment and factories. Government rolls out major stimulus amid rising inflation Inflation remains high, with core consumer prices rising significantly above the Bank of Japan’s target of 2%. Soaring prices for staples such as energy and food continue to put pressure on households. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is preparing an ambitious economic stimulus package, valued at over ¥17 trillion (around US$110 billion). Measures are expected to include subsidies on electricity and gas bills, cuts to gasoline taxes, targeted tax breaks, and strategic investment in growth industries such as AI and semiconductors. The government plans to fund the package through a large supplementary budget, likely exceeding last year’s additional spending of ¥13.9 trillion. Policymakers struggle to ensure that they are providing strong fiscal support while being responsible for its fiscal implications. Monday’s GDP numbers boost political support for aggressive fiscal spending. But Japan’s already elevated public debt raises concerns about long-term financial stability. The Bank of Japan is also in a delicate position. Although weak output may temper near-term interest rate increases, inflation remains persistent. Policymakers have emphasized caution, aiming to strike a balance between supporting growth and maintaining price stability. The Prime Minister, Takaichi, has called for “wage-driven inflation,” one that sees price rises corresponding not only to higher costs but also to higher incomes. Consumers cut back on spending Private consumption, which constitutes more than half of Japan’s economy, slowed markedly in Q3. Many households scaled back their spending as prices for necessities such as food, electricity, and gas increased further. Increased costs are stretching household budgets, resulting in less disposable income for discretionary spending on items such as dining out, travel, and entertainment. Consumer confidence was still delicate. Surveys indicate that many families are concerned about the future, particularly regarding job security and the impact of inflation on their financial stability. From the same BOJ survey (September 2025 wave), 62.5% said things are worse than a year ago, while only 3.8% said they felt things had improved Firms scaled back spending on new projects and growing operations or facilities, either because demand from here or abroad was softer. Firms have maintained their own cautious streak amid economic unease, as trade pressure from overseas has continued unabated. Housing spending softened again during the quarter. The construction of new homes and real estate development slowed, as higher interest rates and building costs discouraged both builders and homebuyers. Weak household spending, combined with restrained business investment, has exacerbated the damage caused by declining exports, resulting in a decline in overall GDP.

Recent data reveals alarming signals that every crypto investor needs to understand. Massive Bitcoin deposits flooding into Binance suggest the market might be heading for another significant downturn. What Does the Bitcoin Correction Signal Mean? CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost spotted a crucial pattern that often precedes major market movements. Since October 26th, over 35,000 BTC worth approximately $3.5 billion has moved onto Binance exchanges. This massive transfer coincided with Bitcoin’s price dropping from $114,000 to $94,000. Why should this concern you? Large exchange inflows typically indicate investors are preparing to sell their holdings. When fear grips the market, this trend becomes particularly pronounced. The current Bitcoin correction signals reflect genuine market anxiety rather than random noise. How Do Exchange Inflows Predict Market Movements? Understanding this Bitcoin correction indicator requires knowing how exchanges function. Investors typically move crypto to exchanges for one primary reason: they plan to sell. The recent surge in Binance deposits suggests many holders are positioning themselves for potential exits. Key factors driving this Bitcoin correction signal include: Large-scale institutional moves affecting market liquidity Investor psychology shifting toward risk-off sentiment Market absorption capacity being tested by sell pressure When Can We Expect Market Recovery? Darkfost maintains that until this inflow trend stabilizes and the market absorbs the current sell-off volume, a meaningful rebound remains unlikely. The possibility of further price decline cannot be ruled out during this Bitcoin correction phase. However, experienced traders know that market corrections create opportunities. While the short-term outlook appears cautious, these periods often set the stage for the next bullish cycle. The current Bitcoin correction could present buying opportunities for patient investors. What Should Investors Do During This Bitcoin Correction? Navigating potential market downturns requires strategic thinking. Rather than panic selling, consider these approaches: Monitor exchange flow data for early warning signals Diversify your portfolio across different assets Set clear entry and exit points based on your risk tolerance Keep some dry powder for potential buying opportunities Remember that every Bitcoin correction in history has eventually been followed by recovery. The key is maintaining perspective and avoiding emotional decisions during volatile periods. Frequently Asked Questions What causes a Bitcoin correction? Bitcoin corrections occur due to various factors including profit-taking, negative news, regulatory concerns, or large-scale selling pressure like the current Binance inflows. How long do Bitcoin corrections typically last? Correction periods vary widely, from several days to multiple months, depending on market conditions and the factors driving the downturn. Should I sell during a Bitcoin correction? This depends on your investment strategy. Long-term holders often view corrections as buying opportunities, while short-term traders might adjust positions. How can I track Bitcoin correction signals? Monitor exchange inflow/outflow data, funding rates, fear and greed index, and trading volume for early warning signs. What’s the difference between correction and bear market? A correction typically represents a 10-20% decline from recent highs, while a bear market involves sustained declines of 20% or more over longer periods. Are Bitcoin corrections healthy for the market? Yes, corrections help reset overextended markets, shake out weak hands, and create healthier foundations for future growth.

Look no further than the latest stablecoin issuance data, revealing a massive $14 billion injection into the ecosystem since October 11. This staggering capital inflow highlights growing confidence and sets the stage for potential market expansion. Let’s break down why this matters for investors and the broader crypto landscape. What Does $14B in Stablecoin Issuance Mean for Crypto? Tether and Circle have been busy minting new tokens, with USDT and USDC leading this charge. According to Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics firm, this substantial stablecoin issuance indicates strong capital movement into digital assets. Moreover, Circle’s recent $750 million USDC mint reinforces this trend. Therefore, this activity suggests investors are positioning themselves for future opportunities. How Does Stablecoin Issuance Impact Market Liquidity? Stablecoins serve as crucial liquidity bridges between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. When issuers like Tether and Circle increase supply, it typically signals: Increased trading volume on exchanges Higher buying pressure for other cryptocurrencies Improved market depth and stability This stablecoin issuance acts as a barometer for market sentiment. Consequently, the $14 billion influx since October’s dip could foreshadow renewed bullish momentum. Why Should Investors Monitor Stablecoin Metrics? Tracking stablecoin issuance provides valuable insights into market dynamics. For instance, large minting events often precede price rallies as fresh capital enters the ecosystem. However, investors should also watch redemption patterns to gauge overall risk appetite. This dual perspective helps make informed decisions based on real-time on-chain data rather than speculation alone. What Challenges Accompany Rapid Stablecoin Growth? While increased stablecoin issuance suggests market optimism, it also raises important considerations: Regulatory scrutiny around reserve transparency Potential systemic risks if adoption outpaces oversight Market dependence on centralized issuers Nevertheless, the current growth trajectory demonstrates stablecoins’ evolving role in global finance. How Can Traders Leverage This Information? Smart investors use stablecoin metrics as leading indicators. The recent $14 billion issuance suggests: Accumulation phases may be underway Downside protection through stablecoin holdings Preparation for upcoming market movements By monitoring these patterns, traders can align strategies with capital flow trends. Conclusion: Stablecoin Issuance Signals Renewed Confidence The $14 billion in USDT and USDC created since October’s market dip represents more than just numbers—it reflects growing institutional and retail conviction in cryptocurrency’s future. This stablecoin issuance surge provides essential market liquidity while acting as a confidence meter for the entire ecosystem. As capital continues flowing through these digital dollar proxies, the foundation strengthens for sustainable growth. Frequently Asked Questions Why does stablecoin issuance matter? Stablecoin issuance indicates capital entering crypto markets, often preceding price increases as investors convert to volatile assets. How does USDT differ from USDC? USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) are both dollar-pegged stablecoins but have different issuers, reserve structures, and regulatory compliance approaches. Can stablecoin issuance predict market trends? While not foolproof, large issuance events frequently correlate with upcoming market activity as investors position themselves. What risks come with stablecoin growth? Concerns include reserve transparency, regulatory changes, and centralization risks despite their decentralized usage. How often do stablecoin issuers create new tokens? Issuance occurs based on market demand, with periods of high volatility often triggering increased minting activity. Where can I track stablecoin metrics? On-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Etherscan, and dedicated dashboards provide real-time issuance data. Found this analysis helpful?

The Financial Services Agency is drafting measures that would cover 105 cryptocurrencies listed domestically, including Bitcoin and Ethereum . Exchanges would need to disclose core facts for each asset, such as whether there is an issuer, what technology it uses and the risk of price swings. The plan brings market conduct rules familiar to equity traders into crypto. People with non-public information tied to issuers or exchanges would be barred from trading on material events like listings, delistings or bankruptcies before they are disclosed. Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) plans to reclassify 105 cryptoassets, including BTC and ETH, as “financial products” and push for a tax overhaul in fiscal year 2026—reducing the current progressive crypto tax rate of up to 55% to a flat 20% capital gains tax. The agency… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 16, 2025 Japan Eyes 20% Flat Tax On Crypto Gains, Matching Stock Trading Distribution would broaden as well. Banks and insurers could sell cryptocurrencies to customers through their securities subsidiaries, giving retail investors access via regulated financial channels. Tax treatment would shift to a flat 20% on crypto gains, the same rate as stock trading, down from the current top rate of 55%. A simpler, lower rate could pull activity back onshore and reduce incentives to trade through foreign platforms. The agency aims to submit legislation in next year’s ordinary parliamentary session, the report said. FSA Pushes Clearer Disclosure To Strengthen Investor Confidence Domestic venues handle 105 assets today, a small slice of the thousands that trade globally. The FSA’s disclosure push signals a preference for depth over breadth, with clearer information for the assets that Japanese investors can buy. Market supervision is tightening elsewhere in Tokyo. Bloomberg reported that Japan Exchange Group is weighing stricter use of backdoor listing rules and may seek fresh audits for companies shifting heavily into crypto positions. Three listed firms have paused plans to buy digital assets after pushback, and were told their fundraising could be limited if they centered strategies on accumulating crypto. For traders, the message is clean rules and cleaner data. A 20% rate aligns crypto with equities, insider curbs target information abuse and bank-led distribution offers regulated access.

Not only is it a significant move to strengthen its domestic operations, analysts say, but the commitment is also a means to further expand in key growth sectors. Samsung plans to invest approximately $310 billion (450 trillion won) in South Korea over the next five years, according to the company. The investment will focus on semiconductor manufacturing, artificial-intelligence infrastructure, and advanced battery technology. At the core of the plan is a new chip production line at Samsung’s Pyeongtaek campus , called Plant 5. As global demand for memory chips, primarily for artificial intelligence applications, increases, the new line is expected to commence commercial operations in 2028. Beyond making chips, Samsung also plans to construct two large AI data centers. One is located in South Jeolla Province, enabling the company to be part of the national AI ecosystem, and the other is in Gumi for the development of internal AI capabilities. Investors cheer domestic focus and job growth. Samsung drives domestic growth and global leadership with bold five-year plan Investors viewed the $310 billion pledge as a tangible indication that Samsung would pursue a long-term strategy to stabilize South Korea and foster its economic growth. Such moves reflect Samsung’s confidence, analysts say, not just in the company’s own business, but in the larger South Korean economy. The investment plan is projected to create tens of thousands of jobs, both directly within Samsung itself and indirectly in adjacent industries, such as construction, logistics, and high-tech manufacturing. Moreover, small and medium-sized businesses and start-ups are also expected to benefit, especially as the market is witnessing an increased presence in semiconductors, advanced battery technology, and AI solutions. In the wake of the trade war in global markets and concerns that some Korean companies might relocate overseas to find new business opportunities, Samsung’s investment decision has also served to reassure the government and investors. It also reassures the nation’s identity as an international center for semiconductors, AI, and advanced technology manufacturing. Samsung’s pledge aligns with the government’s efforts to enhance the country’s industrial competitiveness. Analysts believe that Samsung demonstrates its strength by maintaining its core capability to produce at home, which will not only ensure it retains leadership in the global technology and industrial sector but also provide its nation with the capacity to expand its economy. Samsung and peers drive local industrial growth Samsung is not alone in its domestic investment boom. Other large Korean conglomerates, such as Hyundai, LG, and the SK Group, have also announced numerous investment plans on a larger scale in recent months. Cumulatively, the package provides hundreds of billions of dollars in investments to strengthen South Korea’s industrial and technological infrastructure. Those efforts include semiconductors and artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, batteries, and next-generation materials. This wave of locally-driven investments is a vivid indication of confidence in South Korea’s technology and manufacturing capabilities, experts say. By dedicating huge amounts of money to local manufacturing, they are signalling that, in the midst of global competition and changing global supply chains, they are convinced that South Korea can still be a global leader in high-tech sectors. The investment also reflects South Korea’s desire to position semiconductors as strategic assets to support the global economy, specifically in the areas of AI, smartphones, and cloud computing.

Macro investor Raoul Pal reveals that the secret isn’t complex trading strategies or market timing—it’s something much more fundamental that most investors overlook entirely. Why Does Patience Generate Superior Crypto Returns? Raoul Pal emphasizes that patience, not fear, generates sustainable crypto returns over time. Many investors currently feel terrified during market corrections, convinced they’ve made irreversible mistakes. However, Pal advises sticking to core principles rather than panicking when prices drop. He shares a crucial principle through the acronym DFTU—advising against making critical investment errors during emotional moments. If every market correction feels like a life-altering crisis, your investment approach likely needs adjustment. What Can We Learn From Historical Market Corrections? Pal draws from personal experience to illustrate how patience ultimately generates crypto returns. He first bought Bitcoin in the $200 range and endured significant losses: Two major Bitcoin drawdowns of 85% and 70% Ethereum and Solana positions down 95% at various points Multiple Bitcoin corrections averaging over five 35%+ drops per cycle Despite these temporary setbacks, proper asset allocation and patience generated substantial crypto returns over the long term. When Bitcoin falls 30%, altcoins typically drop more than 60%, creating both risk and opportunity for informed investors. How Can You Avoid Common Investment Mistakes? Pal warns against borrowing conviction from others and highlights the dangers of frequent trading. Many investors sabotage their potential crypto returns by constantly buying and selling based on short-term price movements. Instead, focus on these key principles to generate consistent crypto returns: Maintain proper asset allocation to withstand market volatility Avoid emotional decision-making during price corrections Remember Bitcoin’s historical performance as the highest-returning asset Develop personal conviction rather than following crowd sentiment What Separates Successful Crypto Investors? The ability to generate consistent crypto returns ultimately comes down to psychological resilience. Successful investors understand that market corrections are normal and temporary, while unsuccessful investors react emotionally to short-term price movements. Pal’s experience demonstrates that even massive temporary losses can transform into extraordinary crypto returns when investors maintain patience and discipline. Bitcoin’s history of recovering from severe corrections provides a powerful template for long-term investment success. Frequently Asked Questions How many market corrections does Bitcoin typically experience? Historically, Bitcoin averages more than five corrections of 35% or more per market cycle. These are normal occurrences that patient investors can navigate successfully. What does DFTU mean in crypto investing? DFTU is slang advising investors to avoid making critical mistakes during emotional market periods. It emphasizes sticking to principles rather than panicking. How much do altcoins typically drop when Bitcoin corrects? When Bitcoin falls 30%, altcoins often drop by more than 60%. This creates both significant risk and potential opportunity for informed investors. Is frequent trading beneficial for crypto returns? No, Raoul Pal specifically warns that frequent trading is detrimental to long-term crypto returns. Patience and strategic holding typically outperform active trading. What was Raoul Pal’s experience with crypto losses? He endured an 85% and 70% loss on Bitcoin positions, plus 95% losses on Ethereum and Solana, yet still generated substantial returns through patience and proper allocation. Why is borrowing conviction from others dangerous? Investing based on others’ beliefs rather than personal research often leads to panic selling during corrections, undermining potential crypto returns. If you found these insights valuable, share this article with fellow investors who could benefit from understanding how patience generates crypto returns. Help others avoid common mistakes and build wealth strategically.

He slammed the Bitcoin-only company’s business model as “fraud,” adding that Strategy (MSTR) “will eventually go bankrupt.” The gold investor on Sunday challenged Michael Saylor to a public debate on this proposition during Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in December. “MSTR’s entire business model is a fraud,” Peter Schiff publicly criticized the firm. “Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I believe MSTR will eventually go bankrupt.” MSTR’s entire business model is a fraud. Saylor and I will both be speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in early December. I challenge @saylor to debate this proposition with me. Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I believe $MSTR will eventually go bankrupt. Let’s go! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 16, 2025 In June, he argued that Strategy’s marathon Bitcoin buying spree will look reckless once the next major downturn takes hold. He claimed the coin’s price “won’t stand up over time” and MSTR will fall with it. Besides, Peter Schiff recently invited Binance founder Changpeng Zhao to a debate on tokenized gold vs Bitcoin – “which best satisfies the conditions of money.” Zhao, often referred to as ‘CZ,’ replied to him, saying he is “in the mood for it.” Peter Schiff Explains Why Strategy’s Business Model Would Fail “MSTR’s business model relies on income-oriented funds buying its ‘high-yield’ preferred shares,” Schiff wrote in a separate post on X. MSTR’s business model relies on income-oriented funds buying its “high-yield” preferred shares. But those published yields will never actually be paid. Once fund managers realize this they’ll dump the preferreds & $MSTR won’t be able to issue any more, setting off a death spiral. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 16, 2025 According to him, these yields will “never actually be paid.” Schiff continued that the company will no longer be able to issue more debt, causing a “death spiral.” “Dividends are only paid if MSTR decides to declare a dividend. But there is no requirement for MSTR to ever declare one, and there is no penalty for not doing so. Undeclared dividends don’t accumulate. They are lost forever,” he argued. Peter Schiff has been a persistent Bitcoin skeptic, claiming the crypto’s 21 million supply cap as a “meaningless” metric . He has also compared Bitcoin to silver , advising investors to sell their BTC portions to purchase silver. However, Bitcoin ultimately outperformed silver in early July, rising to $111,999 , and further surging to $124,457 in mid-August . MSTR Stock Risks Crashing as BTC Slumps Further Strategy’s (MSTR) stock has fallen by over 19% in the past 5 days, and nearly 30% over the past month, per Google Finance data . According to experts, the dip in MSTR stock could be attributed to the recent underwhelming performance of the Bitcoin price. Additionally, Strategy’s wallet moving massive BTC holdings to Coinbase has further weighed on the market sentiment. Bitcoin has further slumped on Monday, as part of a broader 10% weekly decline. The largest crypto by market cap failed to hold the $95,500 pivot, dropping to $92,890 on 17 Nov, a critical support breach. Bitcoin has currently rebounded and is trading at $95,384 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap data .

Kim Young-hoon, recognized as the person with the world’s highest IQ, just dropped a bombshell Bitcoin price prediction that’s sending shockwaves through the crypto community. His recent X post forecasts Bitcoin reaching an astonishing $220,000 within the next 45 days – a move that would represent one of the most dramatic price surges in cryptocurrency history. What Makes This Bitcoin Price Prediction So Significant? When someone with verified exceptional intelligence makes a bold financial forecast, investors naturally pay attention. Kim Young-hoon’s credentials as the world’s highest IQ holder lend unique credibility to his Bitcoin price prediction. However, it’s crucial to understand that even the brightest minds can’t guarantee market movements. This prediction comes during a period of significant volatility in cryptocurrency markets, making timing particularly challenging. Several factors could support this ambitious Bitcoin price prediction. Institutional adoption continues growing, regulatory clarity is improving in many regions, and Bitcoin’s scarcity becomes more pronounced with each halving event. Moreover, global economic uncertainty often drives investors toward decentralized assets like Bitcoin as hedge instruments. How Realistic Is This $220K Bitcoin Forecast? Let’s break down the numbers behind this dramatic Bitcoin price prediction. Reaching $220,000 from current levels would require approximately: Massive capital inflow into Bitcoin markets Accelerated institutional adoption beyond current rates Positive regulatory developments across major economies Significant market momentum building on existing trends While the timeframe seems aggressive, cryptocurrency markets have historically demonstrated capacity for rapid, unexpected movements. Remember that past performance never guarantees future results, and this Bitcoin price prediction represents one expert’s analysis rather than financial advice. What Should Investors Consider About This Prediction? Before making any investment decisions based on this Bitcoin price prediction, consider these crucial factors. First, diversify your portfolio rather than concentrating on single assets. Second, establish clear risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders and position sizing. Third, conduct independent research beyond any single expert’s forecast. The cryptocurrency market remains highly speculative and volatile. While this Bitcoin price prediction generates excitement, responsible investing requires balanced perspective and thorough due diligence. Consider both the potential upside and the significant risks involved in cryptocurrency investments. How Does This Compare to Other Bitcoin Predictions? Kim Young-hoon’s Bitcoin price prediction stands among the more optimistic forecasts, but he’s not alone in expecting substantial growth. Several analysts project six-figure Bitcoin valuations, though typically over longer timeframes. The key differentiator here is the compressed 45-day window, which would require extraordinary market conditions. Other experts emphasize gradual appreciation rather than explosive short-term growth. This diversity of opinion highlights the inherent uncertainty in cryptocurrency forecasting and reinforces why investors should consider multiple perspectives before making decisions. What Are the Potential Implications of This Move? If this Bitcoin price prediction materializes, the ramifications would extend far beyond Bitcoin itself. Such a dramatic price surge would likely: Accelerate mainstream cryptocurrency adoption Trigger significant altcoin market movements Attract increased regulatory scrutiny Validate Bitcoin’s store of value narrative The entire digital asset ecosystem would experience ripple effects, potentially reshaping how traditional finance views cryptocurrency markets. However, remember that such rapid appreciation also increases volatility risks and potential for sharp corrections. Final Thoughts on This Bold Bitcoin Forecast Kim Young-hoon’s Bitcoin price prediction certainly captures attention with its combination of dramatic numbers and impressive credentials. While the $220,000 target within 45 days seems ambitious, it underscores the growing optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s long-term potential. The coming weeks will reveal whether market conditions align with this expert’s analysis. Regardless of short-term price movements, Bitcoin continues demonstrating resilience and growing adoption. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or cryptocurrency newcomer, maintaining perspective and practicing risk management remains essential in this dynamic market environment. Frequently Asked Questions Who is Kim Young-hoon? Kim Young-hoon is recognized as the person with the world’s highest recorded IQ, bringing unique analytical perspective to his Bitcoin price prediction. How accurate have previous Bitcoin predictions been? Cryptocurrency predictions vary widely in accuracy. While some experts have made remarkably prescient forecasts, many have missed the mark, highlighting market unpredictability. What factors could drive Bitcoin to $220,000? Massive institutional adoption, favorable global regulation, economic uncertainty driving safe-haven demand, and limited supply could potentially support such price movement. Should I invest based on this prediction? Never invest based solely on any single prediction. Conduct thorough research, assess your risk tolerance, and consider consulting financial advisors before making investment decisions. What timezone does the 45-day prediction use? The prediction timeframe wasn’t specified, but typically such forecasts use the posting date as starting point counting forward 45 calendar days. How can I track this prediction’s progress? Monitor reputable cryptocurrency price tracking platforms and set price alerts to follow Bitcoin’s movement toward the predicted target. Found this analysis insightful?

The price is still trading below the middle Bollinger Band at $0.3985, which remains the first major overhead resistance. A daily close above the mid-band would indicate short-term strength is returning. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative yet is flattening, indicating that bearish pressure is losing force rather than intensifying. The RSI at 40.95 continues to hover in the lower range, aligning with the consolidation phase rather than an imminent breakdown. Optimism 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart reflects a clearer short-term rebound as OP climbs from the recent low wick and pushes toward $0.3888, with momentum somewhat supported by the narrowing Alligator lines. OP is approaching the immediate resistance band between $0.388 and $0.392, where the blue Alligator line and recent rejection zone converge. A close above $0.392 on this timeframe would confirm a short-lived bullish continuation. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI at 45.37 is rising from oversold territory, showing strength but not yet signaling overextension. The OBV also shows a small uptick, which fits with the recent buying seen through the last two candles.

OP is showing early signs of a base forming, but until $0.398–$0.405 is reclaimed on the daily timeframe, upside remains corrective rather than trending. A break above that zone opens room for a stronger recovery, while failures there would likely keep OP range-bound between $0.36–$0.39. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

The current Bitcoin correction represents a normal market adjustment rather than a fundamental breakdown. According to cryptocurrency experts, this temporary dip actually signals a healthy market reset that could set the stage for future growth. What Exactly is Causing This Bitcoin Correction? Ryan McMillin, Chief Investment Officer at Merkle Tree Capital, identifies three primary factors driving the current Bitcoin correction. First, long-term holders are taking profits after significant gains. Second, spot Bitcoin ETFs have shifted from net inflows to outflows. Third, global macroeconomic uncertainties are creating temporary headwinds. This combination of factors creates a perfect storm for short-term price pressure. However, the underlying Bitcoin fundamentals remain remarkably strong. The market is simply experiencing a natural breathing period after substantial earlier gains. How Does This Bitcoin Correction Differ From Past Downturns? The current market structure shows crucial differences from previous Bitcoin corrections. Institutional participation through ETFs provides substantial liquidity that absorbs selling pressure. This creates a more stable foundation than during earlier market cycles dominated primarily by retail investors. McMillin emphasizes that ETF and institutional liquidity is absorbing a significant portion of the sell-off . This structural change means corrections may be shallower and recovery periods potentially shorter than in previous cycles. Why Should Investors View This as a Healthy Correction? Market corrections serve essential functions in any financial ecosystem. They allow markets to consolidate gains, shake out weak hands, and establish stronger support levels. This Bitcoin correction performs several healthy functions: Resets overextended price levels to sustainable valuations Allows new investors to enter at more attractive prices Tests and strengthens key support levels for future growth Reduces speculative excess that can lead to bubbles Each successful test of support during this Bitcoin correction builds a more robust foundation for the next upward move. What Can We Expect After This Bitcoin Correction Phase? Historical patterns suggest that healthy corrections typically lead to renewed buying interest once the adjustment phase completes. The current Bitcoin correction appears to be following this pattern, with institutional interest remaining strong despite temporary price weakness. The fundamental case for Bitcoin continues to strengthen regardless of short-term price movements. Adoption continues growing, institutional interest remains elevated, and the long-term narrative remains intact. This Bitcoin correction simply represents a pause in that broader upward trajectory. Conclusion: Embracing Market Reality Successful investors understand that corrections are normal, healthy market phenomena. This Bitcoin correction provides an opportunity to reassess positions, add to holdings at better prices, and prepare for the next growth phase. Rather than fearing temporary declines, experienced market participants recognize them as essential components of sustainable long-term growth. The current environment demonstrates the market’s growing maturity. The presence of institutional liquidity and diversified participant base creates a more resilient ecosystem that can withstand normal market fluctuations without collapsing. Frequently Asked Questions How long might this Bitcoin correction last? Correction periods typically last from several weeks to a few months, depending on market conditions and external factors. There’s no fixed timeline, but historical patterns provide useful guidance. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this correction? Unless you need immediate funds, selling during corrections often locks in losses. Many investors use corrections as buying opportunities to improve their average entry prices. What price level would signal the end of this Bitcoin correction? Look for stabilization above key support levels and renewed buying volume. Technical analysts monitor specific price zones, but fundamentals ultimately drive long-term value. Are Bitcoin ETFs making corrections more or less severe? ETFs appear to be moderating correction severity by providing additional liquidity and institutional participation that absorbs selling pressure more efficiently. How does this Bitcoin correction compare to 2022’s bear market? This appears fundamentally different—2022 involved major contagion events and leverage unwinding, while current conditions reflect normal profit-taking and adjustment. What indicators should I watch during this Bitcoin correction? Monitor ETF flows, exchange reserves, miner activity, and overall market sentiment alongside price action for a comprehensive view.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin fell to $93,000 on Monday in Asia, its sharpest drop since March, as traders trimmed expectations of a December US rate cut and global stocks opened on the defensive. Liquidations told the story. CoinGlass data showed $617.45m wiped out in 24 hours, with longs at $394.50m and shorts at $222.95m. Bitcoin accounted for $242.19m and Ether for $169.06m. The largest single wipeout was a $30.60m BTC position on Hyperliquid. Wall Street set a weak tone. Futures softened after Friday’s slump left the Dow down 1.65%, the S&P 500 off 1.66% and the Nasdaq lower by 2.29%.

Germany’s DAX fell 1.39%, the FTSE 100 slipped 1.05%, France’s CAC 40 eased 0.11%, and the Euro Stoxx 50 lost 0.83%. Asia followed with a mixed open. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.77%, Australia’s S&P ASX 200 fell 1.35%, New Zealand’s benchmark declined 1.58% and Shanghai edged down 0.16%. Rate expectations kept risk in check. Market pricing for a December Fed cut slid to around 40% from more than 60% a week ago, pushing investors toward cash and away from high beta trades. Liquidations Pile Up As Crypto Markets Struggle For Support Crypto mirrored that shift. Spot ETF outflows picked up and liquidity thinned, leaving Bitcoin to give back gains built on easier policy hopes. By late morning, it hovered near $95,051 after the early plunge. Japan added a domestic twist. The Asahi reported the Financial Services Agency is weighing rules that would treat crypto as financial products subject to insider trading restrictions, with a tax cut to a flat 20% and new disclosures for 105 listed tokens. Equity traders also eyed a heavy week for earnings and delayed US data that could shape the rate narrative. Tech leaders remained in focus as investors reassessed valuations built on artificial intelligence enthusiasm. In the liquidation tape, pressure was steady through the session. Twelve-hour liquidations totaled $389.39m with $283.40m from longs. Four-hour totals reached $76.11m, led by short losses at $67.04m. Traders said renewed institutional conviction will decide whether the next move is a base or another leg lower.

It’s Happening Again,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-has-historically-bounced-hard-when-this-spikes-its-happening-again/,"XRP has spent the past few days in a narrow range despite the launch of the XRPC spot ETF , a development that many expected to give the asset a stronger lift. The price has remained stagnant, and market participants have looked for signals that could explain what may come next. A recent post by prominent market analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) added a new angle to the discussion by highlighting a metric that often gains attention during periods of uncertainty. He shared a chart showing Relative Unrealized Loss on a seven days moving average and stated that “when unrealized losses spike, $XRP has historically bounced hard.” BREAKING: WHEN UNREALIZED LOSSES SPIKE, $XRP HAS HISTORICALLY BOUNCED HARD. IT’S HAPPENING AGAIN! pic.twitter.com/V1KU2cFsrV — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 15, 2025 What The Indicator Shows The Relative Unrealized Loss metric measures the proportion of supply currently held below its cost basis. Rising values indicate that more holders are underwater. In the past year, XRP saw moments where this level increased for a short window before a price reversal. The chart shows that XRP experienced massive 500% surge between November 2024 and January 2025, when this value was high. Another brief spike in the middle of the year pushed XRP to its all-time high , and the data shows that the value is rising rapidly again. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The recent move stands out because it arrives after the XRPC ETF’s record-breaking launch , which generated interest but did not produce the immediate volatility some investors expected. Instead, the price stayed calm while the metric climbed. This suggests that the current situation may differ from earlier phases of excitement without sustained follow-through. Steph’s analysis suggests this is a constructive setup because past spikes in unrealized losses often coincided with rapid price rally. Why This Development Matters For XRP The timing supports the view that XRP may sit at an early stage of a new cycle. If investors treat the recent metric spike as they have before, the situation could bring renewed demand. XRP’s muted performance may reflect temporary consolidation rather than a shift. The launch of the XRPC ETF still carries weight, especially as new products often take time to influence liquidity and behavior. The Relative Unrealized Loss spike shows that investors are navigating short-term uncertainty while maintaining longer-term interest. If historical patterns hold, the conditions described by Steph Is Crypto could bring a positive turn . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to Wu Blockchain reports, this YU stablecoin depegs event has caused the token to plummet to just $0.42, representing a catastrophic 54.9% loss in value within 24 hours. What Exactly Happened When YU Stablecoin Depegs? The YU stablecoin depegs event represents one of the most significant stablecoin failures in recent memory. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a consistent value, typically pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar. When a YU stablecoin depegs situation occurs, it indicates serious underlying problems with the token’s stability mechanisms. This particular YU stablecoin depegs incident saw the token lose more than half its value almost overnight. The rapid decline suggests that either: Market confidence evaporated suddenly Liquidity pools became insufficient Technical issues compromised the peg mechanism External market pressures overwhelmed the stability protocols Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This Depegging? When any stablecoin experiences depegging, it serves as a crucial reminder of the risks inherent in cryptocurrency investments. The YU stablecoin depegs event highlights several important considerations for investors: First, it demonstrates that even assets marketed as “stable” can experience extreme volatility. Second, the YU stablecoin depegs situation underscores the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms that maintain a token’s peg. Moreover, this YU stablecoin depegs incident affects: Investor confidence across the crypto space Trust in Bitcoin-native protocols like Yala Regulatory scrutiny of stablecoin projects Future adoption of similar financial instruments How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? The ramifications of this YU stablecoin depegs event extend far beyond just YU holders. Stablecoins serve as crucial infrastructure within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, facilitating trading, lending, and decentralized finance operations. When a YU stablecoin depegs situation occurs, it can create ripple effects throughout the market. Other stablecoins may face increased scrutiny, and investors might become more cautious about similar projects. The YU stablecoin depegs incident particularly impacts Yala’s reputation as a Bitcoin-native liquidity protocol. What Can We Learn From This Stablecoin Crisis? This YU stablecoin depegs event provides valuable lessons for both investors and project developers. The dramatic price collapse emphasizes the importance of: Thorough due diligence before investing Understanding the mechanisms behind stability guarantees Diversifying across different stablecoin projects Monitoring market sentiment and liquidity conditions The YU stablecoin depegs situation serves as a stark reminder that in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, even seemingly safe assets can carry significant risks. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when a stablecoin depegs? When a stablecoin depegs, it means the token has lost its 1:1 value ratio with its target asset, typically the US dollar. This indicates failure in the mechanisms designed to maintain price stability. How common are stablecoin depegging events? While minor depegging occurs occasionally, major depegs like the YU stablecoin depegs incident are relatively rare but can have significant consequences for investors and the broader market. Can YU recover from this depegging? Recovery depends on multiple factors including market confidence, liquidity restoration, and protocol adjustments. However, major depegs often result in permanent loss of trust. Should I invest in stablecoins after this incident? Stablecoins remain useful tools, but this YU stablecoin depegs event emphasizes the importance of choosing well-established, transparent projects with proven track records. What protections exist for stablecoin investors? Currently, stablecoin investors have limited protections. The market operates largely without insurance or government guarantees, making due diligence essential. How can I identify stablecoins at risk of depegging? Watch for declining trading volumes, reduced liquidity, negative community sentiment, and any changes to the stability mechanisms that maintain the peg. Found this analysis helpful?

The Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country's top financial regulator, is preparing to reclassify 105 crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, into the “financial product” category. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the cryptocurrencies in question will be regulated under the Financial Products Transactions Act. The FSA's move reportedly includes requesting tax relief from the government ahead of the next fiscal year. According to Asahi, these new regulations will be similar to the tax model applied to stock trading and could significantly put an end to Japan's controversial crypto taxation system. Under Japan's current system, cryptocurrency earnings are declared as “miscellaneous income,” and investors in the highest tax bracket are required to pay 55% of their earnings to the government. Given that cryptocurrency earnings are considered capital gains and taxed at lower rates in many countries, Japan's system has long been the subject of criticism. If the FSA's proposal is implemented, profits from these 105 cryptocurrencies would be taxed at a single, flat tax rate of 20%. The agency hasn't made an official statement on the matter, but the report stated that criteria such as transparency, the reputation of the issuing institutions, technological robustness, and price volatility risk were taken into consideration in determining the coins to be included on the list. The FSA is also planning to introduce new rules to prevent insider trading in the domestic crypto industry, according to the report. Under the regulations, individuals and companies affiliated with exchanges or issuers would be prohibited from trading while possessing sensitive data, such as listing dates or financial status information that has not yet been disclosed.

Japan's cryptocurrency sector currently has a “green list” system managed by its own self-regulatory body, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA). The list currently includes 30 crypto assets, including high-cap coins like BTC, ETH, MATIC, XRP, and LTC. For a token to be greenlisted, it must meet three conditions: Must be listed on at least three JVCEA member exchanges Must be listed on a JVCEA member exchange for at least six months It is deemed “eligible” by the JVCEA and is allowed to be listed unconditionally. *This is not investment advice.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3195 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility, ensuring that the total supply remains accessible to users. Pi Network is reaching one of the most crucial phases in 2025; as the market is still suspicious, the on-chain activity and the Pi ecosystem continue to develop. Pi recently recorded a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, 2025, down sharply from its February peak of $2.98, underscoring the token’s high volatility in the crypto market. Despite this, key fundamental factors are keeping investor interest alive. Passkey Update enhanced the security of the Pi Wallet with Face ID, fingerprint, and PIN ahead of the Mainnet launch. New DeFi tools Pi DEX and AMM on Testnet allow users to transact Pi and explore decentralized finance in a Web3-aligned way. Meanwhile, Pi Network Ventures partnered with OpenMind AI to build a decentralized AI infrastructure, and a recent system process enabled 3.36 million Pioneers to complete identity verification pi network on Pi Network. With the Pi Hackathon 2025 and Sign Protocol partnership ongoing, the Pi network price prediction suggests a resilient ecosystem still focused on utility and long-term growth within the declining exponential model that defines its supply and mining rewards In this article on Pi price prediction and Pi Network price prediction, we analyze recent technical factors and fundamental developments, including price history, key support levels, resistance levels, and multiple technical quantitative indicators, to assess whether Pi’s current forecast points to recovery or further decline between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.2245 Price Change 24h 2.51% Market Cap $1.85B Circulating Supply 8.31B PI Trading Volume 24h $31.42M All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.2245 Price Prediction $ 0.1860 (-24.97%) Fear & Greed Index 33 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 10.61% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2672 200-Day SMA No Data 14-Day RSI 56.56 (Neutral) Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown : Pi trades at $0.2245, up by 2.51% in the past 24 hours after briefly reaching a high near $0.2314. Pi’s price shows early stabilization, supported by fading bearish pressure and a moderate pickup in volume. Resistance is between $0.23 and $0.246, while support remains at $0.22 and $0.215. As of November 16, 2025, Pi Network’s price is showing a steady recovery after a small pullback earlier in the week. Pi is trading at $0.2245, slightly recovering after intraday lows of $0.2177. Bulls are still defending the level of support at $0.22, despite the subdued volume, indicating that the market is experiencing a tamed consolidation period as traders wait for a momentum trigger. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows that there was a transition period following weeks of the PI price sliding down. Pi ranged between $0.2177 and $0.2314, then stabilized at $0.2245 and created a narrow sideways trade that reflects indecision but with improving sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 47.05, just behind the signal line 51.38. This indicates a neutral market with a slight bullish bias. A sustained break above 50 would confirm accumulation and could push Pi toward $0.236 – $0.246. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) lines are at–0.0032 and –0.0037, with a slightly positive histogram at +0.0005, showing mild bullish buildup. The narrowing distance between MACD and signal line suggests an approaching bullish crossover, signaling the possibility of a short-term uptrend if volume strengthens.. Immediate resistance stands at $0.23, aligning with recent local highs, while solid support sits near $0.22 and $0.215. A close above $0.23 could spark a move toward $0.246–$0.25, while losing $0.22 may drag Pi back to $0.21. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, Pi Network is trading around $0.2225, reflecting an intraday decline after a rejection near $0.2273. Pi has been ranging between $0.2199 and $0.2273, showing low-volatility consolidation as traders recheck momentum near the $0.22 and $0.23 zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 50.99, sitting just above its signal line at 47.58, indicating a mild bullish bias even though momentum has cooled off from the overbought spike earlier. A sustained hold above 55 RSI could open room for renewed accumulation toward $0.23 and $0.235. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) line at 0.0010 is slightly above the signal line at 0.0000, with a small positive histogram (0.0009). This shallow divergence suggests neutral-to-bullish pressure, showing early signs of buyers returning after the dip. If the MACD crossover strengthens, Pi Network could attempt another push toward $0.229 and $0.233. If Pi closes above $0.227, short-term upside targets remain $0.233 to $0.24, confirming improving buyer strength. However, failure to hold the $0.220 support may trigger a pullback toward $0.215, where stronger liquidity sits. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3019 SELL SMA 5 $0.2744 SELL SMA 10 $0.2451 BUY SMA 21 $0.2286 BUY SMA 50 $0.2672 SELL SMA 100 $0.3262 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2387 BUY EMA 5 $0.2571 SELL EMA 10 $0.2897 SELL EMA 21 $0.3235 SELL EMA 50 $0.3764 SELL EMA 100 $0.4668 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to continue moving sideways between $0.22 and $0.23 as momentum cools off after an earlier brief spike. The RSI shows mild bullish strength but not enough to break resistance, while the MACD remains weak, signaling that buyers are present but not dominant. For Pi to make a meaningful move, it must reclaim $0.235 and $0.24 with stronger volume; otherwise, the price may drift back toward $0.218 to $0.22 as traders review the fading momentum. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price up today? Pi is up today because it broke above key resistance with stronger buying volume, and a whale accumulated around 1M PI, boosting confidence and accelerating the upward move. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation.

Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) recognizes this technology’s potential to revolutionize financial services. This approach enables faster settlements and improved liquidity management. Moreover, it bridges the gap between conventional banking and emerging digital asset ecosystems. The pilot program builds upon previous sandbox experiments to test real-world applications. How Does Hong Kong’s Tokenized Deposits Pilot Work? The live pilot operates through the digital Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD+) infrastructure. It focuses initially on tokenized money market funds and real-time liquidity management. Here are the key components: Digital settlement using blockchain technology Integration with traditional banking systems Real-time transaction processing Enhanced security protocols The program will continue until 2026, allowing thorough testing and refinement. This extended timeline ensures robust implementation before full-scale deployment. What Benefits Do Tokenized Deposits Offer? Tokenized deposits provide numerous advantages over traditional banking methods. Financial institutions gain operational efficiencies while customers enjoy improved services. The system enables: Faster transaction settlements – reducing processing times from days to minutes Enhanced transparency – through immutable blockchain records Improved liquidity management – enabling real-time fund transfers Reduced costs – by eliminating intermediary requirements These benefits position Hong Kong as a forward-thinking financial hub. The successful implementation could set a global standard for digital banking innovation. What Challenges Might Tokenized Deposits Face? Despite the promising benefits, tokenized deposits encounter several hurdles. Regulatory compliance remains a primary concern for financial authorities. Technical infrastructure requirements present another significant challenge. Market adoption depends on user education and trust building. Cybersecurity risks require robust mitigation strategies. The HKMA addresses these concerns through careful pilot management and stakeholder collaboration. How Does This Impact Global Financial Markets? Hong Kong’s tokenized deposits initiative influences international finance significantly. Other financial centers monitor the pilot’s progress closely. Successful implementation could accelerate global adoption of similar systems. The project demonstrates practical blockchain application in mainstream banking. It also showcases how traditional and digital finance can coexist productively. This development may inspire other jurisdictions to explore comparable innovations. Conclusion: The Future of Tokenized Deposits Hong Kong’s live pilot for tokenized deposits marks a pivotal moment in financial technology evolution. The program bridges traditional banking with digital asset capabilities effectively. As the pilot progresses until 2026, we anticipate valuable insights that will shape global financial infrastructure. The successful integration of tokenized deposits could redefine banking efficiency and accessibility. This initiative positions Hong Kong at the forefront of financial innovation while setting benchmarks for other markets to follow. Frequently Asked Questions What are tokenized deposits? Tokenized deposits are digital representations of traditional bank deposits on blockchain networks. They maintain parity with regular deposits while enabling enhanced functionality. How long will the Hong Kong pilot run? The pilot program is scheduled to operate until 2026, allowing comprehensive testing and refinement of the tokenized deposits system. What assets are involved in the initial phase? The pilot initially focuses on tokenized money market funds and real-time liquidity management transactions. How does this benefit regular bank customers? Customers may experience faster transactions, improved transparency, and enhanced banking services through tokenized deposits implementation. Is the digital Hong Kong dollar different from regular HKD? The e-HKD+ maintains parity with traditional Hong Kong dollars while existing as a digital token for specific financial applications. Could this system replace traditional banking? Tokenized deposits complement rather than replace traditional banking, offering additional functionality while maintaining existing systems.

His comments were made as Bitcoin slipped below $99,000. Strategy’s stock also plunged more than 50% since July, and its mNAV struggled to recover from a drop below 1. Meanwhile, gold held firmly above $4,000 and remained near record highs, giving Schiff fresh ammunition to argue that Bitcoin is too volatile to serve as a reliable corporate treasury asset. Schiff Says Strategy Faces a Death Spiral Gold investor Peter Schiff reignited his long-running feud with the crypto industry, this time targeting Strategy (MSTR) and its executive chairman Michael Saylor. In a series of posts on X , Schiff called Strategy’s Bitcoin-heavy business model a “fraud” and publicly challenged Saylor to debate him at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai this December. The attack came during a period of market weakness for both Bitcoin and crypto-treasury-focused companies, while gold surged back above the $4,000 level. Schiff argued that Strategy’s business model hinges on income-oriented funds purchasing the company’s high-yield preferred shares. According to him, the yields advertised to investors will “never actually be paid,” and once fund managers realize that, they will abandon the asset. Schiff believes this will trigger a “death spiral,” and will prevent Strategy from issuing new debt and ultimately undermine its broader strategy of using capital markets to accumulate more Bitcoin. His criticism is similar to his long-standing belief that the crypto sector overpromises and underdelivers while masking fundamental weaknesses with aggressive marketing. The comments landed at quite a sensitive moment. Bitcoin recently fell below $99,000, extending a decline of more than 20% from the record high close to $125,000 that was reached in early October. The flash crash on Oct. 10 erased tens of billions from the market, and seriously shook investor confidence across crypto-exposed equities. BTC’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Strategy has been hit particularly hard, with its stock price down over 50% since July and currently trading near $199. One of the most closely watched indicators for the company, its mNAV — which measures the premium at which shares trade relative to the value of underlying Bitcoin holdings — dropped below 1 in November. Although it has recovered to 1.21, this is still well below the “healthy” level of 2 or higher that many treasury-focused investors prefer to see. Meanwhile, gold strengthened in the face of the crypto market’s drawdown. Prices held above the critical $4,000 support level, and climbed to around $4,085 per ounce after briefly dipping earlier in the month. Gold reached an all-time high of roughly $4,380 per ounce in October, which helped push its total market capitalization above $30 trillion before settling back to current levels. Schiff is a longtime gold advocate, and used the metal’s relative resilience as even more evidence that Bitcoin remains too volatile and speculative to justify its growing role in corporate treasury management.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 05:30:00

This perfect storm of monetary policy uncertainty and economic weakness is creating treacherous conditions for Forex traders and cryptocurrency investors alike. Why are Asian currencies declining against the dollar? The US dollar continues to strengthen as Federal Reserve officials maintain their hawkish stance on interest rates. Recent economic data showing persistent inflation has forced markets to reconsider their earlier optimism about imminent rate cuts. The dollar index has climbed to multi-month highs, putting downward pressure on emerging market currencies across Asia. Federal Reserve policy shift rattles global markets Market expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts have been pushed further into 2024 as inflation proves more stubborn than anticipated. Several Fed officials have emphasized the need to keep rates higher for longer, causing a fundamental repricing across global asset classes. This shift is particularly painful for Asian economies that benefit from lower US borrowing costs. Currency Recent Performance Key Factors Japanese Yen -2.3% BoJ policy divergence, weak GDP Chinese Yuan -1.8% Property crisis, export weakness Indian Rupee -1.2% Oil imports, capital outflows South Korean Won -2.1% Tech exports, China exposure Japan GDP contraction signals deeper economic troubles Japan’s economy shrank by 0.5% in the third quarter, far worse than economists had projected. The Japan GDP decline was driven by multiple factors including weak consumer spending, falling business investment, and sluggish exports. This contraction raises serious questions about the Bank of Japan’s ability to normalize monetary policy while supporting economic growth. Interest rates outlook: What traders need to know The current interest rates environment presents significant challenges for Asian central banks. With the Federal Reserve likely to maintain higher rates, regional policymakers face difficult choices between defending their currencies and supporting economic growth. Key considerations for traders include: Timing of potential Fed policy shifts Regional inflation trajectories Capital flow patterns Central bank intervention risks Forex market implications and trading strategies The Forex market is experiencing heightened volatility as these fundamental shifts unfold. Currency pairs involving Asian currencies are showing increased correlation with US Treasury yields and risk sentiment. Traders should monitor several key indicators including US inflation data, Asian export figures, and central bank communications for directional cues. Frequently Asked Questions How does Federal Reserve policy affect Asian currencies? When the Federal Reserve raises or maintains high interest rates, it typically strengthens the US dollar while putting pressure on emerging market currencies. Asian central banks often face difficult choices between raising rates to defend their currencies or keeping rates low to support economic growth. What caused Japan’s GDP contraction? Japan’s GDP contraction resulted from multiple factors including weak consumer spending, declining business investment, and sluggish export performance. The Bank of Japan continues to struggle with balancing inflation control and economic support. Which Asian currencies are most vulnerable to Fed policy? Currencies with high external financing needs and those with close trade links to China tend to be most vulnerable. The South Korean won, Indonesian rupiah, and Indian rupee often show high sensitivity to Federal Reserve policy shifts. How are cryptocurrency markets reacting to these developments? Cryptocurrency markets are showing increased correlation with traditional risk assets amid these macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin and major altcoins have experienced selling pressure as dollar strength and rising Treasury yields reduce risk appetite across global markets. What should Forex traders watch in coming weeks? Traders should monitor key economic indicators including US CPI data, Federal Reserve meeting minutes, Asian export figures, and central bank interventions. The Federal Reserve chair’s speeches and G20 meetings may provide important policy signals. The combination of fading Federal Reserve rate cut expectations and Japan’s economic contraction has created a challenging environment for Asian currencies. As the US dollar maintains its strength and regional growth concerns mount, Forex traders must navigate increased volatility and shifting correlations. The path forward will depend heavily on incoming economic data and central bank responses across both developed and emerging markets.

The Federal Aviation Administration’s decision to end emergency flight restrictions, President Donald Trump’s call for the release of Epstein files, major portfolio shifts by investor Peter Thiel, and Bitcoin briefly losing all its gains for the year. FAA ends emergency flight restrictions after shutdown The Federal Aviation Administration announced Sunday that it is lifting all commercial flight restrictions imposed at 40 major US airports during the nation’s record 43-day government shutdown. Airlines can resume full schedules beginning Monday at 6 am EST. The FAA and Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said the order, in effect since November 7, was driven by severe staffing shortages in air traffic control facilities. Flight cuts initially stood at 4% and peaked at 6% before being scaled back to 3% as staffing improved after the shutdown ended on November 12. This weekend saw the lowest cancellation levels since the restrictions began, with less than 1% of flights canceled, according to Cirium. FlightAware reported 149 cancellations Sunday and 315 on Saturday. A safety review prompted the rescinding of the order, though the FAA is assessing reports of airline non-compliance during the emergency period. At their worst on November 9, cancellations exceeded 2,900 amid staffing shortages and severe weather. The FAA had initially planned cuts of up to 10% before conditions began to improve late last week. Trump urges House GOP to release Epstein files President Donald Trump reversed his position Sunday, calling on House Republicans to vote to release Jeffrey Epstein–related files — a move he had decried as a “hoax” only days earlier. Trump said releasing the documents would dispel what he called a Democratic attempt to distract from political losses and the shutdown. He noted that the Justice Department has already released “tens of thousands” of pages and highlighted his directive to investigate Epstein’s ties to high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton. A Clinton spokesperson said recent email releases showed the former president “did nothing and knew nothing.” A bipartisan discharge petition led by Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie have forced the issue to the House floor, drawing support from several Trump-aligned Republicans. Speaker Mike Johnson, who previously opposed the measure, has agreed to bring it to a vote this week. Peter Thiel offloads Nvidia, cuts Tesla amid AI bubble concerns Billionaire investor Peter Thiel drastically reshaped his portfolio in Q3, selling his entire Nvidia stake and trimming Tesla holdings as worries grow over what he calls an “AI Bubble.” Thiel Macro LLC slashed its assets from $212 million in Q2 to $74.4 million in Q3, dumping 537,742 Nvidia shares, once 40% of its portfolio, and all holdings in Vistra Corp. The fund also cut Tesla shares by 76%, leaving 65,000 shares as its largest position. Thiel increased exposure to Microsoft and Apple, adding 49,000 and 79,181 shares respectively. His view: diversified tech giants offer more durable long-term value than AI-dependent chipmakers. The investor has repeatedly compared current AI enthusiasm to the 1999 dot-com era, suggesting that expected transformations will take years to materialize. Bitcoin briefly erases all 2025 gains as market slides Bitcoin slid to $93,029 on Sunday, down 25% from its October all-time high, temporarily erasing all gains made this year. It has since recovered to around $95,077.24. The crypto pullback comes despite expectations of a strong year under the Trump administration, which has taken a pro-crypto stance and overseen rising corporate Bitcoin adoption and ETF inflows. However, tariff battles, the prolonged government shutdown, and heavy selling by long-time Bitcoin holders have pressured the market. Analysts at Glassnode said the so-called “OG Whales Dumping” narrative reflects typical late-cycle profit-taking, not a mass exit. Major altcoins also fell, with Ether down nearly 4% and Solana dropping over 27% year-to-date. Some industry voices remain optimistic: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said the “debasement trade” could drive a strong crypto rally in 2026, supported by growth in stablecoins, tokenization and DeFi.

The price of Zcash increased above $700 on Sunday, which sparked disputes online between Bitcoin and Zcash fans. Just a day before, the price of Zcash had dropped to $598, but now it has made a strong comeback, and people have started discussing privacy-oriented assets making a comeback. Bitcoin fans are upset because the price of Zcash has gone up a lot The Bitcoin fans who always believed BTC was the only real coin and everything else was a scam had a particularly hard time accepting the fact that Zcash rose above $700. They could not explain why the price of Zcash increased so rapidly in such a short timeframe, as they were accustomed to seeing slow, steady growth in Bitcoin. The CEO of Bitwise, Hunter Horsley, said the critics are having a hard time discussing the Zcash gain because it goes against everything they believe makes a cryptocurrency real or important . Many Bitcoin supporters shared their surprise, anger, or concern about Zcash online, sparking a debate about what constitutes a “real” cryptocurrency in the community’s eyes. Some Bitcoin fans, like Bit Paine, even accused the Zcash rally of being a “coordinated pump and dump.” They referred to the coin’s 1,500% increase since October and stated that it is due to the actions of big investors or companies pushing the price up for their own benefit. Additionally, they argue that small investors who buy in late will lose a significant amount of money if the price drops too quickly, making this gain risky, unfair, and contributing to the overall instability of the crypto market. BTC fans want all other coins to work just like theirs does, with growth being safe and predictable. On the other hand, privacy coin enthusiasts are okay with the rapid fluctuations in Zcash’s price because the coin offers users more control and privacy than Bitcoin. The argument isn’t even about money, but about what makes a coin real or trustworthy. Secret coins fans are happy because the price of Zcash has gone up a lot Most people in the Bitcoin community criticized Zcash for its rapid rise in popularity. Still, privacy supporters argued that these criticisms lacked foresight, as they overlooked the coin’s technology, purpose, and growing popularity. The CEO of RPC provider Helius, Mert Mumtaz, said many of the BTC fans sounded more like conspiracy theorists because their attacks lacked financial analysis. He explained that Zcash, like BTC, helps investors make money, but it goes beyond just that and offers privacy and security to its users. At a time when governments, large companies, and hackers are closely monitoring all activities related to Bitcoin, Zcash is protecting the identity of its users during transactions. Zcash became the largest privacy-focused cryptocurrency as of October, when it passed its eight-year high and overtook Monero (XMR) in market capitalization. At the time of writing, it had achieved a market capitalization of over $11.2 billion, positioning it close to overtaking Cardano (ADA) and entering the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally. Investors and companies have also begun to show interest in Zcash, with Arthur Hayes, founder of the BitMEX exchange, stating that his family office , Maelstrom, holds Zcash as its second-largest liquid asset, after Bitcoin. When Zcash held its rally, Leap Therapeutics rebranded to Cypherpunk Technologies (a Zcash treasury-backed company) and got funding from Winklevoss Capital. This significant investment increased the price of its shares by over 170%, and Zcash fans say it’s proof that their coin is gaining even more popularity by the day. The rise of Zcash also sparked discussions about incorporating privacy features into Bitcoin. People wanted to reactivate a Bitcoin opcode called OP_CAT, so the coin could support advanced privacy functions and other features that Zcash already provides. For privacy supporters, the implementation of Zcash could serve as an example of how to utilize other cryptocurrencies, prompting a new way of thinking about privacy protection and blockchain adoption. The Zcash rally in the cryptocurrency community has become a national symbol, and the coin’s fans are reveling in the attention it is getting. They say Zcash demonstrates that privacy coins can coexist with Bitcoin and propel the space forward. Get seen where it counts.

This comes after the Bitcoin price completed its foray into new all-time high levels, clearing $126,000 in the process. However, since then, it has been a tale of a slow decline. Most of this decline has been a result of direct selling , especially with billion-dollar whales dumping their considerable BTC holdings on the market. This push-down has driven the Bitcoin price down to a critical level, and its capacity for recovery now depends on whether it’s able to reclaim the $97,000 level. The reason for this, as the crypto analyst explains, is that it would mean that the buyers are beginning to return to the market. Thus, if the Bitcoin price reclaims the $97,000 level with momentum, then it would see a short-term bounce to put it back above $100,000. The Bears Still Have Their Positions For the bearish scenario, the crypto analyst explains that the bitcoin price would need to fail to close above $95,000. As seen over the weekend, this support level has already been weakened after the Bitcoin price breakdown and could see more decline as a result. If it fails to hold up, then the current downtrend should be expected to deepen. This is because the Bitcoin price would be falling to the next levels, where there is much deeper liquidity, and these levels happen to lie below $90,000 . This support level would pull the price in until the buyers step in again. “In that situation, the next major support zone below becomes the logical draw, and the path shown on the chart, a small bounce followed by another leg down, fits well with the current momentum,” the analyst explains. Given this, the buyers would have to step in this new week to ensure another push, or the Bitcoin price risks a further crash.",Uncategorized|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-17 06:00:17

Here’s the Price Target,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-staircase-to-valhalla-unveiled-heres-the-price-target/,"Market participants often search for structure during periods of uncertainty, and some analysts point to recurring patterns as they assess future price behavior. A recent post from ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA), a well-known crypto analyst, has revealed a notable structure for XRP, placing the asset at what he views as a critical stage. His analysis features a chart labeled with consolidation phases and an Elliott Wave structure , which he described as XRP’s “Staircase To Valhalla”. His chart arranges past price behavior into repeating sequences that he believes set the stage for an upcoming expansion. $XRP Staircase To Valhalla https://t.co/UKwbAsywwb pic.twitter.com/nMYiajXjMV — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 15, 2025 The Current XRP 5-Wave Pattern The chart depicts several labeled segments that show alternating consolidation zones and strong upward movements. ChartNerd marks these areas as consecutive waves, with each expansion following a period of compressed trading. The Elliott Wave structure began forming in 2023 and hit its stride in late 2024, when Wave 3 pushed XRP up by over 500%. This rally pushed XRP to a peak of $3.39 in January 2025, and it built on this momentum, hitting an all-time high of $3.65 in July after months of consolidation. He labels two segments as consolidation. The first preceded the 500% surge, and the second is XRP’s current performance, beginning in early 2025, and now nearing its end. The end of this consolidation lines up with Wave 5 of the Elliott Wave pattern, as the analyst suggests a massive surge once this breakout occurs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Targets for XRP ChartNerd’s chart shows XRP trading at $2.25, but suggests a massive surge is imminent. Potential targets are $3, $7, and $15, with the first target matching a crucial resistance level that XRP must turn into support, and the final two levels representing new peaks for the digital asset. The analyst referenced an older post in which he highlighted a missing blow-off top, burn, providing a broader view of XRP’s trajectory. Crucially, XRP has remained above a long-term support level that previously held it down. This adds to the bullish signals for the digital asset. His updated analysis has highlighted these potential targets, suggesting the blow-off top could reach double digits. His new condensed chart signals that the key takeaway lies in the most recent segment. The context from the earlier chart supports his belief that the asset tends to follow a recurring pattern, culminating in a pronounced upward surge.

According to the information he provided, a wallet that had been dormant for about five years suffered millions of dollars in losses due to a large-scale swap transaction. According to ZachXBT, a whale holding a large amount of Cardano traded 14.4 million ADA ($6.9 million) for 847,000 USDA, Cardano's dollar-pegged stablecoin, about two hours ago.

The decision forced Beijing to build its own supply chain, which pushed the 39‑year‑old founder of Cambricon Technologies from struggling researcher to a $23 billion force in the global AI race. The data comes from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracked how fast his net worth exploded after U.S. restrictions reshaped who gets to sell what in China. Back in 2019, Chen Tianshi was nowhere near billionaire status. His startup was only three years old, and Huawei, which made up more than 95% of Cambricon’s revenue, suddenly walked away to build its own chips. That collapse nearly wiped the company out. But when the U.S. blocked China from buying advanced processors and Beijing ordered state and private players to “buy local,” the same system that crushed him handed him a lifeline. The shift built a protected market that funneled business straight into his hands and backed his company with heavy state support. Tracking how Cambricon soaked up demand Over the past 24 months, Cambricon’s stock jumped more than 765%. Chen Tianshi owns 28% of the company, which pushed his personal fortune above $22.5 billion since January. That jump made him the third‑richest person in the world aged 40 or under, right behind Lukas Walton and Mark Mateschitz. Brokerage notes also flagged Cambricon’s new Siyuan 690 chip, even though analysts say it still trails Nvidia’s closest equivalent by a few years. The real rocket fuel arrived in August, when Beijing told local companies to stop using Nvidia’s H20 chips for government work. Cambricon’s stock and Chen Tianshi’s wealth took off instantly. The company had to put out a filing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange to cool investors down, reminding everyone that it still sits under U.S. sanctions and is dealing with a steep technology gap. The filing also shot down rumors about upcoming products that don’t exist. Shen Meng at Chanson & Co. said Cambricon’s rapid growth came from “a low starting point” and that its valuation may not hold if policy support ever softens. And Sunny Cheung at the Jamestown Foundation believes that neither Cambricon nor Huawei is close to becoming “China’s Nvidia,” pointing out that Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem takes years to copy, according to Bloomberg . Chen Tianshi has come a long way from campus labs to a national market Chen’s story is tied directly to China’s state‑run academic machine. Born in 1985 in Nanchang to a father who worked as an electrical engineer and a mother who taught history, he was pushed into a gifted program early. According to his Wikipedia page, Chen studied at the University of Science and Technology of China, earned his PhD in 2010, and joined the Chinese Academy of Sciences with his older brother Chen Yunji. The pair gained attention in 2014 with academic work on their DianNao accelerator. By 2015, they built their first deep‑learning chip. They named it Cambricon after the Cambrian explosion. In 2016, the project became a company with backing from the academy. The big commercial win came in 2017, when Huawei used Cambricon chips to boost the camera and gaming features of the Mate 10. That deal ended in 2019, and Cambricon moved from consumer devices to cloud and edge hardware. Cambricon listed on Shanghai’s Sci‑Tech Innovation Board in 2020, and it stayed unprofitable until the final quarter of 2024, when it finally posted its first positive earnings. The U.S. then placed the firm on the entity list in 2022, limiting access to top American tech. Then Washington tightened restrictions again last year by banning Nvidia and AMD from selling high‑performance AI chips to China, which created a supply vacuum, so Beijing responded by ordering companies to buy domestic hardware. Revenue surged by 500% over the past year. Chen Tianshi still competes with Huawei and a new wave of Chinese chip startups, but the market is large enough to keep all of them busy… well at least for now. Shuman Ghosemajumder at Reken said Cambricon’s rise is tied to the global scramble for AI hardware and warned that volatility is part of the game.

The cryptocurrency market faced intense selling pressure amid broader risk-off sentiment across global equities. The digital asset experienced widespread liquidations totaling $617.45 million within 24 hours. Long positions accounted for $394.50 million of the losses, while short positions contributed $222.95 million. Bitcoin alone saw $242.19 million in liquidations, with Ethereum following at $169.06 million. The largest single liquidation event wiped out a $30.60 million Bitcoin position on Hyperliquid. Market pricing for a December Federal Reserve rate cut dropped to approximately 40% from over 60% just one week earlier, prompting investors to shift capital away from high-risk assets. This dramatic reversal in expectations sent ripples through cryptocurrency markets and traditional financial instruments alike. At press time, Bitcoin was trading near $95,081, representing a 0.85% decline over the last 24 hours. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell to $3.31 trillion, down 0.9% from previous levels. Ethereum declined by 0.7% to $3,183, while XRP showed relative strength with a 0.3% gain to $2.24. Global Markets Echo Risk-Off Sentiment Traditional markets set a bearish tone heading into the week. Wall Street futures weakened following Friday's substantial losses, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 1.65%, the S&P 500 fall 1.66%, and the Nasdaq Composite decline 2.29%. Technology stocks bore the brunt of selling pressure as investors reassessed valuations built on artificial intelligence optimism. European markets opened defensively. Germany's DAX fell 1.39%, while the FTSE 100 slipped 1.05%. France's CAC 40 eased 0.11%, and the Euro Stoxx 50 lost 0.83%. Asian markets followed with mixed but predominantly negative openings. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1.77%, Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 1.35%, and New Zealand's benchmark declined 1.58%. Shanghai edged down a modest 0.16%. The coordinated weakness across global markets reflected growing concerns about the trajectories of monetary policy. Traders shifted toward cash positions as expectations of a rate cut evaporated. The shift marked a significant change from recent months when easier policy hopes had supported risk assets. Federal Reserve Policy Uncertainty Weighs Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent statement that a December rate cut is ”not a foregone conclusion, far from it” has resonated with market participants. Several Federal Open Market Committee members expressed caution about additional easing given persistent inflation concerns and limited economic data due to government disruptions. Boston Fed President Susan Collins indicated hesitancy toward further rate cuts without evidence of notable labor market deterioration, particularly given limited inflation information. The uncertainty has created headwinds for speculative assets like cryptocurrencies that benefit from looser monetary conditions. Bitcoin had previously rallied on expectations of accommodative policy. The reversal in rate expectations forced traders to unwind positions rapidly.

ZachXBT, a blockchain investigator, made this mistake public after reporting it on Sunday, November 16. The investigator observed 14.4 million Cardano (ADA) tokens, worth $6.9 million, being swapped for 847,695 US dollar Anzens (USDA) stablecoins. This event resulted in a loss of over $6 million in Cardano (ADA). A Cardano investor’s move creates tension in the blockchain ecosystem Reports from ZachXBT indicated that the Cardano user, identified by the wallet address “addr…4×534,” appeared to have conducted a test transaction of 4,437 ADA for a US dollar stablecoin labeled USDA at approximately 4:06 PM UTC on Sunday. This occurred 33 seconds before the substantial USDA swap . Interestingly, sources noted that the Cardano wallet had remained inactive since September 13, 2020, prior to the mistake occurring. This out-of-the-ordinary transaction has drawn attention to crypto investors about the importance of using liquid crypto pools when carrying out swaps, particularly with substantial orders that can significantly impact pricing, to avoid poor execution rates. Meanwhile, recent data from CoinGecko indicated that this transaction appeared to increase ANZA’s price to approximately $1.26 before it declined back to $1.04. Still, it is unclear whether the Cardano user intentionally planned to purchase this lesser-known stablecoin , which has a market cap of $10.6 million. On the other hand, Blockchain records attempted to address these concerns, indicating that this crypto investor did not have a record of owning USDA stablecoins before this incident. Several analysts weighed in on the situation. According to them, crypto-related mistakes such as this scenario can significantly impact the markets. The analysts also noted that this is not the first time such an error has occurred this year. They cited the incident in October, in which Paxos , a regulated blockchain infrastructure firm that issues stablecoins, accidentally created 300 trillion PayPal USD (PYUSD) and subsequently burned them approximately 22 minutes later, confusing many crypto users. Paxos mistakenly mints and burns 300 trillion PayPal USD Regarding the October incident, Omer Goldberg, the founder of Chaos Labs, shared an X post stating that Aave would temporarily stop trades for PayPal USD. Sources with knowledge of the situation noted that this act, which involved both the minting and burning of the stablecoin, was a significant event and occurred unexpectedly. The scenario was made public after data from the Ethereum blockchain showed that Paxos minted around 300 trillion US dollar-pegged stablecoin at 7:12 pm UTC. Afterwards, the company burned the total amount by transferring it to an inaccessible wallet. This incident took place 22 minutes after the minting process. The error briefly caused concerns across the digital asset space as some community members called it one of the most visible fat-finger moments in blockchain history. To explain the situation, Paxos decided to share an X post highlighting that they had unintentionally minted excess PYUSD during an internal transfer. The company described the occasion as an internal technical mistake. “There has been no security breach. Customer funds are secure, and we have fixed the issue,” Paxos added. After this news, although PYUSD maintained its value tied to the dollar, its price slipped slightly by around 0.5%, according to data from Nansen. Data from the International Monetary Fund, however, noted that the $300 trillion minted represents an amount that is more than twice the global GDP and more than 125 times the number of U.S. dollars in circulation.

Recent data reveals that shorts hold a slight edge in BTC perpetuals across major exchanges, signaling cautious trader sentiment. This development could hint at upcoming price volatility, making it crucial for investors to stay informed. What Do BTC Perpetuals Tell Us About Market Sentiment? BTC perpetuals are futures contracts without an expiration date, popular for leveraged trading. The long/short ratios provide real-time insights into trader positioning. Currently, the overall market shows 47.97% long positions versus 52.03% short, indicating a bearish tilt among traders on top platforms. Breaking Down the Exchange-Specific BTC Perpetuals Data Let’s examine the numbers from the three largest exchanges by open interest. Each platform shows unique patterns in BTC perpetuals activity: Binance : 47.9% long / 52.1% short Bybit : 48.79% long / 51.21% short Gate.io : 49.96% long / 50.04% short Interestingly, Gate.io shows nearly balanced positioning, while Binance and Bybit display clearer short dominance in their BTC perpetuals markets. Why Should Traders Monitor BTC Perpetuals Ratios? Tracking BTC perpetuals ratios helps anticipate price movements. When shorts dominate, it often precedes downward pressure, but can also signal potential short squeezes. Understanding these dynamics in BTC perpetuals allows traders to make better-informed decisions and manage risk effectively. Actionable Insights From Current BTC Perpetuals Data The slight short advantage in BTC perpetuals suggests traders are hedging or expecting minor corrections. However, the narrow margins indicate uncertainty rather than strong conviction. Consider these points when analyzing BTC perpetuals data: Monitor for sudden ratio shifts that could signal trend changes Combine with other indicators for confirmation Remember that extreme positions often reverse quickly What’s Next for BTC Perpetuals Markets? As the crypto market evolves, BTC perpetuals will continue reflecting trader sentiment. The current slight short bias might change rapidly with news or price movements. Staying updated on BTC perpetuals data helps navigate these volatile waters successfully. In summary, the marginal short advantage in BTC perpetuals across major exchanges highlights cautious market sentiment. While not extreme, this positioning warrants attention as it could influence near-term Bitcoin price action. Always conduct thorough research before making trading decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What are BTC perpetuals? BTC perpetuals are futures contracts that don’t expire, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely while paying funding rates. Why do long/short ratios matter? These ratios indicate market sentiment – high long ratios suggest bullishness, while high short ratios show bearish expectations. Which exchange has the most balanced BTC perpetuals? Gate.io shows the most balanced ratio at nearly 50/50, while Binance and Bybit have clearer short advantages. How often should I check these ratios? Daily monitoring helps spot trends, but significant changes often happen around major news events or price movements. Can these ratios predict price accurately? While helpful for sentiment analysis, they shouldn’t be used alone – combine with technical and fundamental analysis. What’s a dangerous long/short ratio? Extreme ratios above 70/30 either way often precede sharp reversals as positions become overcrowded. Found this analysis of BTC perpetuals helpful?

On the surface, the reasoning behind the latest crash is quite slim, as there aren’t any significant catalysts that can be blamed. However, the analysts from the Kobeissi Letter believe there’s a more profound and fundamental shift in the cryptocurrency market, and explained why a new type of ‘structural’ bear cycle has begun. Why Such Big Moves? Before we head into the explanation of this sort of bear market, first, we need to examine the analysts’ culprits for the overall market calamity. After all, BTC has lost 25% since its early October all-time high, and now sits at six-month lows of $95,000 after the Sunday dip. As they admitted, this decline is particularly “strange for one key reason.” “There haven’t been many material bearish developments on the fundamental side of crypto. Just days ago, President Trump said America being “number one in crypto” is his top priority.” Additionally, inflation in the US is gradually declining, the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates again, and Washington and Beijing are close to a trade deal. As a result, the landscape now appears a lot more bullish than it did in April, for example. Consequently, the analysts categorized the current downturn as “structural and mechanical.” They noted that it began with institutional outflows in mid-to-late October, which is evident from the ETF numbers. In the first week of November, crypto-focused funds experienced $1.2 billion in net outflows, marking a record. However, where it gets particularly tricky in crypto is the excessive levels of leverage used during these institutional outflows, the Kobeissi Letter explained. As a result, when these sudden downswings happen in crypto, liquidations surge. As seen on October 10th, the -$19.2 billion liquidation spree led to the first ever $20,000 BTC daily candlestick. Excessive levels of leverage have resulted in a seemingly hypersensitive market. pic.twitter.com/oJtnYQNQTm — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) November 16, 2025 What’s Next? The post added that 3 out of the last 16 trading days have seen liquidations skyrocketing to over $1 billion. Moreover, the analysts noted that daily liquidations of more than $500 million have become an everyday occurrence. As such, they indicated that when this is combined with ‘thin’ volume, the price swings in either direction become violent. This also explains the massive shift in market sentiment. As reported over the weekend, the Fear and Greed Index has gone to its lowest levels since February, even though BTC is up by 25% since the April bottom. “Leverage is amplifying shifts in investor sentiment,” the analysts said. Nevertheless, the team concluded that the fundamental value of the cryptocurrency market has only improved. They predicted that the bottom is near, as these wrinkles “will work their way out.” Therefore, when you really zoom out, it seems that crypto is in a “structural” bear market. The fundamental value of crypto has only improved, but market dynamics are shifting. As with any efficient market, the wrinkles will work their way out. We think the bottom is near. pic.twitter.com/ra2QaFwoHy — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) November 16, 2025 The post Bitcoin Just Entered ‘Structural’ Bear Market: What Does It Mean and What’s Next? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Top News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Bear Market,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-17 06:43:58

Key Takeaways: Tom Lee says Ether may be entering a “Supercycle” similar to Bitcoin’s 100x rally that began in 2017. ETH is approaching the average cost basis of long-term holders, a level historically linked to strong accumulation. Long-term wallets now hold 27 million ETH, signaling growing conviction despite the recent market pullback. In an X post on Sunday , Lee said the current Ether market resembles Bitcoin’s setup eight years ago, a period marked by deep volatility that ultimately preceded one of the strongest bull cycles in crypto history. Tom Lee: Bitcoin’s 100x Run Began With a $1,000 Call in 2017 Lee noted that his firm first recommended Bitcoin to Fundstrat clients in 2017 when BTC traded near $1,000. Since then, Bitcoin suffered several drawdowns of up to 75%, yet still surged more than 100-fold from that initial call. “We believe ETH is embarking on that same Supercycle,” he wrote, arguing that Ether’s recent weakness reflects doubt, not deterioration. “To have gained from that 100x Supercycle, one had to stomach existential moments to HODL.” ETH has trailed Bitcoin for much of 2025, even as the market reached new record highs. Ether notched its all-time high of $4,946 in August, while Bitcoin topped out above $126,000 in October. Both assets have since pulled back sharply, with BTC down 25% from its peak and ETH sliding more than 35%. Lee framed the retreat as part of the “discounting of a massive future.” Bitcoin is a volatile asset. We first recommended Bitcoin to Fundstrat clients in 2017 (1%-2% allocation) – Bitcoin 2017 ~$1,000 Since then (past 8.5 years), $BTC : – 6 declines > -50% – 3 declines > – 75% 2025, Bitcoin 100x from our first recommendation TAKEAWAY: To have… pic.twitter.com/xtIRGLdnWM — Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) November 16, 2025 On-chain data suggests Ether may be nearing a critical level for long-term holders. CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci said ETH’s current price , around $3,150, sits just $200 above the average cost basis of long-term accumulators, whom he described as investors who have been “patiently stacking.” Ether has only fallen below this level once this year, during April’s market shock triggered by President Donald Trump’s global tariff rollout. According to Kesmeci, long-term conviction in Ether is stronger than ever. Roughly 17 million ETH has moved into accumulation addresses in 2025, pushing the total balance held by long-term wallets to 27 million ETH, up from 10 million at the start of the year. If ETH slips to the $2,900 level, he said, history suggests it would represent “one of the strongest long-term accumulation opportunities.” Ether briefly touched a 24-hour low of $3,023 but has since steadied, trading flat around $3,185. Ethereum Whales Accumulate 7.6M ETH as Market Enters Compression Phase As repored, Ethereum whales have significantly increased their exposure as ETH hovers near $3,000, a trend analysts say has historically preceded major market reversals. CryptoQuant data shows wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have accumulated 7.6 million ETH since April, a 52% jump, while smaller holders continue to trim their balances. The divergence suggests institutional-sized players are positioning for a potential rebound, even as retail remains cautious. Analysts also point to repeated spikes in Ethereum’s spot trading volume since early November, a pattern commonly seen in late-stage compression phases before large price moves. Meanwhile, Ethereum network fees have plunged to some of their lowest levels in years, with gas prices dropping to 0.067 Gwei last week as onchain activity slowed following October’s market-wide crash. During the 2021 bull run, transaction costs on Ethereum’s base layer frequently exceeded $100–$150, driving users toward cheaper alternatives and layer-2 solutions. However, since the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which optimized gas fees for layer-2 rollups, Ethereum’s fee revenue has collapsed by 99%, according to Token Terminal.

New York Times: $28 Billion in Illicit Funds Flowed into Global Stock Exchanges According to the report, leading exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Bybit have become major flow points for funds generated by North Korean hacker groups, Southeast Asian-based fraud networks, and globally widespread “pig butchering” investment scams. The investigation revealed that Binance continued to accept transactions from risky entities despite previously pleading guilty to money laundering and sanctions violations and paying a $4.3 billion fine. It was also reported that over $400 million in inflows into the exchange came from high-risk entities, particularly Cambodia-based Huione. The report also cited US President Donald Trump’s signing of a $2 billion cooperation agreement with Binance and his pardon of the company’s founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), as developments that raised concerns that regulations could be loosened. The NYT investigation reveals that the crypto market remains significantly vulnerable to illicit fund flows and that regulatory pressure is likely to intensify in the coming period. Industry experts warn that such findings could pave the way for stricter global oversight. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency market holds its breath as Bitcoin teeters on the edge of critical support levels, with all eyes turning to this week’s Federal Reserve minutes. The Bitcoin price action has turned increasingly bearish, creating tension among investors who fear a potential drop below the psychological $90,000 mark. Why Is Bitcoin Price Under Pressure? Multiple factors are converging to create headwinds for the Bitcoin price. First, U.S. tech stocks have experienced a sharp decline, dragging crypto markets lower. Second, institutional buying through crypto ETFs has slowed significantly for two consecutive weeks. Moreover, selling pressure from long-term holders is increasing while retail investor liquidity remains weak. The situation creates a perfect storm for Bitcoin price volatility. When institutional flows weaken and long-term holders begin selling, it typically signals potential trouble ahead for any asset’s price stability. Critical Bitcoin Price Levels to Watch According to derivatives firm Bitunix, several key technical levels will determine the Bitcoin price direction in coming days: Short-term support: $93,000 – $95,000 range Breakdown target: $89,600 if support fails Resistance levels: $100,200 and $107,300 The Bitcoin price currently tests these crucial support zones. A break below could trigger further selling as stop-loss orders activate and sentiment turns more negative. How FOMC Minutes Could Impact Bitcoin Price The Federal Open Market Committee minutes release represents the week’s most significant event for the Bitcoin price. Nick Ruck, director of research at LVRG, emphasizes that whether the $92,000 level holds depends largely on a dovish stance being confirmed in the upcoming Fed communications. Market participants closely watch for any hints about future interest rate policy. Higher rates typically pressure risk assets like Bitcoin, while dovish signals could provide the catalyst for a Bitcoin price recovery. What This Means for Your Bitcoin Strategy Given the current Bitcoin price uncertainty, consider these actionable insights: Monitor the $93,000-$95,000 support zone closely Watch for institutional flow data in crypto ETFs Prepare for increased volatility around FOMC release Consider dollar-cost averaging if adding positions The Bitcoin price often finds direction after major economic events like FOMC minutes. However, remember that short-term price movements don’t necessarily reflect Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Navigating Bitcoin Price Volatility While the current Bitcoin price action appears concerning, experienced investors understand that volatility comes with cryptocurrency investing. The key is maintaining perspective and not making emotional decisions based on short-term price movements. The Bitcoin price has weathered numerous storms throughout its history. Each correction eventually gave way to new highs as the technology’s fundamental value proposition remained intact. Final Thoughts on Bitcoin Price Outlook The Bitcoin price stands at a critical juncture. The combination of technical breakdown risks and fundamental headwinds creates a challenging environment. However, the upcoming FOMC minutes could provide the clarity markets need to establish a new direction. Whether you’re a long-term holder or active trader, understanding these Bitcoin price dynamics helps you make informed decisions rather than reacting to fear or greed. Frequently Asked Questions What is causing the Bitcoin price decline? The Bitcoin price faces pressure from multiple factors including declining tech stocks, slowing institutional ETF inflows, increased selling from long-term holders, and weak retail participation. How low could Bitcoin price drop? If Bitcoin breaks below the $93,000-$95,000 support zone, analysts project a potential drop to $89,600. However, this depends on market sentiment and upcoming economic data. When are the FOMC minutes released? The Federal Reserve releases FOMC minutes approximately three weeks after each policy meeting. Traders watch these closely for clues about future interest rate policy. Could Bitcoin price recover quickly? Yes, the Bitcoin price has historically shown rapid recovery capability. A dovish Fed stance or positive institutional flow data could trigger a swift rebound toward resistance levels. Should I buy Bitcoin during this dip? This depends on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Some investors see price dips as buying opportunities, while others prefer waiting for clearer technical signals. How does ETF flow affect Bitcoin price? Institutional flows through Bitcoin ETFs significantly impact price. Net inflows typically support higher prices, while outflows or slowing inflows create selling pressure. Found this Bitcoin price analysis helpful?

Binance just revealed an astonishing $9 billion stablecoin inflow over the past month, creating waves of excitement among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This massive movement of digital assets signals something significant brewing in the crypto space. What Does This Massive Stablecoin Inflow Mean? The recent $9 billion stablecoin inflow represents one of the largest capital movements we’ve seen since the 2021 bull market peak. According to CryptoOnChain, a respected CryptoQuant contributor, this substantial stablecoin inflow indicates that investors are positioning themselves for potential market moves. The analyst emphasized on X that this creates strong buying pressure for both Bitcoin and major altcoins. When we examine this stablecoin inflow pattern, several key insights emerge: Accumulation phase – Investors are building positions Market confidence – Large capital movements signal trust Buying pressure – Ready capital waiting for entry points Historical parallels – Similar patterns preceded previous bull runs Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Stablecoin Movements? Stablecoins serve as the lifeblood of cryptocurrency trading, acting as digital dollars that investors use to quickly enter and exit positions. Therefore, when we see such a substantial stablecoin inflow into major exchanges like Binance, it typically indicates that traders are preparing to make significant moves. This massive stablecoin inflow essentially represents ‘dry powder’ waiting to be deployed into various cryptocurrencies. The current stablecoin inflow situation mirrors what we witnessed during previous market cycles. However, the scale and timing make this particular movement especially noteworthy. Market analysts suggest that this level of stablecoin accumulation often precedes substantial price movements across multiple cryptocurrency assets. How Does This Impact Bitcoin and Altcoin Prices? The relationship between stablecoin inflows and cryptocurrency prices is well-documented in market analysis. When exchanges experience significant stablecoin inflow, it creates immediate buying pressure that can drive prices upward. This recent $9 billion stablecoin inflow positions Binance as a potential catalyst for the next major market movement. Consider these market dynamics: Bitcoin dominance – Large stablecoin reserves often benefit BTC first Altcoin rotation – Excess capital typically flows into alternative coins Market liquidity – Increased trading volume improves market efficiency Price discovery – More capital leads to better price determination What Can We Learn From Historical Stablecoin Inflow Patterns? Historical data reveals that substantial stablecoin inflow events often serve as reliable indicators of upcoming market trends. The current stablecoin inflow magnitude suggests we might be approaching a similar scenario to the 2021 bull market conditions. However, market participants should remember that while history often rhymes, it rarely repeats exactly. This stablecoin inflow represents more than just numbers – it reflects market psychology and investor sentiment. The fact that this massive capital movement is occurring now suggests that sophisticated investors see potential opportunities in the current market environment. Conclusion: Riding the Wave of Capital Inflows The $9 billion stablecoin inflow into Binance represents a powerful vote of confidence in the cryptocurrency markets. This substantial capital movement creates a foundation for potential growth across Bitcoin and major altcoins. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the historical correlation between stablecoin inflows and market movements provides valuable context for current conditions. The market now watches closely to see how this massive stablecoin inflow will translate into actual buying activity and price movements across the cryptocurrency landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What is a stablecoin inflow? A stablecoin inflow occurs when investors transfer stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) into cryptocurrency exchanges, typically indicating preparation for future trading activity. Why does stablecoin inflow matter? Stablecoin inflow represents ready capital that can quickly enter cryptocurrency markets, creating immediate buying pressure and potentially driving prices upward. How does this compare to previous bull markets? The current $9 billion stablecoin inflow approaches levels seen during the 2021 bull market peak, suggesting similar market conditions might be developing. Should I invest because of this stablecoin inflow? While substantial stablecoin inflow can indicate market optimism, investment decisions should consider multiple factors including risk tolerance and financial goals. Which cryptocurrencies benefit most from stablecoin inflows? Bitcoin typically sees immediate benefits, followed by major altcoins as capital rotates through different market segments. How long do stablecoin inflow effects last? Market impacts can vary from immediate price movements to longer-term trends, depending on how quickly the capital gets deployed into actual purchases.

These declines have left the leading meme coin by market cap in the red, pushing it back down to levels not seen since 2023. As a result, the Dogecoin price is now in a precarious position where it needs to make a major move or DOGE investors risk more decline as the altcoin struggles to find support. Next Trajectory For The Dogecoin Price Bitguru, in an analysis on X, outlined where the Dogecoin price is and what could determine the next move for the cryptocurrency. This all comes back to a critical level that would send the price in either direction, making it the point where both bulls and bears are now fighting for dominance, and this level is at 0.166. Related Reading: Analyst Breaks Down Why There Can’t Be 7 Million XRP Holders As the crypto analyst explains, the Dogecoin price has been in a clear downtrend already, and there has been no indication that it will actually pull out of this soon. If anything, sideways movement has been the order of the day, and catalysts that could trigger another rally have not been forthcoming. It so happens that the Dogecoin price ended up being rejected at $0.1823, which has been established to be a major high for the digital asset. Hence, it puts the sellers in control once again as the price moves toward $0.166. This $0.166 level lies above the major support at $0.16, meaning that it is imperative for bulls to actually reclaim and hold it. Another problem that the digital asset is facing at this point is that it continues to form lower highs. Naturally, this is a bearish development for any cryptocurrency as it means that buyers are weakening and sellers are gaining control in the market. If these lower highs continue, then it could see further decline for the Dogecoin price as opposed to a possible recovery. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Falling Because Of Strategy Sell-Offs? On-Chain Data Fuels Debate The Dogecoin price did try to rebound over the weekend, but was ultimately pushed back down as the Bitcoin price struggled at $95,000. Now, reclaiming the $0.166 is the next major task for bulls if the meme coin is to continue its ascent. In the event of a failure to reclaim $0.166 with momentum, then the Dogecoin price could correct lower. As the decline deepens, the next major support level lies firmly at $0.15, where there could be a wave of buying to trigger a short-term rise.

When asked about a potential XRP ETF shortly after the launch of ETH ETFs, Fink responded with caution, stating, “I can’t. And you don’t want me to.” Pumpius interpreted Fink’s evasiveness as evidence that BlackRock may have been restricted by a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) tied to Ripple or other stakeholders. Ripple is well known for having more than 1,700 NDAs , and commentary around the clip suggests that BlackRock’s refusal to speak on XRP ETFs at that time may have stemmed from such legal obligations. BLACKROCK IS BOUND BY XRP NDAs! “I CAN’T” His face says it all! pic.twitter.com/CxYHUty5qf — Pumpius (@pumpius) November 15, 2025 The XRP ETF Race In the years since the interview, the situation has changed considerably. XRP-based ETFs have now entered the market. Notably, the Rex Osprey ETF and the Canary Capital ETF have recently launched, with Canary’s XRPC ETF experiencing a record-breaking debut . Furthermore, heavyweight institutions, such as Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, CoinShares, and others, are reportedly preparing to introduce their own XRP ETFs in the coming weeks, potentially opening the floodgates for institutional participation in the XRP market. BlackRock’s Position Today BlackRock has not publicly acknowledged involvement in any XRP ETF initiative, and the company has made no formal statements confirming that it is preparing such a product. Yet, the resurfaced video has sparked speculation. A continued NDA could have kept BlackRock silent even as other firms moved ahead, as Fink’s tone in the interview could reflect ongoing internal deliberations about entering the XRP ETF space. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is BlackRock Under an NDA? Ripple’s extensive use of NDAs reinforces the idea. If such a contract bound BlackRock, it might explain Fink’s refusal to elaborate during the interview. He refused to comment despite pressure from the interviewer, and as XRP ETF competition grows BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, and the XRP army has been vocal about its desire to see the company join the XRP ETF race . The resurfaced interview raises new questions about BlackRock’s strategy. Will the firm eventually join the growing cohort of providers in the XRP ETF market? If legal barriers once prevented public acknowledgment, many market participants now wonder whether these barriers still exist as other major institutions prepare for their ETF launches .

According to SoSoValue data , BlackRock’s ETF IBIT bled $532.41 million, recording the largest net outflow last week. Currently, the cumulative net inflow of IBIT funds has reached $63.79 billion. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) logged a net weekly outflow of nearly $290 million, ending November 14. Meanwhile, the fund’s total historical net inflow touched $63.79 billion.

These tokens mirror airline miles or in-game currencies, enabling loyalty and activity without speculative volatility. a16z notes that arcade tokens aren’t necessary for speculative projects or layer-1 networks with established tokens. In a report published Thursday , researchers at the venture capital firm argued that these tokens, designed to function more like airline miles or credit-card points than speculative assets, could become a foundational tool for scaling digital economies. Arcade Tokens Offer Stable, Spendable Fuel for Digital Economies Arcade tokens hold relatively stable value within a specific software or product ecosystem and are meant to be spent, not hoarded. They give users access to functions or rewards inside a network, helping projects grow user activity without exposing them to the volatility associated with most cryptoassets. “Just as stablecoins unlock new forms of commerce, and network tokens enable decentralized value-sharing and governance, arcade tokens can power digital economies at scale,” wrote a16z researcher Scott Duke Kominers, CTO Eddy Lazzarin and others. One example cited in the report is Blackbird, a hospitality-tech startup that launched a Web3 payments platform for restaurants in 2024. Its FLY token acts as a reward asset: customers earn it through spending and can redeem it at participating restaurants. The redemption process runs on a purpose-built blockchain layer, while a separate network token ensures security and incentives among service providers. a16z argued that this split model, using a network token for infrastructure and an arcade token for user-facing activity, mirrors traditional reward systems that drive loyalty programs. More on what is — and isn’t — an arcade token pic.twitter.com/FRqkRSNUlX — a16z crypto (@a16zcrypto) November 16, 2025 Airline miles and in-game currencies were highlighted as analogues that encourage repeat engagement without giving holders ownership stakes. Crucially, arcade tokens have “programmatically bounded” value, preventing extreme price swings. The report also pointed to broader opportunities. For “spend-centric economies” or applications that connect to real-world businesses, arcade tokens offer price stability, predictable accounting, and simpler token design. Developers can also issue new arcade tokens on demand to support growth, whether through user incentives, grants or developer subsidies, while keeping value circulating inside the ecosystem instead of leaking out. However, the firm cautioned that not every project requires them. Highly speculative environments or layer-1 blockchains with established network tokens often gain little from adding an arcade layer. a16z and DeFi Fund Urge SEC to Create Safe Harbor for Blockchain Apps As reported, the DeFi Education Fund and a16z are calling on the SEC to establish a regulatory “safe harbor” for blockchain-based applications. In an Aug. 13 blog post, a16z said both groups submitted formal proposals urging the SEC to clarify that developers of decentralized apps should not automatically be treated as brokers. Their request follows years of SEC enforcement actions and Wells notices suggesting that software interfaces enabling peer-to-peer transactions could fall under broker-dealer rules. The groups argue that the SEC should grant a “rebuttable presumption” that neutral blockchain apps are not engaged in brokerage activity unless proven otherwise. According to the proposal, forcing developers to register as brokers would impose responsibilities they never agreed to, such as taking custody of user assets or acting as intermediaries, which would undermine blockchain’s core design and introduce new risks to users.

His comment came after months of internal pressure from lawmakers who want stronger moves against nations buying Russian energy. He added another line before leaving Florida, saying, “The Republicans are putting in legislation that is very tough sanctioning, etcetera, on any country doing business with Russia.” That statement showed that he knows who is pushing the bill, where it is coming from, when it started gaining speed, why it exists, and which source delivered the quote. The people behind the idea include Senator Lindsey Graham, who has pushed the measure for years, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said back in October he was ready to bring the bill to a vote but did not want to commit to a deadline. Tariffs hit nations buying Russian oil The legislation would give Trump the power to impose tariffs of up to 500% on imports from nations that keep buying Russian oil and do not help Ukraine. The focus is clear: China and India, who both buy large volumes of Russian crude. He also said, “We may add Iran to that,” without giving details on where he got that information or when that call would be made. Lawmakers from both parties have pushed for new steps to hurt Russia’s economy as the war passes the four‑year mark. For months, Trump held back on supporting this plan because he wanted to push Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy toward peace talks. He even hosted Putin at a summit in Alaska, but the Russian leader has not eased his assault. Ukraine is striking more Russian energy sites, but Russia has increased its own attacks and is trying to take the rail hub of Pokrovsk. Ukraine said it hit Rosneft PJSC’s Novokuybyshevsk refinery in the Samara region, more than 1,300 kilometers northeast of Kyiv, and reported explosions and fire in the area. Oil flows shift as attacks hit Russia’s supply routes Russia’s Black Sea port at Novorossiysk restarted oil loading after a two‑day shutdown caused by a Ukrainian cruise‑missile strike, according to Bloomberg and LSEG. The ship‑tracking data showed two crude tankers, the Arlan and the Rodos, plus the Yanbu oil‑products carrier, were moored at the terminal on November 16. Ukraine’s General Staff said the attack in Samara was part of an effort to limit Russia’s ability to supply fuel and ammunition to its military. Russia’s seaborne crude exports dropped for a third straight week, falling to a two‑month low. Vessel‑tracking data compiled by Bloomberg showed shipments at 3.45 million barrels per day in the four weeks to November 9, down by 130,000 barrels per day compared to the earlier period ending November 2. A large amount of Russian oil is stuck on tankers because of slow discharge rates caused by U.S. sanctions. More delays may come after November 21, the deadline for receiving oil tied to sanctioned giants Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC . The Aframax tanker Ailana sat idle off Mumbai for a week before transferring its cargo to the Fortis, which first headed toward Kochi but is now going to China after India did not take the cargo. Russian crude at sea has climbed to over 350 million barrels, rising 22 million barrels, or 7%, since September, according to Bloomberg’s tanker‑tracking data. At the same time, crude available for export is increasing because Russia has boosted production by 450,000 barrels a day since March as eight OPEC+ nations ease earlier cuts. Fuel that cannot be refined due to damaged facilities is being funneled to export terminals instead.

This token has begun to emerge in the 2025 market as it gears up to make significant changes. Most investors claim that it is becoming one of the most observed new crypto projects of the year, and the initial signs are that it could grow at an astonishing rate and be high-demand at launch. Although the project is just developing, it has experienced a lot of traction in the past few months that it has been difficult to overlook. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance(MUTM) is developing a two-side lending platform that is meant to be used in the DeFi crypto market. The project is based on the Peer-2-Contract and Peer-2-Peer markets within a single ecosystem. In the Peer-2-Contract market, assets are contributed to common pools by the users. On depositing, they get one of the tokens which are the mtTokens, which are kind of ERC-20 receipt tokens but increase in value over time. Assuming that a user has deposited $1,000 U.S. dollars in the form of USDT at an estimated 5% APY, the balance of the assets held as the mtTokens will automatically increase over time as interest accrues. Peer-2-Peer is a model which will be used with borrowers that wish to do an isolated lending. Borrowers can select individual terms like type of rate and period. Loan-to-value (LTV) settings define the amount of a person who can borrow in their collateral. When a borrower is unable to sustain the collateral level required, the protocol leads to the liquidation process which protects the lenders against incurring a loss. Good Demand and Momentum Mutuum Finance has already been able to get off with an organized presale. The project has already collected $18.7M funds and has 18,000 holders, which is growing its community around the token rapidly. Out of the overall number of 4 billion tokens a total of 45.5% or 1.82 billion tokens is designated to the presale. This will provide their early participants with a big portion of supply before the protocol becomes active. The presale was initiated in early 2025 at $0.01. At phase 6, the price is shown at $0.035 implying that the price has gone up by nearly 3x compared to the initial phase. There is a fixed allocation on every stage. With rise in demand, the supply in every stage is filled faster forcing the price to the next level. Phase 6 is already exceeding 88%, which puts pressure on the remaining supply because it is limited. There is also the daily engagement system used in the presale. The 24-hour leaderboard will incentivize the best contributor with $500 in MUTM, and it brings about constant contributions and maintains the token in the greater top crypto discussion. Having an established price of launching at the discounted price of $0.06, numerous early adopters are considering the present stage as the final form of a pre-release discounted entrance to the general release. Analyst Expectations and Securities Milestones The first major milestone has already been proved by Mutuum Finance. Based on the official announcement on X , the V1 testnet will be launched in Q4 2796 on Sepolia. This prototype consists of the liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens and the liquidator bot. It will provide users with the initial opportunity to touch upon the essentials of the protocol. Another area of interest has been security. Mutuum Finance also underwent a CertiK audit where it received a 90/100 on its Token Scan. Through such developments, analysts have indicated huge upward prospects in case the platform becomes popular once it gets started. Long-Term Projection A native stablecoin is one of the largest motivations making MUTM become a palpable name in the newly emerging crypto-related discussions. This stablecoin will involve utilization of interest in borrowing markets to sustain the structure. In the case of the protocol, this is a second growth channel following the core lending system. Mutuum Finance also specified its strategies of layer-2 expansion which is relevant to scalability in the long term. The system does this by operating on various networks saving more on gas bills and increasing speed on which transactions are made hence gaining more users in the long run. According to analysts, the additions might help the token to increase its value when the ecosystem transitions to an open release. A Speedy Altcoin with Increasing Publicity Having a high amount of presale demand, a fast community growth rate, and a proven V1 launch date, Mutuum Finance is one of the most discussed new crypto projects of 2025. The dual-market lending, storage and deployment of stablecoins, and integration into Layer-2 has made MUTM one of the leading crypto competitors to be in the upcoming cycle. And an acquisition of MUTM at $0.035 has a very soon expiry with Phase 6 almost sold out.

54516412,628834,1763364613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54516412.jpeg,Cardano Founder Hoskinson Tells Crypto Traders To ‘Hold The Line’,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-hoskinson-crypto-traders-hold-the-line/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has responded to the latest market downturn with one of his most forceful defenses of crypto to date, urging investors not to panic-sell and portraying exits to fiat as a vote for a dystopian future. Speaking from Colorado in a video dated November 15, he noted that “since October, you know, we lost about a trillion dollars of value,” but stressed he has “lived through” multiple boom-and-bust cycles. Reviewing long-term Bitcoin charts, the Cardano founder mocked the recurring emotional swings of the market. “It goes up, it goes down and everybody freaks the f*** out. Paper hands. So papery,” he said, comparing himself to a calm rider on a violent amusement-park drop, reading a book while others scream. Cardano Founder Predicts 1 Billion Users By 2030 Hoskinson argued that the sell-off has not been driven by deteriorating fundamentals for crypto, but by leverage, manipulation and trader behavior. “Have any of the fundamentals changed between now and a month ago or 12 months ago about crypto? Have any of the fundamentals changed? Any?” he asked. Instead, he pointed to rising US debt , declining trust in the dollar and worsening geopolitical tensions, describing governments as “morally bankrupt, fiscally bankrupt, and destined for Armageddon.” He ridiculed those selling into dollars amid such a macro backdrop. “You paper hand sons of […] want to go exit into a currency that has nearly $40 trillion of debt,” he said, questioning whether that exit is just to “go buy a car,” “buy some real estate,” or pay down “a little credit card debt.” He called this behavior “collective Stockholm syndrome,” arguing that people are returning to institutions that systematically exploit them. “Crypto is the opt out. Crypto is the exit. Crypto is the solution,” Hoskinson said. In his view, blockchain systems provide “honest money,” verifiable votes and auditable institutions where “no one can ever change the record to their own convenience.” He claimed there are “550 million people in the cryptocurrency ecosystem” and predicted “there’s going to be a billion by 2030,” adding that “the majority of the world’s stocks and bonds and equities will be in the cryptocurrency space by 2030.” On markets, he repeated that volatility is secondary to long-term direction. “Goes down, goes up, goes down, goes up […] But it goes up because there’s people,” he said, arguing that adoption and migration of financial markets into crypto will push the asset class toward 10 trillion in value. “Trillion doesn’t even mean anything anymore. The dollar doesn’t mean anything anymore. Everything ought to be priced in crypto because it’s the only place left where there’s a semblance of objectivity and honesty.” Hoskinson extended his critique to fiat money creation, calling the existing system “a Ponzi scheme.” “The money is worthless because when they print it, they use it themselves, extract all the value, get hard assets with it, and then dump the worthless […] on you, and your wages don’t go up,” he said. In contrast, he argued, “No one can turn off your ADA. No one can turn off your Bitcoin. No one can turn off your Ether.” He framed on-chain governance and transparency as prerequisites for legitimate institutions, claiming that “no voting in the United States will ever be legitimate again until it’s on a blockchain” and “no company in the United States will ever be fully legitimate, trustworthy, and honest until it’s a DAO.” He also highlighted privacy-focused technologies such as Zcash , Monero and Cardano’s Midnight sidechain , which he described as “real privacy” and said is being designed to be “fully programmable and soon to be postquantum.” Despite describing himself as “so thoroughly done” with market panic, Hoskinson said he continues to work in crypto because he believes it is the only realistic path to preserving individual autonomy. “There’s a reason I’m still around and I haven’t retired,” he said. “I honestly still believe we can win.” For traders unnerved by red candles, his message was uncompromising: “Hold the line. Bring people in. Get crypto going. Get the markets going again.” Selling, he warned, is not a neutral act but “voting to permanently live in that world” of surveillance and control. “Don’t sign up for it. Sign up for crypto. That’s all I’m going to say.” At press time, Cardano traded at $0.49.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-17 07:30:13

The movement represents one of the largest single-day outflows in recent months. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that 121 billion SHIB exited exchanges on November 15 alone, with the pattern continuing through November 16. Technical Resistance Holds Despite Outflows Despite the significant supply reduction on exchanges, SHIB's price remains constrained by technical barriers. At the time of writing, the token trades at $0.000008995, a support zone that has held multiple tests without triggering upward breakouts. All major moving averages sit above current price levels, creating a convergent downward-sloping resistance structure. SHIB price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap The Relative Strength Index hovers around 39, indicating weak momentum without capitulation. Trading volume remains steady rather than collapsing, suggesting holders maintain positions instead of rushing toward exits. This stability in volume during a consolidation phase often precedes directional moves once catalysts emerge. SHIB must reclaim $0.0000105 to challenge the first resistance cluster where moving averages converge. Beyond that level, $0.0000112 represents the next critical breakpoint. Neither threshold has been tested during the current outflow period, leaving the token in a technically bearish posture despite improving on-chain metrics. Supply Dynamics Point to Accumulation The disconnect between price action and exchange data reveals competing forces at work. Tokens leaving exchanges at accelerated rates typically reduce available supply for sellers. When this occurs without corresponding price increases, accumulation phases often develop beneath the surface. Current holder behavior supports this interpretation. Source: Tradingview Market participants removing tokens from exchanges demonstrate willingness to weather volatility rather than liquidate positions. This behavior contrasts sharply with distribution phases, where tokens flood onto exchanges ahead of selling pressure. The current pattern suggests conviction among existing holders and potential positioning for future price appreciation. Historical precedents show that sustained exchange outflows frequently precede trend reversals in cryptocurrency markets. While timing remains uncertain, the magnitude of recent withdrawals exceeds typical baseline activity. If outflows continue at current rates while price maintains support, conditions for upward momentum may develop. Market Context and Future Outlook Shiba Inu remains nearly 90% below its all-time high, placing the token deep into bear market territory by traditional metrics. The broader cryptocurrency market has experienced volatility throughout November, creating unstable sentiment conditions. Against this backdrop, the exchange outflow data provides a counterpoint to the bearish price structure. The Shiba Inu development team recently teased new initiatives , though specific details remain undisclosed. Such announcements can catalyze renewed interest when combined with improving supply dynamics. However, concrete developments rather than speculation typically drive sustained rallies in the current market environment. Trading activity shows holders adopting wait-and-see positions rather than aggressive accumulation or distribution. This neutral stance allows for rapid shifts once technical levels break in either direction. The key support zone between $0.0000090 and $0.0000093 must hold for bullish scenarios to remain viable.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 07:30:34

Our ENA price prediction expects a maximum of $0.82 in 2025. In 2031, we expect the ENA price to achieve $7.38. Ethena is a stablecoin project built on Ethereum that offers USDe, a fully decentralized coin pegged to the US dollar. Unlike stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, USDe doesn’t depend on banks or centralized companies for reserves. Instead, it uses a cash-and-carry trading strategy to keep its value equal to the dollar. For investors who prioritize decentralization, USDe could be an appealing choice — especially since it currently offers staking rewards above 9%. However, critics caution that since the project is still new, it’s uncertain whether USDe’s high yields and dollar peg can remain stable during a market downturn. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Ethena price prediction from 2025-2031. In this article, we’ll find out “Will ENA reach $10?” and explore the factors behind ENA price prediction.

Currently, the ENA price is preparing for a bearish rally. Ethena price analysis 1-day chart: ENA price triggers bearish momentum Analyzing the daily price chart of ENA tokens, ENA witnessed a bearish correction after sellers pushed the price toward support lines. Sellers are now aiming for a hold below the immediate Fib channels around $0.27. The 24-hour volume surged to $52.6 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. Ethena’s price is currently trading at $0.276, which has dropped by over 0.6% in the last 24 hours. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and hovers within the neutral level at 30.7, showing that bears control price momentum slightly. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. ENA/USDT 4-hour price chart: Buyers aim big above EMA levels The 4-hour ENA price chart suggests that ENA experienced a bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, buyers aim for a strong rebound above the EMA20 trend line. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.08, suggesting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost downward correction.

ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, ENA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2549, resulting in a correction to $0.2087. Is ENA a good investment? Whether ENA is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. Ethena has been ranked among the 100 cryptocurrencies. Still, there are questions about its demand, given its similarity to algorithmic stablecoins — a concept that lost trust after LUNA’s collapse in 2022. Even so, Ethena has shown strong performance during market surges, making it a solid project in the crypto market. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the ENA price down today? ENA’s price gained selling pressure around recent highs, resulting in a minor downward push. This created a decline toward $0.276. Will Ethena price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.3 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will ENA reach $10? ENA price might reach the $10 mark in 2032 if buying demand surges and ENA attracts altcoin investors. Will ENA reach $100? The $100 mark is a distant dream for ENA. This price level is achievable in the long run if ENA continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Ethena a good long-term investment? ENA has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on ENA Terminal Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) incubated by Ethena Labs, has attracted more than $262 million in total value locked (TVL) ahead of its upcoming launch.

ENA historical price sentiment ENA Price History: Coinmarketcap Ethena’s price history from mid-2024 to late 2025 shows a period of intense volatility marked by sharp fluctuations in both price and market capitalization. In early 2024, Ethena traded strongly, reaching highs around $1.20 in April, supported by high trading volumes exceeding $8 billion. However, by mid-2024, the token began to decline steadily, closing near $0.38 by July as investor sentiment weakened and market activity cooled. The latter half of 2024 saw further instability. Ethena’s price dropped as low as $0.20 in September, reflecting a major correction phase in the broader crypto market. Despite these setbacks, the token demonstrated resilience, climbing back above $1.00 by December 2024. This late-year rally suggested renewed interest from traders and potential ecosystem developments. In 2025, Ethena continued to experience wide swings. The token opened the year near $1.25 but faced sustained downward pressure through the spring, dipping below $0.30 by June. A strong recovery followed in the third quarter, with prices surpassing $0.70 in August and stabilizing near $0.50 by October. Throughout this period, Ethena’s market cap ranged from $1 billion to over $5 billion. In early November, the price of ENA declined toward $0.3.",Crypto Price Predictions|ENA|Ethena,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ENA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-17 07:32:34

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/crypto-analysis-firm-matrixport-says-crypto-market-enters-deleveraging-process-here-are-the-details/,"Crypto analytics firm Matrixport has announced that the cryptocurrency market has entered a distinct deleveraging phase, with the risks of maintaining highly leveraged positions rapidly increasing. Matrixport: Crypto Market Enters Clear Deleveraging Process, Bitcoin Approaches Critical Support Level The company noted that the recent 50% drop in open interest in Ethereum futures indicates that leveraged funds are beginning to unwind significantly. This suggests a weakening of overall risk appetite and increasing selling pressure in the market. According to Matrixport, Bitcoin is currently approaching the critical $93,000 level. The company emphasized that liquidity in this price range could become more fragile in the short term, and volatility could increase. The large-scale liquidation of long futures positions, which had accumulated rapidly, particularly in the fourth quarter, helped alleviate some of the short-term pressure in the market. However, Matrixport notes that the key element the market will need to monitor from now on will be ETF positions. If the general market trend remains weak, spot Bitcoin ETFs may also be pressured to reduce their positions, which could create a new liquidity shortage in the market. While the company considers the current situation to be an important threshold for the crypto market, it emphasizes that investors should be more cautious about leverage risks. *This is not investment advice.

BTC maxis went even further along the way, which was supported by TradFi experts and regulators who categorized the cryptocurrency as a commodity, just like gold. If that’s the case, then the two should move in sync, right? Such identical moves have occurred in the past, but that hasn’t been the case since the October 10 massacre, as shown by new data from the Kobeissi Letter. Gold Link Broken The gap in performance between the two began after the massive crash mentioned above. At the time, BTC plunged from over $121,000 to $101,000 on some exchanges in the span of just hours, a move that wiped out over $19 billion in leveraged positions. Since then, the cryptocurrency’s situation has only worsened, as it dipped to a six-month low of $93,000 yesterday. In contrast, the precious metal has marked some gains and even managed to tap a new all-time high in the meantime. As such, the Kobeissi Letter determined that after more than 12 months, during which the two assets moved in high correlation as safe havens, the link had broken. Still not convinced? Take a look at the chart of Bitcoin versus Gold since the October 10th liquidation occurred. For 12+ months, Gold and Bitcoin moved with high correlation; the safe haven assets. Since early-October, Gold has outperformed Bitcoin by 25 percentage points. pic.twitter.com/cMd17JFGuL — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) November 16, 2025 The analysts believe the main reason behind BTC’s nosedive, as well as its entirely different moves compared to gold, is the amount of excessive leverage used in the crypto markets. US Tech Sector Link Grows At the same time, the Kobeissi Letter noted another growing positive correlation with a different asset class – the US technology sector. The 30-day correlation between BTC and the Nasdaq 100 Index reached its highest level in over three years at 0.80. It’s also the second-highest in the past 10 years. Over the past five years, the correlation has been positive except for a brief period in 2023. Consequently, BTC’s 5-year correction to the Nasdaq has exceeded 0.5, while its relationship with cash and gold has been “essentially zero.” “Bitcoin is increasingly behaving like a leveraged tech stock,” concluded the Kobeissi Letter.

Therefore, this development could mark a significant milestone in bridging traditional financial systems with blockchain-based payment networks. Ripple’s ILP, a protocol designed for seamless, cross-ledger payments, enables instant transfers across different payment networks without relying on intermediaries. By connecting traditional financial rails like VISA to ILP, financial institutions could achieve faster, more efficient, and cost-effective transaction processing. The integration promises to reduce the friction and delays that often plague cross-border payments, which currently rely on legacy systems such as SWIFT. The report indicates that VISA could leverage Ripple’s Interledger Protocol to enable near-instant, transparent payments across banks, digital wallets, and financial networks, offering faster fund access, lower fees, and a seamless payment experience for businesses and consumers. Notably, Ripple’s Interledger Protocol is built for seamless interoperability, enabling real-time connections across diverse ledgers. This positions VISA to modernize its payment infrastructure while maintaining regulatory compliance and operational reliability, bridging traditional finance and digital assets. Beyond speed and efficiency, integrating Ripple’s ILP with VISA could bridge traditional finance and blockchain, creating a seamless hybrid ecosystem. This move could drive mainstream adoption of digital currencies, positioning ILP as a key infrastructure for global payments. Therefore, the report highlights the rising convergence of traditional finance and decentralized networks. Integrating VISA transactions with Ripple’s ILP could usher in a new era of cross-border payments, delivering unmatched speed, transparency, and scalability. XRP Eyes $5–$8 as Strong Support Zone Bolsters Institutional Confidence According to prominent market analyst Crypto Patel, XRP has established a decisive support zone between $1.85 and $2, signaling a robust foundation for both retail and institutional investors. This range, Patel notes, represents a strong liquidity and accumulation base, creating a favorable environment for potential price expansion in the months ahead. XRP’s $1.85–$2 support zone is proving pivotal with the current price being $2.27. Historically, areas of high liquidity and concentrated institutional accumulation absorb selling pressure and anchor markets during volatility. As Crypto Patel notes, XRP’s consolidation here reflects strong investor confidence and positions the coin for potential structural growth. XRP continues its bullish momentum across multiple timeframes, with strong trading volumes and clear institutional accumulation signaling strategic positioning. Analyst Patel suggests that if the $1.85–$2 support holds, XRP could see a structural surge toward $5–$8, representing substantial upside potential. Therefore, XRP’s $1.85–$2 support zone is more than a floor, it signals strong institutional backing, deep liquidity, and bullish momentum. If trends hold, a structural move toward $5–$8 is well-supported by market dynamics and investor activity, reinforcing XRP’s upward trajectory. Conclusion Integrating VISA transactions with Ripple’s Interledger Protocol could transform payments, combining traditional network reliability with blockchain’s speed, transparency, and interoperability. This leap promises a faster, more efficient ecosystem and marks a major step toward a truly connected global financial landscape. On the other hand, XRP’s $1.85–$2 support zone highlights strong institutional interest and deep liquidity. With bullish momentum intact, this level not only defends current valuations but also positions XRP for a potential surge toward $5–$8.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 07:56:48

He linked XRP’s earlier valuations to simple real-world references and used these points to frame a projection that extended its long-term growth rate. His remarks set the stage for a wider discussion about the digital asset’s long-term performance and whether its previous gains can guide price expectations for 2030. What $XRP will be worth by 2030? COMMENT NOW!! pic.twitter.com/CWqe3L26C7 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 15, 2025 Rietveld’s View on Historical Movement Rietveld reviewed XRP’s price trend from 2016 to 2025 and pointed to the scale of its long-term increase. He noted that the token traded at “half of a single cent” in 2016. He also referenced its performance during the 2021 bull market, when XRP approached $2, and its position during the current cycle, which capped off at $3.65 in July . Rietveld then calculated that XRP rose about 4,380% from 2016 to 2025. According to his comparison, a repeat of this historical performance could send the price to $100.35 within roughly five years. He closed his remarks with a direct question to viewers: “Will XRP be $100 by 2030?” Community Expectations and Varying Projections Rietveld’s calculation led many community members to share their own long-range views. Some investors suggested targets ranging from $15 to $1,000 or $5,000. These estimates reflect different assumptions about adoption, market structure, regulatory developments, and overall liquidity in the digital asset sector. The range of predictions also shows how wide opinions remain regarding the token’s trajectory, especially in a market influenced by technology, regulatory policy, major institutional players, adoption, and global financial conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Assessing the Path Toward 2030 XRP’s chance of reaching $100 by 2030 depends on factors that extend beyond past growth. Now that XRP has legal clarity, its integration into payment systems and cross-border transaction platforms continues to influence long-term interest. Market cycles, liquidity conditions, and competitive pressures from other digital assets also affect price behavior. Institutions are beginning to flood the XRP market through products like the recently launched XRP ETF by Canary Capital, and their influence could help XRP reach this lofty target. While Rietveld’s video focused primarily on the mathematical extension of previous gains, these fundamental drivers could support or limit such price outcomes.

54517707,https://cryptonews.com/?p=452552,1763367127,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54517707.jpeg,ECB Warns $300B Stablecoin Market Could Trigger Global Financial Crisis,https://cryptonews.com/news/ecb-warns-300b-stablecoin-market-could-trigger-global-financial-crisis/,"A potential run on stablecoins could force the European Central Bank to reconsider its monetary policy approach, according to Dutch central bank governor Olaf Sleijpen , who warned that dollar-pegged digital tokens are rapidly approaching systemic relevance. The $300 billion stablecoin market , which has surged over 48% this year following new U.S. regulations under President Trump, now poses direct risks to European financial stability, economic growth, and inflation control that may require ECB intervention. “ If stablecoins in the US increase at the same pace as they have been increasing, they will become systemically relevant at a certain point, ” Sleijpen told the Financial Times, noting that instability in these tokens could trigger mass sell-offs of underlying assets, primarily U.S. Treasuries. While the central bank would likely deploy financial stability tools first, he acknowledged uncertainty over whether rate cuts or increases would follow, stating, “ I don’t know in which direction we would be going. “ Dutch central bank governor Olaf Sleijpen. | Source: Bloomberg Dollar-Backed Tokens Threaten European Monetary Sovereignty The explosive growth of dollar-denominated stablecoins has sparked alarm among European institutions, with officials warning that the bloc faces conditions similar to those in emerging markets, where widespread foreign currency use undermines domestic monetary policy. A senior ECB official warned this summer that dollar stablecoin dominance could hamper European policymakers’ ability to set interest rates or control money supply, while Nobel Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole cautioned that token failures could force governments into multibillion-dollar bailouts. These concerns intensified after the U.S. enacted the GENIUS Act in July , establishing federal oversight for stablecoin issuers and spurring rapid market expansion. DefiLama data shows euro-pegged stablecoins remain marginal at under $549 million in circulation, representing just 0.18% of the global market compared to dollar tokens’ 99.58% dominance. Source: DefiLama The European Systemic Risk Board, chaired by ECB President Christine Lagarde, escalated warnings in October by identifying “ built-in vulnerabilities ” in multi-issuer stablecoin models. During its 59th General Board meeting, the ESRB endorsed a recommendation to ban structures where EU-regulated issuers hold local reserves while non-EU partners manage identical tokens backed abroad. They warned that stress-driven redemptions could overwhelm European reserves and expose the bloc to offshore liabilities. European Banking Consortium Launches Counter-Strategy Despite their concerns about stablecoins, nine major European lenders responded by forming a consortium to launch a euro-backed stablecoin in the second half of 2026, targeting MiCA licensing under the Netherlands’ regulatory framework. ING, UniCredit, CaixaBank, Danske Bank, SEB, Raiffeisen Bank International, Banca Sella, KBC, and DekaBank established a joint company to house the project, aiming to create a European alternative to U.S.-dominated markets. “ We believe this development requires an industry-wide approach, and it’s imperative that banks adopt the same standards ,” said Floris Lugt, Digital Assets lead at ING. The consortium’s stablecoin promises near-instant transactions at lower costs, along with round-the-clock cross-border settlement capabilities. European Stability Mechanism Managing Director Pierre Gramegna reinforced this push during an October hearing , stating, “ Europe should not be dependent on U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, which are currently dominating markets. ” Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe supported this stance, noting that the ECB’s digital euro project, expected to be launched by 2029, could further modernize regional payments. Momentum behind the digital euro continues to build, with ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone describing recent consensus among finance ministers on customer holding limits as a “ major breakthrough. ” The European Parliament is expected to establish a legislative framework position by May 2026, while member states aim for general agreement by year-end. The initiative seeks to reduce reliance on Visa and PayPal while limiting dollar-stablecoin influence. The @EU_Commission wants ESMA to directly supervise all crypto firms, replacing MiCA’s national regulator model. #MiCA #ESMA https://t.co/iOR7YOdqah — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 14, 2025 Despite Europe’s regulatory preparations, the European Commission now proposes shifting MiCA supervision from national authorities to the European Securities and Markets Authority, potentially disrupting the framework just as full implementation approaches next year. Industry groups warn that this reopening risks introducing legal uncertainty, though French officials argue that centralized oversight would close regulatory loopholes inherent in the current passporting system.

Key Takeaways: CZ says any refund of Binance’s $4.3 billion DOJ settlement would be reinvested in the United States. His comments follow a presidential pardon that triggered political backlash from Democratic lawmakers. Critics accuse CZ and Binance of financial ties to Trump’s family venture, raising concerns about the pardon’s integrity. The comment came after author and crypto commentator Anndy Lian publicly asked whether CZ expected the US government to return the multibillion-dollar penalty following his presidential pardon. CZ called it a “delicate question,” saying that he was already grateful for the pardon and suggested there is a balance between seeking fairness and appreciating the outcome. CZ Says Any Refund of DOJ Fine Would Be Reinvested in the US Addressing the issue directly, CZ said any refunded amount would be put to work inside the United States. “If we get any refund, we will be investing that in America anyway, to show our appreciation,” he said, adding that he has not yet asked for one. Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at Binance, a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. He was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024. Binance paid over $4.3 billion in settlements , while CZ personally paid $50 million and served four months in prison before his release in September 2024. ah, delicate question. 1. I appreciate the pardon already. There is a balance in asking for more vs ""what is fair"" vs appreciate what you got already. 2. IF we get any refund, we will be investing that in America anyway, to show our appreciation. Haven't asked yet, I think — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) November 17, 2025 In October 2025, Zhao was given a presidential pardon by President Donald Trump, which instantly sparked massive backlash . Senator Elizabeth Warren led opposition to the pardon, writing that “the convergence of Mr. Zhao’s pardon application and Binance’s financial entanglements with the President’s family presents urgent concerns regarding the integrity of our justice system.” She posted that CZ “pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge” before financing Trump’s stablecoin and lobbying for clemency. A group of Democratic senators , including Bernie Sanders, Chris Van Hollen, Jack Reed, and Mazie Hirono, sent a letter to Attorney General Pamela Bondi demanding explanations about how the pardon impacts future white-collar prosecutions. Representative Maxine Waters particularly called the pardon “an appalling but unsurprising reflection of his presidency.” CZ’s Lawyer Rejects Corruption Claims As reported, CZ’s attorney, Teresa Goody Guillén, has pushed back against allegations that the former Binance CEO’s presidential pardon was influenced by improper financial ties, calling recent media reports “false statements” based on fundamental misunderstandings of blockchain technology. Guillén argued that CZ “never should have been prosecuted,” saying he faced harsher treatment than banking executives who committed similar compliance violations. She emphasized that the case involved no victims or fraud and attributed the prosecution to the previous administration’s broader “war on crypto” following the fallout from FTX. Addressing claims of corruption, Guillén dismissed connections between Binance and Trump-backed World Liberty Financial as misinterpretations of normal blockchain activity. Critics had cited USD1, a stablecoin operating on Binance Smart Chain, and a $2 billion investment settlement involving the token as evidence of quid pro quo. She countered that USD1 runs across multiple chains and is not exclusive to Binance, comparing the assumption of a special relationship to claiming someone has ties to Craigslist simply for posting an item on the platform.

This currency movement comes as traders worldwide await crucial economic data releases that could reshape the entire forex market landscape. The unfolding scenario presents both opportunities and challenges for investors engaged in currency trading across global markets. What’s Driving the Dollar Strength Against Major Currencies? The greenback’s upward momentum reflects growing market confidence in the US economy’s resilience. Several factors contribute to this dollar strength : Anticipation of strong economic data releases Diverging central bank policies between the Fed and other major banks Safe-haven flows amid global uncertainty Interest rate differential expectations Understanding the Yen Retreat in Current Market Conditions The Japanese yen’s decline represents one of the most significant movements in the forex market . This yen retreat stems from multiple pressures: Factor Impact on Yen Market Reaction Bank of Japan policy stance Negative Increased selling pressure US-Japan yield differential Strongly negative Carry trade attractiveness Risk appetite recovery Moderately negative Reduced safe-haven demand Key Economic Data Releases That Could Reshape Currency Trading Market participants in currency trading closely monitor several upcoming economic data points: US inflation figures (CPI and PCE) Employment reports from major economies Central bank meeting minutes Manufacturing and services PMIs Retail sales data across G7 nations Forex Market Dynamics: Opportunities in Currency Trading The current forex market environment offers distinct opportunities for informed traders. The combination of dollar strength and yen retreat creates interesting pair dynamics. Successful currency trading in these conditions requires: Careful monitoring of economic data releases Understanding central bank communication patterns Risk management around volatility events Technical analysis of key support and resistance levels Actionable Insights for Navigating Current Market Conditions Traders can implement several strategies to capitalize on the ongoing dollar strength and yen retreat : Strategy Risk Level Potential Reward Dollar-long positions Medium High Yen-carry trades High Very High Range trading Low Medium Breakout plays High Extreme Frequently Asked Questions What central bank policies are affecting the dollar-yen pair? The Federal Reserve’s relatively hawkish stance compared to the Bank of Japan ‘s continued accommodative policy creates fundamental divergence driving the pair higher. How important are the upcoming economic data releases? Critical. The Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data and inflation figures will significantly influence Fed policy expectations and currency valuations. What technical levels should traders watch? Key resistance for USD/JPY sits near the 150.00 psychological level, while support appears around 147.50. Breakouts from these levels could signal extended moves. Are other major currencies showing similar patterns? While the yen retreat is most pronounced, the euro and pound also face pressure from dollar strength , though to a lesser extent due to their respective central bank policies. What risk management strategies are recommended? Position sizing, stop-loss orders, and correlation analysis remain essential given the elevated volatility around major economic data releases. Conclusion: Navigating the Currency Crossroads The current forex market presents a fascinating landscape where dollar strength meets significant yen retreat at a critical juncture for global economic data . Successful currency trading in this environment demands careful analysis, disciplined execution, and continuous monitoring of evolving fundamental drivers. The coming data releases will likely determine whether these trends accelerate or reverse, making this one of the most exciting periods for forex participants in recent months.

However, according to financial newsletter Kobeissi, wealthy asset holders are feeling a much “nerfed” impact compared to households strained by rising debts, stagnant wages, and job cuts. The Kobeissi Letter, sharing a chart from Moody Analytics, reported that 23 states are now in recession or at high risk of entering one. Those states represent almost a third of total US economic output, a deterioration from September’s findings which counted 22 states, with the addition of Michigan. 23 US states are fighting a losing battle with recession Struggling parts of the country are states in the Midwest, Northeast, and Northwest, where those marked in red include Washington, Oregon, Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maine. States supposedly in the clear include Texas , Florida, Louisiana, Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia. Those mentioned to be in the “water,” which meant they are holding steady but no longer posting meaningful growth, were California, New York, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. According to the report, the nation’s two largest state economies California and New York are no longer expanding at earlier rates, and MarketWatch economist Mark Zandi believes the two could turn the whole US into recession if the situation deteriorates. Moody Analytics’ research also found that the top 10% of households control about two-thirds of the nation’s wealth, while the bottom half of Americans hold less than 3%. The wealth of asset holders, the struggle of hand-to-mouth workers Households with investment portfolios, rising home values, or business equity are benefiting from appreciating financial markets. Meanwhile, families whose spending goes primarily toward rent, insurance, utilities, and groceries are struggling because prices are not coming down, and wages are not getting any better. “While there is some distress at the household level, in line with that K-shaped economy where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The macro picture is fairly bright,” wrote Bankrate senior industry analyst Ted Rossman in a note to investors last Wednesday. Total US household debt reached a record $18.59 trillion this year, with heavy reliance on loans for cars, education, homes, and day-to-day living. Credit bureau Experian estimated that Americans owed $17.57 trillion in the third quarter of 2024, a 2.4% increase from the previous year and more than $105,000 in liabilities per consumer. Millennials carried the largest total average debt at $371,864 mostly from home loans. But when mortgages are excluded, Generation X leads instead, owing about $68,038 in non-housing balances. Without the ability to buy appreciating assets, lower-income Americans are dependent on credit. “If you spend on rent, groceries, insurance, utilities, you will feel like the economy is collapsing. But if you spend on stocks, real estate, 401(k), business ownership, you feel like the economy is booming,” said one trader on social platform X. Unemployment, job losses, and inflation takes a toll on the US economy According to data collected by the Economic Policy Institute from state labor departments, there is a dramatic surge in continued unemployment insurance filings across Washington, Maryland, Virginia, Connecticut, and Oregon. Federal claims in DC jumped more than 1,000% compared with 2024’s tallies, while Maryland recorded an increase of more than 500%. When looking at claims in all state-managed programs, the year-over-year gains for DC, Virginia, and Maryland were 53%, 29%, and 25% respectively. US employers cut more than 150,000 jobs last month, the largest October reduction in more than twenty years. This will certainly become a talking point in the Federal Reserve’s December 9-10 FOMC meeting, after the longest US government shutdown blinded Jerome Powell and his camp with delayed key economic indicators. Traders using the CME FedWatch Tool have reduced the probability of a December interest rate cut to below 50%, down from the nearly 96% probability priced in just one month ago.

However, several Fed officials insist inflation is too high to justify more cuts at the end of 2025.

Coinbase is fighting back against banking groups trying to ban stablecoin rewards, calling the move un-American, while Bitfarms stock tanked 18% after ditching Bitcoin mining for AI. And DeepSnitch AI is already at the helm. The presale has raised over $527K at $0.02289, with 51% gains from $0.01510. Its SnitchFeed agent is now live and catching whale moves in real time, with 100x potential backed by operational tools, not illusions or false promises. DeFi gets regulated, miners abandon Bitcoin Aave’s Push service can now convert euros to crypto with zero fees after securing MiCA approval from Ireland’s Central Bank. That’s a direct shot at traditional exchanges charging merchants billions annually. Meanwhile, US banking lobbyists asked regulators to ban cashback tied to stablecoin payments, worried that widespread adoption could drain over $6 trillion from traditional banking. Coinbase called it protectionism disguised as regulation. And Bitfarms announced its shuttering of Bitcoin operations over the next two years to pivot entirely into AI compute. The company posted a $46 million Q3 loss, and its stock dropped 18% on the news. DeepSnitch AI 100x potential, Ethereum and Chainlink outlooks DeepSnitch AI 100x potential and tools shipping already Although still in the early days of its presale, with plenty of room to run, DeepSnitch AI is already operational. One of its snitches, or AI agents designed by on-chain experts to source crucial information for retail traders, SnitchFeed is streaming live alerts in the internal environment, catching whale moves and sentiment shifts before they cascade through Twitter. The DSNT growth outlook holds so much promise with this utility-driven, working infrastructure. Its rare and sophisticated AI-based market prediction capability gives traders a sharp edge, one they’ve needed for a long time to contend with elite intelligence until now only accessible to whales and institutions. The presale raised over $527K and delivered 51% gains at $0.02289 while most competitors are still in testnet at this stage. Its AI-based market prediction infrastructure is audited, operational, and shipping features early enough to prove its trustworthiness beyond a shadow of a doubt. November launches crypto’s historically best six months. DeepSnitch AI holds AI-based market prediction capabilities that retail needs in a market littered with scams. This is its holding power, and at this early stage in the presale, it’s a clear mark of a moonshot in the making. 2. Ethereum: Network activity declines amid ETF competition Priced at around $3,170 in mid-November, ETH has declined substantially since earlier in the month, and even more so since October. The network saw transactions drop 23% over 30 days while active addresses fell 3%. Network fees also collapsed 88% from their late-2024 peak of $70 million per week, hammering staking yields. The Ethereum price prediction for 2026 will be contingent on whether the Fusaka upgrade delivers clarity on how ETH holders benefit from layer-2 scaling solutions. Traders are questioning whether Ethereum’s dominance in total value locked will translate into higher DApp revenues. With XRP, BNB, and Cardano launching ETFs, Ethereum faces intensifying competition for institutional capital. 3. Chainlink: Oracle infrastructure eyes ETF and institutional growth Trading at approximately $14.2 on November 14, Chainlink has been maintaining its position as the industry-standard oracle network. Recent momentum includes potential for a Chainlink ETF and integrations with institutions like the US Department of Commerce and S&P Dow Jones. The protocol has secured tens of trillions in transaction value since launch and actively secures the majority of DeFi protocols across blockchains. And mainstream organizations like Swift, J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and Euroclear have partnered with Chainlink to build tokenization infrastructure. But whether Chainlink maintains oracle dominance as competitors emerge remains to be seen. And with a market cap approaching $10B, explosive gains are far easier found elsewhere, especially among utility-based presales with all the room in the world still to run. Last reflections Aave unlocked zero-fee euro-to-crypto conversions. Coinbase is battling banks over stablecoin rewards, and Bitfarms abandoned mining for AI. At the centre of this infrastructure change, DeepSnitch AI has 100x potential and is backed by operational tools, not speculation, and no smoke and mirrors. At $0.02289 with 51% gains delivered and over $527K raised, the DSNT growth outlook offers asymmetry that mature coins can’t match. With AI-based market prediction infrastructure already deployed and the presale launching during November’s historically strong crypto period, DeepSnitch AI offers infrastructure in a sector projected to hit $1.5 trillion in AI spending by year’s end. Visit the website for more info or to buy into the presale, or keep up with X and Telegram for official updates. FAQs Does DeepSnitch AI have 100x potential? With working AI agents, live staking, 51% presale gains, and a $0.02289 entry price, there’s plenty of reason to believe in DeepSnitch AI’s 100x potential as the platform scales and institutional AI spending accelerates toward $1.5 trillion. What is the DSNT growth outlook for 2026? The DSNT growth outlook is supported by its operational tools, over 10.9 million tokens already staked, regulatory compliance through audits, and positioning as infrastructure in the AI x crypto sector during typically strong market months. Is AI-based market prediction accurate through DeepSnitch AI? AI-based market prediction through DeepSnitch AI uses live data feeds, sentiment analysis, whale tracking, and contract scanning to provide real-time intelligence, giving traders an edge through information asymmetry rather than speculation.

The framework establishes a structured environment for early participants while the project advances toward its mainnet release. The rollout coincides with the active presale phase. Round 1 lists BTCM at $0.35, anchored to an internal launch benchmark of $6.00, which corresponds to an anticipated 1614% ROI. These figures define the financial conditions at the project’s initial entry stage. Structural Design Supporting Portfolio Efficiency Bitcoin Munari’s structural framework connects distribution mechanics, market setup, and network participation into an integrated system. The approach reduces concentration among internal holders and establishes operational pathways before the mainnet phase. Key structural components include: Public-first distribution , directing a majority of circulating supply to early participants Liquidity allocation , forming the initial trading environment for BTCM on Solana Validator provisions , forming the reward base for long-term network activity The structure minimizes early-stage bottlenecks and forms a pathway from presale entry to functional asset use. Token distribution, liquidity management, and validator preparation operate as interconnected components instead of isolated processes. Economic Framework Anchored to Fixed Supply Principles Bitcoin Munari’s economy is defined by a fixed supply of 21,000,000 BTCM, establishing a scarcity-based model without inflationary issuance. The presale forms the primary distribution event, including public access and allocations tied to long-term network operations. Primary allocation groups include: Public presale: 11,130,000 BTCM Validator rewards: 6,090,000 BTCM Liquidity reserves: 1,680,000 BTCM Team allocation under vesting: 1,050,000 BTCM Marketing and ecosystem development: 1,050,000 BTCM Round 1 introduces BTCM at $0.35, measured against the internal reference level of $6.00, establishing an anticipated 1,614% ROI for first-round participants. Subsequent rounds follow predetermined increments until the full allocation is complete. The structure places network security, liquidity management, and community distribution into defined categories instead of relying on ad-hoc supply release. Each segment carries a specific function within the long-term operational plan. Technical Components Enabling High-Performance Execution The technical framework begins with BTCM operating as a Solana SPL token. Solana’s throughput, low transaction costs, and established tooling enable immediate circulation and integration with existing DeFi infrastructure during the project’s initial phase. The dedicated Bitcoin Munari Layer-1 mainnet represents the second phase of the technical roadmap. The chain uses a delegated proof-of-stake model, an EVM-compatible execution layer, and a structured governance mechanism designed to manage protocol adjustments through community voting. Core components of the architecture include: Solana SPL deployment during Phase 1 Delegated proof-of-stake consensus on the mainnet EVM-compatible smart contract engine Integrated privacy and governance modules Solana-to-Munari 1:1 migration bridge The investment platform functions as the operational entry point connecting presale distribution to the broader technical rollout. Each component fits within a sequential release plan that moves BTCM from early circulation into full-chain functionality. Portfolio Return Mechanics Within the Munari Development Roadmap The roadmap links asset acquisition, network development, and ecosystem activation into distinct stages. Presale entry forms the first phase. BTCM then moves into the Solana liquidity environment, where trading activity and wallet integrations begin. The testnet period introduces validator onboarding, transaction stress procedures, bridge verification, and economic modeling. BTCM operates as the reference asset for simulation activities, governance tests, and network configuration. Mainnet activation enables validator rewards, smart contract deployment, DeFi integrations, and cross-chain functionality. The 1:1 migration bridge maintains continuity between SPL BTCM and native BTCM on the completed chain. After migration, BTCM interacts with staking functions, governance modules, privacy features, and DeFi protocols released under the project’s ecosystem plan. The roadmap links each stage to tangible operational components rather than speculative milestones. Every phase carries a defined function within the broader network architecture and portfolio structure.

The talks center on how BTC should be utilized and whether non-financial transactions should be exempt from regulation. It was reignited by the recent Bitcoin Core v30 update, which some critics argue could open the door to blockchain “spam.” Knots supporters want this type of activity filtered out to prevent bad actors from embedding illegal or immoral content into the blockchain. Bitcoin Core proponents, however, argue that imposing restrictions risks network fragmentation, user confusion, and undermines one of Bitcoin’s core principles. Bitcoin’s Core vs. Knots battle echoes past technical disputes such as the block-size wars and SegWit adoption, both of which prompted heated debate and were settled without disrupting adoption. These historical episodes demonstrate that while protocol changes can have significant consequences for network stability, once the change has become normalized, institutional investors tend to treat it as a low-priority issue. Most institutional investors are unfazed by the Bitcoin Core vs Knots debate In a recent X post, Thorn shared results from a poll of 25 institutional Bitcoin investors working with Galaxy. He found that 46% were unaware of the debate, 36% were ambivalent, and only 18% expressed support for Bitcoin Core. Thorn noted that Real capital, real investors, service providers, and even government officials seem unbothered or are unaware that there’s even a debate; at best, it’s a hypothetical problem. Their proposed solution does nothing to solve the (fake) problem they claim is real. He continues to say that even if it is implemented, all their legal theories are mumbo jumbo, and the concerns about them are ones that everyone adjusted to years ago during early debates over the legality of permissionless decentralized systems. Some analysts questioned the number of institutions polled. The questions were directed to 25 institutional Bitcoin investors. When they inquired about the validity of the poll’s sample size, Thorn responded that it was a “ fair question ,” however, he noted that his poll reflected what he had been seeing. “I won’t reveal their identities, but I will say yes, and the results from that poll line up exactly with my conversations with other whales, investors, leaders at miners and service providers, and government officials over the last several months,” he said. Thorn added that, although he didn’t poll miners directly, he follows most of the major ones closely and confirmed that none are paying attention or concerned. Soft fork debate could impact Bitcoin adoption Earlier, a BTC improvement proposal for a soft fork drew backlash on X over a section that seemed to suggest legal consequences for those who failed to support the fork. Thorn bel ieves the argument will conclude in one of three ways, one of which could potentially cause significant harm to Bitcoin adoption. According to Thorn, the first issue fades into obscurity as no one pays attention. The second is that the debate instills fear around Bitcoin, scaring people away, while the proposed forks ultimately fail. Lastly, in a very unlikely scenario, the changes are adopted, but the solutions fall short, and Bitcoin adoption suffers long-term damage due to the fear created around permissionless systems. Although the Bitcoin Core vs Knots debate has been of high technical intensity, Thorn’s findings underscore a crucial truth: institutional investors, rather than differing nodes, care most for Bitcoin’s financial performance, regulatory clarity, and adoption trends. Developers are still discussing the forks and filtering of transactions, but these discussions among most of the market participants are mostly theoretical. The realities of security, liquidity, and compliance have proved much more compelling than the emerging software disputes in the long term to BTC’s establishment, adoption, and legitimacy in the mainstream financial ecosystem.

Key Takeaways: XRP whales dumped nearly 200 million tokens within 48 hours of the ETF launch, signaling heavy selling pressure. Despite a blockbuster ETF debut, XRP’s price slipped as whales sold and technical indicators turned bearish. The divergence between whale selling and institutional inflows reflects broader risk-off sentiment across the crypto market. In a recent post on X, on-chain analyst Ali said large holders “dumped nearly 200 million XRP in just 48 hours,” a signal that the biggest wallets are selling into the post-ETF rally rather than accumulating. XRP’s SEC Triumph Paves Way for Blockbuster ETF Launch on Nasdaq The selling comes at a pivotal moment for XRP, now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of roughly $136 billion. Its community has been celebrating a years-long legal victory over the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which in 2023 led a federal court to rule that XRP is not a security when traded on exchanges. That ruling helped push institutions back toward XRP and set the stage for Thursday’s launch of the Canary Capital XRP ETF on Nasdaq, the strongest ETF debut of the year with $58 million in first-day trading volume and more than $250 million in inflows . However, whales appear unmoved by the milestone. XRP has fallen 4.3% in 24 hours, sliding from $2.31 to $2.22 and forming a clear lower-highs pattern that suggests near-term bearish pressure. Crypto trader Tara warned that XRP is breaking down toward key buy levels around $2 and could drop further to $2.05 or even $1.88 unless Bitcoin stabilizes. She said volatility is likely to increase as XRP approaches these zones. #XRP is starting to break down and will be reaching buy targets soon! This could REALLY be one of the LAST buying opportunities that we get around $2! Remember, we've added in that possible subwave 3 fib at ~$2.10 – We need to watch #Bitcoin closely (and the RSI!) when XRP… — TARA (@PrecisionTrade3) November 16, 2025 The ETF’s strong inflows have not been reflected in trading volume because the product uses in-kind creations, allowing institutions to exchange ETF shares directly for XRP without activity showing up on public order books. ETF analyst Nate Geraci said this explains how the ETF posted low visible volume but high inflows. At the same time, data from Nansen shows that top-performing “smart money” wallets added $44 million in long positions over the past day. The disconnect between whale selling and institutional interest may come down to broader market conditions. Crypto remains in a risk-off phase, with Bitcoin ETFs seeing $866 million in outflows on the same day, one of their worst sessions on record. Ripple Welcomes Fed Proposal Giving Crypto Firms Access to Payment Rails Last week, Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stu Alderoty, said a proposal from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller to allow crypto companies access to “skinny” Fed accounts could reshape the US digital asset landscape. Waller argued that stablecoin issuers and other crypto firms should be able to tap directly into the Fed’s payment systems, reducing reliance on traditional banks that often hesitate to serve the sector. He urged regulators to “embrace the disruption — don’t avoid it,” signaling a more open stance toward decentralized finance. Ripple, which previously applied for a Fed master account to support its RLUSD stablecoin, sees the idea as transformative. Alderoty told Reuters the proposal could speed up settlement, lower costs and help RLUSD gain traction in a competitive stablecoin market dominated by Tether and Circle. He added that having direct access to the Fed would improve stability and redeemability, enabling firms to move quickly between U.S. Treasuries and dollars without banking middlemen.

His recent statements highlight potential vulnerabilities in the network's legal infrastructure. Szabo posted his concerns on X, stating that Bitcoin and other layer-1 networks possess a ”legal attack” surface. This vulnerability allows governments and large corporations to disrupt operations through regulatory channels. The cryptocurrency veteran dismissed the notion that Bitcoin functions as a completely autonomous system. He described the belief that blockchain protocols can withstand any governmental interference as ”insanity.” His position directly contradicts the common narrative of Bitcoin as an unstoppable financial network. Szabo's perspective carries substantial weight in the cryptocurrency community. He developed the concept of Bit Gold in 1988, predating the creation of Bitcoin. His pioneering work on smart contracts established him as a foundational figure in the development of digital currency. Speculation has long circulated that Szabo might be Satoshi Nakamoto , the anonymous creator of Bitcoin. He has consistently denied these claims. Legal Pressure Points in the Bitcoin Network The Bitcoin pioneer identified specific targets for potential government action. Miners, node operators, and wallet service providers represent critical infrastructure points vulnerable to regulatory pressure. These entities operate within established legal frameworks, making them susceptible to coordinated enforcement actions. Szabo focused his analysis on jurisdictions that maintain a strong rule of law. In these regions, authorities possess clear mechanisms to compel network participants into compliance. His warning centered on the potential for forced manipulation of network data. The ability to insert or remove ”arbitrary data” emerged as Szabo's primary concern. Regulators could mandate that network participants alter blockchain content. This scenario would undermine Bitcoin's core promise of immutable record-keeping. The Ordinals and Runes Controversy Szabo's comments connect to ongoing debates within the Bitcoin development community. The discussion revolves around non-financial content stored on the blockchain through Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 transactions. These protocols enable users to embed images, videos, and audio files directly onto the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots represent two competing visions for the network's future. Bitcoin Knots has gained market share among node validators in recent months. This shift reflects growing dissatisfaction with Bitcoin Core's approach to network data. The OP_RETURN function stands at the center of the controversy. Bitcoin Core developers implemented this feature, expanding the capacity for non-financial data on the blockchain. Critics argue that it enables ”spam” transactions, which congest the network and inflate storage requirements. Supporters argue that restricting data types contradicts Bitcoin's philosophy of being censorship-resistant. They view attempts to filter content as antithetical to the network's founding principles. The technical community remains divided on striking a balance between functionality and network efficiency. Szabo's warnings drew immediate criticism from Bitcoin advocates. Chris Seedor, CEO of Bitcoin seed storage provider Seedor, challenged the assessment. He characterized Szabo's concerns as an overestimation of regulatory capabilities. Seedor argued that Bitcoin's strength lies in minimizing technical vulnerabilities to coercion. He pointed to other resilient technologies as precedents. Protocols like PGP encryption and Tor remain operational despite government opposition. According to Seedor, these examples demonstrate the limits of regulatory power against decentralized systems.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 09:44:53

The country’s Financial Services Agency has announced plans to reclassify 105 major cryptocurrencies as financial products while implementing a massive cryptocurrency tax cut that could revolutionize investor returns. What does Japan’s cryptocurrency tax cut mean for investors? The proposed changes represent one of the most significant regulatory shifts in crypto history. Japan aims to slash the maximum cryptocurrency income tax rate from a staggering 55% down to just 20%. This dramatic cryptocurrency tax cut could unlock billions in investment potential and position Japan as a global crypto hub. Under the current system, cryptocurrency profits face some of the highest tax rates worldwide. The new framework would align crypto taxation with traditional financial instruments, creating a more level playing field. This cryptocurrency tax cut initiative demonstrates Japan’s commitment to fostering innovation while protecting investors. Which cryptocurrencies will benefit from this classification? The FSA has identified 105 digital assets for reclassification, including market leaders like: Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Other major altcoins Exchanges listing these assets will face new transparency requirements. They must disclose critical information including issuer details, underlying blockchain technology, and price volatility metrics. This enhanced transparency combined with the cryptocurrency tax cut creates a safer environment for both retail and institutional investors. How will Japan prevent market manipulation? The regulatory overhaul includes robust measures to combat insider trading. The proposal specifically prohibits executives at issuing companies or exchanges from trading based on non-public information. These protections work alongside the cryptocurrency tax cut to build market integrity and investor confidence. Authorities recognize that sustainable growth requires both attractive incentives and strong safeguards. The cryptocurrency tax cut alone wouldn’t be sufficient without these complementary regulatory enhancements that address potential abuse scenarios. When will these changes take effect? The timeline for implementation extends into 2026, with the FSA planning to submit amendments during the regular Diet session that year. This gives market participants adequate time to prepare for the cryptocurrency tax cut and associated regulatory changes. The extended timeline also allows for thorough consultation with industry stakeholders. The gradual implementation approach ensures the cryptocurrency tax cut and reclassification process occurs smoothly without disrupting existing market operations. What broader reforms accompany the cryptocurrency tax cut? Japanese authorities view this initiative as a catalyst for comprehensive cryptocurrency tax system reform. The cryptocurrency tax cut serves as the centerpiece of a larger strategy to modernize Japan’s approach to digital assets. Future reforms may address additional aspects of cryptocurrency taxation and regulation. The government’s proactive stance signals recognition of cryptocurrency’s growing importance in global finance. This cryptocurrency tax cut positions Japan competitively against other nations developing their own digital asset frameworks. Conclusion: A new era for cryptocurrency in Japan Japan’s proposed cryptocurrency tax cut and regulatory reclassification represent a monumental shift in how digital assets are perceived and treated. By lowering barriers and increasing transparency, these changes could accelerate mainstream adoption while protecting market participants. The combination of significant tax relief and enhanced regulatory oversight creates a balanced approach that could serve as a model for other nations considering similar reforms. Frequently Asked Questions When will Japan’s cryptocurrency tax cut take effect? The changes are scheduled for submission to the Diet in 2026, with implementation likely following legislative approval. Which cryptocurrencies qualify for the tax reduction? 105 specific digital assets including Bitcoin and Ethereum will be reclassified as financial products eligible for the lower tax rate. How much will investors save with the new tax rate? The tax reduction from 55% to 20% represents substantial savings, potentially increasing net returns by over 60% for high-earning investors. Will all crypto transactions qualify for the lower tax rate? The tax cut applies specifically to the 105 reclassified cryptocurrencies traded on compliant exchanges that meet new disclosure requirements. What disclosure requirements will exchanges face? Exchanges must provide information about issuers, underlying blockchain technology, and price volatility for each listed asset. How will Japan prevent insider trading in crypto markets? The regulations prohibit executives at issuing companies and exchanges from trading based on non-public information. Found this analysis of Japan’s groundbreaking cryptocurrency tax cut helpful?

Peter Schiff: “No Matter What Happens to Bitcoin, MicroStrategy Will End Up Bankrupt” Schiff published an article claiming that STR's business model was “a complete scam” and that the company would inevitably go bankrupt. Schiff announced that he will speak at the Binance Blockchain Week event in Dubai in early December and participate in a discussion on the topic with Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor. The renowned economist stated that regardless of what Bitcoin's long-term fate will be, MicroStrategy's financial sustainability is at serious risk. Schiff's allegations have reignited criticism of Strategy's aggressive Bitcoin strategy, which has been known to divert all of its cash flow and borrowing resources to Bitcoin acquisitions in recent years. While this approach is seen as an innovative corporate strategy by crypto advocates, critics like Schiff have criticized it for involving high leverage and excessive risk. Peter Schiff summarized his controversial statements by saying, “It doesn't matter if Bitcoin's ultimate value drops to zero or rises; Strategy has no chance of surviving with this model.” His discussion with Saylor at the Dubai event is expected to reshape discussions of Bitcoin and corporate strategy. *This is not investment advice.

Yet, new projects are emerging with even higher growth potential. Among them, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out the most. Analysts predict that it could surge as much as 28,831% by 2026, which is enough to catch the attention of any early investor. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Best Buy For 2026 Little Pepe isn’t just another meme coin trying to ride the frog wave. It’s a comprehensive ecosystem built on an Ethereum-based Layer 2, specifically designed for meme tokens. This setup means faster, cheaper trades and a fair system that blocks sniper bots. Currently, LILPEPE’s presale is in Stage 13, priced at $0.0022, and it has already sold out 96.49% after raising over $27.4 million out of a $28.7 million target. The presale began back in June 2025, and every stage has sold out quickly. Whales are quietly stacking positions, and retail investors are catching on fast. The project has passed a Certik audit, adding more credibility. What really sets Little Pepe apart is its ability to blend fun with function: offering zero tax on trading, a locked vesting schedule for stability, and a “zero market cap” advantage that provides early buyers with massive upside potential. Its giveaways are also creating waves. The $777k giveaway already has over 524,500 entries, while the Mega Giveaway has over 87,600 entries with prizes worth more than 15 ETH. Add to that upcoming CEX listings and heavy community engagement, and it’s easy to see why experts are calling it the best presale of 2025. If the 28,831% projection plays out, LILPEPE could hit around $0.634 by 2026, turning small investors into early legends. Ethereum (ETH): Still Strong and Rising As of November 12, Ethereum trades around $3,440. ETH recently cooled off after strong gains earlier this year. Still, data from Reuters indicates that major banks and institutions expect it to move toward $6,000 by 2026, provided market conditions remain positive. The network continues to dominate DeFi and AI-based projects, with staking and institutional adoption keeping it a relevant player. So, yes, Ethereum isn’t done rallying but compared to some smaller tokens, its growth might look modest. Pippin (PIPPIN): Small Cap with Big Moves At $0.0347, Pippin has been one of the liveliest new coins on Bybit . Its market cap sits near $34.7 million, and it’s already jumped more than 143% in the last month. PIPPIN is gaining traction as an AI-meme blend coin with strong community backing. With continued bullish momentum, PIPPIN could see aggressive growth by 2026. Analysts believe a move toward $1.20 is possible which would be roughly 34 times the current level. Real (REAL): A Quiet Gem with Upside Potential REAL trades at $0.196 with a small market cap, which means it has plenty of room to grow. It’s part of the new wave of tokens connecting blockchain finance and DeFi innovation. If adoption rises and listings improve, REAL could make some noise in 2026. An optimistic outlook places it between $5.00 and $7.50 in a strong bull run, translating to approximately 38 times growth. With its small base and ties to financial tech trends, REAL could surprise many investors who look beyond the usual names. Look (LOOK): The Underdog of the Group At just $0.0295, LOOK is another small-cap token catching traders' attention. Its market cap hovers near $27 million and its low price gives it massive percentage potential if demand picks up. Recent data from CoinGecko indicate an increase in trading volume, suggesting that investors are starting to take notice. If it follows through with listings and ecosystem growth, LOOK could climb to $2.50 by 2026, an 85× jump from today’s value. Conclusion Ethereum might still climb toward $6,000 but newer tokens are shaping the future. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) leads that charge, with an early price of $0.0022, strong fundamentals, viral community energy, and analysts projecting 28,831% growth by 2026. The cryptocurrency world rewards early believers, and this is one of those rare early moments.

This landmark initiative brings the discipline, trust and transparency of global financial markets to crypto’s most dynamic products, setting a new standard for the industry. Launching on 24 November 2025, these innovative contracts provide a continuous, no-expiry structure favoured by crypto-native communities, combined with the robust clearing and margining standards of listed derivatives. With this launch, investors[1] can access institutional-grade crypto perpetual futures within a regulated, exchange-cleared framework – marking a major step forward in bridging traditional finance and digital asset markets. A Game-Changer for Crypto Markets Perpetual futures account for more than US$187 billion[2] in daily average volumes globally, with Asia at the epicentre of this growth. Yet these flows remain largely priced off and settled on offshore platforms outside of Asia. By bringing these flows on-exchange, SGX will enable institutions to trade and gain exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum with confidence and scale. Michael Syn, President, SGX Group, said, “Digital assets have made their way into institutional investors’ portfolio. We have taken the next logical and deliberate step – applying the same institutional discipline that underpins global markets to crypto’s most traded pay-off. By bringing the perpetuals into an exchange-cleared, regulated framework, we offer institutions the trust and scalability they have been waiting for.” The crypto perpetual contracts are benchmarked to iEdge CoinDesk Crypto Indices[3], aligning price discovery with institutional-grade benchmarks widely recognised across the industry. Andy Baehr, Head of Product and Research, CoinDesk Indices, said, “More than two-thirds of all crypto trading is in derivatives, and perpetual futures offer unique features and benefits that have made them a favourite. We are excited to see SGX Derivatives bring perpetual futures onshore with traditional margining and clearing and are delighted to support the benchmark rate for this innovative contract.” Industry Welcomes Move to Expand institutional Access The launch has drawn encouraging feedback from market participants who view this as a timely and strategic step in advancing access to crypto markets which have become increasingly mainstream. Leonard Hoh, General Manager, Bitstamp by Robinhood – Asia Pacific, said, “This launch is reflective of how market infrastructure and participation are evolving, and it is exciting to see a Singapore-anchored benchmark to reflect the liquidity we see in Asia. This is an important step for institutions to trade at scale, and we are proud to partner with SGX to provide connectivity to the global crypto ecosystem.” Patrick Yeo, Head of Digital Assets, Global Financial Markets, DBS Bank, said, “Crypto perpetuals offer institutional traders enhanced precision and capital efficiency when managing their digital asset portfolios as compared to spot trading. In addition, clearing and margining these derivatives under the same standards as traditional instruments paves the way for broader adoption, and marks a new milestone in the growing maturation of the digital asset ecosystem. DBS is pleased to support SGX’s launch as a member of its cryptocurrency index committee, and we are committed to sharing our expertise and insights as a pioneer in this space to foster a robust and responsible digital asset ecosystem in Singapore.” Joseph Chang, Co-Founder and CEO, Liquibit Capital, said, “We are excited to support SGX’s crypto perpetual futures launch, a key step in bringing regulated liquidity to Asia’s growing digital asset markets. Exceptional performance begins with robust risk management, and SGX’s move delivers exactly that.” CJ Fong, APAC General Manager, GSR, said, “Institutional-grade perpetual futures are a critical milestone in the evolution of crypto markets. By combining SGX’s global credibility with crypto-native innovation, we are creating the foundation for scaled, regulated participation in digital assets.” Gracie Lin, CEO, OKX Singapore, said, “We have seen growing demand for regionally anchored benchmarks, especially as institutions look to integrate crypto exposure alongside other asset classes. It is a natural step in Singapore’s market evolution, and this deeper reference point adds transparency and confidence for institutional participants, helping to support long-term growth of the ecosystem.” Melvin Deng, CEO, QCP, said, “SGX’s entry into perpetual futures is a defining moment for Asia digital asset markets. Institutional participants have long sought a regulated venue that combines the familiarity of traditional market infrastructure with the innovation of crypto-native products. This launch highlights the innovative approach from SGX to encourage global investors to engage in digital assets in Singapore.” Ramesh Arumugam, Managing Director, Asia Pacific, Virtu Financial, said, “Centrally cleared cryptocurrency perpetual futures enhance the foundation for market liquidity, directly drawing from our existing daily flows. This infrastructure aids price discovery and execution, fundamentally boosting our capacity and ability to confidently quote to institutional counterparties.” The official Press Release can be found in the Annex .

A Hyperliquid whale has moved in with long bets on a basket of altcoins. A Hyperliquid whale injected over $3.6M to go long on a selection of altcoins. While the market is still volatile and sentiment is low, the whale bets on a directional move, or at least a short-term recovery. A Hyperliquid whale made a selection of altcoins, allocating $3.6M on long positions. The whale chose trending tokens, as well as riskier memes with the potential for a rapid recovery. | Source: Hyperliquid . The whale selected blue chip tokens like ETH and BNB, as well as recently active coins like LTC. The mix also included meme tokens, expecting a directional move for FARTCOIN, PEPE, BONK, PNUT, and POPCAT. The whale also took up new movers like ASTER and MET, but also an older asset, AVAX, in expectations of a breakout. The whale’s selection signals that a market-wide rally may not be possible, but some altcoins are still seen as capable of moving forward with clear moves. The whale holds onto the positions, with an unrealized loss of $276K net , offset by some of the smaller altcoin gains. Hyperliquid whale bets on HYPE Overall, the whale carried a net unrealized loss, mostly based on the performance of HYPE. The position carried an unrealized loss of $293K, while the whale paid over $8,400 in fees to keep holding. HYPE traded at $38.49, near its usual range, still awaiting a more significant breakout. HYPE open interest fluctuates around $1.4B, after a series of liquidations. HYPE carries over 68% long positions among Hyperliquid whales, in the third spot after BTC and ETH. The coin has constant support from traders, despite its mindshare dropping by over 46% recently. The return of whales to Hyperliquid also signals that the risk of the perpetual futures DEX has not discouraged all traders. Hyperliquid currently carries $7.4B in open interest, of which around $2.5B is allocated to smaller altcoins. Traders look for forgotten coins awaiting a breakout The altcoin season index has recently recovered from a local low of 25 points to 43 points. While not all top 100 assets are expanding, there are enough coins and tokens with directional rallies. The long bets on AVAX also grew on Hyperliquid , with trading volumes increasing to a one-month peak. Open interest also grew to $257M, from a recent low of $200M. While altcoins are risky, a bounce from their recent lows, combined with leveraged trading, may produce bigger gains. Perpetual DEXs allow traders to bet on a breakout, without ending up with token holdings. Trending tokens also ensure there is sufficient liquidity to complete trades. Other recent shifts in sentiment show traders see altcoins as viable once again, after the October 11 liquidation. Among potential runners, UNI is seen as making a breakout to a new range, based on the platform’s success in 2025 and eventual profit sharing. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

54520799,628908,1763373110,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54520799.jpeg,Bitcoin Hyper Presale Nears $28M As Harvard Triples Bitcoin ETF Bet,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-presale-harvard-triples-bitcoin-etf-holdings/,"Quick Facts: Harvard’s endowment has made a spot Bitcoin ETF its largest reported US equity holding, signaling growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin. Expanding ETF ownership strengthens the case for Bitcoin-aligned infrastructure that can support faster transactions, DeFi, and more complex on-chain activity. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve Bitcoin’s speed and fee limits with a Bitcoin-anchored Layer 2 powered by Solana Virtual Machine technology. The $HYPER presale, nearing $28M raised, offers early exposure to a utility-driven Bitcoin Layer 2 narrative. Harvard University’s endowment has sent a market signal so loud that you could hear it across Wall Street. Fresh filings just dropped , and they show the Ivy League giant is seriously bullish on crypto. They absolutely massive-ed their stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), boosting it by a whopping 257% from the last quarter when they held 1.9M shares ! That means they now own around 6.8M shares, valued at roughly $442.8M making the ETF its biggest reported US stock holding ahead of names like Microsoft and Amazon. So why is this such a big deal? Well, endowments traditionally only invest in assets such as private equity, real estate, and strategies designed to last 50 years. They hate volatility. When a massive $57B fund lets a Bitcoin product become its flagship asset , it’s not a gamble; it’s a strategic declaration. It means Bitcoin is officially graduating from some nerdy tech toy to a bona fide, long-term portfolio anchor. The gatekeepers are letting it in. The timing is telling. Bitcoin has cooled dramatically to below $95K since its peak near $120K, and ETF flows have been volatile. But what are the smartest, biggest money managers, from Harvard to even some sovereign wealth funds, doing? They’re quietly buying the dip through these easy ETF rails. So, if institutions are buying, what’s the next bottleneck? The ETFs solve the easy parts: access and custody. But they don’t fix the underlying plumbing of Bitcoin: it’s slow, fees can be high, and it can’t run complex smart contracts. That gap is exactly what projects are jumping on. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin Layer 2, is trying to fill that need. And it’s already successfully raised nearly $28M in presale funding, signaling strong confidence. $HYPER Cures Bitcoin’s Ailments, Allowing the OG Digital Asset to Start Swinging Big Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is built around a simple idea: keep Bitcoin’s security, fix its user experience. The project aims to handle everyday transactions, DeFi, and smart contracts on a dedicated Layer 2 while periodically anchoring state back to Bitcoin for final settlement. To do that, the network plans to use a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) execution layer on top of Bitcoin. Execution moves off the base chain, so you get near-instant confirmations and very low fees, while Bitcoin remains the ultimate settlement and security layer. The core pitch is straightforward: send, receive, and interact with Bitcoin in real time, at roughly cent-level fees, without abandoning Bitcoin’s trust model. That design specifically addresses Bitcoin’s most notable pain points. On the base layer, throughput sits around seven transactions per second , and block times average ten minutes. That is fine for a long-term store of value. It is painful for payments, gaming, on-chain trading, or NFTs. By shifting these activities to a high-throughput Layer 2 and anchoring them to Bitcoin every few hours, Bitcoin Hyper aims to transform ‘digital gold’ into usable collateral for an entire application stack. If you want a further project breakdown of the ‘how’, we’ve got you covered in our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide. This is where Harvard’s move and similar ETF flows come back into play. As more capital treats Bitcoin as pristine collateral and macro hedge, demand grows for infrastructure that lets $BTC actually do something useful: earn yield, back stablecoins, move cross-border instantly, or sit inside $BTC-denominated DeFi rails. A Bitcoin-anchored L2 that can support those flows sits right in that narrative. Find out ‘How to Buy Bitcoin Hyper’ here. $HYPER: What the Whales Gather For The market seems to be noticing. The $HYPER presale is nearing the $28M mark and offers staking rewards of approximately 41% for early participants. For a presale, that is deep liquidity and a clear vote of confidence from early backers. Whale buys have been consistently high, with one topping $500K . Big tickets like that do not prove the thesis, but they do show that high-net-worth investors are willing to treat $HYPER as a leveraged bet on the same macro drivers pulling institutions into spot Bitcoin ETFs. From a numbers standpoint, the upside case is easy to understand, even if it remains speculative. Our experts see a potential end-of-2026 high of $0.20 for $HYPER , which would give you a whopping 1405% ROI if you invested at today’s price. If you’re looking beyond pure meme plays, $HYPER offers a mix of narrative, utility, and early-stage entry pricing. Buy your $HYPER today for $0.013285, but hurry, a price increase is coming soon. Remember, this is not intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before making any investments.

Following the market crash, cryptos are regaining momentum. While the major cryptocurrencies dominate the market, the five new altcoins are delivering massive potential. AI-based cryptos are emerging as the next wave of cryptos, with the potential to deliver massive gains. Ozak AI is an AI-based cryptocurrency with a high growth potential and widespread token adoption. Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), XRP (Ripple), Chainlink (LINK), and Avalanche (Avax) are the top five hottest cryptos set to dominate in 2025. Top 5 Cryptos Dominating the 2025 Market With Strong Fundamentals and Real-World Utility Solana (SOL)—Solana is known for its high-speed transactions and very low fees. It now expands across the DeFi and NFTs. Currently the Solana is trading at $154.30 with a market cap of $85.30 billion with a total supply of 613.4 million SOL. After its downfall, the Solona has regained its position and could cross its all-time high by the end of this year. Cardano (ADA) - It is a research-driven blockchain built for its scalability and sustainability. It is focused on real-world adoption through innovation and education. Currently ADA is trading at $0.52 with a massive market cap of $18.95 billion, with a total supply of 44.99 billion ADA. With Hydra upgrades, the Cardona will enter its high-priced range. XRP (Ripple) - It is designed for global payments and cross-border transactions. XRP is currently trading at $2.20 with the $133.30 billion market cap. It is backed by Partnerships with banks and financial institutions. XRP’s regulatory clarity drives the mainstream adoption. Chainlink (LINK)—Chainlink plays a major role in the decentralized data connectivity in the web3 system. It provides trusted oracles that connect smart contracts to real-world data. Currently, Chainlink is trading at $14.60 with a market cap of $10.21 billion. As tokenized assets grow, the demand of Chainlink will increase, and this will make the price surge. Avalanche (Avax) - It is a highly scalable, low-latency blockchain for enterprises. Its subnet enables custom high-performance blockchain networks. Currently, Avalanche is trading at $16.32 with a market cap of $6.97 billion. Avalanche is leading in real-world asset tokenization and has the ability to boom in 2025 and in the upcoming years. Ozak AI Takes the Lead among Top 5 Altcoins Ozak AI is an AI-based early-stage token. Its Core Technology merges AI and blockchain to produce AI predictive tools that can analyze real-time blockchain data. Currently, the token is in its presale phase , priced at $0.014. More than 1 billion tokens have been sold, and $4.46 million has been raised as presale funding so far. Investors believe that AI will rule the cryptocurrency market in the upcoming years, and Ozqak AI will dominate among all the AI-based cryptos. At the time of launch, Ozak AI was launched at the price of $0.001, and now it has a 1,300% increase from the current launch phase. The token's target price is $1. Analysts predict that the token will reach its target price by the end of 2026 and will deliver more than 500x after the launch. Innovative Technology and Partnerships Driving Ozak AI’s Expansion The Ozak AI advanced technology and strong features increase the token's potential and attract investors to invest in it. The primary feature of Ozak AI is the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN). It is made up of three layers, each of which serves a different function. The OSN layer connects to on-chain and off-chain data to provide news and blockchain events. The data layer securely stores all encrypted data. AI later performs AI calculations on a GPU. Another feature is that Ozak Data Vaults are secure storage lockers for Ozak AIb. It stores all financial data in an encrypted format, which is both fast and secure. Collaboration with Echobit , an exchange designed for microsecond-order matching, combined with Ozak AI's 30-ms market prediction. Partnering with Hive Intel , which is a multichain data API, the Ozak AI predictive tools can now analyze the on-chain behavior deeper, which includes NFT, Defi events. Conclusion The top altcoins have the potential to grow, but Ozak AI is in its early stages and has the potential to deliver the highest ROI. These altcoins have already established themselves in the market and have a massive market cap; however, Ozak AI has a strong technology background, strategic partnerships, a very small cap, and a low presale price that makes the early-stage investors wait; if the token launches at a price of $1, they can gain more than these altcoins.

The Singapore Exchange is launching perpetual futures for Bitcoin and Ethereum on November 24, marking a significant milestone in crypto adoption. This strategic move opens new doors for professional investors seeking regulated exposure to digital assets through Singapore Exchange perpetual futures products. What Makes Singapore Exchange Perpetual Futures So Important? Singapore Exchange perpetual futures represent a major step forward for institutional crypto participation. Unlike traditional futures that have expiration dates, perpetual futures continue indefinitely, making them ideal for long-term positions. The Singapore Exchange derivatives arm will offer these products specifically tailored for institutional investors, providing a regulated environment that traditional finance players demand. These innovative contracts will track the iEdge CoinDesk Crypto Indices, which serve as institutional-grade benchmarks. This ensures pricing transparency and reliability that major financial institutions require. Moreover, the Singapore Exchange perpetual futures launch demonstrates how established financial markets are embracing cryptocurrency innovation. Why Should Institutional Investors Pay Attention? The Singapore Exchange perpetual futures offering addresses several key concerns that have previously limited institutional participation: Regulated Environment: Trading occurs within an established, regulated exchange framework Institutional-Grade Infrastructure: Professional trading tools and settlement systems Transparent Pricing: Based on reputable iEdge CoinDesk Crypto Indices Risk Management: Familiar derivatives structure for portfolio protection This development comes at a crucial time when institutions increasingly seek crypto exposure but require traditional market safeguards. The Singapore Exchange perpetual futures platform provides exactly this bridge between conventional finance and digital assets. How Will This Impact Crypto Market Dynamics? The introduction of Singapore Exchange perpetual futures could significantly influence market liquidity and price discovery. Institutional participation typically brings substantial trading volume, which may reduce volatility and improve market efficiency. Additionally, the credibility of the Singapore Exchange name lends legitimacy to cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Market analysts predict this move could trigger similar offerings from other major exchanges worldwide. As more institutions gain comfortable access through regulated venues like Singapore Exchange perpetual futures, we may see increased capital flows into the crypto space. What Challenges Might Investors Face? While Singapore Exchange perpetual futures offer numerous advantages, investors should consider potential challenges. Regulatory requirements may limit participation to qualified institutions initially. Additionally, traders must understand the unique mechanics of perpetual futures, including funding rates that maintain contract prices close to spot market values. However, the Singapore Exchange has extensive experience in derivatives markets, suggesting they’ve designed these products with proper risk management protocols. The use of established indices further mitigates pricing manipulation concerns. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Derivatives The Singapore Exchange perpetual futures launch represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption. By providing institutional investors with regulated access to Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives, this development bridges traditional finance with digital assets. The November 24 launch date marks the beginning of a new chapter where major financial institutions can participate in crypto markets through familiar, trusted channels. Frequently Asked Questions What are perpetual futures?

Who can trade Singapore Exchange perpetual futures? Initially, these products target institutional investors, though retail access may follow depending on regulatory approvals and exchange policies. How do perpetual futures differ from traditional futures? Traditional futures have specific settlement dates, while perpetual futures continue rolling forward with funding mechanisms instead of expiration. What indices do these futures track? Singapore Exchange perpetual futures track the iEdge CoinDesk Crypto Indices, providing institutional-grade Bitcoin and Ethereum pricing benchmarks. When does trading begin?

Following the strong performance of Stage 3, the platform has rolled out the Stage 4 (Harvest) airdrop program and will launch the “ Double Harvest ” trading competition on November 17 with a total reward pool of $10 million. At the same time, Aster continues to scale its early-asset product Rocket Launch , expanding the pipeline of new token activities. These incentive tracks run in parallel, enabling users to earn multiple rewards from the same trading activity, substantially increasing platform engagement and trading depth. The Stage 4 reward pool represents 1.5% of the total $ASTER supply (approximately 120,000,000 $ASTER tokens), distributed evenly across six weekly Epochs. Running concurrently, the $10 million “Double Harvest” competition features five independent weekly leaderboards, allowing users to earn both airdrop rewards and competition rewards from identical trading behavior. Rocket Launch Shows Strong Traction, Emerging as a Key Growth Engine Beyond the airdrop and trading competition, Aster Rocket Launch continues to gain momentum. The product is designed to accelerate early-stage projects by driving liquidity and trading activity. Within its first month, the platform launched 5 new token campaigns, with a cumulative reward pool of more than $3 million. This highlights the growing market demand for early-stage liquidity and ignition mechanisms. Rocket Launch is quickly becoming a gateway for new projects to attract initial liquidity and users, while simultaneously evolving into a major driver of Aster’s broader ecosystem growth. Advancing Infrastructure: Building an On-Chain Order-Book Layer-1 Alongside short-term incentive programs, Aster is accelerating progress on its long-term infrastructure roadmap. During a recent official AMA, the team revealed active development of a high-performance, optionally private on-chain order-book Layer-1, designed to process order placement, matching, and cancellation directly at the protocol layer. The goal is to recreate a CEX-like trading experience fully on-chain—combining transparency, self-custody, and privacy with high-speed execution. Internal testing and an initial public testnet are planned for late 2025, with mainnet launch targeted for Q1 2026. On the product side, Aster will further expand $ASTER’s utility over the next two quarters, including staking, governance, fee discounts, VIP tier benefits, airdrop eligibility, and yield-enhanced integrations with DeFi protocols. The platform has also introduced gold and index perpetuals and plans to broaden its lineup of commodities and equity-related instruments, while deepening integrations with Trust Wallet, Safepal, Math Wallet, Lista DAO, and other ecosystem partners. Expanding Global Presence and Industry Influence Aster’s international visibility also continues to grow. CEO Leonard recently spoke at Binance Campus APAC in Korea, presenting the platform’s infrastructure plans to regional industry leaders. Aster is also set to participate in Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai this December, further strengthening its global footprint. With multi-track incentives, an expanding product ecosystem, and ongoing investment in foundational infrastructure, Aster is shaping a steeper growth curve heading into 2026.

Following the strong performance of Stage 3, the platform has rolled out the Stage 4 (Harvest) airdrop program and will launch the “ Double Harvest ” trading competition on November 17 with a total reward pool of $10 million. At the same time, Aster continues to scale its early-asset product Rocket Launch , expanding the pipeline of new token activities. These incentive tracks run in parallel, enabling users to earn multiple rewards from the same trading activity, substantially increasing platform engagement and trading depth. The Stage 4 reward pool represents 1.5% of the total $ASTER supply (approximately 120,000,000 $ASTER tokens), distributed evenly across six weekly Epochs. Running concurrently, the $10 million “Double Harvest” competition features five independent weekly leaderboards, allowing users to earn both airdrop rewards and competition rewards from identical trading behavior. Rocket Launch Shows Strong Traction, Emerging as a Key Growth Engine Beyond the airdrop and trading competition, Aster Rocket Launch continues to gain momentum. The product is designed to accelerate early-stage projects by driving liquidity and trading activity. Within its first month, the platform launched 5 new token campaigns, with a cumulative reward pool of more than $3 million. This highlights the growing market demand for early-stage liquidity and ignition mechanisms. Rocket Launch is quickly becoming a gateway for new projects to attract initial liquidity and users, while simultaneously evolving into a major driver of Aster’s broader ecosystem growth. Advancing Infrastructure: Building an On-Chain Order-Book Layer-1 Alongside short-term incentive programs, Aster is accelerating progress on its long-term infrastructure roadmap. During a recent official AMA, the team revealed active development of a high-performance, optionally private on-chain order-book Layer-1, designed to process order placement, matching, and cancellation directly at the protocol layer. The goal is to recreate a CEX-like trading experience fully on-chain—combining transparency, self-custody, and privacy with high-speed execution. Internal testing and an initial public testnet are planned for late 2025, with mainnet launch targeted for Q1 2026. On the product side, Aster will further expand $ASTER’s utility over the next two quarters, including staking, governance, fee discounts, VIP tier benefits, airdrop eligibility, and yield-enhanced integrations with DeFi protocols. The platform has also introduced gold and index perpetuals and plans to broaden its lineup of commodities and equity-related instruments, while deepening integrations with Trust Wallet, Safepal, Math Wallet, Lista DAO, and other ecosystem partners. Expanding Global Presence and Industry Influence Aster’s international visibility also continues to grow. CEO Leonard recently spoke at Binance Campus APAC in Korea, presenting the platform’s infrastructure plans to regional industry leaders. Aster is also set to participate in Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai this December, further strengthening its global footprint. With multi-track incentives, an expanding product ecosystem, and ongoing investment in foundational infrastructure, Aster is shaping a steeper growth curve heading into 2026.

The $BEST presale ends in 11 days, on November 28, with $17M+ already raised and $BEST valued at $0.025955. Investors are already FOMO-diving into the presale, with a recent whale buy of $30,744 setting the pace for the remainder of the presale stage. Self custody is back in fashion. As regulation tightens and exchange blowups fade yet never quite disappear from memory, more users are parking assets in Web3 wallets. And they’re doing everything from swapping to staking without handing over their keys. That shift has put a spotlight on wallet-native tokens. Assets like Trust Wallet Token have shown that fee discounts, early access, and governance can give a wallet coin real staying power when the market turns risk on. This is the backdrop for Best Wallet Token ($BEST), the utility asset behind the Best Wallet ecosystem. The $BEST presale has already raised more than $17M, with the current token price at $0.025955 and headline staking yields in the high double digits, at 76% APY. The sale will reach its final conclusion on November 28, which leaves less than two weeks before the next phase of the project begins. Crucially, much of Best Wallet’s roadmap is still ahead of it. Features like a staking aggregator, Best Card, advanced trading tools, and gas-free transactions are mapped out but not fully live. That makes this final stretch of the presale effectively a bet on whether Best Wallet can turn its existing app into a full DeFi ecosystem over the next couple of years. ➡️ Discover more about the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) in our full review. Best Wallet Aims To Become A DeFi Control Center The Best Wallet app is already live as a non-custodial mobile crypto wallet with coming support for thousands of assets across more than 60 chains. 🔐 It uses Fireblocks’ MPC security, biometric login, and decentralized recovery rather than seed phrases, which is the kind of UX upgrade that helps new users stay on chain without sweating over losing a 12-word backup. The roadmap pushes that idea much further. Phase 3 will bring a portfolio management suite, browser extension, NFT gallery, derivatives trading, and a dedicated staking aggregator that promises higher yields with no extra wallet fees. Phase 4 will add market analytics, limit and stop loss orders, dollar cost averaging, MEV protection, and gas-free transactions, effectively turning the wallet into a full trading terminal. On top of this, Best Wallet hooks into iGaming partnerships and a planned Best Card debit product. 🏆 $BEST holders can earn higher cashback, better bonuses and reduced card fees, which pulls the token into real-world spending and gaming flows rather than leaving it as a pure governance chip. All of that utility revolves around $BEST. The token unlocks reduced swap and purchase fees, higher staking rewards, access to the best crypto presales in the in-app launchpad, and governance rights over future upgrades. If Best Wallet makes good on its plan to grow into a DeFi control center, that value should accrue first to long-term $BEST holders. ➡️ Check out our guide to buying $BEST. Final BEST Presale Phase Targets Yield And Upside The $BEST presale began in November 2024 and has moved through a long ladder of incremental price steps. 💰 After passing the $17M mark and climbing to $0.025955, the token now sits in its final stage, with the presale due to end on November 28. The global crypto wallet market, currently valued at around $15.5B, is forecast to have a hefty CAGR of 26.3%, reaching $110.7B by 2033. Best Wallet plans to dominate 40% of that market by the end of next year, which is why a fully funded roadmap is key. That’s where $BEST’s capital raise matters. Its tokenomics are relatively simple. There is a fixed supply of 10B $BEST. One-quarter is earmarked for product development, more than a third for marketing, and 8% for staking rewards, with the rest split between airdrops, exchange liquidity, community incentives and treasury. That mix leans heavily into growth and user acquisition, which makes sense for a wallet trying to win that 40% share in a crowded market. 🚀 Given Best Wallet’s ecosystem utility and long-term goals, our price prediction for $BEST sees it potentially reaching $0.05106175 by the end of 2026, once the implementation phase kicks off. Using the current presale price of $0.025955, that implies potential upside of close to 97% to the 2026 high, although actual performance will depend on adoption, listings and macro conditions. This performance and price projection makes $BEST one of the best crypto presales of 2025. Investors continue to tune in, with a recent $30,744 whale buy setting the pace for the rest of the remaining 11 days. Ready to jump in? Buy $BEST before the presale ends.

While this new regulation enhances anti–money laundering measures by making certain transactions traceable, it also introduces new challenges in maintaining user convenience. The question now is how Japan can protect investor trust while increasing transparency—a balance the market continues to search for. Explore Japan’s crypto regulations and market transparency on https://oncasitown.com/ The Travel Rule and “Partial Transparency” In 2023, Japan implemented the Travel Rule based on international standards, requiring the sharing of sender and recipient information in crypto transfers. This measure plays a crucial role in preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, marking a step forward in strengthening trust across the crypto industry. However, full traceability has not yet been achieved. While information sharing among exchanges has improved, transfers between personal wallets remain partly opaque—resulting in what can be called “partial transparency.” This policy has improved transaction safety, but users who value privacy have raised concerns. The Japanese market is currently in a transition phase, trying to balance regulatory control with the freedom of financial movement. Stricter Regulations and Shifts in Investor Sentiment Japan is known for having some of the strictest crypto regulations in Asia. Under the Financial Services Agency (FSA), exchanges must be registered and are required to segregate customer funds. This framework has significantly enhanced security, but also imposed limitations that some investors view as restrictive. In 2024, Japan eased token listing standards, fueling optimism for market revitalization. Yet, complex tax rules and restrictions on overseas exchanges remain psychological and operational barriers for many investors. As a result, market activity and capital flows have fluctuated, with more individual investors adopting a cautious approach. Striking the right balance between safety and freedom has become one of the key challenges for Japan’s crypto ecosystem. Balancing Transparency and Privacy Finding harmony between “transparency” and “privacy” remains one of Japan’s biggest crypto challenges. While improving transaction traceability enhances fraud prevention and user protection, excessive oversight risks undermining individual freedom. The real question is where to draw the line between assurance and anonymity. Some welcome stronger oversight, but others worry about privacy violations as personal data sharing expands. Japan must build systems that strengthen trust without unnecessary intrusion. Meanwhile, new approaches are emerging to combine fairness and privacy through blockchain’s inherent transparency. Ongoing collaboration between technology and regulation will determine how mature and resilient Japan’s crypto market becomes. Future Outlook — Oncasitown’s Perspective Looking ahead, Japan’s crypto market is expected to evolve in line with global standards, particularly through alignment with FATF guidelines. These reforms will likely enhance transparency, safety, and international cooperation. At the same time, the number of domestic and international users seeking both transparency and transactional freedom continues to grow. The challenge is to create a regulatory framework that protects trust while accommodating diverse user needs. At Oncasitown, we analyze these developments from both an investment and entertainment perspective, delivering insights that help readers navigate Japan’s fast-changing crypto environment.

Harvard Triples Stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs as Bitcoin Hyper Becomes the Next Crypto to Explode November 17, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Harvard Management Company just tripled its stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs as the company pumped its share holdings to 6.8M IBIT , worth over $442.8M. This comes several months after Harvard announced it was holding $116M-worth of IBIT in 1.9M shares. Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, stated that Harvard’s involvement validates BlackRock’s IBIT: It’s super rare/difficult to get an endowment to bite on an ETF- esp a Harvard or Yale, it’s as good a validation as an ETF can get. —Eric Balchunas, X Post The announcement could cause some of the hype to spill into Bitcoin, which is currently trading at little over $95K. Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $27.8M presale will likely leech some of the hyper, as the $HYPER is on track to become the next crypto to explode.

The all-new standard being rolled out by Falcon is a reflection of both demand from its users and the level it aspires to reach now that the supply of its yield-bearing stablecoin has surpassed $2B. No longer the plucky contender, USDf has evolved into a major player and serious rival to USDe. Falcon’s stablecoin protocol enables users to lock crypto assets as collateral – including plain stablecoins such as USDT and USDC – and to mint USDf. After minting the synthetic stablecoin, they can then earn yield on it through staking it in the Falcon Finance dashboard – and additionally utilize the liquid token they receive in return to explore further earning opportunities across the DeFi ecosystem. The launch of a new transparency framework attests to the progress USDf has made this year – and indicates where Falcon’s DeFi protocol is headed next. Transparency as a Service While USDf has had a very good year, the broader yield-bearing stablecoin sector has encountered the occasional speed-bump, the latest being the depeg of Stream’s xUSD, whose yield strategies were found to be deviating from delta-neutral sources – despite what its founders had claimed to the contrary. While not a USDf problem, it’s understandable that Falcon Finance should have used the opportunity to reassure users that USDf is fully backed – and that its yield is fully sustainable. Unveiling its new risk management framework, Falcon’s Andrei Garchev said: “Users should never have to guess what is backing their assets or how risk is being managed. If USDf is to serve as collateral and a yield instrument for serious builders and institutions, its reserves, custody, and controls must be transparent by default and validated by independent experts.” Putting It All on the Table Falcon Finance had already released a transparency dashboard that reveals key metrics concerning the backing for its native stablecoin, full breakdown of reserves, and yield strategy allocation. This framework has since been further enhanced by the addition of new metrics that provide an unprecedented insight into the security and risk-management parameters built into USDf . After staking USDf to create sUSDf, Falcon users can tap into a yield-bearing token that leverages diversified, institutional-grade trading strategies. Not only does Falcon enable users to view near real-time data points concerning USDf’s backing and supply, but it enlists independent auditors to provide attestation. Coupled with third-party smart contract audits, these measures have bolstered confidence in USDf, contributing to its growing adoption by retail DeFi users and institutions too. Falcon Finance believes that it can attract clients, including Web3 projects overseeing Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), seeking yield that beats the returns available from ETH staking. With yield for staked USDf currently standing at over 9%, it’s currently delivering around 2x that benchmark. Falcon’s decision to provide full transparency into its operations should help to further grow TVL while driving greater institutional adoption of yield-bearing stablecoins, now a $15B sector.

One name keeps coming up in these discussions, and many early buyers say its early traction is hard to ignore. The token is still under $0.05, but its roadmap progress and rising demand have made it a major topic in the altcoin market. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin remains one of the largest meme coins in the market. At the moment, DOGE trades near $0.16 with a market cap of around $24 billion, which already puts it among the top crypto assets. This also makes Dogecoin one of the hardest tokens to push higher in percentage terms. DOGE continues to face heavy resistance in the $0.20 to $0.22 range. Each time the price approaches this zone, sellers step in and slow down any momentum. Dogecoin is also still far below its all time high near $0.73. With its current market cap, analysts say a major surge is unlikely. Some even project that DOGE may only see a mild recovery of around 1.5x in 2026-2027 due to its limited utility and strong competition from newer tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new DeFi crypto project that is building a dual lending system designed to support both simple lending markets and more flexible borrowing tools. The protocol aims to offer a safer and more open lending experience for everyday users. It focuses on transparent smart contracts and a roadmap that explains how the system will evolve from testnet to full deployment. The MUTM presale has gained strong traction. The token is priced at $0.035 in Phase 6. So far, the project has raised $18.7 million, gathered 18,000 holders, and sold about 800 million tokens. Out of the 4 billion total supply, 45.5%, or roughly 1.82 billion, is allocated to the presale. Phase 6 is already over 88% allocated, showing consistent demand. 3 Reasons Why MUTM Could Outperform DOGE in 2026 1. Dogecoin’s High Market Cap Limits Growth, MUTM Has More Room to Expand DOGE sits at a massive market cap. Large assets with such size usually move much slower because it takes far more liquidity and interest to lift the price. Dogecoin’s early runs were possible because it had a tiny market cap and gained hype quickly. That phase is now over. MUTM is the opposite. It is still in its early stages with a low entry price and ongoing development. This gives it much more room for higher percentage growth as the protocol expands and the product reaches testnet and mainnet. 2. Dogecoin Is a Meme Coin, MUTM Is Utility Driven Dogecoin remains a meme coin with limited real use. It is mostly driven by social trends, and this can be unreliable. It also does not offer meaningful utility features such as yield generation or borrowing tools. It has no built-in mechanics that support long term growth. Mutuum Finance is built around real utility. The protocol uses mtTokens, which represent a user’s share in the liquidity pool. These mtTokens increase in value as interest is generated. The platform also uses a buy and distribute model where part of the platform revenue is used to buy MUTM from the market and redistribute it to users who stake mtTokens. This creates steady buy pressure that DOGE does not have. 3. Timing: Early DOGE Buyers Are Rotating Into MUTM Many early Dogecoin investors are now looking for new opportunities because they know DOGE’s growth window has slowed. With Mutuum Finance preparing for its first testnet release and gaining strong presale momentum, more investors are paying attention. The official statement on X confirmed that the V1 launch is set for Q4 2025, which adds even more excitement around the project. Presale Strength Mutuum Finance continues to show fast progress. The presale is advancing rapidly with Phase 6 nearing full allocation. The platform has a daily 24 hour leaderboard, where the top contributor receives rewards. This system keeps the presale active and transparent. The project also accepts MUTM payment by card, making entry easier for new buyers and removing limits on purchase size. This has helped accelerate the adoption rate. Security is another key point. The protocol completed a CertiK audit with a 90 out of 100 score, which gives investors confidence as development moves forward. Dogecoin’s massive market cap and lack of utility make high percentage gains difficult. Mutuum Finance, by contrast, is at an early growth stage with a working roadmap, strong token mechanics, and a presale that continues to expand at a fast pace. With V1 approaching in Q4 2025 and more investors rotating from older meme coins into utility projects, analysts believe MUTM could see stronger performance in 2026.

Here’s Why He’s Not Bearish,https://timestabloid.com/expert-spots-incoming-xrp-death-cross-heres-why-hes-not-bearish/,"Ledger Man (@strivex_), a crypto influencer and commentator on X, has highlighted the appearance of a death cross on XRP’s daily chart. While this signal is bearish, he offered a view that compares common expectations, adding another angle for market participants to consider. $XRP DEATH CROSS INCOMING! History repeat itself. pic.twitter.com/bXzQNnw2Mr — Ledger Man (@strivex_) November 15, 2025 Historical Context of the Signal In his video, he stated that the recent death cross should not cause concern because similar events preceded significant rallies in prior cycles. He said the pattern in 2017 “marked the exact low” of that market period before XRP advanced sharply. During that cycle, XRP rose from $0.006 to $3.36 in early 2018. The increase reached about 55,900%. He also noted that a similar death cross in 2020 “marked the exact low” of that bear market. XRP then moved from about $0.115 to $1.96 in 2021, gaining roughly 1,604%. His comments reflect a view that the current setup may repeat those earlier moves even though many traders usually interpret a death cross as a negative signal. He emphasized that the same pattern now appears again and suggested that XRP “is most likely about to go much higher.” XRP Potential Price Projections Market observers now evaluate how the historical gains compare with today’s price. XRP recently traded near $2.18. Applying the percentage increase from the 2017 cycle would produce a theoretical target far above typical market expectations. A gain of 55,900% from $2.18 would place XRP at about $1,220. Using the 1,604% rise recorded after the 2020 death cross would generate a target of over $37. While other traders have warned about a potential decline due to this death cross , Ledger Man’s analysis suggests a massive bull run for the digital asset.

Market Outlook Current sentiment varies as traders assess technical signals in market activity. Some might dig deeper, monitoring trading volume and momentum to determine whether the present setup matches earlier cycles.

However, with the advent of on-chain tech, this status quo is going through a major revamp, with ‘personal intelligence layers’ (PIL) representing one of the more intriguing evolutions in this context (at least over the last couple of years). Rather than forcing users to choose between privacy and participation, these layers allow users to maintain encrypted control over their data while simultaneously enabling AI systems to process that information for personalized insights. In fact, the privacy-preserving AI market has fast gained traction and is expected to grow at an annual rate of 27% over the next four year stretch. The broader implications of these PILs, therefore, challenges fundamental assumptions about ownership and monetization because rather than accepting the notion that personal information needs to be surrendered to access digital services, decentralized models can treat data as assets users can control, selectively share, and potentially monetize. All of this is especially pertinent in light of recent policy shifts such as the EU's Data Act, (implemented in 2023) which encourage open access to financial data while maintaining privacy protections. Therefore, as AI agents become more capable of executing complex tasks, they need negotiation frameworks and commitment mechanisms to interact with each other as well as human users. In this regard, intent-based architectures are perfect as they allow agents to operate across different systems while maintaining security and reliability guarantees.​ Exploring the industry’s evolution toward actionable insights Since the turn of the decade, specific implementations have begun translating personal intelligence concepts into accessible consumer products, with products like ConsumerFi building infrastructure that converts fragmented consumer data into what can be best described as ""user-owned intelligence."" The system operates through an encrypted data structure called ‘ConsumerGraph,’ which functions as a portable memory bank of digital activity, leveraging NEAR AI for private data processing and NEAR Intents for executing actions across multiple blockchains. This transforms everyday interactions into financial opportunities, be it earning rewards for data sharing or making investment decisions based on personalized insights. Most recently, ConsumerFi made its debut on the popular launchpad Calyx, making these privacy-centric concepts even more accessible to a broader audience. The token sale began on November 13, offering 25 million CFI tokens (approx 2.5% of its total billion-token supply), with participation requiring only connecting a wallet on any supported chain and deploying assets through a single transaction. The sale reached its funding target in just 1.5 hours. Notably, the funding target was reached ahead of schedule, with seven days remaining in the sale window, thus unearthing a lot of market validation for the technology. In addition to this, ConsumerFi has also secured investments for major crypto-native entities such as Animoca Brands, Morningstar Ventures, Cypher Capital, Shima Capital, and the NEAR Foundation. 🪷 Funding Target Reached! 🪷Meaning: you still have 7 days to participate in the @ConsumerFi sale ✨Calyx 🪷 pic.twitter.com/i3EkT1dirE — Calyx (@Calyxdotxyz) November 13, 2025 That said, what distinguishes this launch from other token offerings is the existing scale operating behind it as ConsumerFi already operates across applications totaling more than 170 million downloads. A market shift toward personal intelligence layers is in the offing As agentic solutions continue to proliferate, it is only natural that the infrastructure managing consumer data worldwide (and therefore enabling private AI processing) will become increasingly critical.​ And while scalability and interoperability concerns definitely exist, platforms like ConsumerFi are ushering in a much required shift, one where privacy and verification can be balanced. That said, the fundamental proposition that individuals should be able to own their data and benefit monetarily when it creates value, seems to be resonating with demographics and geographies across the board. Therefore, as the landscape matures and more implementations reach production scale, personal intelligence layers will increasingly represent an inevitable evolution of how the internet handles information for the years to come.

The HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) said last week that the launch transitions the initiative from a sandbox experiment to a live value-bearing settlement. The HKMA described the project as pivotal for the country’s crypto roadmap, adding that the city is working towards becoming the region’s crypto hub. The new pilot is expected to operate through 2026 and will initially focus on treasury management, tokenized money-market fund transactions, and real-time liquidity. The Hong Kong de facto central bank initiated the sandbox for Project Ensemble in August 2024, aiming to integrate tokenization into traditional banking through the e-HKD. The sandbox has enabled banks and industry partners to experiment with tokenized deposits and test end-to-end crypto settlement. The HKMA also stated that the HKD Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system will support inter-bank settlements under the pilot. It pointed out that the environment will be upgraded over time to support around-the-clock (24/7) tokenized central bank money (CeBM) settlement. Yue says Ensemble Sandbox concepts are now live The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Eddie Yue, said EnsembleTX marks a pivotal moment in the HKMA’s journey. He pointed out that the concepts and details tested in the Ensemble Sandbox are now live and being applied in real-value transactions to deliver tangible benefits. Meanwhile, the HKMA said this milestone reinforces Hong Kong’s role as a pioneer in shaping the future of digital finance. The central bank institution has invited stakeholders with innovative, real-world use cases that leverage tokenized deposits to participate in this collaborative effort to develop the tokenization ecosystem in Hong Kong. “To scale tokenization of investment products, interoperability is key…A critical step in that direction is today’s initiative announced by the HKMA which will gradually allow interbank settlement of tokenized deposits in real time 24/7.” – Julia Leung , CEO of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) Leung said the SFC is committed to working with the HKMA and market participants in driving tokenization use cases leveraging Ensemble TX forward. She believes this will help establish a dynamic and future-ready financial ecosystem in Hong Kong. HSBC completes first transaction in EnsembleTX The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation completed the first transaction in EnsembleTX on November 13. Ant International transferred $489,000 (~HK$3.8M) in this inaugural transaction to its wallet held at another domestic bank. Vincent Lau, HSBC’s global head of Digital Money and Global Payments Solutions, said the interoperability marks a crucial step for Hong Kong to become a global hub for innovation in crypto. Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong), a subsidiary of Standard Chartered PLC, also completed two transactions leveraging two real-value use cases in EnsembleTX. The first case involved interbank tokenized deposit transfers among Ant International entities. Meanwhile, the second case involved the transfer of tokenized deposits to help Futu Securities International (Hong Kong) subscribe to China Asset Management (Hong Kong)’s tokenized money market fund (MMF). Mary Huen, the CEO of Standard Chartered (Hong Kong) and Greater China and North Asia, said the success of these real-value transactions use cases demonstrated the massive potential of tokenized assets in facilitating interbank settlements. She also noted that tokenized deposits will play an integral role in the next generation of financial market infrastructure. The 2025 Policy Address unveiled plans to push Project Ensemble, encouraging commercial banks to introduce tokenized deposits and promote the live trading of tokenized assets. The HKMA and the SFC will collaborate to advance the practical applications of tokenization across a diverse range of asset classes. The two have also vowed to expand EnsembleTX’s use cases to cover more sectors within the financial industry.

Digital asset funds just witnessed their largest weekly outflow since February, with a staggering $2 billion pulled out in just seven days. This massive movement signals growing investor concern and highlights the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments. Why Are Digital Asset Funds Bleeding Money? According to CoinShares’ latest report, the outflow from digital asset funds reached alarming levels last week. The United States dominated these withdrawals, accounting for nearly 98% of the total outflows. This represents the most significant capital flight from cryptocurrency investment products we’ve seen in months. The breakdown by asset reveals even more concerning patterns: Bitcoin investment products suffered $1.38 billion in outflows Ethereum products recorded $689 million in withdrawals Total assets under management dropped 27% to $191 billion What’s Driving This Massive Capital Flight? CoinShares points to two primary factors behind this dramatic outflow from digital asset funds. First, uncertainty surrounding monetary policy has made investors increasingly cautious. Second, broader selling pressure across cryptocurrency markets has created a domino effect. The timing couldn’t be more telling. Total assets under management in digital asset exchange-traded products have fallen sharply from their October peak of $264 billion. This represents a significant contraction in the institutional cryptocurrency space. How Does This Impact Your Crypto Investments? When digital asset funds experience such substantial outflows, it affects the entire ecosystem. Large-scale withdrawals can: Increase market volatility Put downward pressure on prices Signal changing investor sentiment Impact liquidity across exchanges However, it’s crucial to remember that outflows from digital asset funds don’t necessarily predict long-term trends. Historical data shows that cryptocurrency markets often experience cycles of inflows and outflows. What Does the Future Hold for Digital Asset Funds? The current situation with digital asset funds reflects broader market uncertainties. While the $2 billion outflow seems dramatic, it represents a natural market correction following previous growth periods. Institutional interest in digital asset funds remains strong despite short-term fluctuations. As regulatory frameworks evolve and market infrastructure improves, digital asset funds are likely to continue attracting institutional capital. The current outflow may present buying opportunities for long-term investors who believe in the fundamental value of blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the $2 billion outflow from digital asset funds? The outflow resulted from combined factors including monetary policy uncertainty and broader selling pressure across cryptocurrency markets. Which country saw the largest withdrawals? The United States accounted for $1.97 billion of the total $2 billion outflow from digital asset funds. How much did Bitcoin and Ethereum products lose? Bitcoin investment products lost $1.38 billion, while Ethereum products saw $689 million in withdrawals. What’s the current total assets under management? Total AUM in digital asset ETPs has fallen to $191 billion, down 27% from October’s peak of $264 billion. Is this the largest outflow ever recorded? No, this is the largest weekly outflow since February, but not the largest in history. Should investors be worried about this trend? While concerning, outflows are normal in volatile markets and don’t necessarily indicate long-term trends.

This essentially indicates a growing divergence between activity on Binance and behavior in institutional channels. Retail Selling vs Institutional Absorption Data shows Bitcoin exchange inflows on Binance have surged sharply in recent days, as the figure rose from 5,500 BTC to nearly 15,000 BTC on November 14. CryptoQuant stated that this spike points to intense selling pressure from short-term holders and traders unwinding long positions as prices fell. Additionally, the Binance BTC RHODL Inflow indicator shows a notable increase in the share of younger coins entering the exchange, alongside an almost complete collapse in older coin inflows. Such a pattern is evidence that panicked short-term investors, not long-term holders, are behind the selling. The same cannot be said for institutional activity, which appears far more measured. Balances at OTC desks have been found to have climbed to roughly 156,000 BTC, after rising by nearly 7,300 BTC over the past month. This has been identified as the highest level since August. While this does not indicate aggressive institutional buying, CryptoQuant explained that institutions are not selling into the downturn and are instead quietly absorbing liquidity off-exchange. This steady accumulation is occurring without any major acceleration in demand, which could mean that institutions are using the pullback to reposition rather than exit. Redistribution Or Bear Market? Even as prices retreat, long-term investor appetite for Bitcoin is only strengthening. For instance, the Accumulator Addresses Demand indicator has now climbed past 352,000 BTC, with its 30-day moving average rising steadily. This trend shows that committed, long-horizon buyers are continuing to add to their positions, which confirms that Bitcoin is slowly moving out of weaker hands and into more resilient, patient portfolios. According to the analytics platform, the market is now in a redistribution phase, where Bitcoin moves out of speculative, short-term holdings and into the portfolios of larger and more committed investors. Such transitions have historically led to periods of stabilization and can help lay the groundwork for renewed upside momentum if institutional demand continues. However, not all interpret the recent market behavior through the same lens. Kobeissi Letter, for one, believes that the crypto asset has officially entered a structural bear market, one driven not by weak fundamentals but by deep mechanical pressures. Excess leverage, thin liquidity, and more than $1 billion wipeouts across multiple sessions clearly mean that the market is breaking under its own weight.

The message came as SHIB faced renewed market pressure, which pushed the token below the $0.000009 mark. At the time of writing, the memecoin is trading at $0.000009072, suggesting a 1.23% decline in the last 24 hours. Team Hints at “Wallet-Friendly” and “Useful” Initiative The Shiba Inu team shared a brief yet strategic message stating, “Something new is coming for the ShibArmy.” The update highlighted three clues that pointed to the nature of the integration, describing it as “wallet-friendly, unmistakably SHIB, and useful.” The teaser included an eye emoji and a credit-card emoji, which drew immediate reactions from community members seeking to decode the message. The post also tagged the official Bitget Wallet account, adding another layer to the speculation. Bitget’s comment, “Very SHIB indeed,” reinforced expectations that the initiative involved both parties. The Shiba Inu team urged the community to make informed guesses, noting that full details would be released soon. Bitget Wallet also joined the conversation by quoting the teaser and asking users to submit “wrong guesses only,” a move that kept the discussion active and playful. The timing of the teaser played a role in restoring sentiment. SHIB had dropped to lows around $0.0000086 during the weekend slump, raising concerns among holders. The announcement shifted attention away from price pressure and toward potential utility expansion. Speculation Points Toward Payments or Wallet Integration The credit-card emoji and Bitget Wallet tag led to linking the upcoming initiative to payment solutions. Some argued that the reveal could involve a SHIB-branded credit or debit card or an upgrade to existing wallet features. Others believed the partnership could streamline how users trade, manage, or cash out SHIB within Bitget Wallet. Bitget has already integrated Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 network, Shibarium, which allows users to store, send, receive, stake, and swap SHIB. This capability strengthened assumptions that the next step may enhance Shibarium’s presence within the wallet. The Shiba Inu team also confirmed that more details about the integration would appear “super soon.” This assurance kept the community engaged during the ongoing price dip and maintained focus on the roadmap.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 11:12:17

Apeing Whitelist: The Instinct-First Entry to the Best Upcoming Crypto Presale Apeing knows how degens think. People don’t want thousand-page whitepapers. They want early price, early spot, early advantage, and a fun community that is hungry to flip profits. The whitelist guarantees exactly that. Everyone who joins early is in Stage 1, meaning maximum potential upside when momentum explodes. Instead of hoping to buy dips later, whitelist entries start at the dip. This is why Apeing is labeled the best upcoming crypto presale by communities searching for urgency, not patience. Crypto never rewards slow hands. It rewards anyone willing to click “Join Whitelist” instead of waiting for someone else to say it’s time. In crypto terms: If you’re not early… you’re exit liquidity. How to Join the Apeing Whitelist (Simple + Fast) Visit the official Apeing platform. Enter your email. Confirm your spot. Prepare for Stage 1 allocation. People think crypto success takes complex strategies. Often, it takes one move at the right moment. That moment might be right now. Dogecoin Loses Momentum as Market Turns Risk-Aware Dogecoin remains a cultural juggernaut. Its meme power is unmatched. Tesla jokes, dog mascots, and viral stunts keep it alive. But price-wise, the market is no longer rewarding nostalgia, it is rewarding what’s next. DOGE holders still believe in long-term potential, and that’s fair. But recent sideways movement shows the excitement isn’t in the majors or even the classic memecoins. Degens want new adrenaline. They want access before influencers notice. This is exactly why interest rotates away from familiar giants when early-stage opportunities appear. The next bull run often begins with fresh narratives. And traders now ask the same question: Where is the next 50x hiding? Increasingly, the answer looks like the best upcoming crypto presale that focuses on early access + instinct-first action. And that leads to one project: Apeing. Shiba Inu Waits for Another Catalyst While Traders Look Elsewhere Shiba Inu has built one of the biggest communities in the world. It has NFTs, Shibarium scaling, staking… the whole deal. But community alone doesn’t pump charts in uncertain markets. Investors are waiting for a clear catalyst. A new listing, a huge burn event, an ecosystem unlock. Something that gives the market a reason to move before the crowd arrives late again. While SHIB recalibrates, the ones who want to enter before hype prefer locking positions in an upcoming crypto presale where upside isn’t capped by previous cycles. They want a clean slate, early allocation, and a narrative built for the current moment: Act fast. Win faster. Final Thoughts: In Crypto, Instinct Beats Patience Dogecoin and Shiba Inu will always be legends. They started the movement that brought memes into the financial world. But the future belongs to those who chase what comes next. Right now, Apeing shows every sign of being the best upcoming crypto presale, built specifically for the same type of early degen who turned DOGE and SHIB into monsters in the first place. The whitelist is open. The entry is early. The window is shrinking. The question is simple: Do you act faster than the market… or do you wait and watch others win? For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) FAQ About the Upcoming Crypto Presale What is the best upcoming crypto presale for early entry gains? Apeing is currently viewed as the best upcoming crypto presale because whitelist access gives early entrants the lowest price, maximizing ROI potential before demand drives valuation higher. Can Apeing outperform Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the next market run? Apeing targets early-stage momentum that Dogecoin and Shiba Inu no longer offer. If hype accelerates, Apeing could outperform established meme coins due to its fast-moving community and early access mechanics. How does a whitelist help in an upcoming crypto presale? Whitelisting secures guaranteed participation at the earliest pricing tier. This reduces risk, avoids FOMO buying later, and positions investors ahead of the public wave, especially in high-demand meme projects like Apeing. Summary This editorial explains why Apeing ($APEING) is currently viewed as the best upcoming crypto presale opportunity in the market. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu still hold strong communities, both lack immediate catalysts to fuel aggressive growth. Traders searching for early-stage gains are now pivoting toward Apeing, where whitelist access ensures the lowest entry price and higher profit potential when hype grows. The article highlights current market rotations, early investor behavior patterns, and why instinctual fast action drives outsized returns in meme-driven markets. It also reinforces the importance of timing, community momentum, and exclusive early allocations in determining future winners. Dogecoin wags, Shiba Inu waits, and Apeing wins because it rewards the same boldness that created previous breakout tokens. The whitelist is open, the window is shrinking, and the choice is clear: act early or watch later. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, we’re witnessing a massive Bitcoin whale hand-over that could reshape the entire cryptocurrency landscape. This isn’t your typical market correction – it’s a fundamental transfer of power from old-guard holders to new institutional players. What Exactly is This Bitcoin Whale Hand-Over? The recent market downturn isn’t cause for panic. Instead, it represents a strategic transfer between long-term Bitcoin holders and traditional finance institutions. Existing Bitcoin whales are systematically selling their supply to traditional finance players who plan to hold these assets for the long term. This Bitcoin whale hand-over marks a significant evolution in market structure that could stabilize prices in the future. Why Did CryptoQuant’s CEO Predict This Shift? Ki Young Ju had foreseen this market top earlier this year when he observed original Bitcoin whales engaging in large-scale sell-offs. However, the current situation differs dramatically because: New players like spot ETFs are injecting fresh liquidity Traditional cycle theories are becoming less relevant Institutional money is creating more stable foundations How Are Institutions Changing the Bitcoin Game? The Bitcoin whale hand-over involves more than just changing ownership. Major financial entities are now building substantial liquidity channels that could transform how Bitcoin behaves in markets. We’re seeing: Pension funds entering the space Sovereign wealth funds allocating capital Multi-asset funds diversifying into Bitcoin Corporate bonds creating new investment vehicles What Does This Mean for Traditional Cycle Theories? The conventional wisdom about Bitcoin cycles may no longer apply. As this massive Bitcoin whale hand-over continues, the old patterns of boom and bust could become less predictable. The influx of institutional money creates more stable foundations that might smooth out volatility over time. Final Thoughts: A New Era for Bitcoin This strategic Bitcoin whale hand-over represents more than just price movements – it signals Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class. The transition from individual whales to institutional holders could bring greater stability and legitimacy to cryptocurrency markets. While short-term volatility might continue, the long-term implications point toward broader adoption and institutional acceptance. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin whale hand-over? A Bitcoin whale hand-over occurs when large, long-term Bitcoin holders transfer their assets to institutional investors, creating a fundamental shift in market ownership structure. How does this affect Bitcoin’s price stability? Institutional holders typically have longer investment horizons, which could reduce volatility and create more stable price foundations over time. Are traditional Bitcoin cycle theories still valid? According to CryptoQuant’s analysis, traditional cycle theories may become less effective as institutional money creates new market dynamics. What types of institutions are buying Bitcoin now? Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, multi-asset funds, and corporate bond investors are increasingly participating in Bitcoin markets. How long will this transition period last? The hand-over process could continue for several months as institutions gradually accumulate positions from existing whales. Should retail investors be concerned about this shift? This transition likely benefits long-term investors by bringing more stability and institutional validation to Bitcoin markets.

Wynn wrote his warning on X Sunday after a fabricated news story circulated on social media claiming that Jurrien Timmer, the Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Investments, predicted Zcash would soar to 108,000 by 2028. 🇺🇸 Fidelity predicts that one #Zcash $ZEC will be worth $100,000 by 2028 pic.twitter.com/YPzQ0J22wH — Crypto Guru (@BDCryptoGuru) November 16, 2025 In his post, Wynn wrote: “Don’t buy Zcash, it’s an orchestrated pump and dump by the influencer cabal. Do I really need to be the one to say this?” Crypto traders claim Zcash early buyers are looking for exit liquidity Several other traders share Wynn’s concerns, pointing to a pattern they said resembled earlier hype-driven surges that ended in collapses after early bird investors sold their coins during market peaks to take profits. Crypto trader Rajat Soni criticized the sudden enthusiasm for Zcash , writing: “This is why I will never buy Zcash; they need exit liquidity. Buy at your own risk. You might get dumped on the second you own it.” The warnings are a complete contrast to the optimism expressed by some crypto KOLs, who believe the privacy coin has been around for years and has enough market credibility to beat the pump-and-dump allegations. The 2016-launched blockchain privacy project is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses zk-SNARK zero-knowledge proofs, which enables nodes to confirm transactions without revealing info such as the sender’s wallet address. Transactions are still broadcast on a public blockchain, but Zcash conceals addresses and transaction amounts by default. However, users can still choose to reveal transaction data for auditing or regulatory purposes. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley pushed back against attempts to frame Zcash as illegitimate or suspicious. Horsley argued that naysayers who insist only Bitcoin is the legitimate crypto would have a hard time convincing the community that Zcash is a scam outright. “The ‘Bitcoin only, everything else is a scam’ crowd is going to get really twisted trying to figure out what to say about Zcash. Looking forward to the creative explanations of why Zcash is not ‘crypto'” ~ Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley Another KOL, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, has made several posts on X endorsing Zcash , claiming in late October that ZEC was superior to XRP, and stating that the token’s chart was “just so stronk I aped more.” In another post, he said that “all he wants for Christmas is ZEC.” Transaction data from Arkham Intelligence showed he was offloading substantial amounts of other digital assets over the weekend. Hayes sold 520 ETH worth $1.66 million, 2.62 million ENA valued at $733,000, and 132,730 ETHFI worth $124,000 late Saturday. Despite these sales, Hayes had not moved the capital into another position, though speculation grew that he may be preparing to buy Zcash and wait for an end-of-the-year market rout. Winklevoss-backed firm pivots fully into a Zcash treasury Last week, Leap Therapeutics announced a $58.88 million private placement led by Winklevoss Capital. The investment firm, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in 2012, launched the Gemini crypto exchange in 2014. Following the investment, Leap Therapeutics said it would convert into a crypto treasury company named Cypherpunk Technologies Inc., to accumulate Zcash’s token, ZEC. The company disclosed it had already used $50 million from the placement to buy 203,775.27 ZEC at an average price of $245.37. “We’ve taken a different path by building a syndicate of value-aligned investors who believe in the long-term importance of Zcash and privacy for the United States and the world,” reckoned Cypherpunk Chief Investment Officer Will McEvoy. Zcash’s token reacted positively to the news, jumping from a weekly low of $437 and continuing its upward move to a high of $735 earlier today. The asset reclaimed a supply zone between $520 and $540 before moving decisively through a confirmation zone at $700. Its price returned to local highs near $740 to respect a trendline that has supported the rally over the past week, then succumbed to a broader market correction that wiped 4% off its value, and has now settled at around $670 at the time of this publication.

Tiger Research’s eye-opening analysis reveals exactly what went wrong and how the industry can build stronger safeguards for the future. What Caused the Stream Finance Crisis? Tiger Research’s investigation uncovered critical failures in Stream Finance’s operations. The project claimed to use market-neutral strategies for stable returns, but operated with concerning opacity. The firm found no proof of reserves or confirmed insurance fund, creating massive vulnerability in their system. The trigger came when CBB raised alarms about xUSD’s borrowing practices. The stablecoin had borrowed $530 million against only $170 million in on-chain collateral – a dangerous 4.1 times leverage ratio. This risky position became unsustainable when Balancer experienced a hack, sparking investor panic and mass withdrawals. Why Is Risk Management So Critical in DeFi? Effective risk management serves as the foundation for any sustainable DeFi project. Without proper safeguards, even minor market disruptions can trigger catastrophic failures. The Stream Finance collapse demonstrates how quickly problems can spread throughout the ecosystem. The contagion effect impacted multiple projects including: MEV Capital Elixir’s deUSD Compound Yei Finance This domino effect highlights why comprehensive risk management isn’t just optional – it’s essential for ecosystem stability. How Can We Implement Better Risk Management? Tiger Research proposes concrete solutions to strengthen the entire DeFi sector. Their recommendations focus on creating accountability and transparency where it’s most needed. The key improvements include: Independent risk assessments by objective third-party evaluators Structural mechanisms that impose direct accountability on project operators Regular audits and transparent reporting practices Clear collateral requirements with real-time monitoring What Does This Mean for DeFi’s Future? The Stream Finance crisis serves as a crucial learning opportunity for the entire cryptocurrency space. Proper risk management practices can transform how projects operate and protect investors from similar disasters. As the industry matures, implementing robust risk management frameworks becomes non-negotiable. Projects that prioritize transparency and accountability will likely attract more institutional interest and mainstream adoption. FAQs: Understanding Risk Management in DeFi What exactly is risk management in cryptocurrency? Risk management involves strategies and systems that identify, assess, and mitigate potential threats to protect investments and maintain system stability in decentralized finance. How could risk management have prevented the Stream Finance collapse? Proper risk management would have required transparent collateral reporting, independent audits, and leverage limits that could have prevented the 4.1x over-borrowing situation. What are the most important risk management practices for DeFi projects? Essential practices include regular independent audits, transparent proof of reserves, insurance funds, collateral monitoring, and clear emergency response plans. How can investors identify projects with good risk management? Look for projects that provide regular audit reports, transparent collateral documentation, independent risk assessments, and clear communication about their safety measures. Why does poor risk management affect the entire DeFi ecosystem? Because DeFi protocols are interconnected, failures in one project can create domino effects that impact multiple other platforms and their users. What role do regulators play in DeFi risk management? While DeFi operates largely outside traditional regulation, industry standards and self-regulation through best practices are emerging to fill this gap. Help protect the crypto community by sharing this crucial analysis on social media.

Diverse content is now available on the go, a deep contrast to the old days when we were all tuned to the same channels. Despite the evolution, certain persistent challenges continue to affect content creators, streaming platforms, and their audiences. In this interview, we explore a disruptive solution, Technotainment, with Wesley Ellul, its president and head of strategy. Technotainment is a platform leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence to redefine content streaming through more interactive experiences that drive greater revenue. So, we started by asking Wesley about his experience in the entertainment industry. Wesley’s experience in the entertainment industry spans two decades. He started as a club DJ on the island of Malta, where he also worked as an actor. He later transitioned to directing various shows, becoming the first English-language director of Spring Awakening outside the West End and New York. In 2005, Wesley founded his first tech company, Find It, an online business directory for Malta. “I’ve just loved the entertainment space, making people smile and happy was always a big part of my life. I also became heavily involved in the tech world. I’ve been building tech businesses since 2005.” He would later open another company, Untangled Media, a search engine optimization and internet marketing firm. After Untangled Media, Wesley moved into a full-time role as president of Technotainment. Streaming 2.0 with Technotainment We then asked Wesley about the market gap for a platform like Technotainment. Regarding the market gap, Wesley highlighted the contrast between the significant funds spent on creating content and the small returns, noting that the only beneficiaries were the content platforms. He continued to explain that subscription and advertising models only worked when there was a limited number of content channels. Technotainment proposed a new business model that leveraged blockchain technology to introduce new revenue sources. “… we can actually increase revenue sevenfold by introducing new revenue points into the ecosystem. But at the same time, we’re asking viewers to pay less.” The model charges viewers who want a deeper content experience, say a small fee of $2, to watch entire series—a win-win scenario for content creators, streaming platforms, and viewers. Technotainment would serve as the infrastructure layer, while also building a platform to showcase its potential. Wesley went on to introduce a team member, Nile, who is skilled at identifying niche markets poised to perform. Nile is a founder of MTV, Nickelodeon, Country Music Television, pay-per-view television, and the Home Shopping Network. “He (Nile) has identified seven major areas where we will be focusing on the first element of content in Technotainment.” Some of these areas include smart music, movies, sports, faith and values, and self-improvement. These channels didn’t receive the attention they needed, preventing them from having deeper experiences. We then shifted to how Technotainment is using blockchain technology. Wesley shared that blockchain technology will enable Technotainment to integrate new revenue streams. The streams include advertisements, subscriptions, merchandise, and personalized experiences. “In fact, we have an entire AI-driven click-and-buy approach for even the clothes they’re (actors/ performers) wearing.” For all these to work, they require extensive tracking, trust, significant costs, and administration, and that’s where blockchain technology comes in. The technology, by utilizing smart contracts, enables microtransactions, lower costs, and asset tracking. Blockchain will also be used for licensing, staking, and securing the network through its decentralized nodes. Another important aspect is how film, social, and commerce converge to boost engagement. To elaborate, Wesley highlighted a curious observation they made following a study on why the film and TV industries were losing money. Interestingly, they found out that the decline began precisely when the iPhone was released. According to Wesley, the introduction of the iPhone shifted people’s attention from watching the same thing on TV. Attention turned to content on the iPhone, which had social platforms like Facebook and Twitter at the time. Suddenly, people were doing different things, diluting the immersive experience of entertainment. Later, multiplayer games appeared on iPhones, bringing people together through talk/chat interfaces. “This was about the same time when they started bringing multiplayer games together with talk and chat features. And what did that do? That skyrocketed these games to another level, turning them into social spaces to play and engage. You’re all immersed in the same thing. The content and community were essentially reunited.” According to him, as a result of this union, the gaming industry is now worth more than the film, television, and movie market combined. Well, because community and content reside in the same place. Technotainment creates a social feed, tied to specific channels, that enables creators to produce their own videos, live streams, podcasts, and memes, among other types of content. The social feed builds community champions, and as more people engage, the community will become stronger, benefiting everyone. Wesley also highlighted two types of commerce that they plan to integrate into the channels: Artificial intelligence that can screen-read every shot, allowing the audience to select items, say a table, dress, or makeup, know what it is, and buy it there and then. Merchandise sales, including digital drops and live experiences, on the same platform. Creators can integrate hotel bookings, flights, and live experiences on their content. “When we run the numbers, we see that it’s about a seven times additional return….And it’s all because you have a place where a group of people who care about the same thing come together in the same space, talking and engaging with each other.“ What’s in it for the audience? For audiences, according to Wesley, there will be better engagement and response rates. “Me sending out a Stranger Things meme on Twitter when I have no audience that watches Stranger Things, it just means the content’s going to die. Whereas, when I create a Stranger Things meme on the Stranger Things page next to the Stranger Things content with a community of people who love Stranger Things, means I’m getting a lot more feedback.” Beyond that, the audience will create content valued by others and, therefore, be rewarded; that’s where the ecosystem’s native token, Cast, comes in. The audience can earn Cast tokens for marketing the content. Wesley continued to explain that there will also be benefits for producers through “microcasting sites.” The sites enable producers to control their audience and content. Big streaming players will then be like community billboards for what content is available and will also be rewarded. Monetization and the Cast token Monetization is an essential aspect of every streaming platform. We asked Wesley how this works at Technotainment. In his opinion, the first episode would be free, and then a small fee for additional experiences, adopting a subscription model. Additionally, there would be the commercial angle, which he mentioned earlier, as well as affiliate revenue from other experiences. There would also be a gamification feature that lets people play games related to the content, use their skills, and win prizes. How does the Cast token fit in to create value and boost engagement? The Cast token acts as the legal tender within the Technotainment ecosystem. It will enable low-cost transactions and fast peer-to-peer settlements. The token will be tradable for real funds on crypto exchanges. The team and why relationships matter in the entertainment industry We began by asking about Technotainment’s competitors in the space Wesley identified multiple IP-related entertainment projects in the space; however, he lauded Technotainment’s team and relationships as standout features. “This is the first time you’ll see a team of people from the Hollywood era of the entertainment industry, where they’re all focused on Hollywood and entertainment, and there’s only one Web3 representative…It’s not Web3 going into Hollywood. We’re Hollywood, bringing Web3 in.” We went on to inquire about the importance of a team’s background in a highly competitive industry. Wesley began by emphasizing the significance of relationships in the entertainment industry. “You cannot walk in there and say, ‘I’m going to change things.’ We can’t walk in there and say, ‘We’re going to change things.’” He then mentioned that Technotainment is working with several strategic partners, with others in the process of onboarding, including World Mobile and Singularity.net. The Technotainment team comprised individuals who have worked with prominent names in the space, making it easy to initiate these conversations and open doors. Wesley also had a piece of advice for tech founders: “Everything is about relationships. No matter how good your tech is, no matter how amazing things are, if you cannot build relationships, you’re dead in the water. “ What’s next for Technotainment? Wesley shared that Technotainment is fundraising, an effort he expects to conclude by January 2026. The Cast token generation event is expected to take place sometime around March 2026, contingent upon achieving set milestones, such as the target number of community members or partnerships. If all goes to plan, the platform will launch in the first week of September 2026. “In the meantime, we’ll be launching activations and events, and giving people an idea of why Technotainment is the most special project to hit the web3 space in a while.” So, how can you be part of the Technotainment ecosystem?

Key Takeaways: Digital asset products recorded $2 billion in weekly outflows, extending a three-week total to $3.2 billion. Analysts blamed the downturn on monetary policy uncertainty and heavy whale selling. Bitcoin and Ethereum products saw the largest withdrawals, while multi-asset funds attracted modest inflows. The sell-off marked the third consecutive week of withdrawals, bringing total outflows over the period to $3.2 billion, according to a Monday report from CoinShares . The slump follows sharp price declines across major cryptocurrencies, which have pushed total assets under management in digital asset ETPs down 27% from their early-October peak of $264 billion to $191 billion. Whale Selling and Fed Uncertainty Blamed for Crypto Market Slide Analysts cited ongoing monetary policy uncertainty and aggressive selling from crypto-native whale wallets as the main drivers behind the downturn. The US accounted for the overwhelming share of outflows, with $1.97 billion leaving U.S.-based products. Switzerland and Hong Kong followed at a distance, recording $39.9 million and $12.3 million in outflows. Germany stood out as the lone bright spot, attracting $13.2 million in inflows as local investors treated the correction as a buying opportunity. Bitcoin products saw the largest withdrawals, shedding $1.38 billion last week, a three-week bleed equal to roughly 2% of total Bitcoin ETP assets under management. Ethereum fared even worse on a proportional basis, with $689 million in outflows representing 4% of its ETP market. Solana and XRP recorded smaller pullbacks of $8.3 million and $15.5 million. Despite the broader risk-off sentiment, multi-asset investment products attracted $69 million in inflows over the past three weeks as investors sought diversification. Short-Bitcoin ETPs also saw renewed interest as traders positioned defensively amid the ongoing correction. Last week, Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.11 billion net outflows.

The withdrawals coincided with a sharp market correction, as Bitcoin slid nearly 10% to around $95,740, raising concerns that one of the asset’s strongest institutional demand engines is slowing. According to Matrixport, the downturn reflects weakening market momentum, fading ETF inflows, and reduced exposure from long-term holders, all unfolding in an environment with no immediate macro catalysts. The firm described the situation as the beginning of a “mini bear market,” adding that Bitcoin’s next major move will likely depend on upcoming Federal Reserve policy decisions. #MatrixOnTarget Report – November 14, 2025 Signals to Watch in Bitcoin’s Mini-Bear Market #Matrixport #Bitcoin #CryptoMarkets #MarketCycle #OnchainData #BTCFlows #RiskManagement #MatrixOnTarget pic.twitter.com/6yHv8t6vsI — Matrixport Official (@Matrixport_EN) November 14, 2025 While Bitcoin and Ether ETFs struggled, spot Solana ETFs continued to attract capital, posting $12 million in inflows on Friday and extending their streak to 13 consecutive days since launching on Oct. 29. Despite the divergence in ETF flows, Solana still fell 15% over the week, while Ether dropped 11%, underscoring broad weakness across crypto markets.

It stood at around $3.25 trillion as Bitcoin went on a dip below $93,000 on Monday morning. Bitcoin’s Nasdaq correlation spikes As per the data shared by the Kobeissi Letter, the correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq index has remained positive over the last five years, except for brief periods in 2023. Over a five-year window, the correlation sits at 0.54. This shows how closely BTC has begun to trade like a high-beta tech stock. However, its correlation to cash and gold is essentially flat.

Investors are already bracing for a heavy week of US economic data and a crucial earnings print from Nvidia . The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.3%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 0.7%. This comes after fresh GDP figures confirmed the economy contracted for the first time in six quarters. Crypto markets saw a modest bounce after last week’s violent selloff. It has erased nearly $1.1 trillion in value over 41 days, and this comes out to an average drawdown of $27 billion per day. Bitcoin price dipped marginally over the last 24 hours to trade around $95,500. BTC is running down by more than 10% over the past 7 days. The biggest altcoin, Ethereum, plunged by more than 17% in the last 7 days, reflecting the fear sentiment among traders. Small-cap crypto index crashes The speed and depth of crypto’s decline have confused traders because the macro backdrop hasn’t materially worsened. President Trump reiterated last week that keeping the US “number one in crypto” is a priority. He also added that the regulatory clarity has been improving, not deteriorating. The sell-off can be driven by two overlapping forces. Institutional outflows in one of them, as crypto funds saw $1.2 billion in withdrawals in the first week of November. Around $1.1 billion left the funds in the second week, which added pressure to already thin liquidity. Extreme leverage is the second part of the sell-off, as crypto’s derivatives-heavy structure means many traders routinely bet at 20x, 50x, or even 100x leverage. A 2% move against a 100x position triggers liquidation that has already created a heavy pullback. October 10 saw liquidation exceeding $19.2 billion and producing Bitcoin’s first-ever $20,000 daily candle. In the 16 days since, there have been three more sessions where liquidations surpassed $1 billion, and several others above $500 million. Each cascade has knocked sentiment sharply lower. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has now collapsed to 10. It matched the February 2025 bottom and signaling extreme fear. Since early October, gold has outperformed Bitcoin by 25 percentage points, despite the two assets trading nearly in lockstep for the previous year.

Data shows that more than 10,000 BTC, worth nearly $1 billion, flowed onto crypto exchanges within 72 hours, according to insights from Santiment shared by analyst Ali Martinez on November 16. Bitcoin exchange transfers. Source: Santiment The sharp spike in exchange inflows is raising concerns about increased selling activity at a time when market sentiment is already fragile. Notably, this pattern is often associated with investors preparing to sell. Inflows have risen sharply, coinciding with short-term price drops, while overall exchange supply has edged higher after months of decline. This shift is widely considered a bearish catalyst. Large inflows boost liquidity and heighten the risk of aggressive sell-offs, especially as Bitcoin struggles to hold key support levels. Historically, heavy inflows have closely aligned with rapid spot-price declines, highlighting how sensitive Bitcoin is to sudden supply changes. If this trend continues, deeper retracements are likely as traders brace for further selling. Bitcoin under more bearish pressure The continued transfer of coins to exchanges comes as Bitcoin battles to hold the $95,000 support zone, increasing the likelihood of additional losses. To this end, crypto analyst Ted Pillows in an X post on November 17 highlighted a major technical warning: Bitcoin’s weekly Supertrend has turned red for the first time in nearly three years, a signal that has historically preceded deeper corrections. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The indicator flipped bearish as Bitcoin extended its decline from the $130,000 region, breaking the multi-year uptrend that began in late 2022. Previous red phases, last seen in 2021–2022, coincided with prolonged downturns, while green periods supported steady higher highs. Now trading around $95,000 and $100,000, Bitcoin has fallen decisively below the Supertrend support band, indicating sellers have regained control. With lower highs forming and momentum fading after the failed breakout above $120,000 and $130,000, downside risk remains elevated. Notably, a rebound is still possible, but the bearish Supertrend suggests any recovery will face strong resistance unless buyers reclaim key weekly trend levels. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $95,498, down nearly 1% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeframe the asset has dropped almost 10%.

Her recent comments focus on specific price points and conditions that could define the asset’s next move. She emphasized that XRP “will be reaching buy targets soon” and identified areas near $2 as particularly important for traders monitoring entry opportunities. The market has seen Bitcoin approach key resistance while XRP trends lower , creating a scenario where her guidance offers timely insight for those evaluating the near-term outlook. #XRP is starting to break down and will be reaching buy targets soon! This could REALLY be one of the LAST buying opportunities that we get around $2! Remember, we've added in that possible subwave 3 fib at ~$2.10 – We need to watch #Bitcoin closely (and the RSI!) when XRP… — TARA (@PrecisionTrade3) November 16, 2025 Market Structure and Levels Identified by Tara Tara noted that XRP is beginning to move lower and stated that the asset “will be reaching buy targets soon.” She views the current retracement as an opportunity for those waiting for lower entries around $2. She highlighted a possible subwave level at approximately $2.1 and highlighted this area as one of the first points to monitor as XRP approaches support. She also assessed the importance of nearby resistance and support levels, stating that a move “past the support at $2.18” would confirm continued downside. These levels form the basis of her current strategy, with a focus on methodical entries rather than reacting to abrupt moves. Tara expects the market to reward patient positioning as XRP tests deeper price levels. Interaction Between XRP and Bitcoin A significant part of Tara’s analysis relates to Bitcoin’s performance. She emphasized the need to watch Bitcoin and the RSI when XRP reaches the areas she identified. She explained that if Bitcoin does not reach $93.7k when XRP hits that level, she expects the asset to move toward targets at $2.05 or $1.88. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This relationship between the two assets remains central to how she interprets the unfolding structure. She added that she is also watching for Bitcoin to move below $94.5k, which she views as another condition that could support continued downside in XRP . Her approach puts Bitcoin as a factor that can either reinforce or weaken XRP’s support levels. XRP’s Near-Term Outlook Tara advised using a structured approach by spreading buys across key levels, highlighting opportunities to accumulate XRP near the $2 range. She noted that XRP’s next moves depend on support tests and Bitcoin’s position. Her guidance suggests buying the dip with careful positioning rather than a single entry. She proposes using clearly defined levels and shaping expectations for whether XRP holds near $2 or moves toward lower targets in the near term.

Analysts Assess!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-bitcoin-btc-hit-90000-in-november-analysts-assess/,"The prolonged government shutdown in the US and the hawkish stance of the Fed continue to dampen the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets. At this point, Bitcoin fell below the $95,000 level for the day, hitting a six-month low. Bitcoin faces a risk of falling below $90,000 this week, as the FOMC minutes and data delayed due to the lockdown are expected to be released. Market analyst Omkar Godbole said that Bitcoin has strengthened its bearish signals as it fell below the 50-week simple moving average (SMA), which serves as long-term support, Coindesk reported. At this point, the analyst noted that net inflows into crypto ETFs have slowed for two consecutive weeks, selling pressure from long-term investors has increased, and retail investor liquidity has yet to recover. Godbole noted that Bitcoin fell by nearly 10% over the seven days leading up to November 16, forming a large bearish candle and closing below the 50-week SMA. Describing this decline as a “transition from a bullish pattern to a warning phase,” he stated that investors could switch from a “buy on the dip” strategy to a “sell on the rise” strategy. “The 50-week SMA has been a key support that has led several recoveries since the start of 2023, but following the recent breakout it is likely to become a selling zone in the short term. The 50-week SMA is currently acting as resistance near $102,868. At this point, it is difficult to assess a return to an uptrend until a sustained weekly close above the 50-week line is confirmed. Key technical levels need to be broken to the upside.” Derivatives firm Bitunix also noted that Bitcoin could drop to $89,600 if it breaks the short-term support level of $93,000 to $95,000. They added that any attempted recovery would face resistance at $100,200 and then $107,300. Bearish expectations are rising on decentralized prediction market platform Polymarket, which estimates a 77% chance that Bitcoin will fall below $90,000 in November.

Institutional commitment is strong, shown by BlackRock and Fidelity logging huge buy-ins even as the market price fell. Best crypto to buy now before the bull run includes $PEPENODE, $HYPER, and $PENGU. Let’s be honest, the final quarter of 2025 has felt pretty brutal. At some point, we’ve seen Bitcoin ($BTC) prices crash by over 24% in just a few weeks (from around $125K to around $95K), throwing the whole market into a deep state of ‘Extreme Fear.’ While some people are pointing out this is the ‘worst Q4 since 2019,’ it still doesn’t mean you should be losing sleep. Let’s break down exactly why not so you can sleep a little easier. This massive drop isn’t a structural collapse; it’s a giant, necessary flush-out. Some analysts are calling it a ‘massive liquidation’ or a ‘mid-cycle reset.’ Basically, the market got over-leveraged with speculators using borrowed money, and this crash was the system hitting the reset button to clean out all that shaky speculation. Look beneath the hood, and the long-term outlook is stronger than ever. First, institutional money isn’t leaving. Commitment from the big guns is unshakable. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted around $58.85B in cumulative net inflows . We’ve seen BlackRock and Fidelity logging huge buy-ins while the price was falling. This is smart money quietly accumulating from scared retail sellers. Secondly, insane price targets still stand as major financial players aren’t backing off their bullish calls. Institutions like Bitwise and VanEck are still holding firm to aggressive crypto projections , expecting Bitcoin to climb into the $180,000 to $200,000 range next year. So, while the charts look scary right now, the consensus among investors is that this ‘Extreme Fear’ is actually laying the most solid foundation yet for a record-breaking 2026. If this pans out, then it begs the question, which are the best crypto to buy before the next bull run?

At the same time, small-cap coins are getting hit the hardest. Bitcoin dropped under $94,000 on Friday after previously falling below the $100,000 mark, eliminating nearly all the progress it had made since January. The sharp decline has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency world, where momentum often drives trading decisions. Market analysts say the downturn happened in two phases. First came a broad selloff triggered by larger economic factors, followed by automatic selling as traders were forced to close losing positions. October 10 crash triggers massive liquidation cascade The problems started on October 10 , according to Alessio Quaglini, who runs digital asset company Hex Trust. Rising tensions between the United States and China caused investors to dump risky investments across the board. What followed was even worse – a wave of forced selling that destroyed billions of dollars in borrowed trading positions. “This is a liquidity reset, not a loss of belief in the asset,” Quaglini said. The damage spread beyond Bitcoin. Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, has dropped more than 35% from its August peak of $4,954. The entire crypto market has been under pressure since the initial crash. Even though U.S.-China relations have improved somewhat, Bitcoin continues to struggle. Peter Chung from Presto Research pointed to thin trading volumes since the October 10 crash and fears that Bitcoin’s typical four-year boom-and-bust cycle might be ending. He noted that even small trades can now cause big price swings. Economic headwinds are making things worse. Expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December are fading. A recent government shutdown that delayed economic data releases has also hurt investor confidence. Tim Sun, a researcher at digital asset firm HashKey, said the tighter financial conditions have particularly hurt Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. These investment products pulled in over $100 billion shortly after getting approved, but institutional money has slowed significantly as financial condition s ti ghtened. Sun said that money is now flowing out instead of in. Experts war n co rrection may continue despite long-term optimism Many experts don’t expect the selloff to end soon. Quaglini warned that the correction might continue, sayin g if stock markets fall further, Bitcoin could easily drop to the low $70,000s or even below that level temporarily. Jeff Mei from cryptocurrency exchange BTSE agreed that more declines could be coming. He pointed out that Bitcoin is still acting like a risky investment , and with artificial intelligence company valuations under question and rate cuts uncertain, further price drops could make sense. However, market watchers stress that this downturn looks different from previous crypto crashes. “This is not 2022 – there’s no credit contagion, no cascading insolvencies, no systemic failure,” Quaglini said. He still expects Bitcoin to reach new highs within 12 to 18 months once conditions improve. The smallest and riskiest cryptocurrencies are getting hit the hardest. The MarketVector Digital Assets 100 Small-Cap Index, which tracks 50 smaller digital assets, fell to its lowest point since 2020 on Sunday. MarketVector Digital Assets 100 Small-Cap Index. These smaller coins used to outperform during good times as traders chased high-risk, high-reward bets. But that changed last year when the U.S. approved Bitcoin and Ether investment funds, which became the main focus for institutional investors. Over five years, the small-cap index has lost nearly 8% while larger cryptocurrencies have gained about 380%. Pratik Kala, a portfolio manager at Apollo Crypto hedge fund in Australia, said retail traders are learning from past cycles. “A rising tide doesn’t lift all boats – it only lifts the quality ones,” he said. The broader crypto market is still recovering from the October 10 meltdown, which caused about $19 billion in forced selling and erased more than $1 trillion in total market value. Since then, appetite for risk has collapsed, and traders continue avoiding the most speculative investments.

If the network continues to witness robust activities and growth, the price might reach $1000 in no time. Recent news/opinion on Litecoin Canary Capital’s proposed spot Litecoin ETF remains in limbo after the SEC took no action by its Thursday deadline, leaving the crypto industry uncertain amid a looming government shutdown. Analysts say the regulator’s new approach may render old ETF filing deadlines obsolete, as applicants are now being asked to rely solely on S-1 registration approvals. As I understand it, the shutdown could affect the $LTC ETF approval because the @SECGov still needs to sign off on the S-1 and the agency is operating on a skeleton crew.

Themed “Trot On To Infinity,” the campaign framed CoinW’s journey as a crypto marathon rather than a sprint, emphasizing endurance and strategic direction over short-term gains. After eight years navigating market cycles, the platform has focused on two key priorities: maintaining growth aligned with its user base and building the infrastructure needed for long-term development. Strategy Built on User Insights For its anniversary, CoinW launched a user-generated content campaign and followed it with in-depth interviews with over 30 users, partners, and employees worldwide. The feedback highlighted real-world use cases: one business traveler described using CoinW Card for seamless cross-border transactions, while a Southeast Asian user credited the platform’s educational programs with building their trading knowledge. These insights informed the four strategic priorities outlined by CoinW’s Founder, Gary, in an open letter: advancing digital asset security, expanding compliance infrastructure, diversifying asset offerings, and strengthening community development. From Exchange to Ecosystem The anniversary marks a shift from product expansion to deeper ecosystem integration. CoinW has unified its product suite — spot and derivatives trading, copy trading , and earn — while expanding its product ecosystem with platforms like PropW , GemW , and DeriW . Beyond product development, CoinW has deepened its industry presence. As a three-year Platinum Sponsor of TOKEN2049 , the exchange hosted a networking lounge at the main venue and an invite-only gathering at Marina Bay Sands, bringing together over 300 industry leaders. Nassar Al Achkar, Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at CoinW, spoke at the conference’s stage, discussing the evolution from fragmented trading services toward integrated ecosystems. His talk emphasized how convergence and trust-building will drive the industry’s next phase of growth. A Global Movement with Local Impact Launched in October during a market downturn, the global marathon series crossed four continents and eight cities. The event attracted members of Founders Running Club, whose founder Tim Tkachenko noted parallels between marathon running and company building: “It’s about persistence and consistency.” Alongside the international campaign, CoinW held meetups in Taipei, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, drawing over 800 local participants to discussions on trading strategies, market trends, and ecosystem projects. Building for the Next Chapter “Competition in crypto isn’t about speed — it’s about sustainability,” said Nassar. “Users need platforms they can trust through market cycles. That requires strategic discipline, avoiding overexpansion during bull runs and maintaining commitment during downturns.” CoinW now serves over 20 million users across 200+ countries and regions. The figures reflect not just scale, but sustained commitment to core principles. Eight years in, the platform views its anniversary as a milestone rather than a finish line, continuing its measured approach to building digital finance infrastructure for the industry’s next chapter.

President Donald Trump proposed the tariff checks, intended for working families, but estimates suggest that the program could cost the country up to $600 billion . Bessent spoke on Fox News Sunday Morning Futures, emphasizing that the Trump administration has no unilateral authority to authorize large-scale direct payouts. He stressed that the administration would require approval from Congress. According to Bessent, the payments are intended for working families and would include income limits as part of the administration’s broader economic solutions. Bessent says Americans earning over $100K won’t receive a dime The tariff dividend payments idea was first brought to light in August by the current President Donald Trump. He noted that billions of dollars in tariff revenue would fund the redistribution of funds directly to Americans. Based on his Truth Social post , Trump said that the dividend of at least $2,000 per person, excluding high-income families, would be paid to most Americans. He added that the leftovers would be used to reduce the national debt. Trump described the payments as a way to return tariff proceeds to the public while fulfilling the goals of reducing the national debt. Scott Bessent suggested that the payments may not come as checks, but could take the form of tariff-funded tax relief. This could come as no taxes on tips, overtime, or Social Security. He emphasized that no formal plan had yet been finalized. Bessent further noted that any payments would be targeted to working families with income limits to exclude higher earners. For instance, the COVID-19 era stimulus targeted individuals making up to $75,000 and married couples not exceeding $150,000 a year. The Treasury Secretary reiterated that everything is on the table in terms of policy options that aim to support working families. According to a recent Cryptopolitan report , Bessent also noted that Americans earning over $100,000 a year may not receive a dime from the proposed $2,000 paychecks. This is not the first time Trump has advocated for such an initiative. During the COVID-19 era, the President proposed $2,000 pandemic relief payments in late 2020. The initiative was enacted in part by President Joe Biden under the American Rescue Plan. Based on U.S. Treasury data, approximately 476 million payments were made as stimulus over three rounds totaling $814 billion towards U.S. households. Paul Kruger says Trump’s initiative is deeply irresponsible Nobel laureate Paul Krugman described the latest initiative by President Trump to offer $2,000 paychecks as deeply irresponsible. He warns that repeating large-scale cash injections could trigger inflation. He also criticized the plan, citing the federal deficit, which is approaching $2 trillion. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which is a non-partisan watchdog group, estimated that the $2,000 tariff checks may cost the U.S. roughly $600 billion if modeled like the COVID-19 stimulus packages. The cost goes up nearly twice the projected tariff revenue for 2025, which economists estimate at $300 billion. As of September, only $195 billion had been collected. The Committee argued that tariff revenue alone would not cover the cost of the proposed payouts. Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ( CRFB.org ) In addition to the short revenue collection, some tariffs under the revenue estimates were placed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and have been subject to review by the Supreme Court. According to customs law experts, if the court invalidates the tariffs, the available funds under the projected $300 billion revenue could be reduced and temporarily increase borrowing needs and further complicate fiscal planning. Despite the backlash from several officials, Trump and his administration framed the plan as a solution to rising costs of living. So far, the proposal has not made any official development; it’s still under the fate of congressional action and legal outcomes regarding tariffs.

The Trump Organization is making this possible through an innovative hotel tokenization initiative that’s capturing global attention. This groundbreaking approach allows everyday investors to participate in high-end real estate development from the earliest stages. What Exactly is Hotel Tokenization? Hotel tokenization represents a revolutionary shift in real estate investment. Instead of traditional funding methods, developers convert ownership rights into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token corresponds to a specific share of the property. This approach democratizes luxury real estate investment, making it accessible to a broader range of investors. The Trump Organization’s Maldives project will tokenize the entire development phase. Investors can purchase these digital tokens and benefit from the property’s appreciation from construction through operation. This method provides unprecedented transparency and liquidity in luxury hotel investments. Why is This Hotel Tokenization Project Significant? This initiative marks one of the most high-profile hotel tokenization projects to date. The collaboration involves Dar Global, the London-based unit of a Saudi Arabian developer, bringing international credibility to the venture. The hotel’s scheduled 2028 completion allows investors to track progress through blockchain verification. Key benefits of this hotel tokenization approach include: Lower investment barriers for average investors Enhanced transparency through blockchain tracking Increased liquidity compared to traditional real estate Global accessibility without geographical restrictions How Does Hotel Tokenization Transform Real Estate? The traditional real estate market often excludes smaller investors from premium opportunities. Hotel tokenization changes this dynamic completely. Through blockchain technology, ownership becomes divisible and transferable. Investors can buy, sell, or trade their tokens on supported platforms, creating a vibrant secondary market. This particular hotel tokenization project demonstrates how luxury developments can leverage modern technology. The Trump Organization’s move signals growing institutional acceptance of tokenized assets. Moreover, it sets a precedent for future high-end real estate projects seeking alternative funding methods. What Challenges Might This Hotel Tokenization Face? While promising, hotel tokenization faces several hurdles. Regulatory compliance remains crucial across different jurisdictions. The project must navigate international securities laws and ensure proper investor protection. Additionally, market volatility could affect token values during the development period. Technical considerations also play a vital role. The blockchain infrastructure must guarantee security and prevent fraudulent activities. However, the Trump Organization’s partnership with established developers suggests they’re addressing these challenges proactively. The Future of Hotel Tokenization in Luxury Markets This Maldives project could inspire similar initiatives worldwide. As more developers recognize the advantages of hotel tokenization , we may see increased adoption across the luxury hospitality sector. The approach offers developers faster capital raising while providing investors with unique opportunities. The success of this hotel tokenization venture could accelerate mainstream acceptance of blockchain in real estate. It demonstrates how traditional luxury markets can integrate innovative financial technologies to create win-win scenarios for developers and investors alike. Conclusion: A New Era for Hotel Investment The Trump Organization’s Maldives hotel tokenization represents a significant milestone in real estate innovation. By combining luxury development with blockchain technology, they’re creating accessible investment opportunities while maintaining premium standards. This project could fundamentally change how we think about hotel ownership and investment. As the 2028 completion date approaches, the industry will closely watch this pioneering hotel tokenization initiative. Its success could pave the way for similar projects, potentially transforming the entire luxury real estate landscape through blockchain integration and democratized investment models.

The analyst also stated that XRP investors would win, regardless of which scenario played out. Two Scenarios That Could Play Out For XRP At The Moment In an X post , Chad stated that there are two options, with the first being that the XRP price stays the same as today, and then the ETFs buy the entire circulation supply in exactly one year. Meanwhile, the second option is that the XRP price rises dramatically, and the acquisition of XRP declines because the altcoin becomes more expensive to buy. The crypto analyst declared that XRP holders will win either way. He indicated that the XRP price would surge drastically if ETFs were to accumulate significantly. Notably, the first ‘33 Act XRP ETF just launched last week and has recorded significant net inflows. SoSo Value data shows that the Canary XRP fund took in $245 million on the first day and $243 million on the second day of trading. Meanwhile, other pending XRP ETFs are expected to launch soon. The first among them is Franklin Templeton , which is likely to launch this week after earlier filing an updated S-1, which removed the delay amendment. Bitwise and 21Shares could also launch this week, following a similar move. As Chad suggested, these XRP ETFs are bullish for the XRP price, considering the amount of fresh capital that could flow into the altcoin’s ecosystem through these funds. Institutional investors have already shown huge interest in XRP, as evidenced by the fact that Canary’s fund has had the best launch this year in terms of trading volume and inflows. Analyst Shares ETFs Impact Launch Model In another X post , Chad shared the XRP ETFs launch impact model, showing how high the XRP price could reach thanks to these funds. The model showed that 20 ETFs seeded at $45 million each, with a total inflow of $900 million, would absorb 1.5% of the altcoin’s supply and could spark an XRP price surge to between $10 and $17 within 30 days. Meanwhile, the price could rally to between $13 and $24 within 60 days based on the model. Chad also revealed how the XRP ETFs could spark a supply shock for XRP. He noted that the OTC desks will initially run cover for the ETFs, but they will inevitably have to buy on public exchanges at some point. The analyst revealed that the XRP supply on exchanges is 2.8 billion, an amount that he expects the ETFs should be able to buy up. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.25, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Altcoin|Chad|Coinmarketcap|Franklin Templeton|OTC Desks|ripple|Sosovalue|Spot XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-17 12:00:45

This comes amid BTC’s recent decline, which has erased all its year-to-date (YTD) gains. Bitcoin Price Flashes Death Cross, Marking Potential Bottom In an X post, Colin stated that a death cross just flashed for the Bitcoin price, with the “ironically” bullish indicator triggering at the same time that BTC tagged the lower boundary of its megaphone pattern. The analyst noted that this is a bullish setup from this point forward, as the death cross often marks bottoms. He indicated that this is likely the bottom, as BTC has ended at the lower end of the megaphone pattern channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Won’t Crash To $92,000, Here’s Why Colin remarked that these factors combined indicate a high likelihood of a move up for the Bitcoin price from its current level. He added that a bounce is likely in the short term. However, the analyst noted that the bigger question is whether this would be a bounce to new all-time highs (ATHs) or just a relief rally on the way down in a bear market. Regardless of what happens, he is optimistic that an upward move will occur in the short term. Colin also alluded to the fact that the Federal Reserve will end quantitative tightening (QT) by December, a move which he described as another bullish catalyst for the Bitcoin price. This move is expected to inject more liquidity into the BTC and possibly spark higher prices for the flagship crypto. The Fed could also cut rates again at the December FOMC meeting, which would be a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. Another Analyst Confirms Death Cross Popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen also confirmed that the Bitcoin price just had a death cross. He noted that prior death crosses have marked local lows in the market. However, he added that the death cross rally fails when the cycle is over, which could be the case this time if the bull market is over. Related Reading: Why Are The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Down Again? Cowen stated that the time for the Bitcoin price to bounce if the cycle is not over would start within the next week. The analyst further remarked that if no bounce occurs within one week, another dump is likely before a larger rally back to the 200D SMA, which he claimed would mark a macro lower high. Meanwhile, market analyst Subu Trade shared data on how BTC has reacted after historical death crosses. The last death cross occurred in April this year, and the flagship crypto recorded a 22% gain following it. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $95,100, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The video outlines Volante’s cross-border payment capabilities and an integrated environment, including support for SWIFT GPI and SWIFT Go, under a network through which banks can access multiple settlement options through a single platform. This presentation created interest because Volante already works with Ripple. The company’s messaging hints at a unified framework that connects outdated networks such as SWIFT with Ripple’s newer infrastructure. VOLANTE PROMO VIDEO CONFIRMS ACTIVE RIPPLE–SWIFT INTEROPERABILITY Watch closely. pic.twitter.com/Xgb4u6eC6Y — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 16, 2025 Volante Promotes Interoperability Between Ripple and SWIFT The video emphasizes Volante’s ability to support SWIFT GPI, SWIFT Go, Ripple, Visa B2B Connect, Visa Direct, Mastercard Send, and similar services through one streamlined system. It states that Volante “lowers your processing costs so you’ll be able to raise margins” This network also allows institutions to “offer your customers better pricing on cross-border transactions and foreign exchange while providing them with exciting new automated global payables and receivable solutions.” Volante has worked with Ripple for years, offering a Ripple interface within its VolPay platform that allows banks to integrate Ripple’s technology without rebuilding their internal systems. While multiple integration methods have been proposed for Ripple and SWIFT, the fact that this promotional video places Ripple among SWIFT GPI, SWIFT Go, and major card-network payment services increases industry interest in how these systems may interact in real-world banking environments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Potential Entry Point Into SWIFT’s Ecosystem The integration framework shown in the video aligns with Volante’s broader product strategy, which enables banks to route payments across multiple networks based on cost, speed, or liquidity. Because Ripple is one of the supported rails and XRP plays a central role in Ripple’s liquidity solution, this setup could offer an indirect path for financial institutions to use XRP and benefit from its many advantages while still working within SWIFT’s established network of over 11,000 banks . The flexibility presented in the promotional video demonstrates how modern payment orchestration platforms may bridge the gap between legacy networks and newer digital asset-based solutions. Volante’s network could serve as a major entry point for XRP , and this interoperability would place the asset at the center of global finance, giving it the chance to revolutionize cross-border payments.

While expectations of further declines in Bitcoin are growing, one analyst said that the recent decline in BTC is not a trend reversal but a healthy correction. Ryan McMillin, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of MerkleTree Capital, said that the recent drop in Bitcoin's price is a temporary adjustment within the current cycle. Speaking to Cointelegraph at The Bridge conference in New York, Ryan McMillin stated that the decline was not caused by a single event but rather a combination of factors. McMillin identified three primary reasons for the recent decline: “Significant profit-taking by long-term investors, net outflows in spot Bitcoin ETFs, and heightened global macroeconomic risks.” “Long-term investors are taking profits after the rally, and the environment supporting market liquidity has weakened. ETF purchases, which triggered the initial rise, have slowed, and interest rate cut expectations have also receded. McMillin noted that the current market structure is significantly different from the past, with liquidity from ETFs and institutional investors absorbing a significant portion of the sell-off compared to previous cycles. Therefore, McMillin stated that the recent decline was not a trend change and said: “The recent price drop in Bitcoin is a healthy adjustment within the current cycle. It does not represent a trend reversal, as Bitcoin's fundamentals remain strong. The current market structure is different from the past, with ETF and institutional liquidity accounting for a large portion of the selling. The current influx can be seen as a healthy adjustment phase.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is the Situation So Bad for Bitcoin? Has the Trend Changed?

As per the press release , the collaboration is not only bringing the Trump brand to the Maldives but also introduces tokenization of the luxury hospitality project. The initiative tokenizes the development phase itself, offering investors the opportunity to participate in a high-growth, premium real estate project from inception. Deloitte predicts real estate tokenization to reach $4 trillion by 2035 The Trump International Hotel Maldives will feature approximately 80 ultra-luxury beach and overwater villas and is set to open by the end of 2028. Eric Trump, Executive Vice President of The Trump Organization, stated that they are delighted to bring the Trump brand to the Maldives with Dar Global. He noted, “This development will not only redefine luxury in the region but also set a new benchmark for innovation in real estate investment through tokenization.” Ziad El Chaar, CEO of Dar Global, explained, “Tokenizing the development of Trump International Hotel Maldives marks a global first that blends luxury, innovation, and technology in a way that will transform how the world invests in hospitality.” On the main page of the Dar Global website, it reveals that the company is evolving how the world invests in luxury real estate. It talks about the utilization of blockchain-powered tokenization , making access to high-value properties smarter, more flexible, and globally connected through fractional ownership. Dar Global’s website notes that investors can trade their tokens through regulated platforms, knowing that these tokens are backed by real-world assets, with every transaction being recorded on the blockchain. The Deloitte Center for Financial Services predicts that $4 trillion of real estate will be tokenized by 2035, increasing from less than $0.3 trillion in 2024, with a CAGR of 27%. Deloitte adds that the tokenized ownership of undeveloped land and under-construction projects is expected to reach US$50 billion by 2035, with a total market penetration rate of 0.80%.

The 1-hour chart, currently marked by sharp volatility and tight ranges, reflects a market caught between caution and anticipation. XRP’s bounce from $2.1893 injected renewed optimism into the market. The rebound demonstrated that buyers are still aggressively defending lower levels, preventing the asset from slipping into deeper downside territory. However, that optimism was quickly tempered when XRP faced a strong rejection at $2.28, a level that has now emerged as a key short-term resistance. This rejection has led to intensified scrutiny of the $2.22 support zone, an area Cruz identifies as the pivotal line in the sand. “If $2.22 holds,” she notes, “then what we’re seeing is likely just consolidation, a healthy pause where the market resets, shakes out weak hands, and builds pressure for the next move.” If support holds, XRP could be gearing up for another push at the crucial $2.28 barrier, a level that has repeatedly halted momentum. A clean breakout could trigger a sharper move, with liquidity above resistance still thin and price currently hovering at $2.27. XRP Could Be Entering a Major Liquidity Phase as Franklin Templeton’s EZRP Set to Launch XRP is edging toward what analysts call a potential ‘major liquidity phase’ after Canary Labs’ XRPC delivered a record-breaking debut last week. The surge in inflows, trading activity, and institutional interest around XRPC has amplified speculation about the next wave of XRP-linked financial products. Analysts now point to Nov. 18 as a pivotal moment, when global asset-management giant Franklin Templeton launches its XRP exchange-traded product, EZRP. The upcoming debut has already fueled industry-wide anticipation, with experts suggesting EZRP could rival, if not surpass, the breakout success of Canary’s XRPC. Why is this important? Well, Franklin Templeton’s entry marks a major turning point for XRP’s market structure. Franklin brings decades of proven credibility, global distribution reach, and institutional expertise built on its $1.6 trillion asset base, advantages that could give the new EZRP product a decisive edge as investors explore XRP exposure. Market strategists say brand reputation may be the decisive factor. Canary’s $245 million record debut set the pace, but Franklin Templeton’s deep trust with traditional investors could attract far larger, more conservative inflows. If both products sustain strong performance, this rivalry may trigger a broader liquidity cycle for XRP. Therefore, if Franklin Templeton’s debut attracts substantial inflows, it could ignite fierce competition among XRP products and cement XRP’s foothold in mainstream investment portfolios. Conclusion XRP’s current price action reflects strategic positioning rather than panic. Trading tightly between key support and resistance, the market signals an imminent move. The next direction hinges on behavior around $2.22, but underlying pressure is building. As analyst Genny Cruz notes, this could be the final reset before momentum accelerates. On the other hand, with Franklin Templeton’s EZRP set to launch on Nov. 18, institutional credibility, investor confidence, and rising XRP adoption point to a potential major liquidity phase. Whether EZRP outperforms or complements Canary’s XRPC, XRP is clearly entering a new era of mainstream attention, deeper market engagement, and heightened price potential.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 12:11:18

The firm suggested that these tokens, akin to airline miles or credit card points, provide crypto networks with utility that can grow without depending on speculation. According to venture capital firm a16z’s report published last Thursday, arcade tokens exist within a specific software or product ecosystem to keep their values relatively stable. They allow users to perform functions within the ecosystem, and are way beyond what the community would deem “investment instruments.” “Arcade tokens are the blockchain-based equivalent of a type of asset that people are already familiar with: airline miles, credit card points, in-game digital gold, and so on,” the report read. ‘Arcade tokens are foundational for the blockchain,’ venture capitalists note Venture capitalists at a16z , including researcher Scott Duke Kominers and CTO Eddy Lazzarin, asserted that arcade tokens are a foundational tool for crypto networks. “Just as stablecoins unlock new forms of commerce, and network tokens enable decentralized value-sharing and governance, arcade tokens can power digital economies at scale,” they wrote. The firm doubled down on its hypothesis that arcade tokens are significantly different from network or security tokens purchased with investment returns in mind, because they are intended for spending. Users can access services or applications through arcade coins, much similar to how players in games buy or sell items through “digital tokens or gold.” “You go inside; you trade cash for tokens, typically physical ones; then you use those tokens to play a few rounds of Galaga, Gator Panic, or whatever else you’re into. The tokens let you participate in the arcade’s economy,” the research explained. The report is against labeling them “utility tokens,” since such terminology implies other tokens lack utility, which is not accurate. Holders sometimes use alternative names like “points” or “loyalty tokens,” but this is mostly party to private ledgers or curated applications. Moreover, a16z noted these tokens allow issuers to control supply and pricing to match user demand, where if twice as many customers arrive on a given day, the token supply could be increased for all users to participate. Prices can also be adjusted to reflect advancements to the ecosystem, like new games, more features, or upgraded rewards. Issuers can implement dynamic pricing, adjusting token costs or purchase prices to meet or solve demand fluctuations. When tokens encourage loyalty, users will be more interested in purchasing them, and this could attract more developers, merchants, or service providers. Finally, economic controls allow issuers to burn tokens on redemption, track liabilities on-chain, and apply monetary policies such as those seen in central banking. Arcade tokens have real-world applications According to the report’s assessment of how arcade token value can be determined, the coins are redeemable through mechanisms that remove tokens from circulation, called “sinks.” In an arcade context, sinks are the game “slots,” where each token inserted allows a user to play. If one game costs a single token, its value can be pegged to say, 25 cents. a16z researchers mentioned that issuers can also set a buyback price slightly below the initial issuance price, so it can always be redeemed for a guaranteed amount. “An issuer can guarantee that it will always pay, say, 20 cents apiece to buy back those 25-cent tokens. This establishes a floor under which the price should not drop,” the report deduced. a16z cited hospitality-tech startup Blackbird’s native FLY token as an example, a coin launched in mid-2024 in a Web3 payments platform for restaurants. The token incentivizes adoption by rewarding users and enabling redemption at participating venues. According to the venture capital firm’s insight, FLY operates on a purpose-built blockchain layer supported by a network token, combining secure network operations with customer-facing arcade functionality. Other applications existing in decentralized computing networks include security, compute providers incentives, and cultivating engagement among end users. In the last application model, arcade tokens could encourage network participation without granting ownership of the underlying infrastructure. “With greater regulatory clarity, we expect more builders and users to recognize the benefits of arcade tokens as more projects, including those not native to crypto, explore their utility,” the research concluded.

Price Analysis",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/ethereum-eth-hits-3000-was-that-the-bottom-price-analysis,"Shhh, it's a secret. Ethereum (ETH) has probably bottomed at $3,000 and hardly anyone is talking about it. With market sentiment at its most dire - the Fear and Greed Index hit 10 on Sunday, deep in extreme fear. Is this now the beginning of a rally to $5,000 and beyond? $ETH price hits $3,000 psychological support level Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $ETH shows how the price not only tagged the bottom of the descending channel, but it also hit the psychological $3,000 horizontal support level and a decent bounce has resulted so far. It would be expected that the price will now either move on up to the downtrend line (faint dotted line) or it will perhaps come back down, perhaps for another retest, and the very short term momentum indicators can reset. The RSI reveals that the indicator line has broken up through the first downtrend line. In keeping with what was just mentioned, it could go back to retest and confirm this trendline before moving up to the next downtrend line. This could correspond to a similar movement to the trendline in the price action. Bounce here or coming soon Source: TradingView Looking at $ETH in the daily time frame it can be seen that a bounce from the current level makes perfect sense. Yes, there is the possibility of a further dip to the even stronger horizontal support level of $2,800, but institutions would probably be buying into such a drop, given the excellent support below. All this said, $3,000 is a key level and the bounce can certainly take place from here. The descending trendline in the RSI at the bottom of the chart suggests that the bounce is either happening or will arrive soon. As can be noted in the previous almost 6-month long downtrend line, when the indicator line breaks through, this can signal a period of huge price growth. Huge $ETH price rally building Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows what could be a huge, thunderous bull flag, or at the very least a descending channel, the measured move of which would take the price back, near to the all-time high. The measured move for the bull flag could take the $ETH price to somewhere near $7,000. The RSI in this time frame reveals how it has signalled previous big rallies. These have led to price rises of 169%, 82%, and 221%. Taking just the average of these 3 price rises (157%), this would send the $ETH price to well over $7,000. Hold onto your hats!

The asset’s price recovered slightly to $142.27 as of press time, yet the broader structure still reflects sustained pressure. Market data shows a 0.79% daily gain but a significant weekly decline of nearly 16%. TD Sequential Signals Potential Strength Ali Martinez noted a fresh TD Sequential buy signal on the 12-hour chart. That setup often appears near exhaustion points. The indicator flashed its signal after a completed red nine count. This pattern strengthens the argument for a short-term rebound attempt. Moreover, Solana now stabilizes near the $136–$139 support band. This zone cushioned previous pullbacks and attracted early buyers. Martinez believes a break above $142 would confirm momentum. Failure to hold the lower boundary exposes $131 and later $126. This creates a tight technical window where buyers attempt to regain control. Elliott-Wave Outlook Suggests Crucial Threshold Man of Bitcoin outlined a different structural risk. He pointed to the broader Elliott-wave roadmap, which depends on the $127 level. Holding above $127 keeps the white scenario valid. A breakdown opens deeper ranges linked to extended Fibonacci projections. These projections align with areas around $117 and $106. Additionally, price action drifts toward the 0.786 and 0.887 Fibonacci region. That cluster forms a dense support band between $146 and $136. This region attracted strong reactions during earlier declines. However, momentum still favors a final liquidity sweep unless $127 remains intact. High-Volume Zones Shape the Next Move Source: X CryptoPulse highlighted a broader weekly perspective. Solana now tests the first major high-volume support zone near $135–$145. A deeper zone sits between $118 and $126. A sweep of the lower area would reset the structure and potentially prepare for a stronger rally.

Strategy has acquired 8,178 BTC for ~$835.6 million at ~$102,171 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 27.8% YTD 2025. As of 11/16/2025, we hodl 649,870 $BTC acquired for ~$48.37 billion at ~$74,433 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRD $STRE $STRF $STRK https://t.co/HI1TeYOvQ9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 17, 2025 The firm acquired 8,178 BTC for $835.6 million at an average price of $102,171 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. The latest buying spree brings Strategy’s total bitcoin holdings to 649,870 BTC as of November 16, 2025, purchased at an aggregate cost of $48.37 billion at an average price of $74,433 per bitcoin. Aggressive Weekly Accumulation Reflects Ongoing Corporate Strategy During the seven-day period, Strategy made one of its larger weekly purchases of 2025, continuing a consistent accumulation pattern even as bitcoin trades above the $100,000 mark. The $835.6 million outlay reflects the company’s multi-year conviction that bitcoin serves as a superior long-term reserve asset compared to cash or traditional financial instruments. Saylor has repeatedly stated that Strategy will continue to purchase bitcoin opportunistically, using excess cash flows, debt issuance, and equity offerings. This week’s filing shows the same approach: the BTC acquisition was funded through the sale of preferred and common stock under the company’s at-the-market (ATM) programs. Equity Sales Generate Capital for Bitcoin Purchases To finance the latest purchases, Strategy sold multiple classes of stock across its suite of preferred and common offerings. Between November 10 and November 16, the company issued: 39,957 shares of STRF (10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock) for a notional value of $4.0 million, generating $4.4 million in net proceeds. 1.31 million shares of STRC (Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock) for a notional $131.4 million and $131.2 million in net proceeds. 5,513 shares of STRK (8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock) for a notional $0.6 million and $0.5 million in net proceeds. In total, Strategy generated $136.1 million in net proceeds from preferred stock sales during the period. While the filing notes that additional proceeds came from common stock (MSTR) sales under its ATM program, no new common shares were issued during this specific weekly window. The fresh capital contributes to the company’s ability to sustain large-scale BTC accumulation without materially increasing debt leverage. Bitcoin Holdings Reach Nearly $50B in Cost Basis Following the latest purchase, Strategy now holds 649,870 BTC, one of the largest corporate bitcoin treasuries in the world. With a total cost basis of $48.37 billion, the company’s long-term average purchase price remains well below current market levels, reflecting years of steady accumulation through bull and bear cycles. The filing reinforces Strategy’s position as a structural buyer of bitcoin, regardless of short-term price volatility. At an average purchase price of $102,171 for this week’s tranche, the firm demonstrated continued confidence in the asset even near recent cycle highs. As the company maintains tens of billions of dollars in remaining capacity across its equity issuance programs, the latest disclosure indicates that Strategy’s bitcoin buying is far from over. Investors and analysts will be watching for subsequent filings to gauge the pace of accumulation heading into year-end.

Over the past week, the asset’s price has collapsed by approximately 32%, raising the question of whether this is a perfect buying opportunity or the beginning of a more significant crash. What’s Next? ICP stole the show at the start of the month, with its valuation exploding to almost $9.50 on November 8, the highest mark witnessed since January this year. Its market capitalization briefly exceeded $5 billion, and it seemed like a further pump was on the way. However, the major correction of the broader cryptocurrency market poured cold water on those expectations. ICP is among the biggest losers in the past week, tumbling by more than 30% and currently trading at less than $5. ICP Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the retreat, many analysts believe the token has not yet said its final word for this cycle. X user WIZZ told their more than 800,000 followers that ICP is approaching a bounce area, predicting that the next push could stretch to as high as $20. Rushi was even more optimistic. The analyst claimed that a potential price explosion for Bitcoin (BTC) to $220,000 in the next 45 days might trigger an overall altcoin resurgence, with ICP “going straight” for $100. It is important to note that the primary cryptocurrency has seen better days, and reaching that level seems unlikely (at least for now). As of this writing, BTC trades at just over $95,000, representing a 10% decline over the past week. This Metric Flashes the Buy Signal According to ICP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), the valuation could indeed rebound in the short term. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to estimate whether the asset is about to undergo a reversal. It ranges from 0 to 100, and ratios around 30 signal that the token is oversold, indicating a potential surge may be incoming. On the other hand, anything above 70 is seen as bearish territory. ICP’s RSI plummeted below 30 a few hours ago, while currently it is set just north of that mark.

However, it has been bearish since then, losing 24% of its value in the last six weeks. The bearish performance comes despite the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates twice over the past two months. Altcoins have been hit the hardest, with most of them yet to recover from the October 10 deleveraging event. Altcoins could suffer further losses in the months to come as investors approach this cycle differently from the previous ones. BTC, ETH, and others suffer huge losses Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, dropped to the $93K level on Sunday, its lowest level since May. The bearish performance affected other major altcoins, with Ether retesting the $3K psychological level once again. Ripple’s XRP is also trading below $2.5, while Binance’s BNB has declined below $1K after hitting an all-time high of $1,370 a few weeks ago. Thanks to the ongoing bearish performance, the total cryptocurrency market cap has declined to the $3.2 trillion level, losing $1 trillion since the all-time high of October 6. Bitcoin’s decline comes amid slowing institutional demand Bitcoin’s recent decline below $100K comes amid a massive selloff of spot Bitcoin ETFs by institutional investors. Data obtained from SoSoValue revealed that spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an outflow of over $1.1 billion last week, one of the biggest weekly outflows since the funds launched roughly a year ago. The declining institutional demand can be attributed to the tightening liquidity, as the US government shutdown has kept the Treasury general account elevated. With the liquidity policy set to be relaxed in the near term, analysts expect Bitcoin’s price to benefit immensely. Furthermore, 95% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, indicating that only 2.05 million bitcoins are yet to to mined. However, the scarcity hasn’t positively affected Bitcoin’s price recently. While speaking to Cointelegraph , Thomas Perfumo, a global economist at crypto exchange Kraken, said this could change soon because annual supply inflation is currently around 0.8% per annum, and hard money requires a credible narrative for people to confidently adopt a currency as a store of value. According to Perfumo, the scarcity will help Bitcoin’s value in the long term. Jake Kennis, a senior research analyst at the onchain analytics platform Nansen, pointed out that the latest milestone will not directly affect Bitcoin’s price in the near term. It emphasizes Bitcoin’s scarcity, but the remaining 5% will take well over 100 years to reach 100% circulation due to halving events. While increased scarcity can psychologically support prices, this particular milestone is more of a narrative event than a direct price catalyst. Analysts highlighted that the latest milestone indicates that Bitcoin is transitioning from a growth phase to one with fixed, predictable long-term scarcity, and this is important for institutional adoption. Investors are rewriting the altcoin narrative One of the hottest debates within the Crypto Twitter (X) community in recent months is when the altcoin season will begin. Most altcoins have yet to hit the all-time high levels they recorded in 2021-2022, despite Bitcoin and Ether recording new all-time highs earlier this year. With most altcoins down 40-50% from their 2021 highs, it remains unclear if the crypto market will experience the altcoin season similar to the previous cycles. The October 10 deleveraging events saw some altcoins crash by over 40% within a few hours, with most of them yet to recover. According to a recent Bloomberg report , the MarketVector Digital Assets 100 Small-Cap Index, which tracks the 50 smallest digital assets in a basket of 100, fell to its lowest level since November 2020 on Sunday before paring some losses. In previous cycles, the small-cap index often outpaced its large-cap counterpart, benefiting from traders’ hunger for high-risk, high-reward bets. This cycle reversed this trend, with the approval of the Bitcoin and Ether ETFs seeing more institutional inflow into large-cap assets. Pratik Kala, portfolio manager at Australia-based hedge fund Apollo Crypto, pointed out that investors are learning from the previous cycles and focusing more on altcoins with strong narratives. Over the past five years, the small-cap index has been down nearly 8%, while its large-cap counterpart has surged about 380%. The stark difference in performance shows where funding is currently going. With the XRP ETF now live and other ETFs tracking assets such as Solana, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and BNB, currently in the pipeline, it could be argued that more institutional funds will flow into large-cap assets in the near to medium term. This could leave other low-cap assets stranded, ushering in a new era of maturity to the cryptocurrency market.

The recent announcement from Forward Industries has sent shockwaves through the crypto space. This Nasdaq-listed company revealed it holds a massive 6.91 million SOL tokens, marking one of the most significant institutional Solana investment moves we’ve seen this year. What Makes This Solana Investment So Significant? Forward Industries (FORD) isn’t just dipping its toes in cryptocurrency waters. The company has made a substantial commitment to Solana, with nearly all of its 6.91 million SOL tokens currently staked. This strategic Solana investment demonstrates growing institutional confidence in blockchain technology. Staking means the company is actively participating in network security while earning rewards. This approach shows Forward Industries understands the long-term potential of their Solana investment. Moreover, it signals to other traditional companies that cryptocurrency can be part of a legitimate investment strategy. Why Are Institutions Choosing Solana? Solana offers several advantages that make it attractive for institutional Solana investment: High transaction speeds – Processing up to 65,000 transactions per second Low fees – Making it cost-effective for large-scale operations Growing ecosystem – With numerous dApps and projects building on the network Staking rewards – Providing passive income opportunities Forward Industries clearly recognizes these benefits. Their substantial Solana investment positions them to benefit from both price appreciation and staking rewards. This dual approach maximizes returns while supporting network operations. What Does This Mean for Crypto Markets? This major Solana investment by a publicly-traded company could trigger several market developments. First, it validates Solana’s position in the cryptocurrency hierarchy. Second, it may encourage other institutions to consider similar Solana investment strategies. The timing of this announcement is particularly interesting. As regulatory clarity improves, more traditional companies feel comfortable making substantial cryptocurrency commitments. Forward Industries’ Solana investment could serve as a blueprint for other Nasdaq-listed firms exploring digital assets. How Does Staking Enhance This Solana Investment? By staking nearly all their SOL tokens, Forward Industries demonstrates sophisticated crypto management. Staking provides: Regular passive income through rewards Enhanced network security participation Long-term commitment signals to the market Reduced circulating supply pressure This approach to their Solana investment shows the company isn’t just speculating on short-term price movements. They’re building a sustainable position that benefits both their portfolio and the broader Solana ecosystem. What Challenges Come With Large Crypto Holdings? While this Solana investment presents significant opportunities, it also comes with challenges that Forward Industries must navigate: Market volatility affecting portfolio value Regulatory uncertainty in different jurisdictions Security concerns around large digital asset holdings Accounting and reporting complexities However, the company’s decision to stake most holdings suggests they’ve developed robust risk management strategies. Their approach to this Solana investment could become a case study for other public companies. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional Crypto Adoption Forward Industries’ substantial Solana investment marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency adoption. The company’s commitment to staking demonstrates sophisticated understanding of blockchain economics. This move could inspire similar institutional Solana investment strategies across traditional finance. As more public companies recognize the potential of digital assets, we may see increased mainstream acceptance. Forward Industries has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation, with their Solana investment serving as a bold statement about the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions How much SOL does Forward Industries actually hold? Forward Industries holds exactly 6.91 million SOL tokens, with nearly all of them currently staked for network participation and rewards. Why did Forward Industries choose Solana over other cryptocurrencies? The company likely chose Solana due to its high transaction speeds, low fees, growing ecosystem, and strong staking rewards potential. What does staking mean for their investment? Staking means the company earns passive income through network rewards while helping secure the Solana blockchain, showing long-term commitment. Is this the largest institutional Solana investment? While specific rankings vary, this represents one of the largest publicly-disclosed Solana investments by a Nasdaq-listed company. How might this affect Solana’s price? Large institutional investments typically create positive sentiment and reduced circulating supply, potentially supporting price stability and growth. Could other companies follow this strategy? Yes, Forward Industries’ successful implementation could encourage other public companies to consider similar cryptocurrency investment strategies.

This Nasdaq-listed company’s strategic pivot represents one of the most significant corporate rebrandings in the crypto space this year. What Does the BNB Plus Rebranding Mean for Investors? The company’s decision to change its name to BNB Plus and adopt the BNBX stock ticker reflects a fundamental shift in business strategy. This move comes after the company accumulated substantial BNB holdings, currently standing at 15,524 BNB tokens. The transformation demonstrates how traditional companies are increasingly embracing cryptocurrency as core assets. This strategic rebranding positions BNB Plus at the forefront of corporate cryptocurrency adoption. The company’s existing Nasdaq listing provides a unique bridge between traditional stock market investors and the growing digital asset ecosystem. Why is BNB Plus Making This Strategic Shift Now? The timing of this transformation aligns with several key market developments. First, institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to accelerate. Second, the regulatory landscape is becoming clearer. Third, companies are recognizing the value of holding digital assets on their balance sheets. The BNB Plus strategy includes: Direct exposure to BNB’s ecosystem growth Enhanced shareholder value through crypto holdings Positioning in the rapidly expanding DeFi space Leveraging existing public market infrastructure How Will BNB Plus Navigate Regulatory Challenges? As a publicly traded company, BNB Plus must carefully navigate regulatory requirements. However, the company’s established presence on Nasdaq provides a framework for compliance that many pure crypto companies lack. This advantage could position BNB Plus uniquely in the market. The company’s existing regulatory compliance infrastructure, combined with its new crypto focus, creates an interesting hybrid model. This approach may set a precedent for other public companies considering similar transitions into the cryptocurrency space. What Opportunities Does BNB Plus Create for Mainstream Investors? The BNB Plus transformation opens new doors for traditional investors who want crypto exposure without direct cryptocurrency ownership. Through the BNBX stock, investors can gain indirect exposure to BNB’s performance while maintaining the familiarity of stock market trading. This model offers several advantages: No need for cryptocurrency wallets or exchanges Traditional brokerage account accessibility Regulatory protections of public markets Professional management of crypto assets Conclusion: The Future Looks Bright for BNB Plus The strategic rebranding to BNB Plus represents more than just a name change—it signals a fundamental shift in how public companies can integrate cryptocurrency into their core business models. With substantial BNB holdings and a clear strategic direction, this transformation could pave the way for similar moves by other public companies. Frequently Asked Questions What was Applied DNA’s previous business focus? Applied DNA Sciences originally focused on DNA-based security and authentication technologies, providing molecular-level solutions for product verification and anti-counterfeiting measures. When will the name change to BNB Plus become effective? The company has announced the rebranding, but specific effective dates for the name change and ticker symbol transition will be communicated through official Nasdaq filings and company announcements. How does owning BNB Plus stock differ from owning BNB directly? BNB Plus stock represents ownership in a company that holds BNB, while direct BNB ownership means you hold the cryptocurrency itself. The stock provides exposure through traditional markets, while direct ownership offers full control but requires crypto wallet management. What happens to Applied DNA’s existing business operations? The company will likely maintain or transition its existing operations while focusing on its new cryptocurrency strategy. Details about the future of previous business lines should be clarified in upcoming investor communications. Will BNB Plus continue acquiring more BNB tokens? While the company currently holds 15,524 BNB, future acquisition plans will depend on market conditions, corporate strategy, and available capital. Investors should monitor official statements for updates on additional purchases. How can I invest in BNB Plus? Once the ticker changes to BNBX, investors can purchase shares through any standard brokerage account that offers Nasdaq-listed securities, just like any other publicly traded stock.

The trader is now making another bold move, going long amid ongoing market turbulence. According to on-chain activity, the trader opened a 5x long on 29.5 million Starknet (STRK), valued at roughly $6.7 million. That position has since surged, producing more than $2.5 million in profit within three days, according to on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from Lookonchain on November 17.

Rising interest in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies has fueled demand, with STRK benefiting from its use of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollup technology to enhance transaction throughput. The network now allows on-chain verification of Zcash-style zero-knowledge proofs, bridging privacy and scalability. Adding to the momentum, developers unveiled ZTARNET, a network designed to combine Zcash’s ( ZEC ) privacy guarantees with Starknet’s high-performance STARK proofs. By press time, STRK was trading at $0.2181, having plunged over 10% in the past 24 hours, while rallying almost 100% over the past month. Going long on HYPE Now, rather than scaling back after securing a multimillion-dollar gain, the trader has escalated his strategy. Four hours after the STRK success, he opened a 10x long on 77,598 Hyperliquid (HYPE), valued at approximately $2.98 million. A 10x long multiplies exposure aggressively, leaving far less room for price retracements but offering significant upside if momentum continues. Crypto trader’s long position.

On-chain data indicates that the HYPE position was entered around $38.12 and is already in profit, reflecting a strategy built around rapid, high-leverage plays. Notably, nearly the entire portfolio value, around $7.54 million, is concentrated in these perpetual futures positions, highlighting the trader’s aggressive risk appetite. As of press time, HYPE was trading at $38.08, down 2.5%.

Hoskinson spoke candidly about the challenges facing Cardano in a YouTube broadcast from Input Output Hong Kong channel on Friday. The American entrepreneur explained that while the platform has achieved significant technical advancements, certain areas have lagged behind and require focused attention. “Other ecosystems and their members consider Cardano a shadow chain, call our blockchain a laughing stock, and actively criticize it. So that’s the underlying systemic weakness,” he said. Cardano’s ecosystem has to expand, Hoskinson says The Cardano founder reiterated that the project’s long-term success depends on expanding its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and attracting more developers. He talked about a need for marketing the project, admitting that Cardano’s public image has suffered from underpromotion. Hoskinson insisted marketing is part of building a sustainable blockchain ecosystem, listing plans to improve Cardano’s brand recognition through annual events by hosting at least four major gatherings each year starting in 2026. He believes that better engagement will help overcome the perception that the blockchain is secondary to other networks. “While decentralized value transfer is great and programmability is essential, this cannot work for large groups of people unless scalability, interoperability, and governance are addressed,” Hoskinson said. Charles Hoskinson’s presentation on Midnight. Source: Input Output Youtube channel During the broadcast, the 38-year-old blockchain dev was writing on a whiteboard where he wrote about Cardano’s Midnight sidechain, a privacy-oriented project meant to connect Cardano with other blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain. Midnight could increase the liquidity of ADA and other native tokens by enabling integration with external ecosystems like a sidechain. According to Hoskinson, the total value locked (TVL) on the Cardano network currently stands at $680 million, with over 1.3 million people participating in staking and asset management. Collectively, these users hold more than 15 billion ADA tokens. The founder predicts that by 2030, the network could exceed 10 million users if it implements Midnight’s privacy features. Interoperability issues in the Cardano blockchain identified Charles Hoskinson reckoned that there were three critical areas where blockchains come up short despite their improvements in the last decade and a half, including rational privacy, identity, and cooperation. Rational privacy allows users to selectively disclose information rather than hiding all data or revealing everything publicly. It activates controlled sharing on-chain, like allowing a doctor to access medical records or a university to verify transcripts without exposing sensitive data to the world. Midnight could also help in combining decentralized identifiers (DIDs) with privacy-preserving proofs for humans, devices, and assets to authenticate without compromising personal information, research Hoskinson said was conducted by the IOHK Foundation. Existing blockchains operate in isolation, but Midnight proposes a cooperative model, letting networks share security, users, data, and economic benefits. This approach, per the Cardano and Ethereum foundation co-founder, could improve Cardano’s ecosystem through EMURGO’s commercial infrastructure. Midnight could protect user data without making functionality expendable According to Hoskinson’s whiteboard explainer, Midnight brings several innovations to protect user data in tandem with a blockchain network’s functionality. Kachina, its selective-disclosure smart contract system, allows devs to determine which transaction elements are public or private, behaving more like real-world interactions. Nightstream, a post-quantum, GPU-accelerated privacy layer, uses hardware gains from GPUs to make privacy proofs faster and cheaper. It avoids dependence on ASICs and ensures the sidechain scales with mainstream computing developments. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computations on encrypted data without decryption. Combined with lattice-based cryptography, it enables validation, analytics, and coordination while keeping user data private. Hoskinson coined the architecture a “continuation of research-driven cryptography” fronted by IOHK and its academic partners. Moreover, Midnight will integrate W3C DIDs with rational privacy to create a universal, private authentication that can represent humans, AI agents , IoT devices, and digital or physical assets. He concluded the presentation by saying that identity without privacy leads to surveillance, while privacy without identity creates unusable systems. “Everything that we’ve built leads to this destination if we’ve done it right. It’s the very top. You don’t use cryptocurrencies for the sake of using cryptocurrencies. You use them because there’s a purpose,” Hoskinson said.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) uses Solana-style tech to scale $BTC, with a large presale, clear roadmap and upside tied directly to Bitcoin activity. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a meme-driven, Ethereum-based lifestyle token whose value depends heavily on community hype and post-fear risk appetite. Solana ($SOL) offers a more conservative way to play a potential rebound, combining deep liquidity, active dApps, and growing institutional demand. Bitcoin has just printed the dreaded ‘death cross’ on the daily chart as price slipped under $93K for the first time since May 5. The 50-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average, a pattern that many traders still interpret as a classic bearish signal. Analyst KillaXBT believes there’s a 36% chance that the bear sprint will continue this Monday after glancing at Bitcoin’s pivot lows. With $BTC hovering around $95K at the time of writing and the Fear & Greed Index stuck in ‘extreme fear’ at 22, sentiment looks shaken. Several analysts also note that in bull markets, $BTC has frequently bottomed within about a week of the cross before rallying by 40–50% or more. Benjamin Cowen believes Bitcoin has one week to stabilize and bounce back. If that doesn’t happen, we should expect another dump. In that kind of environment, the ‘ best crypto to buy ’ question stops being about one magic ticker and becomes a risk-tier decision. Bitcoin-linked infrastructure, such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , high-beta meme plays like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and a large-cap workhorse like Solana, each react differently to fear spikes and eventual recoveries. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – BTC Layer 2 Built For The Rebound Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a Bitcoin Layer 2 that tries to bolt Solana-style speed and throughput onto the $BTC ecosystem without sacrificing security. The design routes $BTC into a canonical bridge, verifies it on-chain, then moves value onto a high-performance Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine. That lets users send $BTC with near-instant finality, low fees, and support for dApps, DeFi, and meme coins, before ultimately settling back to Bitcoin Layer 1. The $HYPER token sits at the center of that design. Its utility includes gas, protocol fees, access to premium features, and staking. The total supply is 21B, with large allocations to development, treasury, and marketing, aiming to support the delivery of the long-term roadmap rather than just a quick pump. The mainnet launch targets Q4 2025 – Q1 2026 as the release window, with a DAO and incentives for node operators and developers scheduled for 2026. On the presale side, Bitcoin Hyper has already raised more than $27.8M at a current token price around $0.013285, signalling heavy early demand for $BTC-centric infrastructure while Bitcoin itself is under pressure. Our price prediction for $HYPER has it eyeing $0.02595 in 2025 and $0.08625 by the end of 2026 if the team hits its milestones and listings arrive on schedule. That implies an upside of roughly 2x to 6x from the current presale level in bullish scenarios, if you invest today. You can read our guide on how to buy $HYPER today if you’re interested. Visit the presale page and purchase your $HYPER today. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – High-Octane Meme Play On Post-Fear Volatility Maxi Doge ($MAXI) lives at the opposite end of the spectrum. It’s an Ethereum-based meme coin built around a gym-obsessed, 1000x-leverage Doge persona. The branding leans into degen culture: ‘max gainz’, sleepless trading, and a lifestyle vibe more than traditional ‘utility’. Under the memes, though, there is a clear token design. Presale numbers show that this pitch is landing. The Maxi Doge sale has already raised more than $4M at a token price around $0.0002685, with staking APYs currently at 76% for early participants. That combination of low unit price, strong marketing budget, and staking hook is exactly what tends to attract meme-coin hunters when markets flip from fear to greed again. From a death-cross perspective, Maxi Doge is a pure beta play. If Bitcoin stabilizes and follows its historical pattern of strong 2–3 month rebounds, capital could leak back into higher-risk corners of the market and $MAXI is ready. This project caters to traders who actively seek volatility, understand meme-coin risk, and treat staking rewards as a sweetener rather than a guarantee. Visit the presale page and buy your $MAXI today. 3. Solana ($SOL) – High-Throughput L1 With ETF Tailwinds Solana ($SOL) is the established name in this trio. It is a high-throughput Layer 1 that uses a proof-of-stake design plus unique time-ordering to support thousands of transactions per second with low fees. Over the last year, it has become the backbone for a huge chunk of DeFi, NFT, and meme-coin activity, and it has started to attract institutional interest as a candidate for spot ETFs. At the time of writing, $SOL trades around $142 with a market cap above $78B, sitting sixth in the crypto rankings. Solana spot ETFs have logged tens of millions of dollars in weekly inflows even as Bitcoin ETFs see outflows, which suggests some institutions are rotating down the risk curve into high-beta majors rather than leaving the asset class entirely. How does that intersect with Bitcoin’s death cross? Historically, when $BTC stabilizes after a sharp flush, strong Layer 1s with active ecosystems often rebound faster and harder than Bitcoin itself. Solana already demonstrated that dynamic when it briefly overtook $BNB in market cap during earlier stages of this cycle, and when rallies above $200 followed periods of consolidation. Solana trades on all major centralized exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase , and is accessible through most large wallets and DeFi protocols, which makes scaling exposure or taking profits much simpler than with presale tokens. Get your $SOL on Binance today. Recap: Bitcoin’s confirmed death cross has pushed sentiment back into ‘extreme fear’, but history suggests the pattern can still precede strong 2–3 month recoveries rather than immediate collapse. Against that backdrop, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) and Solana ($SOL) represent three distinct ways to position: a $BTC-native Layer 2, a high-risk meme coin built for volatility, and a large-cap Layer 1 already attracting ETF flows. This is not financial advice. DYOR and manage risk wisely before investing.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) uses an SVM-based Layer-2, canonical bridge, and ZK-secured rollup design to bring fast, low-fee $BTC transactions and DeFi. The $HYPER presale has raised over $27.8M with whale participation, creating a sizable runway for development and liquidity programs. Forecasts suggest potential 6.5x upside from today’s token price by 2026 if Bitcoin Hyper executes its roadmap and Layer-2 demand grows. Bitcoin’s latest cycle is in full drama mode. After ripping to six-figure territory earlier this year, it has since slipped back under $100K, with recent moves below $93K triggering a fear and greed reading near ‘ extreme panic ’. Zoom out, though, and the big picture still leans bullish. Several major research desks and high-profile analysts continue to float targets between $200K and beyond for this cycle, with Hayes even hinting at a $1M $BTC by 2028 as institutional adoption ramps and treasuries continue to accumulate. That mix of macro optimism and short-term volatility pushes more capital away from pure ‘number go up’ bets and into infrastructure plays. One of the loudest narratives for 2025 is Bitcoin scaling: Layer-2 solutions, rollups, and sidechains built to handle the fees and congestion created by Ordinals, Runes, and the first wave of Bitcoin DeFi. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) fits straight into this setup. It is a Bitcoin Layer-2 that uses Solana’s Virtual Machine (SVM) to bring high-throughput and low-fee execution to $BTC, with a canonical bridge and rollup design that settles back to Bitcoin for security. Its presale has already attracted over $27.8M, with a token price of $0.013285 and massive post-launch potential. With a projected official launch window set for Q4 2025 – Q1 2026, $HYPER could become the next 1000x crypto in 2026 and beyond. Buy your $HYPER today before the presale window closes. Bitcoin Hyper Aims To Turn Bitcoin Into A High-Speed DeFi Rail Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) thesis is simple: keep Bitcoin’s base-layer security while offloading activity to a dedicated execution environment. Users deposit $BTC to a monitored address on Layer-1, a canonical bridge verifies the transaction, then equivalent $BTC is minted on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2. From there, transfers and interactions happen in an SVM environment designed for near-instant finality and high throughput, before batched state updates and zero-knowledge proofs are committed back to Bitcoin. In practice, that means cheap $BTC payments, on-chain order books, staking, and even meme coins that are still anchored to Bitcoin’s settlement layer. Developers who already understand Solana’s tooling get a familiar stack while tapping into Bitcoin liquidity, which is exactly the combo many builders have been waiting for. If Bitcoin DeFi volume continues to grow and programmable $BTC takes off, a performant Layer-2 designed for that flow is well-positioned to capture fees and user attention. That is the core utility bet behind $HYPER. If you want to support that utility, buy your $HYPER today. The $HYPER Presale and ROI Scenarios For 2025–2026 On the numbers side, the Bitcoin Hyper presale has already crossed $27.8M, helped by at least one $502K whale ticket and consistent daily inflows despite the broader market wobble. Based on the community hype, investor participation, and the project’s express utility, our price prediction for $HYPER suggests a high of $0.08625 in 2026, assuming the roadmap stays on track. Against a $0.013285 entry, this implies roughly a 6.5x return in a 2026 scenario where the DAO is live, node incentives are working, and Bitcoin Layer-2 adoption continues to compound. These are not moonshots compared with meme-coin pumps, but they are realistic multiples for an infrastructure token that actually has to run a chain. With a clear-cut roadmap , a narrative aligned with Bitcoin’s technical development, and an influx of investors, we can rank $HYPER among the best presales of 2025. This makes it a great investment opportunity for $BTC holders who want scaling exposure rather than another meme. If you’re sold, read our guide on how to buy $HYPER beforehand.

While the broader trend remains under pressure, signs of temporary support are forming. Breaking down market conditions across the daily chart, 4H timeframe, and a key on-chain metric can help assess what might come next. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart The daily structure remains negative as a bearish cross is occurring between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, with a death cross (between 50-day and 200-day moving averages) already formed. These signals have led to a swift move down into the $93,000–$95,000 demand zone. This area is acting as short-term support, with bulls attempting a reaction. The RSI is also nearly oversold, now hovering just below 35, suggesting some exhaustion in selling pressure. Still, the trend has clearly shifted, and lower highs dominate the recent price action. Buyers need to reclaim the $100K–$105K range and flip it into support to regain momentum. Until then, the price action is likely to remain capped. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour timeframe reveals a breakout and consolidation below the falling wedge pattern formed during the broader downtrend. The asset is now retesting the pattern’s lower trendline near $96K, supported by a clear bullish divergence on the RSI, which could result in the price climbing back into the wedge. If the buyers manage to reclaim this level, a short-term bounce toward $99K–$100K will be probable before meeting strong supply again. However, failure to hold $95K and a rejection from the lower boundary of the pattern opens the door for a deeper drop to $90K and possibly even $88K, which marks a key untested support zone from earlier in the year. The structure remains bearish overall, but short-term relief is possible as momentum builds. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Whale Ratio (30-Day Moving Average) The exchange whale ratio has been climbing again, with the 30-day SMA rising above 0.48, which is its highest level in months. This signals that large holders are increasingly dominating exchange inflows, which often leads to sell-offs or increased volatility. Historically, spikes in this ratio have aligned with local tops or high-risk zones, especially when the price is under technical pressure like now. If this trend continues, even more downside driven by whale activity could be expected, particularly if the price fails to reclaim resistance levels soon.

The campaign offers participants the opportunity to share a prize pool of 100,000 BARD tokens by minting new LBTC during the promotional period. The event runs from November 14, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. UTC through December 13, 2025, at 11:59 p.m. UTC. Eligible participants who stake BTC to mint LBTC through Bybit On-Chain Earn during this time will be included in hourly snapshots used to determine their share of the BARD rewards. LBTC, or Lombard Staked BTC, is a liquid staked Bitcoin (LST) issued by Lombard Finance and backed 1:1 by Bitcoin. Supported by a decentralized alliance of 14 major digital-asset institutions, LBTC holds a 60 percent share of the Bitcoin LST market, making it the largest in the category. Its yield is generated via Babylon Labs’ Bitcoin Staking Protocol, which enables holders to earn staking rewards while preserving the value of their underlying BTC. Bybit’s integration of LBTC aims to simplify on-chain Bitcoin staking by removing technical barriers. The exchange provides users with direct BTC-to-LBTC minting and LBTC-to-BTC redemption, allowing them to maintain liquidity while participating in staking activities. Both retail and institutional users can benefit from this streamlined experience through Bybit’s centralized exchange interface. During the campaign, only newly minted LBTC amounts—calculated as total minted minus total redeemed—will be eligible for reward snapshots. The daily balance is determined by the lowest hourly snapshot within each 24-hour period. All BARD token rewards will be distributed to participants’ Funding Accounts three days after the event concludes.

The post included interactions from other users asking for the ticker and commenting on the implications for institutional adoption; one user asked directly what the ticker would be and was told it is XRPZ. The timing Nguyen gave places the launch within the same week that other issuers began listing or launching their own spot XRP products, contributing to elevated market attention. BREAKING NEWS: Franklin Templeton $1.6T Assest Fund Manager's Spot XRP ETF will launch next Tuesday, November 18 at 9:30 AM ET/ 6:30 AM PT. BOOOOOOM! #XRP #RLUSD #XRPETF pic.twitter.com/SlR8ZVM5X1 — Kenny Nguyen (@mrnguyen007) November 14, 2025 Where this sits in the ETF rollout Franklin Templeton’s proposed XRP trust has appeared in preparatory listings and regulatory filings in recent weeks. This is a step that market participants commonly interpreted as preparation for an imminent public launch. Industry records and DTCC listings show the Franklin XRP Trust under the ticker XRPZ, consistent with the information cited in social channels. The firm also amended its S-1 filing earlier in November, removing a contractual delay clause and thereby streamlining the path for the registration to become effective unless regulators intervene. Market context: Canary Capital’s debut and investor interest The Franklin announcement follows Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF debut on November 13, which recorded significantly strong early trading volumes and was widely reported as one of the strongest ETF debuts of 2025. Canary’s fund, listed as XRPC, registered substantial first-day and early-session volume figures that market commentators described as notable for a single-issuer launch, and those figures have been cited as setting a precedent for subsequent issuers’ launches. The Canary debut has heightened expectations for institutional flows into similar XRP products. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Impact and immediate outlook Market observers note that multiple issuers’ appearance in DTCC and regulatory filings — including Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, 21Shares, and others — indicates coordinated preparatory activity across issuers and custodial infrastructure. That coordination, together with Canary Capital’s high-volume debut, frames Franklin Templeton’s timing as part of a broader entry of spot XRP ETFs into U.S. markets rather than an isolated event. The removal of the SEC delay provision from Franklin’s filing and the fund on DTCC’s systems is frequently cited as a technical indicator that a launch window is near. However, the start of trading remains subject to exchange listing procedures and regulator actions. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This startup’s ambitious vision comes at a crucial time when South Korea’s defense industry shows massive potential but lacks innovative newcomers. How Bone AI is Revolutionizing Defense Technology Bone AI represents a new breed of defense tech startups that leverage artificial intelligence to create autonomous systems for military and government applications. Founded by serial entrepreneur DK Lee, the company operates from dual headquarters in Seoul and Palo Alto, California, bridging Silicon Valley innovation with South Korea’s manufacturing prowess. The $12 Million Funding That Changes Everything The seed round was led by Third Prime with strategic participation from Kolon Group, a South Korean industrial giant specializing in advanced materials and manufacturing. What makes this funding particularly significant is founder DK Lee’s personal commitment of over 10% – approximately $1.5 million – demonstrating deep conviction in the company’s mission. Investor Role Strategic Value Third Prime Lead Investor VC expertise and network Kolon Group Strategic Investor Advanced materials and manufacturing DK Lee Founder Investment Personal commitment and alignment South Korea’s Defense Tech Opportunity Gap Despite South Korea becoming the second-largest arms supplier to European NATO members with approximately $69 billion in order backlogs, the country’s defense-tech startup ecosystem remains surprisingly underdeveloped. This creates a perfect storm of opportunity for innovative companies like Bone AI to bridge the gap between traditional manufacturing strength and next-generation technology. Bone AI’s Three-Pronged Robotics Strategy The company is developing autonomous systems across three domains with a unified AI platform approach: Aerial Drones (UAVs) : Initial focus on defense applications including logistics support and anti-drone defense Ground Vehicles (UGVs) : Autonomous ground systems for various military operations Marine Vehicles (USVs) : Unmanned surface vehicles for maritime security Why This Startup is Already Generating Revenue In a remarkable achievement for a company less than a year old, Bone AI has already secured a seven-figure B2G contract and generated $3 million in revenue during its first year of operation. The secret? Strategic acquisition of D-Makers, a South Korean drone company, just six months after launch, providing immediate intellectual property and market traction. The Physical AI Vision Beyond Defense Founder DK Lee emphasizes that Bone AI shouldn’t be pigeonholed as just a defense company. He frames it as a “physical AI” firm that brings together advanced AI simulation, autonomy algorithms, embedded engineering, hardware design, and large-scale manufacturing under one roof. How Bone AI Compares to Global Defense Tech Leaders While companies like Anduril in the U.S. (valued at over $30 billion) and Helsing in Europe (last funded at $13 billion) have achieved massive valuations, Asia has yet to see comparable defense tech adoption. Bone AI aims to fill this gap by leveraging South Korea’s unique manufacturing advantages. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bone AI’s background? Bone AI was founded by DK Lee , who previously co-founded MarqVision . The company operates from both Seoul and Palo Alto, California. Who are Bone AI’s investors? The $12 million seed round was led by Third Prime with participation from Kolon Group , a South Korean strategic investor. What technology does Bone AI develop? Bone AI creates autonomous air (UAVs), ground (UGVs), and marine (USVs) vehicles powered by artificial intelligence for defense and government clients. How does Bone AI compare to other defense tech companies? While similar to companies like Anduril in the U.S. and Helsing in Europe, Bone AI focuses on leveraging South Korea’s manufacturing strengths while building a unified AI platform. The Future of Asian Defense Tech Innovation Bone AI’s emergence signals a potential turning point for Asia’s defense technology landscape. By combining South Korea’s manufacturing excellence with cutting-edge AI and robotics, the company represents a new model for defense innovation that could challenge established players and create new global standards for autonomous defense systems.

On September 29, Kim wrote : “ As the world’s highest IQ record holder and Grand Master of Memory, I believe that Bitcoin is the only hope for the future economy. “ He claims to have converted all his assets into Bitcoin, expecting the cryptocurrency to appreciate 100x over the next decade , a path that would place BTC above $10 million. Kim also argues that Bitcoin will become the world’s “ultimate reserve asset,” surpassing gold, foreign currencies, and U.S. Treasuries. The 36-year-old South Korean founder of the United Sigma Intelligence Association has attracted a large online following, but his credibility is heavily debated. Future Economy: According to my theoretical analysis, within the next 10 years, Bitcoin will increase at least 100 times and be universally adopted as the ultimate reserve asset. As a result, American Bitcoin @ABTC will become #1 company in the world by market capitalization. https://t.co/MOKnDLshX8 — YoungHoon Kim, IQ 276 (@yhbryankimiq) September 25, 2025 Psychometric experts have questioned his IQ claims, and Paul Cooijmans of the Giga Society previously described Kim as a “pathologically lying impostor” in an interview with VICE. Bitcoin Bulls Are Doubting Kim’s $220K Forecast Many market participants, even Bitcoin bulls, are skeptical that Kim’s $220K price projection can be achieved in the next 45 days. Over the last 41 days alone, the entire crypto market has erased $1.1 trillion in market cap, with Bitcoin shedding over $400 billion within that period.

Over the last 16 days alone, the crypto market has seen 3 days with liquidations exceeding $1 billion . Daily liquidations of $500+ million have become a normal occurrence. Expert Warns Bitcoin Could Crash to $89K or $72K Support Levels Arthur Azizov, Founder and Investor at B2 Ventures, also told Cryptonews that Bitcoin’s drop to the $95,000–$96,000 level is the result of changing sentiment and the serious outflows from spot ETFs recently. “Once the price fell below the crucial $100,000 level, it confirmed a descending channel that had been forming since mid-October, right after the massive liquidations. Yet the market isn’t collapsing, and I can’t say it turns bearish right away. Participants just get more cautious,” he said. He urged investors to pay close attention to the $89,000–$94,000 zone, as this is where liquidity is concentrated right now. Bitcoin steadied on Monday after sliding to new lows near $93K, according to Laser Digital’s derivatives desk the drop came without a clear catalyst. #Bitcoin #Derivatives https://t.co/aMs2LKdOq0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 17, 2025 “If sellers keep putting pressure, the worst-case scenario is a return to the April 2025 $72,000–$74,000 band, where a real bullish impulse began and let BTC rise almost to $127,000, setting a new all-time high.” Looking ahead into year-end and the beginning of 2026, Azizov still sees the current Bitcoin price action as a healthy consolidation until a clear bearish signal appears. Even though the chances for recovery are decreasing daily, they still exist.

The new product, OpenTrade Stablecoin Staking Yield Powered by Figment, delivers an average annual percentage rate (APR) of around 15% on stablecoins, based on historical data and market conditions. It combines staking rewards from Solana ( SOL ) with OpenTrade’s institutional-grade yield infrastructure and a hedging strategy that offsets price volatility of the staked tokens. Higher yields with the peace of mind of an institutional service Figment is bringing its “safety over liveness” approach, that allows institutional investors to earn staking-based returns while avoiding exposure to decentralized lending markets. The platform’s infrastructure includes legal protections for institutions not typically available in DeFi lending. Under the partnership, Crypto.com provides custodial services for SOL tokens, which are held in segregated accounts. Investors are granted a security interest in the custodied assets, which remain fully separated from the exchange’s operational funds. “We’re bringing our battle-tested infrastructure and security mindset to stablecoins to offer customers exceptional yield opportunities with the peace of mind of an institutional service,” said Andy Cronk, Co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Figment. While users deposit and withdraw stablecoins, earnings are generated through Solana staking returns managed by Figment and hedging via perpetual SOL futures managed by OpenTrade. The combined model has historically produced yields more than double Solana’s native staking rewards of around 6.5% to 7.5%. Jeff Handler, Co-Founder and CCO of OpenTrade added: “As stablecoin usage and demand for stablecoin yield solutions amongst exchanges, wallet providers, and other fintechs has continued to surge, we have been working closely with Figment to build and deliver a new stablecoin yield offering that improves on existing options in the market today. Stablecoin Staking Yield is the result of these efforts, and through our partnership, any company with stablecoins can access a new category of yield options which offer a combination of market leading returns and strong protections, which together cannot be accessed across either solely RWA or DeFi investment strategies.” Karl Turner, Director at Crypto.com , concluded on the parnership: “We have purpose built our platform in order to serve the needs of all traders today and tomorrow. We are proud to support Figment, a true leader in staking capabilities, in enabling a staking stablecoin offering that clients are increasingly looking for in the digital asset investment landscape.” Featured image via Shutterstock.

The longtime cryptographer, who was cited in the original Bitcoin white paper, said current fears circulating on social media over an imminent “quantum attack” are overstated. Back made the comment on Nov. 15 while responding to an X user who asked whether Bitcoin was at risk as quantum research accelerates. Probably not for 20-40 years, if then. And there are quantum secure signatures, NIST standardized SLH-DSA last year. Bitcoin can add over time, as the evaluation continues and be quantum ready, long before cryptographically relevant quantum computers arrive. — Adam Back (@adam3us) November 15, 2025 He wrote that Bitcoin is “probably not” vulnerable for “20–40 years,” pointing out that the National Institute of Standards and Technology has already approved post-quantum encryption standards that Bitcoin could adopt long before quantum computers reach a level where breaking SHA-256 becomes realistic. Despite Viral Predictions, Practical Quantum Attacks Remain Far From Reality His response followed a viral video of venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, who predicted that the quantum threat could emerge in as little as two to five years. Chamath predicts a 2-5 year window before quantum computing becomes advanced enough to potentially break Bitcoin’s encryption. pic.twitter.com/1vTUh1i1Lm — Bitcoin Teddy (@Bitcoin_Teddy) November 14, 2025 Palihapitiya argued that roughly 8,000 qubits would be required to break SHA-256. Back pushed back on the timeline, explaining that today’s machines are far too noisy and far too small. The highest-capacity neutral-atom system, built at Caltech, has reached about 6,100 physical qubits. However, this remains unusable for breaking cryptography because real-world qubits require heavy error correction. Systems with more stable qubits, such as Quantinuum’s Helios , still only deliver about 48 logical qubits. Gate-based systems recently passed 1,000 qubits with Atom Computing, but this is far from the thousands of logical qubits needed to run Shor’s algorithm on current standards like RSA-2048 or Bitcoin’s elliptic curve signatures. While experts agree that practical quantum attacks are not achievable today, the long-term threat remains. The idea of “harvest now, decrypt later,” where attackers collect encrypted data now and decrypt it in the future, has already become a concern in traditional cybersecurity. This technique does not directly affect Bitcoin’s ownership model but highlights the need for timely upgrades across the digital world as quantum capabilities evolve. Is Bitcoin Really Ready for the Quantum Era? The debate over preparation has intensified across the Bitcoin community this year. In November, on-chain analyst Willy Woo urged users to move coins from Taproot addresses , arguing that addresses exposing public keys directly could become vulnerable first. Former Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli said older formats offer more short-term protection, though he warned that no user-initiated migration plan can be considered fully safe once quantum machines reach the mempool-level attack threshold. Good advice for protecting unspent coins – P2PKH gives you years of protection while Taproot exposes your pubkey immediately. But don’t call this “quantum safe.” The moment you broadcast a spend, your pubkey hits the mempool. A quantum attacker could crack your key and RBF… https://t.co/s7DGJ7N8xB — Jonas Schnelli (@_jonasschnelli_) November 11, 2025 Developers are now examining Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 360 , which introduces quantum-resistant ML-DSA signatures selected by NIST in 2024. The plan, drafted by Jameson Lopp, outlines a multi-year transition to phase out older signature schemes before quantum machines become relevant. Supporters argue it provides structure to a complex upgrade process, while others say only a protocol-level overhaul will give users reliable protection. Industry voices remain split on timelines. Some, including Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, warn that a breakthrough within five years cannot be ruled out as AI accelerates research. Analysts estimate that roughly 6 to 7 million BTC sit in older address formats that would be first in line for a quantum attack. El Salvador, which holds more than 6,000 BTC in its national reserve, recently redistributed its treasury across 14 addresses to reduce exposure after criticism over single-address storage. Source: a16z Multiple quantum researchers have revised their projections closer to the late 2020s or early 2030s , noting that required machine sizes have consistently dropped as hardware improves. Some startups now claim that specialized designs with hundreds of thousands of qubits could threaten 256-bit elliptic curve signatures. At the same time, engineers recognize that upgrading decentralized networks requires far more coordination than updating traditional systems. Post-quantum signature schemes often involve larger keys and higher computational loads, posing challenges for wallet developers and miners. Projects such as Rootstock and Naoris Protocol have begun experimenting with post-quantum infrastructure, and hardware wallets like Trezor’s Safe 7 now ship with quantum-secure update paths.

New Model Predicts $7–$24 From ETF Inflows,https://coinpaper.com/12409/xrp-set-to-skyrocket-new-model-predicts-7-24-from-etf-inflows,"ETF Inflow Model: XRP Could Surge to $7–$24 Within 60 Days A new market model suggests XRP could skyrocket to $7–$24 within 60 days, fueled entirely by ETF inflows. Analyst Diana highlights how institutional capital may reshape XRP’s liquidity and drive a major price surge. The scenario is simple but powerful: 5–20 new XRP ETFs, each seeded with $10M–$45M, could drive substantial price gains. This isn’t hype, it’s basic supply and demand. With XRP’s limited liquid supply, even moderate institutional inflows can sharply move the market, as Diana highlights. Therefore, the model projects XRP could hit $4.50–$15 within 30 days of ETF launches, and $7–$24 over 60 days. While ranges vary with ETF count and initial capital, the takeaway is clear: institutional adoption could spark a powerful, liquidity-driven rally. This model arrives at a critical juncture as institutional demand for crypto grows. ETFs offer a regulated, familiar pathway for traditional funds and high-net-worth investors to gain exposure, with Canary Capital already leading the way through its newly launched XRP ETF. Crypto ETF launches have historically fueled rapid price surges, Canary Capital’s XRP ETF drew $245M at debut. With Franklin Templeton next in line in a $1.6T AUM market, XRP could see another major liquidity-driven rally. What does this mean? Well, XRP may be on the brink of a transformative surge. With multiple ETFs poised to launch, institutional credibility, strong inflows, and tight liquid supply set the stage for significant price gains. Even conservative projections suggest near-term upside beyond recent trends, while optimistic scenarios hint at a meteoric rise that could redefine XRP’s role in the crypto market. Notably, this model highlights the rising influence of institutional channels on crypto markets. XRP’s upcoming ETFs could become the next major liquidity catalyst, with the next 60 days set to reveal just how high institutional inflows can push the price. Conclusion The new XRP ETF inflow model signals a potentially transformative phase for the token. With multiple ETFs on the horizon, substantial institutional capital could flood XRP, amplifying pressure on its limited liquid supply. Whether it climbs to $7 or surges toward $24, the next 60 days are likely to be marked by heightened liquidity, growing institutional credibility, and intense market focus. These ETF-driven dynamics could spark one of the most significant price movements in XRP’s history.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 14:12:30

In those early days, freedom online came at the expense of accountability. But the digital world has matured. As technology became central to how people bank, trade, and communicate, trust replaced mystery as the foundation of participation. Today, the question is no longer whether users can remain unseen, but whether the platforms they depend on can be trusted to protect what matters most — data, money, and reputation. Transparency as the new standard The evolution of online trust has been shaped by the growing demand for transparency. Blockchain technology, once a niche experiment, has become a cornerstone of digital accountability. Every transaction recorded on a blockchain is verifiable, timestamped, and resistant to tampering, providing a level of security traditional systems struggled to match. This has made it a model for industries beyond cryptocurrency, influencing how financial institutions, digital marketplaces, and even entertainment platforms build credibility. Transparency is not just about visibility, but about assurance. Whether managing investments, streaming content, or using a licensed platform for online slots , users now expect clear evidence that the systems they interact with operate under verified standards. Licensing, encryption, and regulatory oversight have become hallmarks of digital reliability, signalling that a platform’s promises are backed by enforceable protection. What began as an internet built on trust between strangers has transformed into one where verification is the norm. The influence of regulation and reputation Regulation once seemed at odds with the free spirit of the internet. Yet as digital economies expanded, rules became essential to prevent misuse and ensure fairness. The financial and crypto sectors, in particular, have shown how oversight can coexist with innovation. Markets thrive when users feel secure, and confidence is impossible without safeguards. That same principle now extends across the broader digital landscape, from data management to entertainment and e-commerce. Reputation has also become a form of currency. Verified user reviews, transparency reports, and security disclosures all contribute to how online businesses earn and maintain trust. In a space where a single breach can destroy credibility overnight, companies invest heavily in trust-building mechanisms — not as a legal obligation, but as a competitive advantage. Technology and human trust Despite the sophistication of algorithms and encryption, trust ultimately remains a human instinct. People decide where to spend, share, and engage based on their perception of safety and integrity. Technology provides the framework, but it is consistency and accountability that sustain confidence over time. The most successful digital platforms are those that align innovation with ethical responsibility, proving that speed and safety can coexist. This growing awareness has led to the rise of “trust-by-design,” a concept where protection is built into every layer of the user experience. From privacy-first software to decentralized networks that remove single points of failure, technology now strives not just to serve people, but to reassure them. Beyond finance: a culture of responsibility The cultural shift toward assurance extends beyond traditional finance. Consumers are more aware than ever of how their data is used and are beginning to demand greater transparency from all digital providers. Companies are responding by publishing independent audits, adopting open-source models, and communicating openly about how user protection is managed. In this new era, credibility is not given; it is earned through continuous demonstration of reliability. Trust has evolved from a by-product of convenience into a measure of value itself. The digital economy, once driven by novelty, now thrives on accountability and a focus on trust. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The structure has formed immediately above the $2 support zone, a level that has repeatedly acted as a base during recent volatility. Chart analysts view the pattern as a potential precursor to renewed upside if resistance levels break in the coming sessions. XRP Pennant Compression Hints at Breakout The token traded between $2.16 and $2.28 over the past 24 hours, reflecting the type of range compression typically associated with maturing continuation patterns. Pennants that form after a broader upward trend generally resolve higher, and XRP’s chart reflects that sequence. Momentum indicators are starting to recover. The RSI, now at 40.24, has rebounded from oversold conditions after XRP’s 10.17% weekly decline, suggesting traders may be preparing for renewed accumulation. Market participants are focused on the $2.30–$2.40 resistance corridor. A decisive daily or weekly close above this range could trigger algorithmic buy orders and systematic inflows targeting $2.62 — XRP’s July high and the first major upside objective if the pennant breaks to the upside. Narrative and Market Positioning: Outset PR’s Data-Driven Communications Strategy As technical setups shape trader expectations, communications play an increasingly influential role in how crypto projects maintain visibility and investor confidence during consolidation phases. Outset PR , led by cryptocurrency communications strategist Mike Ermolaev, has become known for aligning messaging with market structure, investor sentiment, and real-time analytics. Outset PR operates more like a workshop than a traditional agency, building campaigns that mirror the precision of technical charting. Media strategies are anchored in quantitative indicators such as discoverability, domain authority, conversion potential, and viral relevance, ensuring that every placement and pitch strengthens narrative momentum. Messaging is tailored to match each publication’s editorial tone while aligning with broader market cycles. The agency’s analytics-driven methodology has produced verifiable outcomes for clients across Web3. As assets like XRP navigate breakout structures, projects increasingly rely on clear, data-backed communications to maintain credibility, differentiate themselves in crowded markets, and steady sentiment during volatility — all areas where Outset PR’s performance-led approach has carved out a unique niche. Outlook A confirmed breakout above $2.40 would likely reaccelerate upside momentum and refocus traders on the $2.62 high. Failure to break resistance could extend the consolidation phase, but the pennant’s structure and RSI recovery suggest that buyers are gradually regaining control. The coming sessions will determine whether compression resolves upward — a move that could set the tone for XRP’s next multi-week trend.

Related News: US President Donald Trump Explains Why He Pardoned Binance Founder CZ! While this amnesty continues to be talked about in the industry, now the $4.3 billion fine paid by CZ and Binance has become a hot topic. At this point, CZ was asked what he would do if the $4.3 billion fine he and Binance paid was returned after his pardon. Cryptocurrency expert Anndy Lian asked CZ from her X account, “Hello CZ, since you’ve been pardoned, will they return your $4.3 billion?” CZ responded indirectly, calling the question a sensitive one and expressing his gratitude for the pardon. CZ stated that if the paid funds were to be returned in any way, he would reinvest them in the United States as a gesture of gratitude. “A polite question. 1. I'm grateful in advance for forgiving. There's a balance between wanting more, wanting what's fair, and being grateful for what you get. 2. If we receive any refund, we will already deposit it to America to show our appreciation.” Binance previously pleaded guilty to charges of violating anti-money laundering and sanctions regulations imposed by US authorities. The $4.3 billion fine was part of a 2023 settlement reached by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) against Binance and its founder, CZ. ah, delicate question. 1. I appreciate the pardon already.

This Bitcoin transfer matters because institutional movements often serve as leading indicators for market trends. When large players make significant moves, retail investors typically follow. The $409 million Bitcoin transfer represents substantial market influence that could impact: Short-term price volatility Market sentiment and confidence Liquidity conditions across exchanges Future institutional adoption patterns How Do Large Bitcoin Transfers Affect Market Dynamics? Every substantial Bitcoin transfer creates ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. This particular movement from Coinbase Institutional reduces exchange supply, which can create upward price pressure if demand remains constant. However, the unknown destination wallet adds an element of uncertainty that markets typically dislike. The blockchain’s transparency allows us to track this Bitcoin transfer in real-time, but the ultimate purpose remains speculative. This ambiguity often leads to increased market volatility as traders interpret the signals differently. What Can We Learn From This Bitcoin Transfer Pattern? Analyzing this Bitcoin transfer provides valuable insights into current market psychology. The move from an institutional platform to a private wallet suggests confidence in long-term holding rather than immediate trading intentions. This Bitcoin transfer pattern often correlates with bullish long-term outlooks among sophisticated investors. Key takeaways from this analysis include: Institutional players continue accumulating Bitcoin Security and custody solutions remain top priorities Market infrastructure handles large transfers efficiently Transparency enables real-time market intelligence Final Thoughts on This Significant Bitcoin Movement This substantial Bitcoin transfer underscores the growing maturity of cryptocurrency markets.

While the immediate market impact remains uncertain, the long-term implications suggest continued institutional adoption and market sophistication. The mystery surrounding the destination wallet adds intrigue, but the fundamental story remains clear: major players continue positioning themselves in Bitcoin, reinforcing its status as a legitimate asset class worthy of significant capital allocation. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin transfer alert?

54531969,629344,1763394242,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54531969.jpeg,Ethereum Rebound Puts Spotlight On Best Meme Coins Like Maxi Doge,https://bitcoinist.com/best-meme-coins-maxi-doge-presale-ethereum-3100-rebound/,"Quick Facts: Ethereum rebounded above $3,100 after a sharp breakdown, even as Bitcoin slid to the low $93K region and sentiment hit extreme fear. Arthur Hayes’ $4.1M sell-off and a dormant $ETH whale reawakening highlight how large players are reshuffling risk during this volatility spike. Maxi Doge blends leverage-trader culture with staking, contests and planned futures-platform integrations, aiming to stand out from pure joke tokens and become one of the market’s best meme coins. From current presale levels, upside scenarios rely on solid execution, exchange listings and a broader recovery in risk appetite across crypto. Ethereum ($ETH) managed to claw back above $3.1K on November 16 after briefly slipping below that level for the first time since November 4. The bounce came in the middle of a brutal risk-off move across crypto, with Bitcoin tagging the low $93K area and pushing the Fear & Greed Index down to extreme-fear territory at 17 . At the same time, one of the market’s most watched whales hit the sell button. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes liquidated roughly $4.1M in crypto assets , including 700 $ETH, along with large clips of $ENA, $LDO, $AAVE, and $UNI. Meanwhile, a dormant Ethereum wallet woke up after more than a decade, moving 200 $ETH . Put together, that is a pretty wild mix of signals. Long-term holders are rotating, a well-known trader is de-risking into weakness, and yet $ETH still defended a key support zone within hours. For anyone who has lived through a few cycles, this is classic late-stage volatility: leverage getting wiped, while spot buyers quietly hunt value. In that type of environment, some traders rotate out of majors and into higher beta plays once the dust starts to settle. For meme coin enthusiasts, that usually means scanning for fresh narratives and early-stage presales with asymmetric upside. One of the names now popping up more often in that conversation is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a Doge-inspired meme coin whose presale has already raised more than $4M at a token price of $0.0002685. Maxi Doge Leans Into Leverage Culture While Adding Utility Maxi Doge takes the familiar Shiba Inu meme and dials it to eleven. The branding is all about the over-caffeinated trader on 1000x leverage: ripped Doge, Red Bull references, and a ‘wake up, sweat, trade, repeat’ storyline that fits the degen mood surprisingly well. Underneath the memes lies a basic utility layer. The $MAXI token lives on Ethereum and is designed around three core hooks: staking, contests, and partner events. As a token holder, you can stake your tokens in a dedicated pool, where rewards are distributed by a smart contract, with current advertised staking yields of 76% annually. The project also plans $MAXI-denominated trading contests aimed at ‘top ROI hunters’, plus community events tied to futures-platform integrations and gamified tournaments. A dedicated ‘Maxi Fund’ holding 25% of tokens is earmarked to support these partnerships and market-making, while 40% goes to marketing, 15% to development, 15% to liquidity, and 5% to the staking pool. To get a full lowdown on the project, be sure to read ‘What is Maxi Doge?’ Security and infrastructure are handled in a fairly standard way for this segment. The $MAXI smart contract has been audited by third-party firms, including Coinsult , and the presale is routed through Web3-native tooling and integrated into multi-chain wallets like Best Wallet. In a market where Ethereum’s volatility is forcing traders to think harder about where they deploy risk, a meme coin that openly represents leverage culture while offering staking and planned integrations is on-brand for degen participants. Presale Numbers Hint At Upside If Sentiment Turns The Maxi Doge presale kicked off in July and uses a tiered pricing model where each stage nudges the token price higher. It has raised over $4M so far, with $MAXI currently available for $0.0002685 per token and a hard cap set near $15.76M. Want to grab your share of $MAXI tokens? Check out our comprehensive Maxi Doge buying guide . If you’re a trader hunting the best meme coins in a down-only week, that structure matters. It means you can secure tokens at a steep discount if you get in early, while the rising price ladder creates a built-in FOMO effect if demand keeps building. On top of that, staking is live during the presale, so you can start compounding rewards rather than waiting for a distant TGE. Where things get interesting is on the forward-looking side. Based on our Maxi Doge price prediction , $MAXI has the potential to reach a high of $0.0058 by the end of 2026, assuming a successful Uniswap debut, follow-through listings, and a supportive broader market. Still, the setup is straightforward. Ethereum just showed it can bounce even as a high-profile whale dumps and dormant wallets wake up. Bitcoin has flushed excessive leverage, and sentiment is at extremes. If risk appetite rotates back into high-beta assets, a meme coin presale that already has traction, staking yield, and a clear cultural pitch will likely sit on many watchlists.

According to findings published on Web3Caff , flaws in multiple versions of the system left some users exposed to credential leakage, with attackers able, in certain cases, to obtain wallet private keys and centralized and decentralized exchange API credentials. After making those discoveries, the SlowMist team reached out to the security teams of Binance and OKX, who worked with the team to identify affected users and revoke compromised keys. Authentication flaws exposed in multiple versions The SlowMist investigation began after the team received intelligence from a community researcher operating under the handle @Endlessss20, who suspected that NOFX AI might be leaking exchange API keys. Cos, the founder of SlowMist , who uses the X handle @evilcos, initially had praise for NOFX AI’s open-source efforts, calling them commendable. However, he then stated that the risks they have “disclosed have already led to real theft incidents, where some users’ wallet private keys and CEX/DEX API Keys were leaked as a result.” Cos added that SlowMist’s initial disclosure effort was deliberately coordinated with exchange security teams to ensure that those affected were notified before details were released publicly. SlowMist’s subsequent analysis identified two core authentication issues affecting different commit generations of the open-source repository. This issue was reportedly present in older and newer versions of the open-source platform; the system reportedly ran in an “Authorization Required” state that nonetheless lacked actual access controls, leaving sensitive administrator (admin) functions open without authentication. So, attackers could interact with admin APIs without needing credentials. Compounding these authentication weaknesses, one of the system’s API endpoints returned sensitive connection data by default, including API keys and associated secrets for exchanges such as Binance, Hyperliquid, and Aster DEX . Coordinated security response with exchanges After confirming the severity of the issues, SlowMist contacted the security divisions of Binance and OKX. They reportedly set up a joint security operations room where SlowMist supplied intelligence and an impact assessment, while the exchange teams independently analyzed and verified the compromised API data. The groups then worked backwards from exposed keys to identify at-risk accounts on their platforms. The exchanges initiated countermeasures, informing each affected user and immediately revoking their API keys, secret keys, and any linked automation credentials. “As of November 17, all affected CEX users have been notified, and their relevant keys have been revoked, and their assets are safe,” SlowMist stated in its report. However, it admitted that reaching users on decentralized exchanges was relatively more difficult. SlowMist said they and the Binance team tried to contact a small number of Aster and Hyperliquid users directly, but could not “due to the decentralized wallet addresses.” “If you are using automated trading systems on Aster or Hyperliquid, please promptly check and address any related risks,” the security firm warned users. Warnings for the AI-trading ecosystem SlowMist also pointed out that there is a rise in large-scale AI model quantization projects; however, most open-source implementations are still in their early stages. Therefore, those deploying such emerging open-source systems are advised to “conduct thorough code security audits and strengthen risk control measures to avoid financial losses.” The security firm also had recommendations for the NOFX AI team and users, advising them to refuse to run the program if a template key is detected, disable admin mode unless explicitly configured and protected with a strong password and OTP authentication, and redesign sensitive endpoints to return only non-critical metadata while requiring secondary verification for private-key or API-key access, among others.

""Not Bearish, But a Drop to This Level Could Come!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bernstein-analysts-reveal-the-real-reason-for-bitcoins-decline-not-bearish-but-a-drop-to-this-level-could-come/,"While the declines in the cryptocurrency market seem to be coming to an end, there is still debate as to whether these declines are a bear market signal or a temporary correction. The final comment on this point came from Bernstein, who has more than $750 billion in assets under management. Are Bitcoin's Drops Bearish or Just a Correction? According to The Block, Bernstein stated in his latest report that the recent Bitcoin declines are a short-term correction rather than a transition to a bear market. Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani stated that the recent sell-off in Bitcoin is a short-term correction driven by concerns about the four-year cycle peak. Analysts said investors who experienced cycle peaks in 2013, 2017 and 2021 sold in advance against the weakness in the fourth quarter because they believed the cycle peak was in 2025, according to the historical cycle pattern. Recalling that there have been major declines of 60-70% in past cycles, Bernstein stated that BTC has only experienced a drop of around 25% from its last ATH, which is a relatively superficial correction rather than a structural bear market. Bernstein also said that investors who had held for more than a year sold 340,000 BTC ($38 billion) in the last six months, but that supply was largely absorbed by spot ETFs and companies. “In the last six months, investors sold 340,000 BTC worth $38 billion, but this sale was covered by ETFs and treasury companies, who bought $34 billion. Additionally, institutional ownership in spot Bitcoin ETFs rose to 28% from 20% at the end of last year. Despite net outflows over the past three weeks, these ETFs currently have total assets under management of $125 billion, providing a significant buffer against selling pressure. Not a Peak in Bitcoin! Analysts emphasized that the current market situation does not appear to be a cyclical peak phase. Rather, the market is part of a multi-year uptrend characterized by institutional participation and moderate corrections. However, analysts pointed to $80,000 as a possible bottom area if the decline continues and said that the decline would be a buying opportunity for long-term investors. No Danger! Finally, Bernstein also addressed the claims that Strategy might sell its BTC, pointing out that the company's management has publicly stated that it has not sold a single BTC and has no intention of doing so. In this context, Bernstein analysts stated that there is no threat to Strategy, saying, “Strategy has $8 billion in debt against $61 billion in Bitcoin assets and therefore has a conservative leverage ratio. Dividends are well covered by the treasury and it has access to more capital through market programs. Therefore, we do not see a threat.” *This is not investment advice.

According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $93,948.61 on the Binance USDT market, sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? The sudden Bitcoin price movement has left many investors wondering about the underlying causes. Market analysts point to several factors that could be influencing this downward trend. However, it’s important to remember that cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, and price corrections are a normal part of market cycles. Several key elements typically affect Bitcoin price movements: Market sentiment and investor psychology Global economic conditions Regulatory developments Trading volume and liquidity Institutional investor activity How Significant is This Bitcoin Price Drop? While any Bitcoin price drop below major psychological levels like $94,000 grabs attention, context matters. The current Bitcoin price movement represents a correction within the broader market context. Therefore, experienced traders often view such dips as potential buying opportunities rather than reasons for panic. The Bitcoin price has shown remarkable resilience throughout its history. Moreover, market corrections often create healthier long-term growth patterns by shaking out weak hands and establishing stronger support levels. What Should Investors Do About the Bitcoin Price Movement? When the Bitcoin price experiences significant movements, investors face important decisions. First, avoid making emotional trading choices. Instead, consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance. The current Bitcoin price situation demands careful analysis rather than reactive trading. Key considerations for investors include: Review your portfolio allocation Assess your risk management strategy Consider dollar-cost averaging Monitor market developments closely Set clear entry and exit points Understanding Bitcoin Price Volatility The Bitcoin price is inherently volatile due to several structural factors. The relatively young market, combined with high speculation and global adoption rates, creates perfect conditions for price swings. Consequently, investors should expect periodic corrections as part of the normal market behavior. Historical data shows that the Bitcoin price has recovered from much larger drops. Furthermore, each cycle has brought new institutional adoption and technological developments that support long-term growth prospects. Market Outlook for Bitcoin Price Recovery Looking ahead, the Bitcoin price trajectory depends on multiple factors. Technical analysis suggests key support levels that could stabilize the current decline. Meanwhile, fundamental factors like adoption rates and regulatory clarity continue to improve over time. Market experts suggest watching these indicators: Trading volume patterns Institutional buying activity Network growth metrics Global macroeconomic trends Regulatory developments Conclusion: Navigating the Current Bitcoin Price Landscape The Bitcoin price drop below $94,000 serves as a reminder of cryptocurrency market volatility. However, it also presents opportunities for informed investors. By understanding market dynamics and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can navigate these fluctuations successfully. Remember that the Bitcoin price has historically rewarded patient investors through multiple market cycles. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $94,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely results from combined factors including profit-taking, market sentiment shifts, and broader economic conditions affecting cryptocurrency markets. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? While the Bitcoin price drop may present buying opportunities, investors should conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance before making investment decisions. How low could Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact Bitcoin price bottoms is challenging. Market analysts suggest watching key support levels and trading volume for indications of potential reversal points. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this drop? Selling decisions should align with your investment strategy. Panic selling during Bitcoin price drops often leads to missed recovery opportunities. How long do Bitcoin price corrections typically last? Bitcoin price corrections vary in duration. Some last days, while others extend for weeks. Historical patterns show eventual recovery, but timing remains unpredictable. What indicators should I watch during Bitcoin price volatility? Monitor trading volume, support and resistance levels, market sentiment, and fundamental adoption metrics during Bitcoin price fluctuations.

At press time, XRP was trading at $2.27, up 2.06% on the daily chart and outperforming the broader crypto market, which is down 0.2%. XRP 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold Still, at the current price, XRP is far below its all-time high of $3.84. AI assesses XRP fundamentals To assess XRP’s chances of setting a new record, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s leading large language model, ChatGPT-5 , which highlighted several catalysts that could support such a move. According to the chatbot, improving regulatory clarity and institutional adoption remain the biggest drivers. Indeed, the recently launched XRP ETF saw $26 million in trading volume within the first 30 minutes, becoming the best-performing fund so far in 2025. Similarly, the AI argued that favorable macro conditions could also boost risk assets and improve the crypto’s momentum in the following weeks, in particular the growing demand for bridge assets. On the downside, though, ChatGPT noted that the general dips in the overall crypto market likely reflect near-term fragility. This has also become evident in recent Bitcoin (BTC) selling activity, which suggests a $1 billion crash might be coming. Will XRP hit a new all-time high? All things considered, the model believes there’s a 30% chance that XRP could hit a new all-time high in 2025 in the base case scenario. If many of the bullish conditions align, including regulatory clarity, ETF approval, strong adoption, and good macro developments, an XRP rally could increase the chances up to 40%. Conversely, more bearish developments contrary to those mentioned above would sink the chances of a new record price to 15%. AI sets the odds of XRP hitting a new ATH. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT Ultimately, what sticks out is that ChatGPT sees some potential for XRP to reach new heights in virtually all scenarios, but that even the most optimistic ones make it “only” 40% likely, meaning that traders should approach the prospect of a new XRP all-time high with caution.

The Bitcoin supply has reached an incredible milestone that’s sending ripples through the cryptocurrency world. According to recent reports, 95% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist has now been mined, leaving only a tiny fraction remaining. This remarkable achievement highlights the unique scarcity that makes Bitcoin so valuable in the digital age. What Does 95% Bitcoin Supply Mined Actually Mean? Let’s break down what this Bitcoin supply milestone really represents. Out of the maximum 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist, approximately 19.95 million are now in circulation. That means we have only 1.05 million Bitcoin left to mine over the next century. The Bitcoin supply is carefully controlled by its underlying code, which creates new coins through a process called mining. This controlled Bitcoin supply is one of the key features that differentiates Bitcoin from traditional currencies. Unlike government-issued money that can be printed indefinitely, Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap. This scarcity is built directly into the protocol and cannot be changed without overwhelming consensus from the network participants. Why Should You Care About Bitcoin Supply Limits? You might wonder why this Bitcoin supply milestone matters to you. The answer lies in basic economics – scarcity creates value. As fewer new Bitcoin enter circulation, the existing coins become increasingly precious. Consider these key points: Fixed maximum supply – Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist Predictable issuance – New coins enter circulation at a predetermined rate Increasing scarcity – Mining rewards halve approximately every four years Global accessibility – Anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network The limited Bitcoin supply creates a fundamentally different monetary system than what we’re used to with traditional currencies. This scarcity mechanism protects against inflation and ensures that early adopters don’t get diluted by unlimited money printing. When Will the Final Bitcoin Be Mined? Here’s where the Bitcoin supply story gets even more fascinating. The final Bitcoin isn’t expected to be mined until around the year 2140 – that’s more than 100 years from now! The mining process becomes progressively more difficult over time due to something called the ‘halving’ event, which occurs approximately every four years. During each halving, the reward that miners receive for validating transactions gets cut in half. This gradual reduction in new Bitcoin supply ensures a smooth transition toward the maximum cap. The current block reward is 3.125 BTC, and this will continue to decrease until the final Bitcoin is mined in the next century. How Does Limited Bitcoin Supply Affect You? The decreasing Bitcoin supply has real implications for investors, users, and the broader financial ecosystem. As we approach the supply limit, several important dynamics come into play: Price pressure – Scarcity tends to drive value upward over time Miner economics – Transaction fees will become more important for miner revenue Adoption incentives – Limited supply encourages earlier participation Store of value – Bitcoin becomes increasingly attractive as digital gold Understanding the Bitcoin supply mechanics helps you make informed decisions about whether and how to include Bitcoin in your financial strategy. The transparent and predictable nature of the Bitcoin supply schedule provides certainty in an uncertain financial world. The Future of Bitcoin Beyond Supply Limits What happens when we finally reach the maximum Bitcoin supply? The network won’t suddenly stop working. Instead, miners will transition to earning revenue primarily from transaction fees rather than block rewards. This transition is already being planned for and tested through various network upgrades and layer-2 solutions. The Bitcoin supply story is ultimately about creating a decentralized, scarce digital asset that can’t be manipulated by any central authority. This achievement represents a major milestone in the evolution of digital money and demonstrates the resilience of Bitcoin’s economic model. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage of Bitcoin remains to be mined? Only 5% of the total Bitcoin supply remains to be mined, which equals approximately 1.05 million BTC out of the maximum 21 million. Why is there a limit on Bitcoin supply? The 21 million Bitcoin limit was implemented to create digital scarcity, prevent inflation, and establish Bitcoin as a store of value similar to precious metals like gold. What happens when all Bitcoin are mined? When all Bitcoin are mined around 2140, miners will earn income solely from transaction fees rather than block rewards, ensuring the network continues to operate securely. Can the Bitcoin supply limit be changed? Changing the Bitcoin supply limit would require overwhelming consensus from the network participants, making it extremely unlikely to happen. How does Bitcoin scarcity affect its price? Scarcity typically increases value as demand grows while new supply decreases, creating upward price pressure over the long term. What is Bitcoin halving? Bitcoin halving is an event that occurs every 210,000 blocks where the mining reward is cut in half, gradually reducing new supply until the maximum is reached.

Ant International manages its operations in the Alipay+ ecosystem. The partnership will enable the fintech company to leverage the investment bank’s blockchain-powered payment platform, which was launched in November 2024, for its global treasury operations across various jurisdictions. The partnership aims to address the challenge of intra-group transfers that heavily rely on traditional systems operated by banking institutions. Limited operating timeframes and inconsistent transaction speeds often hinder the systems. Tokenizing the process on permissioned digital ledgers will enable institutions to synchronize liquidity across their subsidiaries in a shorter duration compared to the long days it takes when using traditional banking systems. The solution will resolve the serious liquidity issues that major companies and conglomerates encounter when operating subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. The announcement also highlighted that the two companies will explore tokenized deposits as a joint venture. Kelvin Li, global manager of platform tech at Ant International, commented on the alliance, stating that the two organizations share a common belief in the possibilities that their underlying technologies could revolutionize cross-border payments. Young Jin Yee, the country head for UBS Singapore, also gave remarks on the deal, stating that the combination of blockchain technology advancements between the two companies will yield a real-time, multicurrency payment solution powered by efficiency and transparency. Singapore emerges as a global hub for crypto adoption, data shows The news follows Singapore’s announcement of plans to introduce regulations on stablecoins and trial tokenization bills. Recent news by Cryptopolitan revealed that Chia Der Jiun, the Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), announced the BLOOM initiative to support the industry’s trials with tokenized bills and regulated stablecoins for settlement. Chia noted that three Singapore banks, including United Overseas Bank (UOB), DBS Bank, and Oversea-China Banking Corporation (OCBC), have successfully executed interbank overnight lending transactions. The settlement used the first live trial issuance of Singapore dollar-backed CBDC. He also reiterated that MAS has supported hundreds of innovation projects and centers in the past decade. The innovation solidifies the entire Asian region as a global hub for decentralized finance, catering to both individuals and institutions. A recent report by Proton Theory revealed that the population in the Asian Pacific region is showing a growing interest in digital assets. The survey collected data from over 4,000 respondents from ten different countries, including Singapore, and was then extrapolated to represent the entire Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. The report revealed that 25% of Asian adults in the APAC region with internet connection might own crypto. The survey also revealed that approximately 50% of Singaporean nationals believe regulations are essential in the development of cryptocurrency. The report showed that in emerging countries like Thailand and India, the figure surged to 70%. Cryptopolitan previously reported that the ApeX Protocol report showed 24.4% of Singapore’s population holds digital assets. The figure has more than doubled compared to last year’s, which stood at 11%. The report also labeled Singapore as the world’s leader in digital asset adoption, with a perfect score of 100.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently demonstrating these early-stage symptoms and shows much more potency. The token has already advanced early buyers a remarkable 250%, and the token is over 90% sold through Phase 6 of its presale, not to mention the token’s adoption well exceeding any sell offering to early retail and whales. With a presale launch token that launched at a remarkably low $0.035, Mutuum Finance is rapidly establishing itself within the crypto faithful as the best crypto to buy prior to the upcoming period of massive crypto-wide change. Many analysts consider Mutuum Finance to be the next crypto to explode. Solana Price Prediction Solana is also appearing vulnerable tactically after the break below the crucial level of $150, which has since reversed to become a robust resistance level. Trades at $145, however, are seeing SOL approaching the $142 level of support, a deeper liquidity level found at $140. If the macroeconomic sell-off continues, and with the upcoming inflation figures, analysts expect SOL to drop further towards the $130-$135 region, where more robust demand is found. And with SOL currently lagging in a sensitive technical position, many traders are beginning to look beyond the current favorite for the best crypto to buy, and that’s exactly what Mutuum Finance is starting to get noticed for. MUTM Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance is generating significant momentum within the world of DeFi with the nearing end of Phase 6 of the presale event. With the sale of over 90% of the tokens, the MUTM token is currently at $0.035 and will receive a further rise of 20% during Phase 7. The presale event has successfully managed to attract the interest of over 18,050 people and raise a considerable amount of over $18.8 million. The response generated during the presale event definitely reveals the interest of the community in the DeFi offerings of Mutuum Finance. As the project continues to rise in popularity, MUTM is becoming the must-watch cryptocurrency of the year 2025, ensuring that early adopters are given the chance of immediate and future use within the ever-changing world of finance. Crypto investors searching for the next crypto to blow up are definitely paying attention. Infrastructure and Innovative Pricing Mutuum Finance uses the Chainlink oracles, which compare the prices of the tokens with the prices of well-traded assets such as USD, ETH, Matic, and AVAX, to ensure that the prices are accurate and timely. The use of decentralized oracles provides Mutuum Finance with the assurance that the information obtained cannot be tampered with and thus remains accurate and trustworthy. Further ensuring the reliability of the system, Mutuum Finance utilizes various levels of security such as fallback oracles, aggregation feeds, and data verification within the chain. With such a system, the protocol is able to achieve accurate and real-time pricing of the data, which is very essential for the stability of the Mutuum Finance platform and the collaterals used within the system. Mutuum Finance: The Next Crypto to Explode Mutuum Finance has already managed to onboard over 18,050 people, raising more than $18.8 million, with its presale stage, Phase 6, already over 90% complete and priced at $0.035. Those that invested early are already enjoying a return of 250%, and experts indicate that Mutuum Finance shows the same characteristics during the early stage that preceded the massive breakout of Solana and that it’s currently the best crypto to buy before the upcoming market shift. Investors looking to get into a DeFi project with a high level of potential should do so immediately before the upcoming 20% rise during the presale’s Phase 7. Mutuum Finance is set to be the next crypto to explode, making it the clear choice for investors seeking the best crypto to buy today and the next crypto to explode in the DeFi sector.

The yen’s persistent decline against major currencies represents one of the most significant currency stories of our time, with profound implications for global markets and cryptocurrency correlations. What’s Driving the Japanese Yen Weakness? The Japanese yen has been caught in a perfect storm of economic factors that have pushed it to multi-decade lows. Unlike cryptocurrencies that can surge on speculation alone, the yen’s decline reflects deep structural issues within Japan’s economy and monetary policy framework. The Bank of Japan policy has been the primary driver, maintaining ultra-loose monetary conditions while other central banks aggressively tightened. Bank of Japan Policy: The Ultimate Accommodative Stance The Bank of Japan has stubbornly maintained negative interest rates and yield curve control, creating what many call the ‘ultimate carry trade currency.’ While the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank raised rates to combat inflation, the BOJ remained committed to stimulus. This policy divergence created massive interest rate differentials that made the yen fundamentally unattractive to international investors. Central Bank Current Policy Rate Inflation Target Yen Impact Bank of Japan -0.1% 2% Highly Negative Federal Reserve 5.25-5.50% 2% Extremely Negative European Central Bank 4.25% 2% Very Negative The Dangerous Game of Currency Intervention Japanese authorities have repeatedly threatened currency intervention to support the yen, but these efforts have proven largely ineffective against market forces. The Ministry of Finance spent billions in 2022 to prop up the currency, only to watch it continue sliding. This highlights the limitations of government action against fundamental economic trends. Massive foreign reserve deployment Verbal intervention and warnings Coordinated action with other central banks Limited long-term effectiveness Interest Rate Differential: The Unbeatable Force The interest rate differential between Japan and other developed economies has reached historic proportions. With Japanese government bonds yielding near zero while US Treasuries offer over 5%, international capital has flowed out of yen-denominated assets relentlessly. This fundamental imbalance makes yen appreciation nearly impossible without policy changes. Yen Depreciation and Global Market Consequences The sustained yen depreciation has created both winners and losers in global markets. Japanese exporters benefit from cheaper goods abroad, but import costs have skyrocketed, squeezing Japanese consumers and businesses. For cryptocurrency traders, the weak yen has interesting implications for Bitcoin trading pairs and market correlations. The situation represents a critical test for modern monetary policy and raises important questions about currency stability in an era of divergent economic strategies. As cryptocurrency enthusiasts know well, when traditional financial systems show stress, alternative assets often attract increased attention. FAQs: Understanding the Yen’s Persistent Weakness What is the Bank of Japan’s current policy stance? The Bank of Japan maintains negative interest rates and yield curve control, keeping monetary policy extremely accommodative despite global tightening trends. How does currency intervention work? The Japanese Ministry of Finance can authorize the Bank of Japan to sell foreign reserves and buy yen, though this provides only temporary support against fundamental market forces. What are the main factors behind yen weakness? Key drivers include massive interest rate differentials, the Bank of Japan’s dovish stance, Japan’s aging population, and structural economic challenges that limit growth potential. How does this affect cryptocurrency markets? Yen weakness can influence Bitcoin-yen trading pairs and may drive Japanese investors toward cryptocurrencies as alternative stores of value amid currency depreciation. Could the yen recover significantly? Sustainable recovery requires either Bank of Japan policy normalization or global central banks cutting rates significantly – neither appears imminent in the near term. The Japanese yen’s dramatic weakness serves as a powerful reminder that even established reserve currencies face immense pressure in today’s interconnected global economy. While cryptocurrencies experience their own volatility, the yen’s situation demonstrates that traditional financial systems are far from stable or predictable.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-any-moment-xrp-could-go-on-a-generational-run-heres-why/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld issued a direct statement that resonates strongly with ongoing sentiment in the XRP community: the conditions supporting a generational move may already be forming, and preparation is essential. His point was not framed as speculation for its own sake but as a reminder that markets often shift before retail participants react. By emphasizing timing, Rietveld reinforced that the current environment is different from previous cycles, in which regulatory and structural barriers limited XRP’s ability to follow broader market momentum. Any moment $XRP could go on a generational run, and you need to be ready. That's precisely why I'm getting ready to share something special, but ONLY to my most loyal and supportive followers. If you are interested comment ""DM"" and I will send you more information — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 15, 2025 Context supporting his assessment Rietveld’s outlook aligns with several developments that have reshaped XRP’s position within the digital asset landscape. With regulatory uncertainty easing , one of the primary constraints on institutional participation has been reduced. This clarity has opened the door for more traditional capital to consider XRP, especially now that programmatic sales are better defined and the regulatory environment is less punitive. The removal of this barrier is central to Rietveld’s argument, as large-scale inflows typically depend on complianc. He also pointed to the strengthening fundamentals surrounding utility and adoption. Ripple’s payment solutions continue to integrate XRP into cross-border liquidity processes, giving the asset a functional demand base beyond speculative trading. Parallel improvements to the XRP Ledger, including growing stablecoin infrastructure and developments that expand its smart-contract capabilities, have broadened the asset’s technical foundation. These enhancements contribute to a more mature ecosystem capable of supporting increased liquidity and higher transaction volumes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Rietveld’s comment also reflects attention to supply dynamics. Data showing declining exchange reserves suggest fewer tokens are readily available for sale, a trend that becomes more significant when paired with institutional accumulation through corporate treasury strategies and investment vehicles. Combined with XRP’s built-in mechanism that gradually removes small amounts of supply through transaction fees, the environment shifts in favor of demand-driven price expansion once buying pressure accelerates. The need for preparedness Rietveld underscored that readiness is not about prediction but preparation. Investors who monitor regulatory decisions, institutional positioning, and liquidity patterns are better equipped to respond when market structure shifts. The core of Rietveld’s message is straightforward: XRP is entering a period defined by reduced regulatory resistance, stronger institutional pathways, and supportive supply characteristics. These components form the basis of a credible argument for a significant upward move, and those who prepare ahead of time may be better positioned as the market evolves.

If These Levels Are Broken, the Trend Will Change!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/analysis-firm-announces-bitcoin-btc-is-at-a-critical-point-if-these-levels-are-broken-the-trend-will-change/,"Bitcoin, which has been experiencing consecutive declines in recent days and has fallen below the psychological level of $100,000, also fell below the $95,000 level during the day, falling to its lowest level in six months. While Bitcoin fell to the $93,000 level, Singapore-based analysis firm QCP Capital evaluated the latest situation of Bitcoin. QCP analysts initially noted that Bitcoin continued its decline last week, falling 27% from its all-time high and nearly wiping out its gains for the year. Bitcoin fell 27% from its all-time high, closing below $100,000 for the first weekly close since May. Market sentiment turned bearish after the 50-week moving average was broken. Analysts have recently noted that prices are often driven by narratives, with rumors that the end of the four-year cycle is nearing further fueling the prevailing bearish trend. At this point, analysts noted that the key levels for Bitcoin are the $92,000 support and the $88,000 CME gap. QCP Capital also noted a clear hedging bias in the options market, stating: “BTC short-term implied volatility remains above 50, and the trend remains largely towards Put options. This suggests increasing demand for downside protection.” Analysts recently pointed to two trend-setting levels for Bitcoin. While a break above the 50-week MA would strengthen the medium-term bearish trend, confirmation of a long-term trend reversal still hinges on whether BTC can break the key supports at $88,000 and $74.5,000. *This is not investment advice.

The product, called the VanEck Solana ETF (VSOL), enters the market amid rising institutional interest in digital asset infrastructure. Besides offering price exposure to SOL, the ETF includes access to staking rewards generated through the Solana network. Zero Fees Aim to Attract Early AUM According to the press release , VanEck will waive VSOL sponsor fees for the first $1 billion in assets until February 17, 2026. The company also confirmed that its third-party staking provider will waive service fees over the same period. Consequently, early allocations will operate with no fund-level cost until the threshold or end date. Moreover, any assets above $1 billion before that cutoff will incur a 0.30% sponsor fee. After February 17, 2026, VSOL will apply the standard 0.30% fee across the entire fund. Kyle DaCruz, Director of Digital Assets Product at VanEck , said the firm is “excited to be launching VSOL” and aims to expand access through “thoughtful, investor-focused products.” His comments signal a strategy centered on cost efficiency and regulatory clarity as competition intensifies within the digital asset ETF landscape. Solana’s Network Strength Supports the ETF Thesis The ETF arrives as Solana continues to rank among the busiest blockchains globally. The network processes tens of millions of daily transactions across DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and tokenized assets. Additionally, its Proof of History system, paired with Proof of Stake consensus, enables low fees and rapid confirmation times. Validators stake SOL to secure the network and earn rewards, which VSOL incorporates into its structure. Hence, the ETF attempts to translate Solana’s technical strengths into a regulated investment format designed for traditional market participants. VanEck Expands Its Digital Asset Lineup VSOL joins a broader family of VanEck digital asset products. The company already offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, along with thematic funds like DAPP and NODE. Moreover, VanEck manages more than $5.2 billion in digital asset-related products worldwide. The firm also operates 29 crypto exchange-traded products in Europe, reflecting its long-standing push toward regulated crypto access.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|SPONSORED|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 16:06:10

A modest rebound has done little to ease concerns. As traders scramble for hope, fresh data suggests that today’s breakdown confirms real bearish pressure. EMA50 Breakdown Crypto analyst Doctor Profit, in his latest tweet, said Bitcoin has entered a clearly bearish phase after breaking below the weekly EMA50, a level he calls the “golden line” and one of the most important indicators for determining whether BTC is in a bull or bear market. He explained that throughout the entire 2024 cycle, Bitcoin consistently closed weekly candles above this level and bounced each time it touched it. Because the EMA50 held for so long, he says this line played a central role in confirming the bull market structure. Now that Bitcoin has dropped below it, the bearish sentiment is confirmed. Many bullish traders argue that the death cross is a positive sign because previous ones in September 2023, August 2024, and April 2025 were followed by strong rallies of 25% to 60% in the months that followed. In all three previous cases, however, Bitcoin was trading well above the EMA50 at the moment of the death cross. In April 2025, BTC was 12% above the golden line, and in August 2024, it was 17% above. Each time, Bitcoin respected the EMA50 and bounced, confirming that those death crosses were fake bearish signals. The situation today, however, is completely different. This time, the death cross happened while Bitcoin was trading 6% below the EMA50, and the golden line already failed to hold as support. Based on this, the analyst calls the latest event a “true death cross.” Doctor Profit also challenged the belief that extreme fear in the market automatically represents a bottom. He pointed to the 2021 example, when the Fear and Greed Index hit extreme levels as Bitcoin dropped from $68,000 to the $50,000 range, yet the price continued falling until it reached the $16,000-$18,000 region. He added that the current environment is more dangerous than previous corrections. In earlier phases of 2024 and 2025, ETFs were selling while whales accumulated, which created a balanced structure. This time, both ETFs and whales show negative volume, which adds to the bearish pressure. On top of that, the average Bitcoin buyer from the last six months has an entry of around $94,600. A move toward or below that level could trigger more selling, as short-term traders tend to sell at breakeven or a slight loss. Structural and Mechanical Downturn At the same time, a separate analysis from the Kobeissi Letter points to a deeper change behind Bitcoin’s downturn. The report said that the leading crypto asset’s 25% slide since October is a “structural and mechanical” bear phase driven by institutional outflows that began in late October. Crypto funds saw a record $1.2 billion in net outflows in early November, while high leverage across the market turned routine volatility into sharp price swings. Therefore, with multiple trading days seeing over $1 billion in liquidations and sentiment collapsing to its lowest level since February, the analysts argued that leverage is amplifying the decline and not fundamentals.

BLOX: Balancing Income And Capital Growth,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4844632-lfgy-vs-blox-balancing-income-and-capital-growth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary Nicholas Crypto Income ETF (BLOX) stands out over YieldMax Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF (LFGY) for crypto-focused, option-based income strategies. BLOX's less aggressive option overlay and secondary income focus support better upside capture and more sustainable payouts, favoring long-term total returns. LFGY's higher yield is funded by return of capital, leading to structural NAV erosion and less capital for future rebounds, making it less attractive long-term. BLOX is rated Buy for its balanced approach and early outperformance, while LFGY is downgraded to Hold, suitable mainly for tactical, consolidating markets. I have already analyzed the YieldMax Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF ( LFGY ) earlier and found it reasonably good for its primary income objective due to broader crypto adjacent infrastructure exposure. Since then, another option strategy based play has arrived in the crypto and adjacent space - the Nicholas Crypto Income ETF ( BLOX ). Since both offer option based income avenues built over a crypto-related underlying, this article takes a look at the similarities and differences and evaluates the pros and cons of both. Methodology The methodologies of both ETFs are broadly similar. Both have an underlying portfolio of crypto and crypto-adjacent companies and build an option layer around it to generate income. BLOX explicitly states its direct crypto emphasis with an anticipated distribution equally spread out over equity, crypto holdings and the option overlay. A look at the full portfolio (downloaded from the ETF websites) shows ~40% crypto holdings in BLOX through FBTC (~15.5%), HODL (~15.5%) and ETHA (~9.5%). LFGY also has considerable direct crypto exposure, although it seems to employ ITM option calls to replicate synthetic positions in bitcoin. Ethereum exposure is through the ETHA ETF route - like in BLOX. Importantly, both the ETFs have an active strategy for the underlying selection - the allocations could change over time as well as the methods adopted (like synthetic positions versus ETFs, or other mechanisms). The inclusion of derivatives makes % weight allocation comparisons difficult, but I have listed out the top 10 allocations in both the ETFs below to give a view of the similar nature of equity holdings and the crypto exposure (the IBIT call option is the synthetic bitcoin exposure in LFGY's holdings). Overall, both ETFs seem to be active and allocate healthily in bitcoin and Ethereum, in addition to a basket of crypto-adjacent equities. Very similar approach - but could show significant differences in how they employ the strategy and the timestamp when the comparisons are made. Top Holdings - LFGY vs BLOX (Holdings downloaded from ETF websites) The option layer is also active for both the ETFs, with a variety of strategies like covered calls, credit spreads, diagonal spreads, cash-secured puts, collars and calendar spreads deployed as deemed fit. This includes the active call on what strikes to choose (OTM vs ATM and distance) and how much of the portfolio is covered through such option strategies. The amount of coverage through a covered call, for instance, could make the difference between capturing decent upsides versus totally capping it (if 100% of the portfolio). Performance Comparisons Given the active nature of the underlying and the option strategy layer, past performance becomes paramount in setting expectations. The below chart shows the total return comparison between LFGY and BLOX. Although BLOX has been around for a few months only and further performance trends should be watched, early indications are that BLOX outperforms LFGY by a decent margin. Data by YCharts This could be a result of several drivers. The underlying portfolio itself could be driving higher returns in BLOX. BLOX seems to have a higher emphasis on crypto which could be driving the outperformance. Distributions within the equity portfolio show similar broad allocations. The equity exposure differences are primarily in LFGY's substantially higher fintech exposure. LFGY has significant positions in NU Holdings (4.91%), Block (4.11%), and PayPal (3.46%) - holdings absent from BLOX. Additionally, LFGY assigns 4.27% to Opera and diversifies into retail trading with GameStop (3.38%) and e-commerce through MercadoLibre (3.39%). Thematic exposure comparison - LFGY vs BLOX (Collated by author using data from actual Holdings reported in ETFs' websites) The higher allocation in crypto could work out well for an ETF in more ways than one. If the option strategy allows reasonable upside capture, it could gain from a crypto rally, of course. But that is not necessary. In a conducive regime, bitcoin calls could have higher premiums and that income could also drive outperformance, even if bitcoins remain stagnant. Since the extent of crypto exposure (although a possible explanation of the outperformance so far) as a factor in outperformance is a multi-variate model (underlying rallies, options aligned well, higher option premiums), this alone is not a predictor of future returns. The same argument holds true for the fintech and other minor equity allocation differences, where LFGY's concentration may have hurt performance in the past few months. BLOX's current portfolio structure may have led to outperformance so far, but I don't see that as a continued source of sustained or structural advantage. Apart from the underlying portfolio, the option layer is another critical determinant of outperformance. There may be differences there too. A less aggressive option strategy could allow better upside capture, leading to outperformance in rallies. On the other hand aggressive option writing could help in consolidations or even corrections. BLOX's outperformance so far is a combination of both the portfolio holdings currently and a potentially more conducive options layer. While, I cannot point definitively to which is the core performance driver, I definitely see an edge in BLOX's approach. BLOX's primary objective (as per the prospectus) is capital appreciation, with income generation as a secondary objective. This usually implies less aggressive option positioning and a setup that allows greater upside capture. LFGY's emphasis on income means better performance in consolidating or bearish markets, but not so much in bullish cycles. Core Mechanics From a core objective perspective, I strongly believe there is no income without growth. In a very unrelated comparison I wrote on MARO vs NVDY, my analysis upholds some of the core mechanics one should know about option strategy based income ETFs. One of the conclusions I drew in that article (and which is universally true), is that buywrite ETFs gain much more from the appreciation of the underlying capital than through the option layer. So, an ETF that leaves the option layer less aggressively positioned, allows better upsides to be captured - i.e. better total returns. In other words, chasing option income is a poorer method to generate better total-return (that funds the income) in the long term. It may sound counterintuitive, but ETFs with a lesser emphasis on income and hence a less aggressive option layer generally tend to do well. In a consolidating or correcting market, LFGY-like income-focused ETFs could do well, but that's a tactical play, not a long term advantage from options. In the long term, a bull thesis in the underlying is mandatory. If the underlying has a bull thesis, then allowing for better upside capture works out better, with option income a secondary augmentation. The emphasis on yields also leads to another structural problem the total return chart above does not capture. LFGY's primary emphasis on income over capital appreciation implies a close to ~42% yield on cost for investments made a year ago. A large part of this is funded through return of capital. That means a structural decline in NAV. This is a problem, because it does not allow the underlying capital to recover from periods of stress. Imagine investing $100 and $40 returned (with ~$5 help from options) in a year when the underlying crashes. Even if the underlying rebounds, LFGY ensures less actual capital to make up for the losses on the way down. Yield on Cost - LFGY (Seeking Alpha) I find BLOX's secondary emphasis on income helpful here. In the chart below, I show the price to total return level graph. This is an indicator of NAV erosion. The more aggressively an ETF pays out over actual capital appreciation, the lower this ratio is expected to be. There are two things to note from the chart below. One, both ETFs are NAV-eroding by nature. Unless dividends are reinvested (which has tax inefficiencies), investors are likely to lose out on capital appreciation that could have funded the payouts better. Two, LFGY's payouts look far more aggressive - more NAV eroding than BLOX's relatively conservative payouts. Data by YCharts Tilting to BLOX There are core reasons beyond early historical performance trends (that are supportive too) that tilts the case towards BLOX as a income vehicle when it comes to the crypto-themed underlying space. For one, I find it's secondary emphasis on income likely to imply lower (and hence more sustainable) payouts. That's a positive for long term income investments. Secondly, the outperformance could be due to less aggressive option plays, given that income is a secondary objective. In terms of expenses, there is nothing material to separate the two. BLOX has an expense ratio of 1.3%, only marginally more than LFGY's 0.99%. Overall, BLOX is a Buy and can replace LFGY as the preferred option strategy in crypto. LFGY is therefore downgraded to a Hold. It has its tactical uses in specific regimes where markets consolidate or correct, but there too I would have liked to see more capital left on the table for the rebound.",LFGY|BLOX,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-17 16:12:50

Two powerful forces are converging to create the perfect storm for dollar dominance: a surprisingly hawkish Federal Reserve and escalating political uncertainty worldwide. For cryptocurrency investors watching these developments, understanding these macroeconomic shifts could mean the difference between capitalizing on opportunities and getting caught in the crossfire. What’s Driving the Current USD Strength? The dollar’s recent performance isn’t just another market fluctuation—it’s a fundamental shift with deep implications. Macquarie analysts point to two primary drivers creating this environment of sustained USD strength . The first involves significant changes in Federal Reserve policy expectations, while the second stems from growing geopolitical tensions and election uncertainties across major economies. How Federal Reserve Policy is Reshaping Currency Markets The Federal Reserve has surprised markets with its persistent hawkish stance, creating a dramatic shift in monetary policy expectations. Here’s what’s happening: Higher-for-longer interest rate positioning Reduced expectations for near-term rate cuts Stronger-than-expected economic data supporting tighter policy Inflation concerns preventing premature policy easing Federal Reserve Policy Shift Impact Previous Expectations Current Reality Market Impact Multiple rate cuts in 2024 Potential delay until late 2024 or 2025 Strengthened USD against major pairs Dovish policy pivot Hawkish hold with data dependency Increased dollar demand for carry trades Inflation normalization Sticky inflation concerns Reduced risk appetite supporting safe havens Why Political Uncertainty Fuels Dollar Demand Beyond monetary factors, escalating political uncertainty is creating a perfect environment for dollar appreciation. Multiple geopolitical flashpoints and upcoming elections in major economies are driving investors toward the relative safety of US assets. This flight-to-quality dynamic reinforces the dollar outlook as positive despite domestic economic challenges. The Complex Relationship Between Monetary Policy and Currency Values Understanding how monetary policy affects currency markets requires examining several interconnected factors. The current Federal Reserve policy stance creates interest rate differentials that make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to international investors. This dynamic supports continued USD strength even as other central banks consider their own policy adjustments. What Does the Current Dollar Outlook Mean for Investors? The combination of hawkish Federal Reserve policy and global political uncertainty creates a compelling case for sustained dollar strength. However, investors should consider several factors when assessing the dollar outlook : Monitor Fed communications for policy shift signals Watch geopolitical developments that could reduce uncertainty Consider diversification strategies despite dollar strength Evaluate impact on other asset classes including cryptocurrencies Frequently Asked Questions What is Macquarie’s view on USD strength? Macquarie analysts believe current USD strength is supported by both less dovish Federal Reserve policy and increasing political uncertainty globally. How does Federal Reserve policy affect the dollar? The Federal Reserve ‘s monetary policy decisions directly impact interest rates, which influence currency values through capital flows and yield differentials. What role does political uncertainty play in currency markets? Political uncertainty typically drives investors toward safe-haven assets like the US dollar, as seen during election cycles and geopolitical tensions. How long might this USD strength persist? The duration of USD strength depends on both Federal Reserve policy continuity and resolution of current political uncertainties affecting global markets. What are the implications for other currencies? Sustained USD strength typically pressures emerging market currencies and could impact export-oriented economies through exchange rate effects. The convergence of hawkish Federal Reserve policy and escalating global political uncertainty has created an environment where USD strength appears well-supported. Macquarie’s analysis suggests this isn’t a temporary phenomenon but rather a structural shift with significant implications across asset classes. For cryptocurrency and traditional investors alike, understanding these dynamics provides crucial context for portfolio decisions in an increasingly complex global landscape.

""Within 45 Days…""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-name-with-the-worlds-highest-iq-makes-ambitious-bitcoin-btc-prediction-within-45-days/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to struggle with the consecutive declines it has experienced in recent weeks, bearish expectations are also increasing. While the $80,000 level started to be talked about after the $90,000 level, a hopeful prediction came for BTC. Accordingly, YoungHoon Kim, who is considered the person with the highest IQ in the world with an IQ of 276, claimed that Bitcoin will reach $220,000 in the next 45 days. “I expect Bitcoin to reach $220,000 in the next 45 days,” YoungHoon Kim said in his post. This ambitious prediction has sparked controversy among investors, especially at a time when Bitcoin has been experiencing volatility and has fallen to levels as low as $92,000. At this point, investors are wondering if YoungHoon Kim is seeing something they're missing, especially as Bitcoin struggles to navigate rising market fears, volatile ETF flows, and shifting macro conditions. If the price reaches $220,000, it would mean that BTC would more than double from its current level in a very short period of time, a jump of over 126%. Kim’s bold prediction comes after cryptocurrency researcher Vivek Sen shared that GROK, an artificial intelligence model widely followed by investors, predicted that Bitcoin would reach $175,000 within 45 days. As World's Highest IQ Record Holder, I expect #BITCOIN is going to $220,000 in the next 45 days.

Lite Strategy, Inc. (NASDAQ: LITS) (“Lite Strategy” or “LITS”) today reported results for its first quarter ended September 30, 2025, and highlighted recent corporate events related to the Company’s digital asset treasury strategy as well as its pharmaceutical operations. “Our first quarter was incredibly successful for LITS. We launched our digital treasury strategy, positioning ourselves as the leading public holder of LTC, and updated our corporate profile to reinforce our new focus,” Board Member Charlie Lee said. “We recently celebrated Litecoin’s 14th anniversary and its unblemished track record of reliability and uptime. LITS provides investors the only US publicly traded company to gain institutional exposure to Litecoin, both for portfolio diversification and long-term value.” “Fiscal year 2026 will showcase the results of the transformative steps taken by Lite Strategy. Since the start of our strategic alternatives process in fiscal year 2025, we have prioritized maximizing the value of our assets for stockholders. Starting with the successful sale of our clinical asset, ME-344 (now known as WE-868), currently being developed for adults with obesity at Aardvark Therapeutics , and continuing through the close of our $100 million PIPE offering in July 2025 that kicked off our Litecoin digital asset treasury strategy in the first quarter of this fiscal year,” said Jay File, CEO, CFO. First Quarter Fiscal Year 2026 and Recent Highlights Raised $100 million in aggregate gross proceeds, commencing the Company’s long-term strategic plan with Litecoin as a digital asset treasury reserve asset. Officially became the first U.S.-listed public company to adopt Litecoin as a primary reserve asset with the acquisition of 929,548 Litecoin (LTC) tokens, implementing a new strategy built on a digital asset infrastructure and long-term capital innovation. Entered into a strategic partnership with GSR, a leading crypto investment firm, to guide LITS’ digital asset treasury strategy, ensuring robust governance, execution, and market expertise. Brought on world-class board members, Charlie Lee, creator of Litecoin, and Joshua Riezman, U.S. Chief Strategy Officer at GSR. Rebranded from MEI Pharma to Lite Strategy, including changing the Company’s corporate name and NASDAQ Stock Market ticker from MEIP to LITS, and unveiling a new corporate logo and website. The rebranding underscores the Company’s commitment to building a long-term corporate strategy around LTC as its primary reserve asset. In October announced a $25 million share repurchase program, advancing LITS from the initial phase of Litecoin accumulation to active capital market operations and allowing LITS to leverage our nearly 1 million LTC treasury - a key differential from passive investment structures like exchange-traded funds. “As we progress further into fiscal year 2026, we continue to evaluate our clinical assets including the commencement of pre-clinical studies with voruciclib in non-oncology disease indications for potential licensing to third parties, and pursuing licensing or sale opportunities with zandelisib,” said Jay File. “We will consider opportunities to deploy our recently announced $25 million stock buyback program until our discount to NAV is normalized. We look forward to executing on all our corporate objectives as we progress through fiscal year 2026.” As of September 30, 2025, the Company had $12.21 million in working capital with no outstanding debt.

LITS provides investors the only US publicly traded company to gain institutional exposure to Litecoin, both for portfolio diversification and long-term value.” “Fiscal year 2026 will showcase the results of the transformative steps taken by Lite Strategy. Since the start of our strategic alternatives process in fiscal year 2025, we have prioritized maximizing the value of our assets for stockholders. Starting with the successful sale of our clinical asset, ME-344 (now known as WE-868), currently being developed for adults with obesity at Aardvark Therapeutics , and continuing through the close of our $100 million PIPE offering in July 2025 that kicked off our Litecoin digital asset treasury strategy in the first quarter of this fiscal year,” said Jay File, CEO, CFO. First Quarter Fiscal Year 2026 and Recent Highlights Raised $100 million in aggregate gross proceeds, commencing the Company’s long-term strategic plan with Litecoin as a digital asset treasury reserve asset.

In October announced a $25 million share repurchase program, advancing LITS from the initial phase of Litecoin accumulation to active capital market operations and allowing LITS to leverage our nearly 1 million LTC treasury - a key differential from passive investment structures like exchange-traded funds. “As we progress further into fiscal year 2026, we continue to evaluate our clinical assets including the commencement of pre-clinical studies with voruciclib in non-oncology disease indications for potential licensing to third parties, and pursuing licensing or sale opportunities with zandelisib,” said Jay File. “We will consider opportunities to deploy our recently announced $25 million stock buyback program until our discount to NAV is normalized. We look forward to executing on all our corporate objectives as we progress through fiscal year 2026.” As of September 30, 2025, the Company had $12.21 million in working capital with no outstanding debt.

Established platforms and new presale opportunities are likely giving you some important choices. While Layer-1 solutions are still performing systemically, most really explosive growth and indeed opportunities are found in innovative, early stage DeFi cryptos. As retail investors, selecting the best cryptos to buy for the next quarter requires focusing on presale opportunities that fit the balance of your investment. In this sense, the cryptocurrencies Cardano (ADA) and the fast growing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are positioned really well for attention and investment. Cardano’s Resurgent Momentum Recently, Cardano (ADA) has shown considerable power in its technical patterns and has been consolidating around the $0.545 range, suggesting the strong possibility of a breakout. This optimistic price behavior highlights confidence in the slowly but surely developing ecosystem founded on peer-reviewed research, sustainability of proof of stake consensus and scalability. The improvements, in combination with the expanding dApp ecosystem, serve as the basis for further adoption. As far as evaluating the best sustainable long term growth potential, Cardano and its committed and advanced technology and associated global community should be on the shortlist. Cardano is seemingly in the process of reclaiming a strong position in the smart contract platform space. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Presale Nearing Its Climax Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently garnering outstanding presale momentum and is being placed as the best cryptos to buy now for exponential returns. With over $17.75 million raised and holders over 18,050, the presale is now on Phase 6, which is the most important presale phase, being the last phase where holders can acquire tokens for $0.035. This phase is over 90% allocated and the last chance to acquire these tokens cheap. Phase 7 will include a near 20% price rise. Anchoring DeFi with an Overcollateralized Stablecoin Along with its successful fundraising, Mutuum Finance builds an intricate lending ecosystem that is built off of a native decentralized stablecoin. This will allow pegged stablecoins to be minted, ensuring a strong 1:1 hold with the US dollar, which will be lent overcollateralized loans. This creates economic loops that strengthens the ecosystem. The new crypto MUTM provides an anchor of economic stability, and is a strong crypto to use, offers a solution to the problematic parts of DeFi volatility by providing users with access to the stablecoin economy. Security is Non-Negotiable With the risks to DeFi users’ capital, Mutuum Finance decided to go the extra mile and get a security audit by blockchain security experts CertiK. Mutuum Finance’s audit also provides testament to the reliability and operational integrity of the smart contracts in use with a 90/100 token scan score. This shows security has been carefully planned and also builds the first real use case for the crypto, a strong assurance for investors. Although there are many projects that have yet to be audited, Mutuum Finance offers a peace of mind, which improves its reputation and provides strong assurance for investors in crypto and DeFi. Your Strategic Move for Q1 2026 The changing market gives new possibilities for strategic distribution. While established assets like Cardano offer some stability, most of the life-changing, “get-rich-quick” gains associated with investing in cryptocurrencies are found in early-stage projects, like Mutuum Finance, prior to mainstream exchange listings. As its presale phase nears complete sell out, your ability to capture a position at this price and aim for a 400% return on investment at the time of launch is a time-sensitive edge. Missing procrastination at this time would most likely be a missed the most ideal entry point in this DeFi crypto’s progression.

The CFTC-regulated trading will tap general interest in perpetual futures trading. CBOE’s Bitcoin and Ether Continuous Futures will be open to US traders, offering perpetual-style exposure. The trading is fully regulated by the CFTC, and will be open 23 hours per day, five days a week. CBOE’s market will still not copy the existent perpetual futures on purely crypto platforms. CBOE Global Markets will back the new contracts, Bitcoin Continuous Futures (PBT) and CBOE Ether Continuous Futures (PET). The contracts will start trading from December 15, pending regulatory review. The contracts will have a 10-year expiration to track the long-term exposure to BTC and ETH, with a daily cash adjustment. Traders of perp futures do not need to periodically roll over positions. CBOE aims to offer the same benefits to crypto traders, including the ability to short the assets and perform other strategic trades. ‘ As perpetual futures have historically been traded offshore, Cboe is excited to help expand access to these products within a U.S.-regulated, transparent, and intermediary-friendly environment, ’ said Rob Hocking, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. Hocking added that the Continuous Futures structure aims for efficient portfolio and risk management, while offering limited leveraged exposure. Recently, CBOE also proposed longer trading hours for its options market, mimicking the most active hours of crypto trading. CBOE to integrate Kaiko real-time data CBOE will use its respective Kaiko real-time pricing data. Positions will receive Funding Amount data for their daily cash adjustment. ‘ Bringing perpetual-style futures to U.S. regulated markets addresses a real need for institutional investors seeking efficient, long-term crypto exposure, ’ said Anne-Claire Maurice, Managing Director of Derived Data at Kaiko. The contracts will be cleared through CBOE Clear US, helping mitigate counterparty risk. Margin requirements will be in compliance with CFTC rules and fully compliant, with the potential for cross-margin offsets with other products on the exchange, such as Financially Settled Bitcoin (FBT) and Financially Settled Ether (FET). The CBOE Options Institute will also offer courses on perpetual futures and discuss use cases, with training open on December 17 and January 13, 2026. CBOE marks growing demand for futures trading CBOE was among the first exchanges to register demand for BTC futures. Its first product, XBT, had some features in common with perpetual futures. The product, launched in partnership with Gemini, tapped the first wave of mainstream interest for BTC. The initial product discontinued its usage in 2019, due to a bear market and lowered trader interest. The current return of perpetual futures reflects another wave of mainstream interest, as well as a more advanced approach to BTC trading. The launch of the contracts follows a few months of peak activity on perpetual futures DEX, competing with centralized futures markets.

The company confirmed that its Orangefin validator will support staking operations for the newly launched VanEck Solana ETF. This development arrives during a challenging moment for Solana’s price, which continues to lose ground after several weeks of sustained selling pressure. Hence, the contrast between growing institutional participation and weakening market performance has drawn fresh attention from traders tracking the trend into year-end. Institutional Momentum Builds Around Solana According to the press release , SOL Strategies said the arrangement strengthens its long-term plan to bridge traditional markets with decentralized networks. The company operates ISO 27001 and SOC 2 certified validators and secures more than CAD$610 million in assets. Additionally, the firm continues to expand institutional partnerships after previous work with Tetra Trust and other regulated entities. The relationship also reflects VanEck’s strategic focus on Solana. Kyle DaCruz said, “SOL Strategies’ proven track record in validator operations and institutional focus made them a natural choice for our Solana ETF staking requirements.” His comments point to rising confidence in regulated staking providers as ETFs drive new demand for yield generation. Besides, SOL Strategies emphasized that the partnership reinforces its position in the institutional Solana market. The company noted its intention to scale validator services as ETF issuers expand their staking allocations. Market Conditions Signal Ongoing Downtrend Despite the institutional development, Solana’s market price continues to weaken. The token trades near $134 as of press time after losing more than 18% over the past week. Analysts link the slide to persistent selling pressure and a clear descending trendline that has shaped the market since early autumn. Source: X According to analyst 0xEthan, the trend remains firmly intact. He predicted that Solana could drop below $100 before 2026, citing a pattern of lower highs and lower lows as a sign of persistent weakness. The chart indicates that the $100 mark coincides with a major trendline around mid-December, forming a significant area of confluence. Additionally, interim support sits near $127 and $118, although momentum still favors deeper moves. Consequently, analysts believe a full retest of the psychological $100 zone remains likely if buyers fail to reclaim $150 soon.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|SPONSORED|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 17:37:27

That’s exactly what one major lobbying group aims to achieve as they launch an ambitious campaign to cultivate pro-crypto candidates across America. The U.S. Chamber of Digital Commerce has unveiled a groundbreaking State Network designed to shape digital asset policies from the ground up. Why Focus on Pro-Crypto Candidates Now? The timing couldn’t be more strategic. With the 2026 midterm elections approaching, the cryptocurrency industry is taking a page from traditional political playbooks. Cody Carbone, Vice President of Policy at the Chamber, explains that while federal attitudes toward crypto have improved, state-level consensus remains fragmented. This new initiative represents a significant shift in crypto advocacy strategy. Instead of focusing solely on Washington, the organization recognizes that real change often begins at local levels. Their vision extends beyond congressional representatives to include school board members and city council officials. How Will They Cultivate Pro-Crypto Candidates? The State Network operates on a simple but powerful principle: education leads to understanding, and understanding leads to support. The program focuses on: Identifying potential pro-crypto candidates early in their political careers Providing comprehensive education about blockchain technology Connecting candidates with industry experts and resources Building local networks of digital asset supporters This grassroots approach ensures that future pro-crypto candidates enter office with a solid understanding of how digital assets benefit their communities. The strategy acknowledges that cryptocurrency policy affects everything from local businesses to educational institutions. What Challenges Do Pro-Crypto Candidates Face? Building support for cryptocurrency at state and local levels presents unique obstacles. Many officials lack basic understanding of blockchain technology, while others remain skeptical about its practical applications. Moreover, regulatory uncertainty creates hesitation among potential pro-crypto candidates who worry about supporting emerging technology. However, the Chamber’s network addresses these concerns through targeted education and community engagement. They demonstrate how digital assets can create jobs, stimulate local economies, and position communities for technological advancement. The Ripple Effect of Local Pro-Crypto Leadership When local officials become pro-crypto candidates and eventually pro-crypto officeholders, they create a powerful domino effect. School boards can integrate blockchain education into curricula. City councils can explore municipal applications of blockchain technology. State legislatures can develop sensible regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation while protecting consumers. This bottom-up approach could ultimately influence federal policy as more states develop successful cryptocurrency frameworks. The cultivation of pro-crypto candidates at all levels ensures that digital asset understanding becomes embedded in governance structures nationwide. What Does This Mean for Crypto’s Future? The initiative represents a maturation of cryptocurrency advocacy. Rather than reacting to regulatory developments, the industry is proactively shaping its political landscape. By cultivating pro-crypto candidates, the Chamber aims to create a sustainable ecosystem where digital assets can thrive through supportive policies and informed leadership. This long-term strategy acknowledges that technological adoption requires political buy-in at every level of government. The success of this effort could determine how quickly cryptocurrency integrates into mainstream American life. Frequently Asked Questions What is the main goal of the State Network? The primary objective is to identify and support pro-crypto candidates who understand digital assets and can implement sensible policies at state and local levels. When will we see results from this initiative? The first major test will be the 2026 midterm elections, though local elections happening before then will provide early indicators of success. Does this only focus on Republican or Democratic candidates? The initiative is non-partisan and seeks pro-crypto candidates across the political spectrum who support digital asset innovation. How can someone get involved with this effort? Interested individuals can contact the U.S. Chamber of Digital Commerce or participate in local cryptocurrency advocacy groups in their areas. What types of positions are they targeting? Everything from local school boards and city councils to state legislatures and congressional seats are part of the strategy. How does this differ from previous crypto lobbying efforts? This represents a shift from reactive federal lobbying to proactive local candidate cultivation and education.

54536134,https://invezz.com/?p=2971095,1763401344,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,5 ways blockchain is changing the game for sports fans,https://invezz.com/news/2025/11/17/5-ways-blockchain-is-changing-the-game-for-sports-fans/,"Blockchain technology is one of the most widely adopted innovations in the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) era. What gained popularity as the technological layer for digital assets like Bitcoin and Ether is now being integrated in more engaging and exciting industries, most notably the sports arena. Thanks to this technology, sports fans are no longer limited to the “old way” of fandom, where they were mere spectators. Blockchain’s decentralized architecture is changing this narrative by providing an opportunity for sports fans to be vested participants or active owners in several ways. Imagine being able to own a portion of your favourite team or club through a blockchain-based digital token that is not only valuable, but tradeable across global markets that are decentralized and permissionless. That’s just one angle through which sports fans are already extracting value from the blockchain. In this listicle, we highlight five verticals driving this evolution: trading player performance in decentralized markets, earning a voice with tokenized governance, authenticating experiences with digital collectibles (NFTs), eliminating scalpers and counterfeits in ticketing and immersive fandom in the sports metaverse. Trading player performance in decentralized markets This 4IR has unlocked the avenue for sports fans to trade player and team performance in decentralized markets. So, how does this work? At its core, blockchain tech plays an infrastructural role, introducing the aspect of decentralization and transparency to sports fan markets. With this type of foundation, any user from across the world can trade player-linked utility tokens or other types of sports-related digital assets within a marketplace built on trust and verifiability. One good example of such a marketplace is TheSportExchange (TSE): this blockchain-powered platform operates as a financial ecosystem for sports by transforming team performance into tradeable assets. The idea is anchored around utility assets dubbed ‘Keys’, which represent the performance of a particular team. Sports fans can purchase Keys through TSE’s Automated Market Maker (AMM) to unlock access to reward pools based on the performance of the team in real-world matches. This approach to trading team performance is a shift away from traditional betting markets where bookmakers run the show. In decentralized markets, sports fans do not have to go through any intermediaries to get financial exposure; instead, automated smart contracts AMMs act as the middlemen, with a guarantee of verifiable transparency. Furthermore, trading player performance in decentralized markets is not a zero-sum game, as there are several ecosystem rewards that traders can tap into. Earning a voice with tokenised governance Blockchain is also changing how fans engage with their favourite teams, elevating them from bench spectators to decision makers. One can think of it as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model that is driven by ‘fan tokens’. But what exactly are these fan tokens and how much power do they have when it comes to team governance? According to Socios , a blockchain-powered platform that issues fan tokens – these are simply “digital assets for the world’s biggest sports teams”. With these tokens, the owners have access to bet on some real team decisions such as kit designs, player numbers and race day livery, among others. Beyond participating through tokenized governance, the fan tokens come with other perks, including unprecedented access to a particular team. This includes flying with the team to an away match, being the team’s official announcer of a specific match and the opportunity to play inside iconic stadiums that have been graced by legends. Before the integration of blockchain technology, strategic sports decisions were made by a handful of people, leaving out fans who probably have a more significant attachment to the team. However, with the introduction of decentralized governance, it is no longer about crossing fingers for the team management to make the right decisions, but being part of the team that gives direction. Authenticating experiences with digital collectibles (NFTs) Another interesting way blockchain is changing fan experience is through digital collectibles, otherwise known as Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These unique blockchain-based digital assets allow sports fans to own verifiable pieces of sports history, including video highlights, player trading cards and limited-edition artwork such as FC Barcelona’s first Masterpiece NFT collection dubbed “In a Way, Immortal”. This particular NFT collection is tied to the club’s history and star players. What stands out about NFTs compared to traditional digital memorabilia is the blockchain’s core aspect of verifiable ownership. Every digital collectible that is tied to a fan experience is minted on a blockchain platform, making it possible to prove its authenticity and scarcity as the only digital copy that exists in the market. This means that fans can seamlessly prove whether a digital collectible is real, who owns it, how many exist and its ownership history since it was minted. One of the blockchain-powered platforms that has successfully implemented this idea is NBA Top Shot . The project launched back in 2020, enabling the tokenization of top NBA clips as “Moments”: fans can collect, own or sell these unique blockchain-based moments. Most importantly, they’re licensed digital collectibles, thanks to the official recognition by the National Basketball Association (NBA). With such innovations and partnerships, sports enthusiasts can now own digitally authentic experiences. Eliminating scalpers and counterfeits in ticketing Millions of dollars are lost to ticket fraud annually: In the UK, for instance, consumers parted ways with close to £6.7 million between 2023 and 2024. To make it worse, ticket scalpers have continued to inflate sports ticket prices while the real fans remain disappointed. On the brighter side, Blockchain tech underpinnings of transparency, traceability and fairness could be a much-needed foundation to solve some of these prevalent issues. Platforms such as Seatlab are already taking action by providing a blockchain-native ecosystem for sports event ticketing, among other types of events. This platform leverages Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to introduce a transparent and fair marketplace where tickets are minted as unique NFTs on the blockchain. Similarly, these digital tickets are transacted and stored on a carbon-neutral blockchain to eliminate any chances of fraudsters creating counterfeit tickets. It is also arguable that NFT tickets are much easier to embed unique perks, given their digital nature as compared to their traditional counterparts. For example, an NFT ticketing platform can take instructions to include added fan experiences such as a VIP seat, snacks and drinks throughout the game. Blockchain ensures all this is done in a verifiable manner and there’s no compromise between when the tickets are created and the D-day. Immersive fandom in the sports metaverse Last but not least is the opportunity to explore metaverse worlds that mimic one’s favourite team stadium or other facilities. Imagine watching a baseball match at Yankee Stadium or following a football match at Old Trafford through a VR device that makes it feel almost real. Blockchain comes in to enhance this experience by allowing innovators to include more modules to these types of metaverse worlds, including the ability to make blockchain-based payments for services. More importantly, blockchain technology can act as the trust layer, such that every digital asset within the metaverse can exist as a tokenized item on-chain. Think of virtual items like avatars, jerseys, stadium seats and collectibles – all these components of the metaverse can only have a unique and verifiable digital identity if they reside on a blockchain. While there hasn’t been much traction in this niche since the metaverse hype died down, several international clubs are already experimenting. Most notably, Manchester City began developing the “Man City Virtual Etihad Stadium” back in 2022. Other notable names that are exploring the space include FC Barcelona, Birmingham City FC and Brooklyn Nets (NBA). What’s particularly intriguing about this area of development is the intersection of VR and blockchain to create a fan experience that almost feels real and immersive. Conclusion As demonstrated through the five verticals in this listicle, blockchain technology makes the fan experience more secure, participatory and financially engaging. Pioneer projects like TheSportExchange, Socios, Seatlab and NBA Top Shot are slowly defining a new age of fandom, where users no longer have to rely on centralized intermediaries that continue to face issues when it comes to transparency, verifiability and fairness. In this new paradigm, blockchain technology acts as the centre piece, ensuring fans become part of something bigger in a level playing field.

Based on on-chain data, the total supply in loss has coincided with four consecutive lower lows in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. So far, realized losses have increased, and panic-driven exchanges have also intensified, although institutional players appear to be buying into the dip. For instance, BlackRock recently moved 4,800 BTC and 54,730 ETH to its Coinbase Prime. The trend has reinforced the current sustained retail capitulation and institutional accumulation. STHs with over 5.4 million BTC in supply continue to experience unrealized losses According to Glassnode on-chain data, short-term holders, which are defined as addresses holding BTC for fewer than 155 days, are currently facing the most pressure since late 2022. At least 99% of STHs with a supply of over 5.4 million BTC are experiencing unrealized losses. The BTC supply in STH holdings represents a 24.7% increase since August, with the realized P/L ratio dropping to -1.4, similar to the FTX-era crash. Source: Glassnode ; Total supply in loss held by short-term holders for BTC The trend highlighted by Glassnode data suggests that the most recent buyers have been caught at the top, creating a feedback loop, which means that continued falling prices trigger more selling pressure. The chart shows that the strength of STH losses mimics previous major capitulation events such as the FTX crash. Alongside the sustained capitulation, the crypto movement into centralized exchanges has increased. To date, over 2.1 million BTC have been deposited on Binance, with approximately 327,000 BTC being deposited in Q4 alone. The movements totaled over $1.1 billion, with funds being transferred from spot ETFs throughout October. Based on on-chain data delivered by SoSoValue, approximately $2.33 billion was withdrawn from Bitcoin ETFs in November, and $1.24 billion was withdrawn from Ethereum ETFs. Although Solana ETFs have sustained net inflows, with over $180 million this month, the market is experiencing a sustained lower capitulation. The large flows into exchanges are being interpreted as preparation for selling or portfolio redistribution. The STH cost basis, which has historically been interpreted as a psychological support indicator, is now directly above Bitcoin’s current trading range, placing further downward pressure on recent buys. BTC is at risk of further liquidation if the downtrend persists The current trend was amplified on October 30 when BTC surpassed $108,000 after the Federal Reserve showed signs of delayed rate cuts. The signal triggered over $820 million in liquidations, $653.6 million wiped from long positions, and $365.4 million from BTC-specific liquidations. So far, BTC has dropped below $94,000, placing the focus on the $ 92,000 -$ 94,000 range, aligning with the 6-12 month holder cost basis. According to a CryptoQuant analysis , long-term holders remain steady, with the Realized Cap at all-time highs. This means that deeper cycle-wide confidence remains intact even as STHs capitulate. Based on on-chain data by Lookonchain, institutional holders are using the downtrend as a strategic entry point. BlackRock deposited 4,880 BTC to Coinbase Prime and 54,730 ETH, representing a combined value of $643 million. Although the movement to exchanges has historically signaled selling intent, some industry experts have revealed that the movement signals accumulation as retail investors suffer stress. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at $93,137, representing a 1.24% drop over the past 24 hours and an 11% drop over the past week. A sustained drop below $ 93,000 could trigger a selloff to the $ 85,000 support level or a potential reversal if the current institutional exchange flows sustain.

These amendments permit crypto mining and circulation outside the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC). Previously, it was formally believed that companies operating in the AIFC had preferential rights to engage in the mining, trading, and exchange of crypto assets. However, with the new law, which will come into force 60 days after its publication, individual entrepreneurs and legal entities in Kazakhstan will officially be granted permission to mine crypto. Kazakhstani miners to sell their crypto assets to other exchanges Although the new law permits the circulation of unsecured crypto assets throughout Kazakhstan, crypto services will still need to obtain a license from the regulatory agency. To that end, Kazakhstani miners are no longer required to sell most of their crypto assets through the AIFC exchanges. The law will require a limitation on the processing period of personal data. The consent of an investor who has provided personal data, for example, to a bank or crypto exchange, will no longer be valid for longer than “the period necessary to achieve the stated purposes of collecting the information.” This move comes after the country announced its intention to establish a national crypto reserve that will hold up to $1 billion in assets, including confiscated cryptocurrencies and shares of companies involved in the digital currency space. The fund should be “up and running” by early next year at the latest, according to the head of the country’s central bank. Bitcoin miners shift to AI As Kazakhstan calls mining profitable, in the US, Bitcoin miners are shifting their focus from crypto to AI. According to Bernstein analysts, every major Bitcoin miner listed in the US has shifted its focus from mining Bitcoin to AI data centers. Miners have faced existential challenges since last year’s halving, which reduced the rewards for validating Bitcoin transactions in half. Dwindling network activity, a loss of half of their revenue source, and soaring network difficulty have made their lives much harder. Cryptopolitan reports that companies that could mine Bitcoin for a profit at $50,000 a coin are now having trouble at $100,000. At the same time, the cost of capital has gone through the roof, and expanding mining operations need a lot of money for ASICs and infrastructure, which might take years to pay back. The shift isn’t new, though. VanEck already saw this coming last year. He stated that if the 12 largest public miners switched just 20% of their work to AI, their annual income would increase by approximately $14 billion. Electricity demand surges in the US amidst shortage predictions in 2026 In the US, electricity demand is also increasing, with a significant portion concentrated in Texas, primarily due to data centers and crypto mining facilities. Therefore, investors are hoping that the prices of power will go down. However, the US Energy Information Administration says that the price of market electricity will go up 8.5% to $51/megawatt-hour in 2026. This is up from $47/MWh this year, which was 23% more than in 2024. Additionally, the total amount of electricity sold is expected to increase by another 2.6% next year, following a 2.4% rise in 2025. The rise will be “led by the West South Central region, which includes Texas, as electricity demand from data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities in that region increases,” EIA said. The Trump administration and Congress are expected to use this as a chance to switch even faster to renewable power by putting in even more big solar and wind installations, along with battery storage. To that end, renewables are expected to grow next year and likely make up a record 26% of all energy generated in the US. When combined with the 18% of power that will likely come from nuclear plants, carbon-free electricity production is expected to reach 62% of all electricity production next year, surpassing the 40% that comes from natural gas.

While the P2E captured early investor interest, it often failed to capture the mainstream gamer, whose primary motivation is fun, entertainment, and reputation building. Now that there is more overlap between Web3 gaming and the mainstream industry, pure financial gain has become insufficient to measure success, as social capital has gained prominence as the definitive metric. SACHI is spearheading this shift by reframing the category with a new term: StatusFi . This SACHI-led wave is the systematic transition from the deficiencies of Play-to-Earn to the New Play-to-Style era, where players get instant utility in the form of rewards and visible status upgrades from in-game achievements and cosmetic unlocks. Status as Utility: The Power of ‘Play-to-Style’ The StatusFi model pioneered in the SACHI universe is presented as the answer to players’ demand for immediate utility that impacts their gameplay, appearance and reputation, and allows them to showcase their accomplishments and status in the digital arena. At its core, the StatusFi model is designed for rapid, visible rewards that allow players to: Style Avatars: Character customization is the biggest status symbol in digital ecosystems. The best and most active players can transform their avatars from simple characters into immediately distinguishable symbols of their skill level and OG status, drawing from a more diverse suite of options to style their avatars using earned, unique, and rare pieces. Social Exclusivity: SACHI recognizes the psychological boost that players get from unlocking access to exclusive areas as rewards for their achievements. That’s why SACHI directly tethers access to the most private private lounges, exclusive tables, or VIP social hubs to certain levels of aesthetic development or gear milestones, allowing players to certify themselves among the rarest and pit their achievements against the best. Social Status is Currency: The SACHI-pioneered StatusFi makes social status an immediately visible and valuable resource throughout the SACHI universe. OG status is not simply an aesthetic appearance; it represents uniqueness and influence within the community. The shift is happening right in front of our eyes: status has become utility. By making the act of looking good the path to access and influence, Play-to-Style beats Play-to-Earn for mainstream fun. The SACHI Difference: Immediate Social Reward SACHI has engineered its ecosystem to ensure that players receive social validation and functional rewards tonight . This focus on immediate action is what drives conversion and retention, especially among social gamers. Reframing the Grind: Instead of rewarding abstract token counts, SACHI rewards expression. A player is incentivized to pursue rare wearables not for their hypothetical cash value, but for the immediate status they confer and the exclusive areas they unlock. Unlocking Access Tonight: Like empty calories, earning cosmetic upgrades for aesthetics sake can quickly become boring and underwhelming. SACHI’s StatusFi is moving players from simply styling their avatar with the cosmetics they earn to using those achievements to unlock access to premium features and exclusive areas tonight . Building a Deeply Connected Community: Many games have diluted players’ achievements with a pay-to-play model that gives the highest spenders performance and reputation boosts. SACHI is challenging this transactional model by promoting a healthier, achievement-driven system that motivates players to organically build and knock off milestones on their way to earning their reputation within a healthy and deeply connected community. Earn Your Status, Define Your Style SACHI’s StatusFi is delivering for gaming purists and Web3 reward hunters with status as the true currency of the digital age, and style as the fastest way to earn it. Jump into the SACHI universe, unlock your aesthetic rewards, and secure your place in the most exclusive rooms tonight.

Market analyst Barri C challenges this perspective , arguing that conventional benchmarks fail to capture the token’s true potential. According to him, assessing XRP solely through the lens of retail investors and four-year cycles overlooks the unprecedented scenario of institutional adoption and real-world utility. Retail Thinking Limits Perception Of XRP Price Potential In a post shared on X, Barri C emphasizes that skepticism about a $1,000 XRP is rooted in a retail investor mindset. Historically, the crypto market has been driven by retail cycles, often following a four-year boom-and-bust pattern, as seen with Bitcoin’s surges in 2017 and 2021. These cycles focus on short-term speculative gains rather than long-term systemic value. He points out that “all we have ever seen is retail investing and a four-year cycle,” highlighting that analysts are applying familiar frameworks to an unprecedented situation: XRP’s adoption by banks and financial institutions worldwide. Retail speculation may generate price volatility, but as the analyst explains, it does not reflect how a cryptocurrency behaves when embedded in global financial infrastructure. Barri C argues that this oversight limits understanding of XRP’s full potential. If mass adoption and enterprise utilization continue, reaching $1,000 and potentially far beyond, becomes a realistic outcome, contrary to the conclusions drawn from retail-focused analysis. Utility, Partnerships, And Institutional Integration Driving The Value Beyond retail cycles, XRP’s long-term value is increasingly shaped by its real-world utility, strategic partnerships, and deepening integration with institutional finance. Ripple’s partnerships with DBS Group and Franklin Templeton allow trading and lending of tokenized money market funds on the XRP Ledger, demonstrating enterprise-grade use that could help drive the XRP price action. Building on this foundation, Ripple’s $200 million acquisition of Rail significantly strengthens its institutional infrastructure. Rail’s stablecoin payment systems, virtual accounts, and automated settlement capabilities, when combined with the RLUSD stablecoin framework , position XRP as a central component of high-volume financial networks. The impact of these developments is further amplified through Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network. Deployed across more than 300 financial institutions in 45 jurisdictions, ODL leverages XRP, enabling real-time settlement and optimizing capital efficiency. These operational advantages, coupled with Ripple’s strategic expansions into the Middle East and Africa, underscore XRP’s growing role in facilitating practical utility that could scale its value. Finally, Ripple’s pursuit of a US national bank charter and a Federal Reserve Master Account highlights its commitment to embedding the altcoin into traditional financial systems . Together, these initiatives illustrate that XRP’s future valuation may be driven by adoption, infrastructure scaling, and institutional integration rather than short-term retail sentiment. According to Barri C, closely tracking XRP’s developments provides the clearest insight into how the XRP price could realistically reach—and potentially exceed— the $1,000 milestone .",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-17 18:00:38

This surge is a direct consequence of the astonishing market debut of the Canary XRPC ETF. Canary XRP ETF’s launch has painted a clear picture of robust institutional and retail demand for a regulated XRP investment product. Why XRPC’s Success Fuels BlackRock Rumors As the speculation around a potential BlackRock XRP ETF is heating up again, the Canary XRPC ETF has delivered one of the strongest launches of the year. An analyst known as Skipper_xrp has noted on X that the newly listed fund stunned the market with over $58 million in first-day trading volume and $245 million in net inflows, outperforming hundreds of ETF debuts of 2025. Related Reading: XRP ETF Completes First Full Day Of Trading, Here’s Why The Community Is Shocked Skipper_xrp mentioned that many supporters in the XRP community still believe that BlackRock might already be quietly experimenting with or even testing the idea of an XRP trust behind closed doors. The momentum has increased further after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made a statement at the company’s Swell event, highlighting that Ripple’s ongoing collaboration with major traditional financial firms will bring digital asset adoption into regulated global markets. However, with the ETF inflows accelerating and XRP gaining more visibility among institutions, many investors are now arguing that it’s only a matter of time before a heavyweight firm like BlackRock will consider stepping into the XRP space. Understanding XRP’s Long-Term Growth Trajectory Crypto trader Adam_Xrp has also offered some insight on why XRP didn’t moon when the first ETF was launched. According to the expert, the XRP ETF launch was never going to be a flip-the-switch moment. Even with the first XRP ETF going live, price action was building slowly, and the institutional money did not pour in all at once. Rather, it scales over time as confidence and liquidity grow. Related Reading: New XRP ETF Just Dropped, But Will Anything Be Different This Time? Furthermore, the altcoin is still early in the rollout, and more XRP ETFs are scheduled to begin trading. Each new product will increase exposure, volume, and demand. This is how true institutional adoption is slowly progressing. BlackRock has stated that the company is not launching an XRP ETF right now, but this isn’t something they would ignore forever. However, once the regulatory path is fully cleared and institutional demand strengthens, it’s only a matter of time before the biggest players, like BlackRock, will step into the arena. Adam_Xrp concluded that the altcoin wasn’t supposed to skyrocket overnight. This phase is a gradual process of foundation building as the ecosystem, liquidity expansion, and the institutional framework grow. The expert added that if you expect to get rich overnight, without understanding the long-term game plan, then XRP might not be the right investment for you.

This will allow investors to be exposed to price movements for extended periods without having to regularly renew their positions.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/tech-enthusiast-xrp-wont-succeed-heres-why/,"Statements from prominent community members often reveal how investors interpret ongoing market conditions. A recent post from crypto and tech enthusiast TheXRPguy has prompted clear opinions regarding the relationship between Bitcoin’s price movements and XRP’s long-term trajectory . The discussion reflects contrasting views about how each asset functions within the broader digital economy. It’s based on whether short-term volatility in Bitcoin has any meaningful effect on XRP’s intended utility . Bitcoin is tanking the market so XRP won’t succeed. Understand ? — TheXRPguy (@TheXRP_guy) November 15, 2025 Diverging Market Functions The central idea presented in the responses is that Bitcoin’s role in the speculative market differs fundamentally from the market in which XRP is positioned. One user, Po’ Da Licka, emphasized the separation by noting that Bitcoin influences speculative trading cycles, while XRP is engineered for liquidity infrastructure and real-time settlement use cases. According to this perspective, the two assets operate on separate rails with distinct market incentives. The argument continues by suggesting that when institutional-grade settlement systems relying on high-speed , low-cost liquidity go live at scale, Bitcoin’s volatility will not be an obstacle for XRP but rather a factor that reinforces the value of a stable settlement asset. This interpretation frames Bitcoin as a speculative instrument and XRP as a transactional tool with different objectives and outcomes. Market Behavior and Community Concerns Another viewpoint came from CKinvests, who asserted that Bitcoin-aligned traders may be influencing XRP’s price performance during periods of heightened attention. The user referenced repeated instances throughout the year in which downward price movements followed positive developments surrounding XRP. Their stance is that these events are not coincidental but instead reflect an intentional effort to slow XRP’s momentum. This perspective is rooted in the belief that a shift in market leadership is possible and that such a transition could create resistance from holders of assets currently at the top. From this angle, XRP’s supporters interpret price fluctuations not as a reflection of weak fundamentals but as the result of competitive positioning within the market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A General Interpretation Overall, the comments responding to TheXRPguy’s statement point to a shared conviction among many XRP observers that comparing the asset directly to Bitcoin overlooks their differing functions. Bitcoin’s broad influence on speculative activity remains undeniable, but XRP’s proponents argue that its relevance lies elsewhere, within systems built for fast, compliant, and scalable value transfer. They maintain that the two assets serve different constituencies and that XRP’s potential adoption will depend more on institutional infrastructure than on Bitcoin’s performance.

This potential launch represents a significant milestone for Dogecoin investors and the entire crypto market. What Makes the Grayscale DOGE ETF So Important? The Grayscale DOGE ETF would mark a major step forward for cryptocurrency adoption. Unlike buying Dogecoin directly from exchanges, this ETF would provide traditional investors with regulated exposure to DOGE through familiar investment channels. Moreover, it would offer the security and convenience of trading through established financial platforms. Why Should Investors Pay Attention to This Development? This potential Grayscale DOGE ETF launch comes at a crucial time for cryptocurrency markets. Here are key benefits investors should consider: Regulated Access : Institutional and retail investors can gain exposure without managing private keys Tax Advantages : Potential tax benefits compared to direct cryptocurrency ownership Market Validation : Signals growing institutional acceptance of meme coins Liquidity Options : Provides additional trading flexibility for DOGE holders What Challenges Could the Grayscale DOGE ETF Face? While the Grayscale DOGE ETF presents exciting opportunities, investors should remain aware of potential hurdles. Regulatory approval remains pending, and market volatility could impact initial performance. However, Grayscale’s established track record with other cryptocurrency products suggests they’re well-prepared to navigate these challenges. How Will This Impact the Broader Cryptocurrency Market? The introduction of a Grayscale DOGE ETF could have ripple effects across the entire crypto ecosystem. Other meme coins might see increased attention, and traditional financial institutions may accelerate their crypto product development. This move potentially paves the way for more diverse cryptocurrency investment products in the future. What Action Should Investors Take Now? As we await official confirmation about the Grayscale DOGE ETF launch, investors should: Monitor official exchange announcements Research Grayscale’s previous ETF performance Consider how DOGE exposure fits their portfolio strategy Stay updated on regulatory developments The potential November 24 launch date for the Grayscale DOGE ETF represents more than just another investment product—it symbolizes cryptocurrency’s continuing march toward mainstream acceptance. While not yet confirmed, this development could open new doors for both crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors seeking regulated exposure to digital assets.

A Grayscale DOGE ETF is an exchange-traded fund that would track Dogecoin’s price, allowing investors to buy and sell shares through traditional brokerage accounts without directly holding the cryptocurrency. When will the Grayscale DOGE ETF officially launch? While Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas suggests November 24, the launch depends on final regulatory approval and official exchange announcements. How is this different from buying Dogecoin directly? The ETF provides regulated, institutional-grade exposure to DOGE without the need for cryptocurrency wallets or exchange accounts, making it accessible to traditional investors. What are the risks of investing in a Grayscale DOGE ETF?

Against this backdrop, Finbold consulted ChatGPT to identify which cryptocurrencies may offer strong upside potential during the current dip. Solana (SOL) One of the standout opportunities highlighted is Solana ( SOL ). According to ChatGPT, a major catalyst is the rollout of Firedancer, a new validator client built by Jump Crypto, designed to push Solana’s throughput toward one million transactions per second. Alongside this, the Alpenglow upgrade is significantly improving the network’s performance by reducing finality to roughly 150 milliseconds, laying the foundation for real-time financial applications, high-frequency trading, and latency-sensitive gaming ecosystems. ChatGPT also noted that Solana’s DeFi activity remains robust, supported by expanding block space and proposals to increase compute-unit capacity. Institutional interest continues to rise as well, most notably through Bitwise’s launch of a spot Solana staking ETF , which attracted more than $420 million in its first week. This combination of technological acceleration and institutional inflows positions Solana as one of the strongest large-cap contenders poised to rebound once market sentiment stabilizes. By press time, Solana was trading at $132, having corrected by over 2% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, SOL has plunged more than 20%. SOL one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Polygon (POL) The second altcoin identified by the artificial intelligence model as a strong buy during the dip is Polygon, which is undergoing one of the most significant transformations of any major blockchain in 2025. At the moment, POL has been weighed down by the broader market sentiment, trading at $0.14 as of press time, down 1.6% in the past day, while on the weekly timeline, the asset is down 22%. POL one-month price chart. Source: CMC The model noted that Polygon’s migration from MATIC to POL is nearly complete, expanding the token’s role into the backbone of Polygon’s multi-chain ecosystem. A core development driving optimism is the rollout of AggLayer, Polygon’s interoperability layer designed to unify liquidity and shared state across multiple Polygon-powered chains. This provides a crucial competitive edge in the increasingly fragmented blockchain landscape, where seamless communication and shared liquidity are becoming essential. Polygon is also strengthening its institutional footprint. The network has attracted high-profile partnerships with companies such as Nike, Starbucks, and Meta, while supporting tokenized finance initiatives, including a €100 million blockchain bond issued through NRW.BANK. These developments suggest a long-term growth trajectory fueled by enterprise use cases, scalable multi-chain infrastructure, and expanding real-world adoption.

A groundbreaking investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has uncovered a disturbing truth about crypto exchanges illicit trades that generated millions in fees for major platforms. How Did Crypto Exchanges Profit from Suspicious Transactions? The ICIJ investigation reveals that major cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance and OKX earned substantial fees from transactions linked to criminal activities. Over the past two years, these platforms processed millions of dollars worth of questionable transfers while collecting standard trading fees. According to the report, 37 media partners across 35 countries collaborated to track these transactions. They collected hundreds of cryptocurrency addresses and traced the money flow through sophisticated blockchain analysis techniques. What Methods Did Investigators Use to Track Illicit Trades? The investigation employed multiple approaches to identify suspicious activity on crypto exchanges illicit trades . Here are the key methods used: Blockchain transaction analysis across multiple networks Cross-referencing known criminal wallet addresses Monitoring patterns consistent with money laundering Collaborating with international financial crime units This comprehensive approach allowed investigators to connect seemingly anonymous transactions to real-world criminal activities. The findings highlight significant gaps in the compliance systems of major trading platforms. Why Are Crypto Exchanges Struggling with Compliance? Despite increased regulatory scrutiny, many cryptocurrency exchanges continue to face challenges in monitoring all transactions effectively. The sheer volume of daily trades, combined with sophisticated obfuscation techniques used by bad actors, makes complete oversight difficult. However, the investigation raises important questions about whether exchanges are doing enough to prevent crypto exchanges illicit trades . The substantial fees generated from these transactions create potential conflicts of interest that regulators are now examining closely. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For everyday cryptocurrency users, this investigation serves as an important reminder about platform due diligence. When choosing where to trade, consider these factors: Regulatory compliance history of the exchange Transparency in reporting suspicious activities Cooperation with law enforcement agencies Investment in advanced monitoring technology The revelation about crypto exchanges illicit trades underscores the importance of working with platforms that prioritize security and regulatory compliance over pure profit generation. How Can the Industry Address This Challenge? Moving forward, the cryptocurrency industry must take decisive action to rebuild trust. This requires coordinated efforts across multiple fronts: Enhanced Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures Improved transaction monitoring systems Greater transparency in fee structures Stronger international cooperation The investigation into crypto exchanges illicit trades represents a turning point for the industry. Exchanges that proactively address these concerns will likely emerge stronger, while those that resist change may face increasing regulatory pressure. Frequently Asked Questions Which crypto exchanges were named in the ICIJ investigation? The investigation specifically mentioned Binance and OKX as major platforms that earned significant fees from suspicious transactions, though other exchanges were also implicated. How much money did exchanges make from illicit trades? While exact figures vary, the investigation suggests millions of dollars in fees were generated from crime-linked transactions over a two-year period. What types of illicit activities were involved? The transactions were linked to various criminal activities including money laundering, fraud, and other financial crimes identified through blockchain analysis. Are regular users at risk when using these exchanges? While regular users aren’t directly implicated, they may face increased regulatory scrutiny and potential platform instability due to investigations and compliance actions. What should I do if I use one of these exchanges? Review the exchange’s compliance updates, ensure your accounts are properly verified, and consider diversifying across multiple reputable platforms. How can exchanges prevent illicit trades in the future? Exchanges need to invest in advanced monitoring technology, implement stricter KYC procedures, and cooperate more closely with international regulators. Share this important investigation with fellow crypto enthusiasts – help spread awareness about the need for greater transparency and regulation in cryptocurrency trading.

In the last 24 hours, a total of $689.8 million worth of positions were liquidated, $348.7 million of which were long and $341 million were short positions. The market decline was driven by a pullback in US stocks and a weakening likelihood of a Fed interest rate cut in December. This decline in risk appetite also negatively impacted the crypto market.

As Michael Saylor talks up a “₿ig Week” and critics warn of a possible death spiral, traders are lining up MSTR charts to see which side proves right. Saylor Signals a “Big Week” as Schiff Warns of MSTR Trouble Bitcoin’s largest corporate holder entered the new week with rising attention after Michael Saylor shared a chart showing MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin portfolio value at $61.20 billion as of November 16. Bitcoin Portfolio Chart. Source: StrategyTracker / X Saylor posted the update with the caption “₿ig Week,” signaling that he expects major moves for both Bitcoin and MicroStrategy as volatility returns. His message came while Bitcoin trades below recent highs and MSTR mirrors the pullback. At the same time, veteran gold advocate Peter Schiff challenged Saylor’s optimism. He said Bitcoin and MicroStrategy face “big losses” this week, arguing that MicroStrategy’s business model depends on income-oriented funds buying its high-yield preferred shares. According to Schiff, those yields “will never actually be paid,” and once managers recognize the risk, they will exit their positions, making it harder for the company to issue additional preferred shares. Schiff added that such a shift could trigger what he called a “death spiral” for MicroStrategy, intensifying the disagreement between the two long-time critics of each other’s market views. MicroStrategy Slides Into Key Support Zone as Trader Sets “Top Watch” MicroStrategy stock is back on traders’ radar after a sharp decline that erased more than half of its value from the recent peak. On the weekly chart shared by BRITT (@BullishBritt), MSTR has dropped into a wide price band around 190–200 dollars that previously acted as a major supply zone during 2024. The new test comes after weeks of heavy selling that pushed the stock straight down from above 360 dollars. MicroStrategy MSTR Weekly Support Zone. Source: BullishBritt on X Now BRITT describes MSTR as her “top watch” for the week, saying she expects the former supply area to act as support and form a demand zone on this retest. In her view, the highlighted region marks a level where the stock paused and reversed multiple times in the past, which could attract fresh buyers if the zone holds. The chart shows price pressing into that band with elevated weekly volume, underscoring how much trading activity is clustering around the level. At the same time, BRITT says she is looking for a “relief bounce” from the support area, with a possible move back toward the 250–280 dollar range if the reaction unfolds. She frames the setup as a short-term recovery play after an extended drawdown, while the broader trend for both MSTR and Bitcoin remains under scrutiny. TrendSpider Flags Cup-Shaped Recovery as MSTR Retests Overhead Zone Meanwhile, TrendSpider highlighted a different angle on MicroStrategy’s price action, posting a chart with the caption, “Don’t show this chart to Michael Saylor.” The daily setup shows MSTR carving out a large cup-shaped recovery from its mid-year lows, with price now pushing back into the same overhead zone that capped rallies earlier in 2025.

As the rebound accelerates, MSTR is trading just under the shaded resistance band near 199.75 dollars, an area that rejected multiple attempts in the past. The move adds fresh attention to whether the stock can break above the ceiling after forming such a deep recovery structure. At the same time, the lower panel shows a triple stochastic RSI clustering in higher ranges, reflecting bullish momentum as the chart presses into resistance.

Schiff Wants A Live Debate To Prove It,https://bitcoinist.com/is-saylors-bitcoin-strategy-a-fraud-schiff-wants-a-live-debate-to-prove-it/,"Peter Schiff, a long-time gold investor and vocal critic of Bitcoin, on Sunday called Strategy Inc.’s Bitcoin-only approach “a fraud” and publicly challenged Michael Saylor to a live debate at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai this December. Schiff said the firm’s recent profits are mostly tied to the market price of Bitcoin and warned that the company’s financial structure could fail if investor sentiment turns. Schiff’s Core Charge According to Schiff, Strategy’s reported gains are largely unrealized and the company’s financing plan is risky. He openly slammed the company, saying, “MSTR’s whole business approach is a fraud. No matter how Bitcoin performs, I expect MSTR to eventually face bankruptcy.” MSTR’s entire business model is a fraud. Saylor and I will both be speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in early December. I challenge @saylor to debate this proposition with me. Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I believe $MSTR will eventually go bankrupt. Let’s go! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 16, 2025 He pointed to the company’s third-quarter results — net income of $2.8 billion and diluted EPS of $8.42 — as examples of earnings that, he says, come from mark-to-market increases in Bitcoin rather than steady business operations. Schiff said that preferred shares marketed as high-yield may never produce the promised returns and that this could trigger heavy selling by yield funds. Strategy’s own report shows it held about 640,808 BTC as of late October, at a total cost around $47.44 billion and an implied cost per coin near $74,032. MSTR’s business model relies on income-oriented funds buying its “high-yield” preferred shares. But those published yields will never actually be paid. Once fund managers realize this they’ll dump the preferreds & $MSTR won’t be able to issue any more, setting off a death spiral. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 16, 2025 The company reported a 26% BTC Yield for the year-to-date and said it had realized close to $13 billion in BTC gains in 2025 so far. Those figures help explain why the firm posted strong accounting profits even while its core software business generates modest revenue. Debate Call Draws Attention The challenge from Schiff is timed to overlap with Saylor’s speaking schedule at the Dubai conference, turning what might have been routine appearances into a potential public showdown. Market watchers say a debate would be watched closely by investors, regulators and other corporate issuers who have been weighing Bitcoin exposure. Some analysts say the strategy, while risky, gives investors a way to gain leveraged exposure to Bitcoin through a public company. Others agree with Schiff that the accounting treatment and financing choices expose shareholders to sudden shifts. Saylor and Strategy did not immediately accept or decline the debate invitation in public comments.

Now the network’s role in tokenized finance, its long-term support line and its CCIP usage trends are shaping the latest narrative around the project. Chainlink, UBS Join DigiFT Pilot for Tokenized Fund Operations in Hong Kong Chainlink and UBS appear in a new DigiFT white paper that describes what it calls the first live, in-production tokenized fund workflow using Chainlink’s Digital Transfer Agent (DTA) technical standard and Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE). The pilot runs within Hong Kong’s digital asset framework and focuses on automating core fund processes onchain. Chainlink Tokenized Fund Operations. Source: X The project sits under Hong Kong Cyberport’s digital asset program, the city’s main digital-tech hub and accelerator. In this setup, Chainlink infrastructure executes and automates onchain fund subscription and redemption, while CRE runs DTA smart contracts that handle transaction recordkeeping. At the same time, the DTA standard built on CRE provides a framework for transfer agents and fund administrators who want to move more of their operations onchain while keeping existing regulatory requirements in place. It is designed to support tokenized assets at scale without changing the underlying rules they must follow. Together, UBS, DigiFT and Chainlink run the in-production system as a standards-based solution for tokenized fund operations in a regulated environment. The pilot shows how onchain finance can function inside Hong Kong’s current digital asset rules rather than outside them. Chainlink Tests a Long-Term Support Line as Selling Pressure Builds Chainlink is approaching a key trendline that has guided its structure since July 2023. The chart shared by analyst Ali shows LINK sliding toward this support after several months of lower highs and repeated rebounds along the same rising line. Each earlier touch produced a recovery, but the latest move brings LINK closer to a decisive break. Chainlink Long-Term Trendline Test. Source: Ali Charts As the chart shows, LINK has traded inside a broad two-year structure with clear reactions each time price met the trendline. Now the token is dipping under the line’s lower edge, signaling that buyers may no longer defend the level with the same strength. If LINK fails to reclaim the trendline soon, the pattern suggests momentum could shift toward deeper support zones. At the same time, the test comes after weeks of broader weakness across large-cap tokens. That context adds weight to the chart because it indicates the move is not isolated. A firm close below the trendline would mark the first clear violation of this structure since it formed, while a quick rebound above it would signal that buyers are still active. Chainlink CCIP Activity Slips as Weekly Volumes Pull Back Meanwhile, Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) posted a clear slowdown in activity for the week of November 10–16. Data shared by analyst Tomb shows total value transferred falling to $292.75 million, a 39.4 percent drop from the previous week. Chainlink CCIP Weekly Activity. Source: CCIP Analytics At the same time, CCIP handled 6,653 transactions, marking an 11.6 percent decline in message volume. Network fees also moved lower, coming in at $4,930, a 43.8 percent decrease. The top-sent token during the period was syrupUSDC, which accounted for about $48.07 million, or 16.4 percent of weekly transfers. As the chart indicates, weekly transferred value has trended unevenly since early August, with sharp increases followed by retracements. The latest drop places CCIP activity back near levels seen in late September, signaling softer cross-chain usage heading into the second half of November.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|LINK|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 19:02:24

The response referenced Grok and included detailed charts outlining how continuous daily accumulation, combined with ETF-driven demand, could bring extreme price outcomes if circulating supply contracts at the pace described. The analysis focuses on the numbers presented rather than speculation, offering a structured look at what such a supply squeeze would mathematically imply. Grok sais: pic.twitter.com/SN9AfGOmp7 — SELATHIEL::::::::::::::::: DIVINE LIGHT :.:.:.: (@theAuthentic11) November 15, 2025 The Acquisition Framework Presented by Chad Steingraber Chad Steingraber’s initial breakdown lays the foundation for the model. He outlines a target daily average acquisition level of 11 million XRP and scales it across twelve ETF funds to produce a combined daily intake of 132 million XRP. At that rate, weekly accumulation reaches approximately 666 million XRP. The one-month projection suggests that these flows would move about 2.64 billion XRP into cold storage. Extending the same accumulation pattern across twelve months, roughly 31.68 billion XRP were removed from the circulating supply, treated in the model as effectively inaccessible. Selathiel’s Grok-Based $15,000 XRP Price Projection Selathiel’s response applies these supply assumptions to a month-by-month valuation model. Beginning at a starting price of $2.45, the model calculates price appreciation strictly from decreasing supply. It presents moderate increases in early months, reflecting initial reductions from over 31 billion XRP in circulation down to about 29 billion. By month three, the projected price reaches approximately $7.57. As the model continues, the supply drops more sharply, falling to levels such as 18.48 billion XRP by month five and 10.56 billion by month eight. This accelerating contraction results in equally rapid upward adjustments in the projected price path. By month six, the model displays a valuation of around $32.82. As the supply moves into single-digit billions, the projections climb into triple- and quadruple-digit territory. Grok’s scarcity-based model shows a depletion of the available supply, assigning a hypothetical price exceeding $15,000 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Interpreting the Model’s Structure The attached tables and chart emphasize that the outcome stems directly from compounding percentage increases tied to each reduction stage. Relative reduction percentages rise steadily—from around 8% early on to 100% at the end—while the projected price increase percentages scale in parallel. The model labels the later-stage figures as unrealistic without significant shifts in how the market processes price discovery, indicating that such explosive behavior would normally trigger structural limits, regulatory protections, or liquidity adjustments. Selathiel’s reply presents a clear numerical demonstration of how a strict scarcity model would translate sustained daily accumulation into rising valuations over time. By combining Chad Steingraber’s acquisition assumptions with an aggressive reduction-based pricing formula, the attached visuals illustrate how extreme outcomes emerge mathematically when supply is removed at scale . The projection is framed as a theoretical exploration rather than a practical forecast, anchored entirely in the supply-shock scenario.

Draft rules prepared by the Treasury Department to ensure compliance with the international crypto tax reporting system arrived at the White House today. President Donald Trump's advisors will now begin evaluating the proposals. In the first half of the year, the White House openly encouraged the Treasury Department and the IRS to develop these rules. If these regulations are implemented, the US will formally join the Global Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF), established by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in 2022. CARF is a global system that allows member countries to automatically share their citizens' cryptocurrency information with each other. Its goal is to prevent international tax evasion through crypto. G7 countries such as Japan, Germany, France, Canada, Italy, and the United Kingdom, as well as crypto-friendly regions like the UAE, Singapore, and the Bahamas, have already joined the agreement. Related News: Watch Out: Heavy Token Unlocking in 20 Altcoins This Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List In a comprehensive crypto policy report released this summer, President Trump’s crypto advisors recommended that the US join CARF. The report also stated: “Implementing CARF would deter US taxpayers from moving their digital assets to foreign exchanges. It would also support the growth of digital assets in the US and alleviate concerns that a lack of reporting disadvantages the country.” However, the White House also emphasized that the new rules should not impose a new reporting obligation on DeFi transactions. The global CARF implementation is scheduled to take effect in 2027. If the regulatory process in the US is completed, American investors' offshore crypto accounts will be subject to a comprehensive tax tracking system for the first time. *This is not investment advice.

UBS has quietly disclosed a stake in Trump-backed American Bitcoin Corp as BTC slips below a key weekly trendline support. UBS Discloses Stake in Trump-Backed American Bitcoin Corp UBS Group AG has disclosed a new equity position in American Bitcoin Corp, the mining and infrastructure company backed by members of the Trump family. The bank reported holding 41,171 shares of the Nasdaq-listed firm in its latest quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the Form 13F for the quarter ending Sept. 30, UBS added the shares as part of its U.S. equity portfolio, placing the position among its smaller holdings. The filing shows the stake was valued at roughly $277,000 at the time of reporting, marking a modest but notable entry into a politically prominent Bitcoin-related company. UBS ABTC Disclosure. Source: BitcoinTreasuries The disclosure comes as institutional interest in digital-asset firms continues to grow. American Bitcoin Corp has attracted attention since launching with backing from Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., positioning itself as a public vehicle tied to Bitcoin mining and infrastructure. UBS’s inclusion of ABTC in its portfolio adds another major financial institution to the list of investors with exposure to the company. The 13F filing does not indicate a broader shift in UBS’s cryptocurrency strategy. Instead, it reflects routine equity positioning within a diversified portfolio. Even so, the move highlights how traditional financial institutions are gradually increasing their exposure to companies operating in the digital-asset sector. Bitcoin Slips Below Short-Term Trendline as Weekly Chart Points to Nearby Support Meanwhile, Bitcoin has lost its short-term trendline on the weekly chart, signaling a clear technical break after weeks of slowing momentum. The new structure shows the candle closing beneath the purple line, which previously guided the uptrend since mid-2024. Bitcoin Weekly Trendline Support.

This black line has acted as a major support zone across multiple pullbacks over the past two years, and the chart now shows price moving toward it. Traders often watch this level closely because it has repeatedly attracted new demand during earlier corrections. At the same time, the weekly structure still maintains higher lows on the broader trend, meaning the longer-term line remains the more decisive support for the current cycle. As Bitcoin approaches that area, the chart suggests a potential stabilization zone rather than an immediate continuation of the decline.

TD Cowen, a leading research and brokerage firm, has identified Strategy stock as a standout opportunity, forecasting an incredible 170% upside. This optimistic outlook comes despite recent Bitcoin price drops and concerns over the company’s mNAV ratio. Let’s dive into why experts are so bullish on this Strategy stock. Why Is Strategy Stock Gaining Attention? TD Cowen’s analysis highlights two key drivers for the Strategy stock surge. First, the potential inclusion in the S&P 500 could attract institutional investors, boosting demand. Second, an improving regulatory environment in the U.S. reduces uncertainty. These factors position the Strategy stock for sustained growth, even as Bitcoin experiences volatility. What Does the 170% Upside Mean for Investors? A 170% upside suggests that the current Strategy stock price could more than double. TD Cowen bases this on: Projected holdings of 815,000 BTC by 2027 Increased institutional adoption Positive regulatory shifts Therefore, investing in Strategy stock now might offer significant returns, though it’s essential to monitor market trends. How Does Bitcoin’s Performance Affect Strategy Stock? Bitcoin’s recent decline hasn’t dampened TD Cowen’s confidence in Strategy stock. The firm believes that the company’s long-term strategy, including Bitcoin accumulation, will outweigh short-term price swings. Moreover, the mNAV ratio, which compares market cap to BTC holdings, is seen as a temporary concern rather than a lasting issue. What Are the Risks and Rewards? Investing in Strategy stock involves balancing potential rewards with risks. Key benefits include: Exposure to Bitcoin’s growth without direct ownership Possible S&P 500 inclusion driving liquidity Regulatory clarity enhancing stability However, challenges like Bitcoin’s volatility and regulatory changes require careful consideration. Always diversify your portfolio to manage risk. Conclusion: Is Strategy Stock Your Next Big Move? TD Cowen’s bold prediction for Strategy stock underscores its potential in the evolving crypto market. With a 170% upside forecast, supported by S&P 500 inclusion prospects and regulatory improvements, this stock could be a game-changer for savvy investors. Stay informed and assess your risk tolerance to make the most of this opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions What is Strategy stock? Strategy stock refers to shares in a company heavily invested in Bitcoin, analyzed by TD Cowen for its growth potential. Why does TD Cowen predict a 170% upside? This forecast is based on expected S&P 500 inclusion, regulatory improvements, and projected Bitcoin holdings of 815,000 by 2027. How does Bitcoin’s price affect Strategy stock? While linked, Strategy stock’s long-term outlook may outweigh short-term Bitcoin volatility, per TD Cowen’s analysis. What is mNAV? mNAV is the ratio of market cap to the value of Bitcoin holdings, used to assess a company’s valuation relative to its assets. Should I invest in Strategy stock? Consider your financial goals and risk tolerance; consult a financial advisor for personalized advice. When might Strategy stock join the S&P 500? No specific date is confirmed, but positive regulatory changes could accelerate this process.

The asset is now priced around $900 after falling from a mid-October peak of around $1,370. This drop has triggered new analysis on whether the move is a warning sign or a buying window. Price Action and Key Levels BNB’s fall below $1,080 confirmed a break in market structure. Crypto analyst Crypto Patel stated that a dip toward $880 was already expected. The price reached this area and rebounded slightly, but it still sits under the $1,000–$1,050 resistance zone, which was tested and rejected. A longer-term trendline, which had held since the summer rally, has also broken. Patel pointed to the $770–$730 zone as a possible area for accumulation. He added, “ Everyone panics when BNB dips… I look for entries ,” and maintained a longer-term view that BNB could reach $5,000. In a separate analysis, Henry shared a possible short-term recovery setup. On the 4-hour chart, a W-shaped pattern or double bottom has formed, with support near $900. If BNB breaks above $1,036, he expects a move toward $1,175. “Double bottom is done, now it’s time to pump,” he said. Momentum Signals Momentum remains low. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38, which is near oversold levels but not low enough to confirm a strong reversal. Buying activity is limited, and the market lacks a clear direction. Source: TradingView The MACD, an indicator that follows trends, still indicates a bearish structure. The MACD line is situated under the signal line, and both are in the negative area. This setup points to continued downside pressure, with no sign of a trend reversal for now. Meanwhile, sentiment remains mixed. According to Market Prophit, the crowd is bullish, while their model indicates bearish conditions. This split shows that traders and systems are not aligned on the next move. However, netflow data shows a recent $2.06 million inflow to exchanges, which may suggest short-term selling. Over recent weeks, though, BNB has seen mostly outflows, meaning more tokens are moving off exchanges. This often happens when holders move assets into private wallets. Source: Coinglass Distribution and Legal Context As CryptoPotato reported earlier this month, data from YZi Labs shows that BNB supply is becoming more dispersed across the network. More tokens are now held in self-custody, with fewer stored on exchanges. Simultaneously, the regulatory landscape concerning Binance has changed. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of Binance, was given a complete and unrestricted pardon by US President Donald Trump not long ago. Although some are of the opinion that this might ease the legal pressure on Binance, others doubt the action and its impact on the entire crypto market.

As BNB Chain launches a Local Hack with YZi Labs, the token holds a bullish divergence just above a major demand area. BNB Chain Kicks Off “Local Hack” in Abu Dhabi with YZi Labs The BNB Chain announced on November 17, 2025, that it will hold a “Local Hack” in Abu Dhabi in partnership with YZi Labs. The event will span onsite dates of December 5–6, with an online pre-hack phase from November 24–27. During the pre-hack phase, developers can join live sessions covering build tracks, rules and tooling offered by BNB Chain. The onsite hackathon will feature face-to-face team building, live panels, mentoring and final demos. Participants will compete across eight innovation tracks including trading, real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation, AI, DeSci, payments, wallets and a “Regional Impact” track tailored to UAE market needs. The event offers US $160 000 in prizes and ecosystem support. BNB Chain said the Abu Dhabi hackathon forms part of its “Local Hack Series,” aimed at expanding its developer community in the MENA region. The announcement emphasises that the hackathon isn’t just a weekend sprint: teams are encouraged to prepare early via provided developer toolkits, reference code and ecosystem resources. Developers seeking to apply must register ahead of the onsite event. The announcement also invites regional universities, incubators and developer networks to partner with BNB Chain for future Local Hack events. BNB Tests Demand Zone as Bullish Divergence Builds Meanwhile, BNB continues to defend the demand zone around $900–$925 on the 4-hour chart, where buyers repeatedly step in. The price trades sideways just above this area while the descending trendline from early November still caps every bounce. This keeps the market in a short-term compression between horizontal support and falling trendline resistance. BNB Trendline Compression. Source: Cryptorphic At the same time, the RSI forms a sequence of higher lows even as price moves flat near the floor. That structure creates a classic bullish divergence, which often signals that selling pressure is losing strength compared with previous visits to the same price band. As momentum improves under the surface, the focus shifts to whether candles can close above the trendline drawn from the recent swing highs. If BNB breaks that line with follow-through, the chart would confirm a shift toward bullish momentum and open room for a recovery toward the prior consolidation area above the current range. However, a clean breakdown below roughly $880 would invalidate this constructive setup and show that the demand zone failed, putting lower supports back in play.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 19:17:26

Alexander Egorov, the first Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank’s Board, proposed changes to harmonize legislation to prevent conflicts between the union’s countries. The EAEU currently includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia. “For example, in the Republic of Belarus, the High-Tech Park zone permits the use of cryptocurrency for both legal entities and individuals. Recently, there was a meeting at the head of state where we discussed expanding the park’s mandate, including in the area of ​​cryptocurrencies and cryptobanks. On the other hand, we see the situation in Russia, where the use of cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments is quite limited,” Egorov explained. According to the official, such measures will facilitate cross-border transactions, preventing instances where crypto asset owners transfer capital to EAEU countries with more lenient regulations and lower taxes than those in other jurisdictions. The EAEU countries differ in crypto goals and regulations All five countries have different crypto regulations, yet they still show great interest in the assets. Earlier, Roman Golovchenko, Chairman of the Board of the National Bank of Belarus, stated that a digital version of the national currency will become available to businesses and state-owned companies in the second half of 2026. At the same time, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko urged his government to introduce stricter regulations for the crypto industry. According to reports, Lukashenko warned that lax oversight was undermining investor security and the state’s economic interests. This came after a state audit found that about half of all citizen investments sent to foreign crypto platforms fail to return. In Kyrgyzstan, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) has recently authorized banking institutions in the country to establish escrow accounts for transactions involving crypto tokens. This was made possible due to the recently introduced amendments to its Resolution “On Approval of the Instructions for Working with Bank Accounts and Bank Deposit Accounts,” which was originally adopted in 2012. In Russia, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) announced its plans to authorize capital management firms to invest in crypto-linked instruments in 2026, according to Cryptopolitan. They are currently banned from buying such derivatives with a regulatory act that needs to be amended to lift the restrictions. The bank now intends to make the necessary changes in the first quarter of the new year. Additionally, Kazakhstan announced its plans to own a crypto reserve that will store between $500 million and $1 billion worth of various assets. Part of these will be in the form of crypto seized by the government, and some will be repatriated assets. On the other hand, Armenian authorities confirmed their plan to prohibit cash purchases of cryptocurrency in the country, starting from next year. A representative of the executive power in Yerevan stated that their intention is not to curb crypto turnover, but rather to prevent anonymous transactions. The EU continues to crack down on sanctions evasion via crypto In other news, the EAEU founder, Russia, was reminded that the European Union intends to crack down on sanctions evasion via crypto. After the EU’s 19th sanctions package, platforms such as Revolut and Bybit EU began cutting off customers from Russia. Most complaints came from Russians and Belarusians residing in the EU. One affected user with a Russian passport had a residence permit in Europe but still failed re-verification. “Recently, ByBit NL migrated to ByBit EU. And they asked me to pass KYC again. With the very same documents I used to verify before, they refused,” the user described the problem. Revolut has been closing the accounts of Russians with EU residence permits on similar grounds, citing the new restrictions. Although the bank had previously opened accounts for such residents, from November 1, even existing clients began receiving closure notices. Announcing the latest package, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said it was aimed at the financial loopholes that Russia uses to evade restrictions. However, for the first time, the curbs were extended to crypto platforms. The official document was published on October 23. Beyond import and personal sanctions, its provisions prohibit EU-licensed venues from providing services to residents of the Russian Federation. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

It’s not straightforward to assess. WIN has shown remarkable uptrend, quietly becoming one of the big crypto success stories of 2022—a year many in the sector would prefer to forget, as it consistently outperformed the market. However, the project has gone quiet since 2024. As WIN price is set to surge further, it can be a good investment option in the long run. As with any cryptocurrency investment, conducting thorough research is crucial before investing in WIN. Why is the WIN price down today? WIN price witnessed a bearish reversal as sellers crushed the nearest support level. Will WIN price reach $0.0001? WIN price might soon reach the $0.0001 mark in 2027 if the buying demand surges and WINkLink attract altcoin investors. Can WINk reach $1 dollar?? Due to the community effort, WINkLink Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the WINkLink (WIN) Coin will reach $1 soon, which is a long-term target. Is WINk a good long-term investment? WIN has gained popularity thanks to strong community support. However, it’s not investment advice, and it’s crucial to conduct one’s own research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable long-term investment. What will WINk be worth in 2030? WINkLink is expected to trade at $0.000209 on the lower side and $0.000229 on the higher side in 2030, which will significantly impact its market capitalization. What is the WINkLink price prediction for 2050? Predicting a cryptocurrency’s price for such a long period as 2050 is highly speculative, as the industry is subject to unforeseen legal and market changes in the future. However, some analysts predict a minimum price of $0.0935 for the WIN token by that time.

WIN historical price sentiment WINkLink price history The WINkLink blockchain ecosystem was launched in August 2019, at a price of 0.00046. In 2020, the token saw a swift descent as it observed its all-time low of $0.000041 on March 13. 2021 was a good year for WIN as it clocked its all-time high of $0.002894 on April 05, 2021, following its acquisition of Justlink.io, after which it became the first comprehensive Oracle in the Tron ecosystem. The token traded near $0.00131 till May 2021, while it traded at a higher than average price of $0.000689 till November, as per crypto market data. Strong corrections followed throughout 2022, as the token remained on a downward spiral till June and consolidated near $0.000091 till December. In 2023, WINkLink (WIN) was trading in a range of $0.000067 to $0.000106 and could not make a breakthrough as the cryptocurrency market remained bearish. Bullish markets of 2024 proved favorable for the token on a limited basis as it touched a high of only $0.0002 in March and corrected down to the previous range of $0.000077 before flashing at $0.00017 in December. The WIN token started 2025 with a correction, reaching $0.000093 by the end of January and $0.000071 in February. In March, the token plunged to $0.0000422, but it remained afloat above this level until September, occasionally spiking as high as $0.0000709. In October 2025, the WIN token started to correct again and reached $0.00003952, while in November, it is trending near $0.00003371, as the current market sentiment is negative.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-17 19:30:00

Paid Promotion Or Real Momentum?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-is-zcash-thriving-paid-promotion-real-momentum/,"After years in the wilderness, Zcash (ZEC) has staged a roughly 740% price “pump” this year, with analysts linking the move to surging demand for on-chain privacy and a cluster of high-profile endorsements. The speed and timing of the rally have ignited a heated debate on X: is Zcash’s resurgence driven by coordinated paid promotion, or by genuine improvements in its technology and monetary design? The flashpoint came from infrastructure founder Mert Mumtaz (@0xMert_), who mocked the idea that a single “mega-whale” is paying off every visible supporter. “There’s a person in crypto so rich that they are simultaneously paying off Cobie, Naval Ravikant, Balaji Srinivasan, me, Tim Ferris, [Arthur] Hayes, Gainzy, path, Ansem, the Winklevoss Twins, Toly [Yakovenko] and more. (all of whom require just one final OTC KOL deal to finally make it). Either that or I’m retarded.” there’s a person in crypto so rich that they are simultaneously paying off cobie, naval, balaji, me, tim ferris, hayes, gainzy, path, ansem, the winklevoss twins, toly and more (all of whom require just one final OTC KOL deal to finally make it) either that or I’m retarded — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) November 16, 2025 In a follow-up, he argued the real story is investor psychology, writing that “people would rather believe the above than admit that they sidelined themselves due to poor thinking and emotion.” Why Is Zcash Surging Now? Mert then laid out why, in his view, Zcash is rallying now: a more favorable political window for privacy coins in the US, issuance reduction, NEAR Intents that turn ZEC into a “shielded swiss vault” for one-click cross-chain payments, the default-shielding Zashi wallet with “100x better UX,” the 100x-scaling ambitions of Project Tachyon. Related Reading: Winklevoss Twins Back Zcash (ZEC) Treasury Company With $58M Investment On the long list of arguments he added the disillusionment with an increasingly institutional Bitcoin, Europe’s tightening surveillance regime, maturing zero-knowledge tech, fatigue with supply-controlled coins that were “dumped” on retail, and the broader “debasement trade” pushing investors toward alternative stores of value. He closed: “you combine all of the above with a little spark and the fire spreads fast. There is no conspiracy, just think. This is not a trade.” Skeptics see the same facts very differently. One user complained that Jordan Fish [@Cobie), a prominent UK-based crypto investor and trader, had become a “paid zcash shill,” and asked whether “all the big KOLs just randomly decided to just start shilling Zcash.” Cobie replied that his interest was not new at all: “Just started? I have been doing this almost 10 years (painfully),” resurfacing a 2017 tweet about buying ZEC if the price ever hit $0.3. When his critic apologized, Cobie turned to fundamentals: “Zcash has a lot of recent developments actually IMO. (1) One of the coolest things I have seen: Project Tachyon. (2) They fixed the brutal inflation that killed us. (3) Zcash + NEAR intents for permissionless cross-chain swaps seems to actually be working.” Zcash has a lot of recent developments actually IMO.

Zcash’s engineering roadmap has advanced from experimental cryptography to production-grade systems. Project Tachyon, outlined by Zcash researcher Sean Bowe, proposes “oblivious synchronization,” a way for wallets to sync shielded notes without leaking metadata, drastically lowering latency and making large-scale shielded usage practical. Related Reading: Arthur Hayes Outlines Why Zcash Could Surge To $10,000–$20,000 Fast On the user side, the Zashi wallet has become the flagship interface, abstracting away complex shielding flows and steering users into private, shielded transactions by default. Research from Galaxy and other analysts notes that shielded supply has climbed from low single-digit percentages a few years ago to roughly a quarter of all circulating ZEC, with estimates around 30% of supply now parked in the shielded pool. Influencer activity undeniably amplifies this. Naval Ravikant’s October post, “Bitcoin is insurance against fiat. ZCash is insurance against Bitcoin,” was widely cited as an immediate catalyst for a sharp doubling in ZEC’s price and cemented the “privacy insurance” meme. The Zcash debate ultimately sits at the intersection of reflexive markets and real progress. Genuine upgrades in issuance, UX and scalability, plus a harsher global climate for financial privacy, have created a strong fundamental backdrop. Vocal advocates with large audiences have compressed years of re-rating into weeks, leaving sidelined traders searching for explanations. Whether one calls that paid promotion, organic momentum or a feedback loop of both, the current cycle shows how quickly a once-written-off privacy coin can become crypto’s latest battleground.

Ethereum has also dipped to a crucial round-numbered support, and the liquidations are on the rise due to excessive leverage used by traders. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView It wasn’t that long ago when BTC stood firmly above $100,000. In fact, less than a week ago, it had just jumped past $107,000 following some positive developments on US soil. However, that was short-lived, and the subsequent rejection and correction have been quite violent. Bitcoin plummeted to a five-digit price territory last Thursday and has not been able to stage any sort of recovery. Just the opposite, the hits keep on coming, and the latest took place minutes ago when it dipped below $92,000. This is the lowest price tag it has seen since April 24, making it a seven-month low. What’s interesting and different about the ongoing crash is the fact that there’s no evident culprit behind it. Unlike previous occasions, such as industry blowouts, global pandemics, or macro uncertainty, this correction appears to be driven by excessive leverage, as explained by the Kobeissi Letter earlier. Moreover, the analysts determined that BTC has entered a new structural bear market, and the landscape has only worsened since then. ETH is in no better shape as it dipped below $3,000 minutes ago as well. Ethereum is down by more than 15% weekly and over 22% in a month. Most other altcoins are in a dire state as well, with XRP dropping by 3.6% daily and SOL plunging by over 5%. Naturally, the high levels of leverage used by traders have harmed a significant number, with more than 150,000 such market participants wrecked daily. The total value of liquidated positions has risen to almost $800 million within the same timeframe. The single-biggest wrecked order was a whopping one. It took place on Hyperliquid and was worth $96.51 million, data from CoinGlass shows.

At the same time, a separate thread focused on BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes after an account known as 0xNobler claimed Hayes was sending assets to Wintermute “every few hours.” The dashboard showed a wallet labeled “Arthur Hayes” routing tokens to market maker Wintermute, OTC desk FalconX and several exchange deposit addresses.

Ethereum Dominance Bounces Off Key Support as Gordon Eyes Upside Ethereum’s market share is holding a key support zone after a steep slide, putting dominance back in focus for traders. The weekly chart shared by analyst Gordon shows ETH dominance rebounding from the 7–8 percent area and now stabilizing around 12 percent. ETH Dominance Chart. Source: Gordon on X The same band acted as support during earlier cycles, when Ethereum paused and then extended higher. On the chart, ETH has already formed a clear base at the lows and then pulled back into this mid-range support, where buyers previously stepped in. Gordon wrote that “ETH dominance is set up perfectly to go higher from here,” and drew a path that points toward the mid-teens if support holds.

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index sits at 17, only slightly above this year’s lowest of 15, and the market continues to react to the same pressures that have dominated the past week, including spot ETF outflows, reduced risk tolerance, and slower participation from long-term holders who have been taking profits during Bitcoin’s pullback from levels above six figures. Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Source: CoinMarketCap) Bitcoin trades around $94,000 and remains the anchor for overall sentiment, since many desks are using it to gauge how much liquidity remains in the system. The combination of risk reduction, macro caution, and position trimming has constrained rotation across mid-cap and small-cap tokens, and that restraint shapes today’s environment more than any single move in isolation. History shows that when sentiment drops into deep fear, traders tend to prioritize liquidity, stable turnover, and clear usage over speculation, and the current pattern fits that profile. Within this setting, Uniswap, Ethena, and Immutable stand out mainly because they are rising in a market that is otherwise heavy. Their moves offer a narrow window into how capital behaves when conditions are tight and how some assets can still climb when the wider market is constrained by risk aversion. Uniswap Holds Up Through Steady Protocol Usage Uniswap’s UNI is currently trading near $7.89 , up by about 5% in 24 hours, with liquidity and volume remaining steady relative to earlier sessions. Swaps continue to route through the protocol at a rate that supports consistent demand, and governance discussions around the Unification roadmap keep attention on its long-term structure without depending on short-term narratives. UNI’s move today fits the pattern of a token supported by ongoing usage rather than sudden shifts in sentiment. Ethena Benefits From Stabilizing Yield Structures Ethena’s ENA is now trading around $0.272 , up by roughly 3% in 24 hours, after several weeks shaped by adjustments to its synthetic dollar strategy and a more measured approach to leverage. Funding and open interest data point to a calmer backdrop for the protocol, and today’s rise appears linked to this stabilization rather than to new developments. ENA continues to function as a reference point for how much appetite remains for structured yield during a cautious period. Ethena is powering exchanges everywhere. The native liquidity pool on @reya_xyz 's perpetuals DEX will be fully allocated to USDe & sUSDe, pending final Reya governance approval. With this integration, Ethena assets will underlie liquidity for the 6th largest perp DEX by volume. pic.twitter.com/JjvgbEaLE2 — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) November 17, 2025 Immutable Gains on Steady Gaming Pipeline Activity Immutable’s IMX is near $0.383 , up about 2.5% in 24 hours, supported by progress within its gaming pipeline and continued interest from builders working on upcoming releases. The project’s earlier partnerships and tooling updates maintain attention even during weak sentiment days, and the increase in turnover from last week’s levels suggests that traders remain engaged with ecosystems anchored by active development rather than short-lived signs. Extreme Fear Shapes the Altcoin Season Outlook The market’s current posture is shaped far more by the environment than by the handful of tokens showing strength. With fear near its lowest point of the year and Bitcoin drifting around the $94,000 level, rotation remains muted because liquidity is being preserved rather than deployed. Conditions have tightened across leverage, funding, and derivatives activity, and that combination reduces the likelihood of broad rallies even when some tokens show resilience. This period of extreme fear shows how the market behaves when sentiment compresses and how emphasis shifts toward projects with clear usage or defined roadmaps. Movements in Uniswap, Ethena, and Immutable show that activity does not disappear entirely during these phases; yet, the lack of participation across most altcoins indicates that the altcoin season remains distant until liquidity and conviction return.

The team presented it as a way to make DeFi more accessible for everyday retail users, as it eliminates the need for crypto wallets or complex setups. Aave’s high-yield crypto app Aave Labs , like many other blockchain-affiliated companies, is taking advantage of the recent crypto boom to expand its appeal to mainstream customers. The announcement revealing the project’s plans to launch an app in Apple’s App Store came on Monday, and there is already a waitlist out for interested users. The Aave Labs team is positioning the upcoming app as a softer landing spot for outsiders of crypto, and opening up the waitlist for the app is its way of offering a version of its services without the buzzwords linked to crypto, which may be unfamiliar or off-putting to outsiders. Aave’s new product is reportedly similar to a savings account, with the only real difference being that it provides access to a higher yield. Other features that set it apart are that it allows users to earn a minimum of 5% interest on their holdings, and they can deposit money into a bank account or a debit card. Meanwhile, the product will use stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, as well as the Aave protocol. While DeFi protocols like Aave can be liable to greater risks than conventional banks, because of hacks and the fact that they have no government backing, Stani Kulechov, founder and CEO of Aave Labs, stressed to Fortune that the Aave protocol—and subsequently the forthcoming Aave app—is safe. Aave is one of the very few protocols to have never experienced an exploit in its five-year history. “There is a security in the actual market economics. And then there’s also security on the actual code basis,” Kulechov said, while highlighting how multiple security companies have audited the software. Kulechov claims to be a big fan of merging DeFi and Wall Street. He believes DeFi has been accessible to only “very savvy, professional users,” and that the “next step for DeFi is to bring more direct access for consumers.” Aave acquired a stablecoin company News of Aave’s high-yield app is coming weeks after it revealed that it had acquired the stablecoin company Stable Finance for an undisclosed sum. “They had more of a consumer DeFi experience that helped our team to move faster and improve our offering down the line,” said Kulechov. According to an official update shared on the project’s blog, the acquisition is supposed to help Aave Labs develop more consumer-focused products for DeFi. As part of the acquisition, Stable Finance founder Mario Baxter Cabrera will assume the role of Aave Labs’ Director of Product. The entire Stable Finance engineering team will also be absorbed by Aave Labs. The company says the move heralds the next phase Aave is entering, and it will draw from its experience in DeFi to deliver resilient institutional products like Horizon alongside accessible consumer products that will broaden access to on-chain finance for both individuals and institutions. “Mario and the Stable team have built unique technology supporting a seamless user experience that will help accelerate our consumer roadmap and extend the Aave protocol to new users,” Kulechov said.

Chart showing the decline in ETH price. Solana attracted attention with a 21.98% weekly loss, while Cardano's loss reached 21.39%.

The cryptocurrency market just witnessed a significant shift as Bitcoin price tumbles below the crucial $92,000 mark. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $91,978.09 on the Binance USDT market, sending ripples across the crypto community. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? The sudden Bitcoin price movement has left many investors wondering about the underlying causes. Market analysts point to several factors contributing to this downturn. First, increased regulatory scrutiny in major markets has created uncertainty. Second, profit-taking by large holders after recent gains has added selling pressure. Moreover, broader economic conditions continue to influence cryptocurrency valuations. How Does This Bitcoin Price Action Compare to Historical Patterns? Historical data reveals that Bitcoin price corrections often follow significant rallies. The current Bitcoin price movement aligns with typical market cycles where: Sharp increases often precede consolidation periods Market sentiment shifts rapidly based on global events Institutional activity can amplify price swings Therefore, understanding these patterns helps investors make informed decisions during volatile periods. What Should Investors Watch For Next? Monitoring key indicators becomes crucial when the Bitcoin price experiences volatility. Pay attention to trading volume spikes, as they often signal momentum changes. Additionally, watch for major support and resistance levels that could determine short-term direction. The current Bitcoin price sits near important technical levels that could dictate near-term movement. Practical Steps During Bitcoin Price Volatility When facing significant Bitcoin price movements, consider these actionable strategies: Diversify your portfolio across different assets Set clear stop-loss orders to manage risk Monitor market sentiment through reliable sources Avoid emotional trading decisions based on short-term fluctuations Looking Beyond Current Bitcoin Price Levels While the current Bitcoin price decline might concern some investors, experienced traders recognize these movements as natural market behavior. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged. However, market participants should remain vigilant and adapt their strategies accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions How low could Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact Bitcoin price bottoms is challenging, but technical analysis suggests key support levels around $88,000-$90,000 based on historical data and trading patterns. Should I buy during this Bitcoin price dip? Investment decisions depend on your risk tolerance and strategy. Some traders see dips as buying opportunities, while others prefer waiting for stability. How long might this Bitcoin price correction last? Corrections can vary from days to weeks. Monitor trading volume and market news for clues about duration. What factors most affect Bitcoin price? Regulatory news, institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions, and market sentiment significantly influence Bitcoin price movements. Is this Bitcoin price drop unusual? No, Bitcoin has experienced similar percentage drops throughout its history. Volatility remains characteristic of cryptocurrency markets.

While major tokens continue to move in sharp swings, a quieter narrative is taking shape beneath the surface. Investors are rediscovering low-cost early-stage projects, especially those linked to real-world assets. Among the tokens priced under 0.03 dollars, one name has gained consistent attention in recent weeks: RentStac (RNS) , a newcomer in the tokenized real estate sector that is drawing interest during a period of heightened volatility. Market Conditions Are Pushing Investors Toward Alternative Segments Large-cap turbulence often acts as a catalyst for rotations into smaller but structurally different projects. The latest wave of whale activity across the market has intensified this movement. As traders navigate uncertainty and search for assets less affected by rapid sentiment changes, interest is gradually shifting toward tokens that represent tangible economic activity rather than pure momentum. This trend has brought new visibility to the real-world asset category, which has expanded steadily throughout 2025. RentStac has become one of the more discussed names in this space thanks to its pricing structure, its model and its positioning within a sector growing quietly but consistently. What Makes RentStac Different From Typical Low-Cost Tokens RentStac is built around a straightforward idea. The platform transforms rental property income into a blockchain-based asset. Each property is placed into a dedicated SPV to ensure legal separation and transparent ownership. The income generated by these assets is then connected to the RNS token through staking pools and a revenue-based buyback system. This creates several advantages for holders: • exposure to rental income • long-term alignment with property performance • a staking system tied to real yield • a buyback model funded by operational revenue • governance features for future asset decisions While many low-priced tokens rely on speculative narratives, RentStac is positioning itself around the stability of traditional real estate combined with the efficiency of decentralized finance. A Sub 0.03 Dollar Presale Gaining Attention The RNS presale has set a total supply of 2 billion tokens, with a portion allocated to early buyers. The current price remains below 0.03 dollars, placing RentStac among the most accessible RWA tokens entering the market this year. The structure includes phased pricing and a bonus system designed to reward mid-range participation. Contributions starting from 500 dollars now receive a 70 percent token bonus. This has quickly become one of the drivers behind the rise in participation. As volatility continues to affect traditional crypto leaders, investors are increasingly looking for projects with lower entry prices and measured growth expectations. Security Measures Designed to Build Confidence One of the main concerns around asset-backed crypto projects involves reliability and transparency. RentStac has integrated several verification layers. Properties are held through legally compliant SPVs. Income streams are monitored through independent oracles. Fund movements operate under multi-signature security. The smart contracts have undergone external technical review, and a full audit is expected as development continues. The combination of proven real estate structures and on-chain data transparency is one of the reasons RentStac is being discussed as a more structured option in a market that has faced confidence challenges throughout the year. Token Utility and Long Term Design RNS is intended to serve as the central asset of the RentStac ecosystem. Its utility extends beyond simple asset representation. The token provides access to yield pools, governance participation and a deflationary system based on buybacks and burns. As rental revenue flows through the platform, a portion is allocated to purchasing tokens from the open market, which are then removed from circulation. This structure aligns the evolution of the token with broader project performance, a characteristic increasingly appreciated in a market that has become more selective. Updated ROI Breakdown With the Current Bonus Model At the current presale price of 0.025 dollars, a 500 dollar contribution allocates: • 20,000 RNS from the initial purchase • 14,000 RNS from the 70 percent bonus Total allocation: 34,000 RNS When RNS reaches 1 dollar, the position is valued at 34,000 dollars. This calculation reflects the current presale conditions and highlights how early pricing tiers affect potential upside once trading begins. Why RNS Is Emerging as the Best Sub 0.03 Dollar Option Right Now The RWA sector continues to grow as investors look for assets tied to real economic output rather than rapid shifts in sentiment. RentStac, with its mix of regulated property structures, on-chain distribution and a sub 0.03 dollar presale price, has positioned itself as one of the most watched projects in this range. As November progresses and volatility remains elevated, interest in early-stage tokens connected to real income streams is likely to continue. RentStac is currently among the projects gaining the most traction within this segment. The presale is live now.

While the market is consolidating within itself, some sophisticated investors are eyeing two different assets that may yield exceptional results in the next 4 years. One of these is a Layer 1 goliath with strong fundamentals, and the other is a unique DeFi presale venture with the promise of unparalleled expansion. For those with a crypto to buy list, the counterbalance of strong fundamentals and investment potential is a foundation for the next crypto bull run. Solana (Sol) With Fundamental Strength Reasserting Dominance Even when the Solana (SOL) market ecosystem shows weaknesses, it still leads the market in NFT revenue, DApp revenue, and DEX trading volume. Even with the market dips, Solana has still managed to hold a value more than $150. This shows confidence in the market from institutions or the holders and retail traders. Further proof of this strength is reflected in their Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) with $369 million cumulatively in 12 consecutive days of positive activity. This demand from institutions keeps the network in the top positions with key on-chain metrics. Solana is a strong position to buy with solid growth predicted. Solana aims for a target price of $180. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Presale Engineered for Explosive Returns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now undeniably the best cryptocurrency to buy for life-changing potential, while Solana is for proven performances. Presale success has become monumental, exceeding $18.75 million, while over 18,050 holders have come on board. Phase 6 is now 90% complete with the final opportunity to purchase tokens at $0.035. The next Phase 7 will increase the price to $0.040 which is around a 20% increase. Now is the final opportunity to acquire tokens at phase 6 pricing, making immediate action critical. Comprehensive Market Capture Through a Dual Lending Model One of the reasons Mutuum Finance stands out in the DeFi space is its pioneering dual-market lending ecosystem. The system serves all the DeFi users. The protocol runs Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools for high liquidity assets like ETH and USDT. This is where users automate the generation of yields and become capital efficient. At the same time, Mutuum Finance supports Peer-to-Peer (P2P) markets where users can substitute ‘traditional’ assets in the pools for exotic, illiquid tokens. The architectural flexibility of the dual-market lending system enables Mutuum Finance to gain and maintain lending niche and mainstream markets. That is one of the reasons why MUTM is one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in to retain a large addressable market and advanced DeFi utility. Invest Only with the Best in the Industry Mutuum Finance does not automate capital in loan pools and markets without audit verification of smart contracts. Mutuum Finance eliminates the capital loss problem by completing a CertiK audit which mitigates risk in the smart contract code by an independent 3rd party. Mutuum’s commitment to security and transparency sets it apart in a field of high risk projects where the majority operate without audits. That is why Mutuum is one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for the long term. It is one of the best crypto assets to buy and hold today. Position Your Portfolio for the Next Cycle The best approach to maximize profit potential by 2027 is to position in assets that show current momentum and assets that have the ability to change the future. Solana has the validated and high-performance basis, and Mutuum Finance has the ground-level potential for significant growth. As the presale for MUTM is approaching full subscription, the opportunity to buy at the best price has almost disappeared. Waiting too long might mean losing the opportunity to enter strategically in one of the smartest new crypto projects of the year.

This development represents a significant milestone for Solana investors and the broader crypto market, signaling growing institutional confidence in blockchain technology. What Does Fidelity’s SOL ETF Filing Actually Mean? The submission of the 8-A12B form indicates that Fidelity’s SOL ETF preparations are nearing completion. This specific filing is required for securities to become officially listed and traded on national exchanges. Therefore, the timing suggests we could see the SOL ETF launch relatively soon. This SOL ETF development follows the successful introduction of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. However, a Solana-focused ETF represents an even more sophisticated approach to cryptocurrency investment products. The move demonstrates that major financial institutions now view Solana as a legitimate asset class worthy of mainstream investment vehicles. Why Is This SOL ETF So Important for Investors? The potential benefits of this SOL ETF extend far beyond simple price appreciation. Here are the key advantages for different types of investors: Accessibility – Traditional investors can gain Solana exposure without managing private keys Regulatory protection – ETF structure provides SEC oversight and investor safeguards Tax efficiency – Simplified tax reporting compared to direct cryptocurrency ownership Liquidity – NYSE listing ensures high trading volume and tight spreads Moreover, this SOL ETF could attract billions in institutional capital that has been waiting for regulated exposure to Solana. The timing is particularly significant given Solana’s growing ecosystem and developer activity. What Challenges Remain for the SOL ETF Approval? While the 8-A12B filing is positive news, several hurdles still exist before traders can actually buy shares of the SOL ETF. The SEC must still provide final approval, and regulatory concerns about cryptocurrency custody and market manipulation need addressing. However, Fidelity’s established reputation and previous experience with cryptocurrency products suggest they’re well-positioned to navigate these challenges. Their existing Bitcoin ETF infrastructure provides a proven framework that could accelerate the SOL ETF approval process. How Could This SOL ETF Impact Solana’s Future? The introduction of a SOL ETF could fundamentally change how institutions and retail investors interact with Solana. We’ve seen similar effects with Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted over $50 billion in assets within months of launch. This SOL ETF represents more than just another investment product – it’s validation of Solana’s technology and potential. The network effects could drive increased development, user adoption, and ultimately, greater decentralization of the Solana ecosystem. Conclusion: A New Era for Solana Investment Fidelity’s SOL ETF filing marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency adoption. As traditional finance continues embracing blockchain assets, Solana stands to benefit significantly from increased institutional interest and capital inflows. This development could potentially open floodgates for similar products targeting other major cryptocurrencies. Frequently Asked Questions What is an 8-A12B form? The 8-A12B form is a registration document required for securities to be listed and traded on national exchanges like NYSE. Fidelity’s filing indicates their SOL ETF is in the final preparation stages. When will the SOL ETF be available for trading? While no exact date is confirmed, the 8-A12B filing typically occurs shortly before launch. However, final SEC approval is still required before trading can begin. How is a SOL ETF different from buying Solana directly? A SOL ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Solana’s price through traditional brokerage accounts without dealing with cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, or private key management. What are the advantages of investing through a SOL ETF? Key advantages include regulatory protection, tax simplicity, institutional-grade custody, and accessibility through traditional investment platforms. Will the SOL ETF pay dividends? Most cryptocurrency ETFs don’t pay traditional dividends. Returns primarily come from price appreciation of the underlying asset, though staking rewards could potentially be distributed. How might this affect Solana’s price? Historically, ETF approvals have correlated with increased demand and positive price action, though past performance doesn’t guarantee future results.

Zhao described the issue of the possible refund as “delicate,” adding that he already feels grateful for the leniency shown in the case. He emphasized the importance of balancing ambition, justice, and appreciation for what one already has. CZ Hasn’t Requested a Refund Yet Zhao clarified that he has not submitted a formal request to U.S. authorities but does not rule out the possibility. In November 2023, Binance admitted to violating anti-money-laundering laws. As part of the settlement, Zhao stepped down as CEO, and the company accepted a $4.3 billion penalty. A U.S. court approved the deal in February 2024. Prosecutors said Binance’s actions were intentional and posed risks to the financial system. Under the agreement, an independent law firm will monitor the exchange’s compliance for the next five years. Before the Settlement: How Binance Rose to Global Dominance Before the legal troubles emerged, Binance grew into the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in just a few years. Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, the platform became known for low fees, vast token listings, and rapid feature expansion. This explosive growth brought global attention — and eventually, increased regulatory scrutiny. By 2021, U.S. authorities began examining Binance’s compliance practices, AML controls, and customer monitoring systems. These investigations would later form the foundation of the record-setting settlement that changed both the company’s direction and CZ’s public role.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 20:00:31

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-recorded-716-whale-transactions-heres-what-happened/,"XRP’s on-chain activity has entered a more active phase, with data confirming 716 transactions valued at over $1 million each, marking the highest count in four months. This level of concentrated movement among large holders is significant because it reflects a clear escalation in capital deployment across high-value wallets. Market participant and analyst Ali Martinez reported these on-chain activities. $XRP just recorded 716 whale transactions, each worth more than $1 million. This is the highest count in four months! pic.twitter.com/w6zptU2BLC — Ali (@ali_charts) November 16, 2025 Market participants emphasize strategic positioning Observers who follow whale behavior closely have described this pattern as coordinated movement rather than isolated transfers. They highlight the consistency and timing of the transactions, noting that major wallets generally increase activity when preparing for shifts in liquidity conditions. Discussions surrounding potential ETF inflows, tightening supply on centralized exchanges, and increased institutional use cases, such as ODL, were referenced as possible reasons for the cluster of high-value transactions. Other community members added that the activity aligns with ongoing ETF interest, suggesting that larger players may be positioning for expected demand tied to expanding institutional access to XRP. Recent ETF performance adds further context Supporting this outlook is the recent performance of the newly launched Canary Capital spot XRP ETF (XRPC). According to a Times Tabloid report dated the 13th, the fund began trading with a notable start, recording more than $916,000 in volume in its first thirty minutes. This early activity was viewed as a strong signal of initial demand, setting a tone for what has quickly become one of the more prominent ETF launches of the year within the digital asset sector. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The growing interest does not appear isolated. Additional spot XRP ETFs from Bitwise, CoinShares, and 21Shares are expected to launch in November, a sequence that may further expand institutional pathways into XRP. This development adds another layer of relevance to the increase in whale transactions, as significant holders often act ahead of structural market catalysts such as new regulated investment products. Outlook as liquidity dynamics evolve The alignment of increased whale activity with expanding ETF availability presents an environment where demand from larger participants could continue to rise. While on-chain data alone does not confirm intent, the scale and timing of these transfers, combined with the accelerating ETF landscape . This indicates that the market is entering a phase where institutional positioning may become more visible. Continued monitoring of liquidity, ETF inflows, and exchange supply trends will be essential as these factors increasingly shape XRP’s near-term structure and behavior.

The development marks Trump’s entry into one of the world’s most exclusive tourism markets. It also marks a shift in how property deals can be financed, giving investors the chance to buy into the project before the resort is built.

Investors to Buy Into Trump’s New Maldives Resort Through Tokenization The project will be situated a short distance from Malé and feature approximately 80 beach and overwater villas, catering to high-end travelers. Eric Trump, executive vice president of The Trump Organization, said the Maldives opening represents a new chapter for the family’s global portfolio, adding that the tokenization model introduces a fresh way for investors to participate in a resort from day one. Dar Global CEO Ziad El Chaar said the company plans to keep expanding tokenized real estate structures after this first launch. The announcement lands at a time when tokenized assets are gaining momentum. Data from rwa.xyz shows the sector’s market capitalization at around $3.52 billion, with monthly active addresses up more than 53% over the past month and total holders rising above 165,000.

Tokenized Property Market Heats Up Globally, And the Trump Organization Is Getting In Early Trump’s real estate ventures have been drawing closer to blockchain technology throughout the year. In April, the company said buyers would be able to pay in cryptocurrency for units in its $1 billion tower in Dubai, a project including a branded hotel, residences, a private clubhouse, and a pool planned to be one of the tallest in the world.

Dubai has been positioning itself as a center for digital asset activity, though it has also faced scrutiny over the role of its property market in moving illicit money. Still, the city continues to court blockchain firms, and its property regulator in May launched Prypco Mint , the first government-backed tokenized real estate platform. The program seeks to tokenize as much as $16 billion in Dubai property by 2033 through fractional ownership recorded on the XRP Ledger. The Trump family’s digital expansion also includes a real estate-themed blockchain game expected to debut this year , designed by longtime associate Bill Zanker and built with mechanics inspired by mobile city-building titles. The game follows earlier ventures involving NFTs, memecoins, and crypto-linked media initiatives. At the same time, financial authorities globally are pushing deeper into tokenized finance. Singapore’s central bank is preparing a pilot for tokenized government bills settled with a central bank digital currency, describing asset-backed tokens as past the experimental phase but still early in broader adoption. The MAS plans to pilot the issuance of tokenized MAS bills that will be settled using central bank digital currency (CBDC). #Singapore #Crypto https://t.co/2XyVwbgIFp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 13, 2025 Europe is testing tokenized sovereign debt and exploring permanent frameworks for digital trading systems under its DLT Pilot Regime. Institutional interest is rising as well. A recent study from State Street found that digital assets make up about 7% of current portfolios , a figure projected to double within three years.

The updated legislation removes earlier restrictions tied to the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC), marking a significant shift in how digital assets can be used nationwide. What Has Changed Under the New Digital Asset Rules? The Law “On Amendments and Additions Concerning Artificial Intelligence and Digitalization” establishes a fresh regulatory model for unsecured digital assets. Previously, cryptocurrencies could legally circulate only within the AIFC, but they are now permitted across the entire country, provided participants comply with Kazakhstan’s national legislation. One of the most notable changes is the removal of the requirement for miners to sell most of their mined cryptocurrency through the AIFC exchange. Miners are no longer obligated to withdraw or liquidate assets via a specific platform, giving them greater flexibility in how they handle their operations. Broader Legal Recognition for Crypto and Mining Cryptocurrency mining is now officially permitted for both legal entities and sole proprietors. Importantly, it is not considered an activity related to organizing digital asset circulation, reducing regulatory burdens for miners. The law also lifts the previous ban on issuing and circulating unsecured digital assets. Licensed cryptocurrency exchanges will now be allowed to operate within Kazakhstan, creating a regulated market for exchange services. The amendments take effect 60 days after their first official publication. Officials say the expanded legal environment should encourage more transparency among investors. Tokayev noted that only around 5% of market participants were fully compliant with AIFC rules, while the rest operated outside official regulation. Kazakhstan Introduces New AI Law Alongside Crypto Reforms In parallel with the crypto reforms, Tokayev signed a separate law focused on artificial intelligence. The legislation sets core principles for AI systems, including transparency, legality, fairness, data protection, and accountability for system owners and operators. A new content-labeling mechanism will help identify AI-generated products and reduce the risk of manipulative or misleading material. The law also prohibits AI technologies that use subconscious influence or gather personal data illegally. Authorities have announced plans to build a legal framework for a national AI platform designed to test and develop models in a controlled environment. Kazakhstan recently signed a memorandum of intent with Nvidia to acquire $2 billion in AI chips, emphasizing the country’s growing ambitions in digital and technological innovation.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-17 20:09:44

Many traders don’t fully understand the mechanics behind why futures liquidated positions can create such dramatic market movements. Essentially, futures trading allows investors to use leverage, meaning they can control large positions with relatively small amounts of capital. However, when prices move against these leveraged positions, exchanges automatically close them to prevent losses from exceeding the trader’s initial margin. This creates a domino effect where each futures liquidated position adds selling pressure, potentially triggering more liquidations. Protecting Your Portfolio From Future Liquidations Given the recent wave of futures liquidated positions, smart traders are reevaluating their risk management strategies. Here are essential protective measures: Use lower leverage ratios to withstand market volatility Set stop-loss orders at reasonable levels Diversify your portfolio across different assets Monitor margin requirements closely during high volatility Keep extra collateral available for margin calls Remember, the recent futures liquidated events serve as a powerful reminder that proper risk management isn’t optional in cryptocurrency trading.
