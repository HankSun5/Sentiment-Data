With the blockchain industry evolving rapidly, selecting the right investments can make all the difference between riding the next wave of innovation or missing out on game-changing opportunities. This week’s top picks include projects that are reshaping global finance, decentralized infrastructure, and Web3 applications. Qubetics ($TICS) is revolutionizing cross-border payments, ensuring fast, seamless, and cost-effective global transactions. Meanwhile, Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is building the decentralized internet, aiming to replace centralized cloud infrastructure. And then there’s SUI, a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain that’s been making waves with massive gains and bullish market sentiment. With SUI currently trading at $3.29, showing strong momentum and liquidity inflows, it’s becoming one of the hottest cryptos of the week. As institutional adoption increases, ICP’s Web3 innovations are positioning it as a long-term winner. Meanwhile, Qubetics’ presale has raised $13.2 million, making it one of the most anticipated blockchain projects of the year. Qubetics: Cross-Border Transactions Simplified Qubetics is bringing a new era of seamless, low-cost international payments. Traditional remittance services are plagued by high fees, slow transactions, and hidden costs. Qubetics’ blockchain-based system eliminates intermediaries, enabling users to send money instantly, securely, and affordably. With TICS tokens, businesses and individuals can execute real-time cross-border transactions , making Qubetics a game-changer in financial services. Whether you’re a freelancer working with global clients, a business paying international suppliers, or an everyday user sending money abroad, Qubetics ensures that your funds arrive faster and at a fraction of traditional banking costs. Understanding Qubetics’ Cross-Border Payment System Qubetics’ payment network is designed to work across multiple fiat and digital currencies, giving users flexibility while ensuring compliance with international regulations. Smart contracts automate transactions, reducing errors and ensuring transparent, trustless payments. This is especially crucial for businesses looking to streamline supply chain payments, payroll processing, and B2B settlements. With 479 million tokens sold and over 20,300 holders, Qubetics has already gained massive traction. Its efficient cross-border system will help unbanked populations gain access to financial services, opening doors for economic inclusion worldwide. Internet Computer Protocol: The Future of Web3 Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is rewriting the rules of the internet. Instead of relying on centralized cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud, ICP enables fully decentralized applications (dApps) to run directly on the blockchain. Unlike most blockchains, which still require centralized servers for certain operations, ICP aims to replace traditional web infrastructure, offering a trustless, autonomous, and censorship-resistant alternative. This means users can host websites, run applications, and store data securely on the blockchain, reducing reliance on Big Tech monopolies. The real value of ICP lies in its ability to provide scalable, low-cost decentralized hosting. Imagine a world where social media platforms, online marketplaces, and financial applications operate entirely on a blockchain, free from corporate control. That’s what ICP is building, making it one of the most important long-term investments in crypto. SUI: Bullish Momentum and Market Potential SUI is making headlines in the crypto world with its strong price movement and growing ecosystem. Currently trading at $3.29, SUI has shown remarkable resilience, maintaining a tight trading range between $3.00 and $4.00. One of the biggest reasons behind SUI’s bullish momentum is the recent launch of tokenized funds on its network, attracting new liquidity and institutional interest. As more financial products migrate to SUI, the demand for its native token continues to rise. However, SUI faces a critical resistance level at $3.50. If it breaks past this price, analysts believe it could enter a strong upward trend. On the flip side, failure to hold above $3.00 could see a retest of lower support levels around $2.34. Still, its growing adoption and integration into major DeFi projects make it one of the top cryptos to watch this week. Conclusion This week, Qubetics , ICP, and SUI are proving to be some of the most promising investment opportunities in the crypto market. Qubetics is disrupting cross-border payments, Internet Computer Protocol is pioneering the decentralized internet, and SUI is gaining momentum with institutional adoption. The innovation behind these projects is not just theoretical—it’s being implemented and refined every day. With real-world use cases, partnerships, and growing adoption, the potential upside remains significant. Investors who position themselves early in these emerging technologies could benefit from substantial gains as adoption increases. As blockchain technology continues to redefine global finance and digital infrastructure, these three projects are well-positioned to be major players in the next crypto bull run. Whether you’re looking for long-term growth, innovative use cases, or explosive short-term gains, these cryptos deserve a spot in your portfolio.

The token associated with both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has increased and is actively used in the cryptocurrency market. Blockchain data firm CryptoQuant noted that the supply expanded, which led to the upgrade. At first, stablecoins exhibited more activity on the Ethereum blockchain. However, the trend of adoption has shifted over time to select XRPL, reflecting the relatively cheaper fees of the transactions. Adoption and exchange listings The credibility of RLUSD is boosted through multiple listings on the exchange platforms. The stablecoin has recently been integrated into the Margex trading platform that offers high leverage trading. Also, an asset under NYDFS got a listing on Zero Hash, making it more accessible in addition to its expansion. Another key milestone was RLUSD’s integration with the popular financial application Revolut. These factors have enabled the expansion of the stablecoin supply and an expansion into a variety of financial industries. RLUSD may expand across its networks. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has hinted at plans to integrate the RLUSD into the Cardano blockchain. If successful, this could increase its accessibility. Prior to RLUSD’s official launch, Ripple performed test minting on Ethereum and the XRPL in August. A push towards it has been seen recently as it costs less than Ethereum in terms of transaction fees. Currently, the XRPL has 37.4 million RLUSD, while Ethereum’s RLUSD supply has fallen to 83.3 million. More adoption of RLUSD in the XRPL has also improved the steadiness of the XRP market. This has impacted the price pattern of altcoins since their use and demand for stablecoins are high. As of the time of writing, XRP was around $2.64, registering a 3% decline in the last 24 hours. According to Coingecko, the market cap of RLUSD currently stands at $108 million. Analysts predict that the RLUSD growth will boost XRP prices in the long run. The continued adoption of XRP due to factors such as RLUSD, amongst other factors, has seen the token anticipated to hit $250 by 2026. Analysts have hinted that the whale movements could trigger the next rallying points in prices.

Investors are moved toward emerging digital assets that offer both high returns and practical uses because Bitcoin's market control has hit its maximum. A Solana ETF approval by regulatory bodies has the potential to serve as the key driver for cryptocurrency adoption in combination with emerging market players like Remittix. 1. Solana ETF Approval Could Be As Early As March With Altcoins Like Remittix Set To Explode As BTC Dominance Tops Out 2. Solana ETF Approval: A Catalyst for Market Dynamics 3. Remittix: Bridging Crypto and Traditional Finance 4. Conclusion Solana ETF Approval: A Catalyst for Market Dynamics The acceptance of Solana ETF can transform the current cryptocurrency market dynamic. The blockchain network Solana stands among the most desired platforms because of its efficient transaction processing and affordable costs. A review from analysts indicates that Solana ETFs may receive SEC approval until March 2025 as the regulatory environment now welcomes cryptocurrency investment products. A potential regulatory approval will enable institutional investment in Solana thus enabling growth in market liquidity and price consistency and improved credibility with traditional financial institutions. Bitcoin ETFs succeeded in paving the way for crypto adoption so authorities now focus on approving the Solana blockchain for regulatory validation besides Bitcoin. An ETF focused on Solana investment would enable both institutional and retail investors to join traditional financial markets thus integrating cryptocurrencies much deeper. The proposed market shift will favor alternative digital currencies which provide functional advantages particularly Remittix. Remittix: Bridging Crypto and Traditional Finance Digital currencies have expanded during recent years but many people across the world still do not have access to traditional banking services. An estimate from the World Bank shows that 1.4 billion adults across the world lack bank accounts. A substantial number of unbanked people still possess mobile devices that let them execute digital wallet payments alongside cryptocurrency operations. The solution comes from the Remittix (RTX) system. Remittix resolves the key obstacle to cryptocurrency adoption through its capability to turn cryptocurrency into FIAT money to allow effortless transactions. Remittix enables users to turn cryptocurrency into FIAT allowing bank deposits directly from anywhere across the world through a banking intermediary-free system. Remittix provides critical support to users in developing economies who want to take advantage of mobile and crypto usage opportunities despite restricted banking options. Through its platform Remittix enables users to preserve cryptocurrency's native characteristics of anonymous asset management together with systems of modern finance. The future demonstrates credit payments to freelancers in Africa through crypto which then automatically transforms to FIAT currency and funds instantly reach them without depending on centralized banking services. Remittix is currently creating such a future. Currently in its presale stage, Remittix offers an opportunity for early investors to acquire RTX tokens before they hit major exchanges. The Remittix presale aims to raise $36 million with a structured tokenomics model designed for long-term stability and value appreciation . The RTX presale enables investors to acquire tokens at reduced prices that may produce substantial profits after the token launches successfully in the market. Early investors obtain dual advantages by participating in the development of a project that intends to change worldwide payment systems while earning financial gains. Remittix establishes leadership in crypto-finance through its solution which combats high remittance fees while cutting down transaction speeds and granting users FIAT money access. The current financial sector evolves because Remittix and similar initiatives take a leadership role in this changing environment. The platform charges lower fees when sending money than Western Union and PayPal do. Conclusion Illuminating financial developments through the Solana ETF regulatory verification provides the perfect moment to study new answers such as Remittix. Taking part in the RTX presale places you ahead of others in witnessing an economic transformation where crypto advantages align with banking systems. As the financial world embraces decentralized finance, Remittix is a critical player in bridging the gap between crypto and mainstream finance. Become a part of a movement that promotes financial inclusion, empowers people globally, and reimagines the future of payments by joining the Remittix community today.

January 17, 2025, saw the launch of the $Trump meme, and it took not just the crypto ecosystem but also the world of trad-fi by storm, onboarding almost one million Trump loyalists to crypto, with 50% of holders being first-time crypto users. Trump, the gift that keeps on giving According to the official meme site , those eligible for the airdrop can claim three $Trump coins until March 1 for purchasing official merchandise. The claim page includes a message informing participants that the airdrop is Trump’s way of rewarding those who showed him love by buying a Trump product. Those eligible for the token claim can redeem their rewards through Crossmint; all they need to do is input the email address they used for their Trump product purchase. Every mail gets the same allocation regardless of how many products were purchased. The airdrop seems to be a part of a wider strategy from the Trump team to parlay holders of the $Trump meme into an active crypto community the site is aiming will be the “Biggest, Strongest Crypto Community the World has ever experienced!” The $Trump meme was a mixed bag for the crypto ecosystem Solana became the go-to chain for memecoins in this crypto cycle thanks to its rapid capabilities. However, the network has also led to significant losses for the newer, less experienced players, and that was before the POTUS, arguably the most powerful man on earth right now, decided to get fully involved with crypto. It all started with Trump endorsing crypto during his campaign. Then, he launched the official $Trump meme on the weekend before his inauguration, which made profits for some and losses for many. Since the meme launched, there have been mixed reactions regarding its impact on the ecosystem, with the demerits seemingly outweighing the merits. One camp believes the $Trump meme has helped the crypto space gain significant exposure and attract new users. Nevermind that the coin lacks a real use case or intrinsic value. For the most part, they are right; the meme did expose the larger mass of otherwise non-crypto-oriented noobs to crypto, Solana, and memes. However, those new users have been getting the undiluted experience of market volatility, which is also thanks to Trump and his memes. Those who have problems with the $Trump meme have accused it of draining liquidity from the space as those who made profits from investing cashed in their earnings. This extracted billions in liquidity from other memecoins and altcoins is making an already hard-to-trade market even more difficult to navigate. There is also the volatility linked to the meme’s hype, which saw its market cap surge to $14.5 billion at peak hours before crashing by about 70%. Since the launch, the space has seen a new wave of celebrity memes, including one from Trump’s wife, Melania. There have also been rumors of other presidents following Trump’s lead to create a memecoin like Faustin-Archange Touadéra, who reportedly launched $CAR. Critics also blame the $Trump meme for seemingly encouraging market manipulation at a crucial time for the space as it seeks mass adoption. The immediate liquidity extraction from the recently launched LIBRA meme backed by Argentine president Javier Milei does not help matters. Things have gotten so bad that one user even mused out loud, asking if Gary Gensler’s combative SEC had not been saving us from ourselves before.

Among them, Dogecoin and the newly introduced TRUMP coin are garnering attention. The predictions for Dogecoin's value look promising this quarter, influenced by a shift in market dynamics. Meanwhile, a fresh player named Panshibi is stepping into the spotlight, hoping to capitalize on the buoyant sentiment surrounding meme coins. This innovative project could serve as a beacon for investors searching for new opportunities. Tracing the Journey of Dogecoin Since its inception in 2013, Dogecoin has been a hallmark of meme coin culture. Initially a tongue-in-cheek creation, it now stands as a testament to the potential and volatility of crypto investments. Although meme coins might not offer the prolonged profitability seen in DeFi, Dogecoin continues to captivate with its ambitious goal of reaching the dollar mark. Attracting a loyal community is essential for sustaining Dogecoin's upward momentum. However, competition from platforms like Panshibi (SHIBI) can challenge its market dominance, pushing Dogecoin to explore new strategies for retention and growth. Could Dogecoin's Price Breakthrough Hit $1? The possibility of Dogecoin making substantial gains is increasingly plausible, particularly in light of the crypto market's recent trends and regulatory changes. With potential ETF approvals for Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin and Ripple, we might witness a more favorable trading environment facilitated by the SEC. While the odds are favorable, the journey to a dollar won't be without challenges. Rivalry with promising tokens like Panshibi could make the road to massive profits an exhilarating yet uncertain ride. Exploring Panshibi's Potential Panshibi is setting the stage for what could be a game-changing debut in the meme coin universe. This new venture seeks to leverage the current excitement for meme coins, suggesting an enticing opportunity for those eager to explore SHIBI tokens. Departing from the conventional launch approach, Panshibi will first appear on centralized exchanges, a strategic move expected to boost initial demand and stabilize its market presence. As the tokens transition to decentralized exchanges, the groundwork for its competitive stance in the crypto hierarchy will already be laid. The anticipated growth of Panshibi could spell considerable gains, with the prospect of a remarkable surge making early participants the likely beneficiaries. Seizing the Opportunity with Panshibi Presale While Dogecoin's trajectory draws widespread attention, the unfolding Panshibi presale promises compelling returns. Currently, in stage four, each SHIBI coin is priced attractively at $0.005, presenting a golden chance to lock in a significant ROI ahead of the launch.

Could Panshibi Actually Hit The 20x People Are Saying?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/why-will-doge-achieve-40-in-30d-could-panshibi-actually-hit-the-20x-people-are-saying,"The meme coin market is up and bustling already, with many of the top meme coins climbing to fresh gains. The newly-launched TRUMP coin nudged Dogecoin to new highs, and the Dogecoin price prediction is looking good for Q1. There's so much good cheer among meme coins, especially with the DeFi sector still reeling from financial changes in the past few weeks. We have a new meme coin project, Panshibi , looking to ride the momentum of the positive atmosphere to new profits. It's a new meme project filled with opportunities for fresh gains in 2025. The question is if DOGE and the SHIBI project will deliver their expected gains and which is the more profitable investment. Get familiar with Dogecoin! Dogecoin launched in 2013, offering the occasional laugh in the crypto-verse and a welcome relief from all the hard trading. Over time, the meme culture has eroded, but Dogecoin has maintained its top meme coin spot. Sure, the meme coin sector doesn't bear as much longevity for profits as the DeFi sector, but the short bursts on the average meme coin could make millionaires out of ordinary holders. The Dogecoin price prediction has the token setting its sights on the dollar mark, but so muchstands in the way. Convincing the meme enthusiasts is one thing, and getting them to be loyal supporters of the Dogecoin project is another. It gets even more difficult when there's a rather appealing platform like Panshibi (SHIBI) lurking. Could Dogecoin have one more trick up its sleeves for profits? Dogecoin price prediction: $1 looking likely? The Dogecoin price could be onto something special, especially as the token is sensitive to meme coin surges, as well as Bitcoin's uptrends. Dogecoin is about to receive another boon, this time from the SEC, as the DOGE ETF petitions are getting ‘high odds of approval’ from concerned parties. Analysts have deduced that the commission might be amenable to approving the launch of ETFs for Litecoin, Ripple, and Dogecoin later in 2025. The SEC is under new leadership, and crypto trading will be a lot freer, even for institutional traders. With the atmosphere being so positive around Dogecoin, the dreams of a dollar surge are almost feasible. However, it won't be a smooth ride there. The Dogecoin price prediction will have to contend with the Panshibi prospects. Just how much fun will that be? Panshibi profits explained! The Panshibi platform is an embodiment of excellent features, and the new project will be looking to take full advantage of the positive disposition towards memes in the past few weeks. Meme coin launches are a reminder of the prospects of becoming millionaires; you don't want to miss out on SHIBI tokens. Why? The Panshibi launch won't take place as the regular token launch does. The Devs have decided to have the tokens launched on centralized exchanges before they get to the DEXs. The reason is simple too. With the SHIBI tokens available to institutionalized traders, there will be a high demand for the Panshibi coins. And with that initial spike, the SHIBI price will be off to a flying start. By the time the tokens get to the DEXs, Panshibi will already be stable enough to compete at the top of the crypto ranks. From all indications, the Panshibi launch will see the token make a 145,000% surge for its users. And you know who will be the biggest winners? The early presale buyers. Join them today–get your SHIBI tokens before they launch! Panshibi presale: SHIBI up for grabs! The Dogecoin price prediction has a lot of gravitas, but clearly not as much as the incoming Panshibi launch. The presale is ongoing and in stage 4 in less than four weeks. Each SHIBI coin costs $0.005, and with that, you still have a chance at about 400% ROI before launch.

According to a report by The Perryman Group, most of the industry is concentrated in twelve states, with Texas being the largest contributor. Economic and Social Benefits The study shows that Bitcoin mining in Texas generates approximately $1.7 billion in gross product and creates more than 12,200 jobs, including those linked to utility-related activities. Other major states include Georgia which gives $316.8 million in annual gross product and 2,300 jobs, and New York with $225.9 million and 1,600 respectively. Bitcoin miners also play a role in local communities. Mining companies often make charitable contributions and sponsor local events. They also invest in community infrastructure which helps to improve the living standards. Additionally, these entities provide specialized training programs and prioritize hiring a diverse workforce. Due to their flexible power consumption, Bitcoin miners can adjust their energy usage during times of grid stress hence helping to stabilize demand. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), their predictable demand for power aids in energy planning and supports investments in power generation and transmission. Despite the economic benefits, the industry faces regulatory challenges at both the state and federal levels. Critics have raised concerns about the environmental impact of its high energy consumption, leading some states like New York to introduce restrictions on mining. At the federal level, lawmakers have debated potential taxation policies on mining operations and environmental reporting requirements. However, many firms have adopted strategies to reduce emissions and use renewable energy. Some are repurposing excess energy, such as using methane from oil fields or heat from mining operations for other uses like greenhouse farming. The United States’ Appeal and Trump’s Vision The U.S. is an attractive location for Bitcoin mining due to low-cost energy, particularly in states like Texas, Washington, and Wyoming, which offer some of the cheapest electricity rates in the country. U.S. President Donald Trump has also expressed strong support for the Bitcoin mining industry. During his 2024 presidential campaign, he stated his goal to make the nation the “crypto capital of the planet” and highlighted mining’s importance for national security. Trump has advocated for building power plants specifically for mining operations using fossil fuels and nuclear energy to support the sector. His vision includes ensuring all the remaining Bitcoin is mined in the U.S., with a focus on strengthening the nation’s role in crypto and AI.

Among these contenders, Remittix has surged in popularity by aiming to transform the colossal $190 trillion global payments sector. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI focuses on AI-driven blockchain, and Pluto Chain seeks to expand DeFi solutions to a broader user base. Remittix’s core offering merges decentralized finance with everyday banking networks, enabling users to send fiat payments worldwide using crypto. By tackling high fees and slow transaction times, Remittix endeavors to bring cross-border remittances into a new era. This article explores how each project competes for the title of Best Crypto Presale and why Remittix appears poised to dominate in 2025. Why Remittix Is the Best Crypto Presale Remittix has already raised over $12 million in its presale, selling more than 461 million tokens (70% of supply) at a current price of $0.0599. Such traction underscores substantial investor confidence as participants recognize the platform’s potential to reimagine global remittances. With PayFi as its flagship innovation, Remittix promises instant crypto-to-fiat conversions for over 50 crypto pairs and 30 fiat currencies. By minimizing hidden fees, Remittix allows a sender in Europe to transfer funds to a recipient in Asia without the recipient even knowing crypto was involved. Imagine an expatriate in the U.K. sending rent money back home with no bulky forex charges and no protracted delays. This straightforward mechanism is among the reasons many deem Remittix the Best Crypto Presale, especially in regions where up to 60% of the population remains unbanked. Looking ahead, Remittix has a “Remittix Pay” API so merchants can accept crypto and settle in fiat instantly. That approach could revolutionize global commerce by uniting blockchain technology with established banking rails. If Remittix captures even a fraction of the $190 trillion payments market, its token valuation may experience exponential gains, rewarding early participants in this ambitious presale. Beyond standard remittances, Remittix envisions bridging untapped corridors in Africa, Asia, and South America, areas often overlooked by major financial institutions. In these markets, a stable way to move money can drastically improve lives, and Remittix’s solution offers speed, accessibility, and cost efficiency. The project’s roadmap anticipates multiple exchange listings, further fueling the consensus that it’s the Best Crypto Presale to watch right now. Lightchain AI: AI-Driven Potential Lightchain AI Blockchain Lightchain AI prioritizes blockchain-based artificial intelligence, aiming to streamline data-intensive tasks and reduce gas costs for dApp developers. Interest has soared, with the project reportedly raising over $15.5 million, according to news outlets . This model could entice enterprises looking to deploy machine-learning workloads on a decentralized network. However, adoption timelines remain uncertain; larger corporations may tread carefully around on-chain AI solutions, given compliance and scalability questions. Even so, Lightchain AI’s success in the presale phase highlights market demand for forward-thinking technology. Pluto Chain: Another DeFi Player Pluto Chain, on the other hand, aims to create user-centric decentralized finance protocols that simplify staking, yield farming, and governance. Its roadmap is outlined in the Pluto Chain’s (PLUTO) Review , and the token’s availability on Coinbase underscores its public accessibility. Despite its growing user base, Pluto Chain competes in a crowded DeFi space populated by established giants. While it could find success through niche offerings or strategic partnerships, its overall market impact may be overshadowed by large-scale payment transformations like the one Remittix is pushing. Conclusion As the hunt for the Best Crypto Presale intensifies, Remittix, Lightchain AI, and Pluto Chain each bring unique value propositions. Pluto Chain zeroes in on DeFi simplification, while Lightchain AI banks on the rising intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Yet the most immediate real-world use case for global remittances is dominated by Remittix, which has already secured significant funding and a clear roadmap to tap the $190 trillion payments market. With over $12 million raised and more than 70% of tokens sold at $0.0599, Remittix stands ready to merge blockchain capabilities with everyday banking systems. Its “Remittix Pay” API, multi-fiat support, and drive for financial inclusion position it as a tangible solution for millions worldwide. That conviction is reinforced by multiple analyst opinions on Remittix , which highlight Remittix’s market-shifting potential. If the project delivers on its PayFi vision, Remittix could redefine cross-border transfers and simultaneously benefit those underserved by traditional finance. Given these factors, many analysts see it as the Best Crypto Presale of the year one that might shape the future of global finance.

Bitcoin dropped to $92k and ETH followed suit with a drop to a monthly low of nearly $2,500. However, innovation and resilience have spotlighted two dark horses that defied the trend: Panshibi and Cardano. Despite the prevailing market uncertainty, Cardano's price has held its ground with an 12% gain in the past week. Panshibi is also riding the wave of the meme coin mania in its ongoing presale. The Panda-themed altcoin and its innovative AI appeal have raked in close to $1M in its ongoing presale. But can ADA break through key resistance levels, and will SHIBI sustain its meteoric rise? Let’s dive into the market dynamics shaping this frenzy. Panshibi: New AI meme coin gem soars to new ATH in presale. While the market reels, Panshibi, the innovative AI-powered meme coin, has dominated the crypto world with its high-demand presale and innovative meme revolution. Currently in Stage 4, its presale has gone far and wide, with almost $1M raised which reflects strong investors' confidence. The reasons are crystal clear! Panshibi has emerged as the real ""meme killer"" with its well-thought-out approach to upending the hype-fueled meme culture. First, Panshibi is creating an inclusive community that features an ingenious blend of meme virality, the lovable Panda theme and Asian heritage. Secondly, Panshibi's uniqueness and potential transcend its predecessors. It boasts an excellent real-world use case with artificial intelligence and social fi mechanics. This technological advancement helps users enjoy a gamified experience and long-term value. Then, there's the part where every user is rewarded for doing the bare minimum. Token holders earn a whopping passive income by staking their tokens and earning up to 1200% annually. This, and other mouthwatering rewards, had investors scrambling to participate. As with Shiba, timing is everything, and Panshibi is currently riding the positive sentiment around AI cryptos and meme coins. Lastly, Panshibi has a solid plan for the future. Roadmap activities like the NFT launch, staking platform development, and tier-one listing highlight its long-term focus on sustainability. Grayscale's ETF pursuit sent Cardano's price flying. Can it reach $1 this month? Cardano has been on an electrifying ride since the year started. After ending 2024 on a bullish note with increased whale accumulation and a 283% surge from September lows, Cardano again rode on the bullish sentiment with excellent gains this year. Technical analysis suggests that Cardano may be poised for a major breakout. Elliott Wave theory points to a completed corrective wave at approximately $0.54, aligning with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. This signals a potential trend reversal, with ADA beginning a five-wave impulsive rally. Momentum indicators also support a bullish case. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has rebounded from oversold territory, hinting at strong buying interest. Beyond the technicals, rising ETF speculations have fueled institutional demand. Earlier this week, Grayscale Investments filed for a spot in Cardano ETF, and a win could mark a historic moment for Cardano price. In fact, the network saw a 20,000 active wallets increase in active user wallets amid institutional interest. The positive sentiment has been reflected in the Cardano price action. This week alone, the altcoin gained over 12% from last week's low at $0.68. Panshibi takes meme virality to new levels. Despite being in presale, Panshibi has emerged as a defiant force with its AI-driven meme revolution. While Bitcoin and other altcoins wavered, Panshibi’s presale soared past $1 million, proving that innovation and community engagement can override bearish sentiment. SHIBI has proven to be more than a meme with its cutting-edge staking rewards, social-fi mechanics, and a roadmap packed with NFT launches and Tier-1 exchange listings. Fortunately, the price is still at a discounted $0.005 in stage 4 of its limited 60-day presale.

Yet, the volatility unveiled hidden opportunities as some digital currencies defied trends with innovative strategies and steadfast growth. Key among these are Panshibi, a novel AI-driven meme coin, and Cardano, both making waves with their distinctive approaches. The Rise of Panshibi: A New Player in Meme Cryptos Panshibi, an AI-powered meme coin, capitalizes on the meme culture explosion by infusing technology and community spirit. This panda-themed token has seen exceptional success, amassing nearly $1 million in its presale. Investors are flocking to join the venture, drawn by the promise of rewards like annual returns up to 1200% for staked tokens. Their roadmap, including NFT projects and future exchange listings, positions Panshibi as a sustainable contender in the meme coin landscape. The success of Panshibi demonstrates a shift in focus towards coins offering more than just entertainment value. With community at its core and utility through artificial intelligence enhancements, Panshibi aims to be more than a fleeting trend. Cardano: The Veteran Thrives Amid ETF Speculation On another front, Cardano has surged with renewed vigor. The altcoin has seen impressive growth, partly fueled by the potential of an ETF launch spearheaded by Grayscale Investments. Cardano's price trajectory shows significant promise, indicating potential major gains, possibly reaching the $1 mark. The network has witnessed a surge in activity, with an increase of 20,000 active wallets, reflecting heightened institutional interest. Technical indicators, including Elliott Wave theory and RSI, suggest a positive outlook for Cardano, hinting at an impending bullish trend that could further uplift its market standing. Leveraging Market Dynamics The unfolding stories of Panshibi and Cardano reveal strategic positioning in a volatile environment. While Panshibi rides the wave of meme culture with added technological value, Cardano capitalizes on strong market fundamentals and institutional attention. Together, they showcase how adaptability and innovation can offer resilience and prosperity in crypto investments.

The crypto crashed shortly after, in a move described by the country’s fintech chamber as a “rug pull.” When markets opened in Buenos Aires on Monday, the S&P Merval dropped by amost 6%. The index, which tracks the biggest companies in the South American country, has since rebounded slightly but is still trading 3% lower than when it closed Friday. Argentina’s markets have been thrown into chaos after President Milei deleted his X post advertising $LIBRA, clarifying that he has no affiliation with the digital asset. However, the opposition politicians threatened an impeachment trial in Congress following the mishap. According to Leandro Santoro, who represents the opposition coalition, the president’s post was an embarrassing scandal on an international scale. He argues that such embarrassment requires them to launch an impeachment motion against President Milei. As a result of the sharp price drop in $LIBRA, over $50 million in long positions were liquidated within just two hours after the news broke (Coinglass, 2025). The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell from a neutral 50 to a fear level of 35 following this event (Alternative.me, 2025). The impact extended past $LIBRA because other tokens dependent on the Argentine market such as $PAMPAS fell 4.5% from $0.85 to $0.81 between 9:30 AM and 10:30 AM EST (CryptoCompare, 2025). $PAMPAS trading volume rose by 300% from 2 million to 8 million tokens showing a typical panic selling behaviour (CoinGecko, 2025). Argentina’s crypto market shaken by alleged presidential misconduct The $LIBRA token price also fell steeply: from $12.45 to $9.87 between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM EST, a 20.8% drop in one hour (CoinMarketCap, 2025). The effect was not only felt on the $LIBRA token but the other cryptocurrencies traded in Argentina also felt the heat with $BTC falling 3.2% from $45,000 to $43,560 and $ETH dropping 2.8% from $3,200 to $3,110 in the same period (CoinGecko, 2025). The trading volume of $LIBRA increased from 5 million to 15 million tokens in the first hour of the news (TradingView, 2025); this is a clear indication of panic unloading among investors. Political and economic analysts believe that the opposition does not have enough votes to carry out the impeachment threats. However, the charges, including fraud and the direct role in encouraging crypto, should hurt the government. As Argentina holds mid-term elections this year, this may affect Milei’s result. First, the president’s action impacted not only the opposition lawmakers but also investors. Most of the investors took to social media and got angry, claiming that he had defrauded them of their hard-earned money. On the other hand, Milei’s supporters are claiming that he is a political witch hunt victim. ONG Bitcoin Argentina , a non-profit organization that supports local education, said that such irresponsible promotion of assets is a threat to thousands of people. The nonprofit emphasized on education and transparency to protect people from such risks. During a morning conference, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to questions on the scandal, saying the public would have to see the results of the investigations. It is extremely serious if confirmed, especially in terms of a president’s powers to promote something private. If, as a president of a country, you propose something for private benefit, there is an obvious conflict of interest. President Claudia Sheinbaum Milei smells political interference from power-hungry people who mean harm to Argentina In the last few days, Milei has not become shy about criticism. He came out swinging hard in the face of criticism as he talked of political opportunists. He noted that the “filthy rats” of the political class wanted to fuel the scandal for their political mileage and to do harm. He noted that he is getting more convictions to make them understand that they should not be able to intervene in the events. The president acknowledged his limited understanding of the cryptocurrency initiative and, upon further investigation, opted to discontinue its promotion. The scandal happens as Milei is set to visit the United States this week, hoping to meet President Trump. The leader seeks to lobby Trump to support Argentina in getting more resources from the IMF under a new program still under negotiation, including exemptions from Trump’s tariffs.

From DeFi facilitating unrestricted banking to NFTs revolutionizing digital asset ownership, significant innovations are emerging beyond mere speculation. These top innovations have moved past the conceptual stage; they represent tangible investment opportunities. This article highlights the top four cryptos to buy that are actively developing, expanding, and capturing market share. 1. Web3Bay: Redefining Online Shopping with Fairness The convenience of online shopping masks the control traditional platforms hold over transactions. They set fees, manipulate visibility, and harvest user data. Web3Bay introduces a decentralized marketplace that eliminates these impositions, enabling direct and transparent interactions between buyers and sellers. Sellers retain a larger share of their profits, avoiding hefty platform fees. Meanwhile, buyers earn 3BAY tokens through purchases and participation, which contrasts sharply with the unilateral decisions made by traditional retail giants. The governance of Web3Bay is determined by its community, offering users real influence over its operations. Web3Bay has raised $1.4 million in its presale, with all tokens in the first three stages sold out, and the fourth stage nearly complete at $0.004562625 per token. Early investors are positioned for a potential return of up to 6,430% by the launch date. As traditional platforms tighten their grip, Web3Bay presents a compelling alternative that empowers its users. The critical question is whether you will join this shift in online shopping, marking one of the top cryptos to buy before it scales further. 2. Bittensor: Democratizing AI Development Today’s AI landscape is predominantly controlled by major corporations. Bittensor aims to disrupt this by decentralizing AI, granting wider access to developers and researchers. This open-source network compensates contributors, fostering a collaborative environment for AI development. The TAO token fuels this ecosystem, motivating developers to enhance AI models. While decentralization is appealing, the question remains whether Bittensor can compete with the computational power and efficiency of centralized AI behemoths like Google and OpenAI. 3. Helium: Decentralizing Wi-Fi Access Dominance by major internet providers may soon be challenged by Helium, which allows users to manage their own decentralized wireless networks. Users set up hotspots, earn rewards, and expand coverage for IoT devices, including smart meters and GPS trackers. The simple principle of sharing connectivity and earning HNT tokens in return positions Helium as a potential game-changer for smart cities and various industries reliant on IoT. Currently, HNT shows a modest price of $4.33, indicating slow but stable growth. 4. Gala: True Ownership of In-Game Assets The gaming industry sees substantial investment in digital items, yet players lack actual ownership. Gala Games addresses this by using blockchain technology to ensure real ownership of digital assets within games. Players can trade, sell, or retain their in-game items across various platforms, an innovation already implemented on Gala’s live platform. GALA token mirrors these advancements with a market movement reflecting a trading volume of $119.5 million at a price of $0.03108. Identifying the Top Cryptos to Buy Today While the blockchain sector is rife with innovative ideas, actual adoption distinguishes the top cryptos to buy from fleeting trends. Helium tests the feasibility of decentralized networks against traditional telecom giants, Bittensor seeks to make AI more accessible, and Gala champions genuine ownership of in-game assets. These projects not only advocate for their respective causes but also demonstrate significant market engagement, with Web3Bay showcasing the practical application of decentralized commerce, evidenced by significant early-stage investments and the potential for substantial returns. Such opportunities are for those who recognize and act on them promptly.

While investors have enjoyed the rapid gains, savvy investors question whether BROCCOLI can sustain its momentum or its just a short lived hype. Analysts are urging investors to rotate their BROCCOLI short-term gains into projects with real utility, and RCO Finance (RCOF) is emerging as the top pick. With AI-powered tools and high growth potential, the RCOF altcoin will redefine the DeFi sector. BROCCOLI: From Meme Hype to Market Reality Memecoins have historically provided short-term speculative gains, with only a few that go beyond the hype. The latest sensation, BROCCOLI , follows a viral sensation inspired by Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s dog. Changpeng revealed the name of his pet dog, Broccoli, sparking a meme coin frenzy that led to the token’s upswing. At press time, BROCCOLI is trading at $0.0009441 after surging by 1,075% in the past day. The reality of memecoins is short-lived, as, without real utility, sustainability remains questionable. Similarly, analysts warn that once speculative traders exit, BROCCOLI will face price stagnation. Investors seeking sustainable long-term returns should focus on projects offering real utility beyond speculation, such as RCOF, which integrates AI and blockchain technology. RCOF: The AI-Driven Altcoin Redefining Crypto Investment Amidst the memecoin hype and short-term gains, RCOF altcoin is positioning itself as an AI-powered trading platform that will revolutionize how we trade and invest. At its core is the AI Robo-advisor , which personalizes investment strategies based on investors’ risk profiles, financial goals, and market trends. RCOF users will stand out in the volatile crypto market with this tailored approach, enabling them to maximize their profits. Unlike human financial advisors, the Robo-advisor continuously adapts to real-time data to ensure optimal fund allocation while adjusting your investment portfolio. The tool helps curb human error and eliminates emotional bias that clouds investor judgment. Timing is everything in the crypto market, and RCOF’s predictive analytics is one of its outstanding features. For instance, the Robo-advisors could have identified BROCCOLI’s meteoric rise, allowing investors to capitalize on gains before its inevitable correction. The tool equips traders with accurate insights ahead of market movements. Unlike BROCCOLI, RCOF altcoin gives users access to over 120,000 tradable assets that include stocks, bonds, ETFs, forex, and tokenized real-world assets. This broad selection enables investors to diversify their investment portfolios to ensure balanced risk management. Investors can stake their assets in the RCOF liquidity pools so that there is sufficient liquidity for trading activities. The integration of liquidity pools improves the trading experience and ensures assets are exchanged quickly and efficiently. In return, investors earn passive income, such as RCOF tokens and dividends. Unlike legacy platforms that require identity verification, the RCOF altcoin operates without a KYC ecosystem. This gives investors the freedom to trade anonymously, with the platform guaranteeing security while maintaining full decentralization. Again, the RCOF altcoin has been thoroughly audited by SolidProof to confirm that the platform is free from vulnerabilities. This boosts investor confidence in the altcoin, as investors know that their assets are safe and secure. If you want to catch a glimpse into the future of trading, the altcoin recently launched its AI beta platform . This is a rare occurrence as other projects wait until after launching their token to test their beta phase. Over 10k active users are onboard, signaling strong market demand for the altcoin offering. Since this is its beta phase, investors can expect more enhancements upon its alpha phase rollout when the token is launched. RCOF Presale: Massive Returns Await Early Investors BROCCOLI’s rapid rise has thrilled many crypto investors, but those looking for long-term utility should rotate their gains to RCOF . This altcoin has high growth potential that could surpass BROCCOLI’s recent surge. The RCOF presale is in stage 5, with tokens priced at just $0.10, having raised $13.64M. Analysts predict that the listing price could be between $0.4 and $0.6, giving early investors a 500% ROI. Investors who bought RCOF tokens in stage 1 will boast over 3,000% ROI during listing, showing the importance of early entry into a promising project. The clock is ticking as the RCOF altcoin presale has limited allocated tokens up for grabs. With its AI-powered ecosystem and real-world utility, the altcoin is a game changer in DeFi.

It is currently trading below the $100,000 mark, an 11.4% decrease from its peak. The crypto asset’s recent trajectory has raised questions about its next move as it trades within a relatively tight range. According to CryptoQuant analyst Percival, Bitcoin is exhibiting a pattern that hints at upcoming significant market movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Late Longs Liquidated: Is a Breakout Finally on the Horizon? Potential Support Levels and Short-Term Indicators In a post titled “Bitcoin ready for either side,” Percival highlights the asset’s current “loading phase.” He explains that Bitcoin’s price dynamics have historically shown abrupt rises followed by prolonged periods of consolidation. The Choppiness Index—a measure used to determine whether the market is trending or consolidating—currently indicates instability, with daily and weekly readings at 62 and 72, respectively. Percival notes that this is a sign of impending volatility. Over the past 90 days, Bitcoin’s range has fluctuated within a band of roughly 16%, suggesting mounting pressure for a breakout. Percival outlines key price levels that could act as support if Bitcoin’s price declines further. The Short Term Holders Cost Base, located at $92,000, is the first significant support level. If that fails, the next support zone lies between $80,000 and $89,000, aligning with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). These levels could provide critical price floors as traders assess whether the current downtrend is nearing an end. The analyst also examines the short-term Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a metric that helps gauge whether coins moving on-chain are being sold at a profit or loss. Currently sitting just below 1, the SOPR suggests the market is near equilibrium. Percival compares the current scenario to August 2023, when a similar setup preceded significant price movements. At that time, low volatility cleared out traders with positions in the wrong direction before a major rally ensued. Today’s conditions—marked by a test zone near 0.99—suggest that sudden price swings could trigger liquidations and short-term panic. Bitcoin Market Sentiment and Next Steps Overall, Percival points out that Bitcoin’s market structure often involves false moves before establishing a clear trend. Breakout traders positioned near the current levels could find their positions shaken out before a sustained directional move materializes. This pattern highlights the importance of caution, particularly for traders attempting to time the market’s next breakout. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at $96,265 after seeing a 1% decrease in the past day. According to a renowned crypto analyst, Ali on X, the asset is likely to see a notable rebound in the near term based on its TD sequential indicator flashing a buy signal. After accurately timing the recent local top, the TD Sequential indicator is now flashing a buy signal on the #Bitcoin $BTC 4-hour chart, suggesting a potential price rebound! pic.twitter.com/3IzinRirxo — Ali (@ali_charts) February 17, 2025 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin market|btc|BTC market|BTCUSDT|crypto|cryptoquant,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-18 00:00:23

Solana (SOL), currently trading at $199.48, has seen a minor 2.29% dip, but its range of $198.11 to $205.83 suggests a solid foundation for future growth. Experts whisper about the possibility of a $635 Solana price tag, fueled by bullish momentum and increasing adoption. Yet, seasoned investors know that while Solana price predictions excite the masses, true wealth is built by getting in early on disruptive opportunities . That’s where one $0.0420 AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), is turning heads, with experts forecasting a jaw-dropping 3,210% surge before the year ends. Solana’s (SOL) Strength Is Clear, But AI Coins Are The Future AI is reshaping every industry, and crypto is no exception. Machine learning algorithms, predictive analytics, and smart automation are no longer theoretical concepts: they are driving multi-billion-dollar valuations. While Solana price speculations remain a hot topic, the real breakthrough investments are AI coins like the $0.0420 WallitIQ (WLTQ) . This isn’t just another AI coin; it’s a SolidProof-audited innovation hub designed for easy financial interactions and lucrative passive income opportunities. There’s no denying Solana’s (SOL) institutional support, high-speed transactions, and growing adoption among developers. A rally to $635 is entirely plausible. But let’s be honest, the true potential for 3,210% gains now lies in AI coins, where exponential growth is still up for grabs. Experts recognize that the combination of AI and blockchain is a seismic shift, and few projects embody this synergy as powerfully as WallitIQ (WLTQ). This next-generation AI coin doesn’t just promise high returns; it delivers real-world utility that’s redefining how users interact with crypto. The AI Coin That’s Reshaping Financial Transactions WallitIQ (WLTQ) isn’t just about speculation; experts have recognized its fully-fledged ecosystem that rewards users for engaging in the digital economy. Imagine a world where every transaction gives you up to 12% cashback, a revolutionary feature that turns spending into an opportunity for returns. While Solana (SOL) investors debate the Solana price trajectory, early adopters of this platform are already securing future profits. Unlike traditional cryptos, this AI coin integrates biometric authentication , giving only authorized users access to assets. Every investor dreams of making money while they sleep. That’s exactly what staking opportunities in WallitIQ (WLTQ) provide. By simply holding and staking tokens, users can generate passive income, compounding their gains over time. The added advantage? Custom alerts that keep users ahead of market trends. While many rely on slow-moving news sources, this AI coin delivers real-time insights directly to your device, helping you never miss an opportunity. Experts Predict A Parabolic Surge Before The Masses Catch On Experts are closely watching this new platform over Solana (SOL). With the upcoming beta launch , the window for entry at today’s undervalued WallitIQ (WLTQ) price is closing fast. While the Solana price might double or triple in the best-case scenario, the upside on this AI coin is far greater. Experts’ projections don’t lie: 3,210% gains aren’t just speculation; they are based on solid adoption trends, feature rollouts, and the increasing role of AI in decentralized finance. Many traders struggle with managing multiple wallets and transactions across various platforms. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) MVP build is set to eliminate that headache, offering an advanced solution for handling crypto assets with ease. As Solana (SOL) continues its upward trajectory, investors looking for the next explosive opportunity are turning their focus here. The Urgency Is Real: The Beta Platform Is Launching Soon While the Solana price chase continues, those who recognize the AI revolution’s true potential are acting now. The upcoming beta launch of this crypto project marks a pivotal moment; once adoption kicks in, early prices will be a thing of the past. Solana (SOL) remains a strong player, and its journey to $635 will be an exciting ride. But the bigger story is unfolding elsewhere.

Through continuous governance enhancements, AI partnerships, and ETF submissions, Cardano is bolstering its stance in the cryptocurrency market. Nonetheless, in spite of these optimistic signs, the ADA price prediction 2025 indicates that it might find it challenging to surpass Remittix, the 'new XRP,' which is transforming blockchain finance. By connecting crypto and traditional finance, Remittix is quickly emerging as the next big crypto. Remittix is currently in its presale phase, having raised over $11 million with each token sold at $0.0567. For early adoption and the benefit of prospective investors, Remittix has launched an exclusive giveaway. ADA Price Prediction 2025: Cardano’s expanding ecosystem With ADA price prediction 2025 remaining a hot topic among investors, Cardano is achieving considerable progress in governance, security, and institutional adoption. The move towards an official Constitution has reinforced its decentralized ecosystem, while the Plomin hard fork and Lace Wallet upgrades have improved security and adaptability. Grayscale's application for a Cardano ETF signifies increasing institutional interest, which could lead to broader mainstream adoption. With whale holdings surpassing 1.41 billion ADA , investor trust continues to be strong. Despite these advancements, the ADA price prediction 2025 indicates that Cardano's price moved -1.36% to $0.803 and trading volume moved -3.92% to $754.35m. Cardano's Market Outlook for 2025 vs. The Rise of Remittix Although Cardano's market outlook for 2025 is positive, the ADA price prediction for 2025 indicates that Remittix is rising as a strong competitor due to its advanced payment technology. Remittix is transforming worldwide transactions with its efficient crypto-to-fiat payment system. Cardano’s venture into AI and blockchain governance is praiseworthy; however, the ADA price prediction for 2025 indicates that Remittix’s genuine financial applications and international payment solutions provide it with a tangible advantage. With the rapid adoption of blockchain, investors are more often looking for assets that have direct financial integration instead of speculative growth. Why Remittix, the 'New XRP,' is Outshining ADA The main reason Remittix is gaining momentum against ADA is its capability to simplify financial transactions for both businesses and individuals. In contrast to Cardano's emphasis on long-term infrastructure advancement, Remittix is achieving immediate outcomes with its instant settlements, fiat integrations, and scalable payment network. Remittix guarantees smooth multi-chain interoperability, enabling users to easily transfer assets across different blockchain networks. Due to this characteristic, it competes directly with XRP's international payment system, offering quicker transaction times, reduced fees, and enhanced accessibility. Furthermore, Remittix is increasing its ties with financial institutions, enabling businesses to incorporate blockchain transactions inside traditional banking systems. Can ADA Compete With the 'New XRP'? Although the ADA price prediction for 2025 indicates potential new peaks, it also recognizes that Remittix's rapid adoption and effective financial solutions position it as the better option. The Cardano's market outlook for 2025 appears robust, yet its rivalry with Remittix, the 'New XRP,' is becoming more intense. As additional investors see Remittix as the 'New XRP', it is evident that its practical usability, scalability, and financial integration position it as the top altcoin for 2025. As Remittix grows its functionality, it is gaining recognition not only as an alternative to ADA but also as a genuine leader in blockchain-based financial services. In contrast to ADA, which continues to depend significantly on ecosystem growth, Remittix is actively delivering tangible payment solutions that are transforming global finance. This essential distinction is the reason investors are choosing Remittix.

Could Ripple finally reach $27 and break resistance? Table of Contents Ripple’s wild ride Is the XRP ETF finally coming? XRP’s make-or-break moment looms XRP price prediction: Could history repeat itself? Ripple’s wild ride Ripple ( XRP ) has experienced a rollercoaster ride in recent months, capturing the market’s attention with large price swings and major regulatory developments. On Jan. 16, the token surged to a multi-year high of $3.39, fueled by strong market sentiment. However, the rally was short-lived. As of Feb. 17, XRP has pulled back to $2.68, marking a 21% decline from its January peak. It remains approximately 31% below its all-time high of $3.89, which was reached in January 2018. Despite this pullback, XRP remains one of the top-performing assets in the top 100, delivering an impressive 145% return over the past 90 days. This outpaces heavyweights like Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ), both of which have lost value during the same period. Amid these fluctuations, broader market forces are also at play. The election of President Donald Trump introduced a more crypto-friendly atmosphere in the U.S., with the Trump administration’s positive stance on digital assets boosting investor confidence. This, in turn, has contributed to the upward trajectory of crypto assets, including XRP. Additionally, the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler has further fueled optimism, as market participants anticipate a more accommodating regulatory environment under the new SEC leadership of acting chair Mark Uyeda. With a mix of strong price action, regulatory intrigue, and shifting political winds, what can we expect from XRP? Let’s explore this further in our Ripple price prediction. Is the XRP ETF finally coming? Amid ongoing volatility and key developments, XRP has remained in the spotlight. A major turning point came on Feb. 13, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission formally acknowledged a filing from the New York Stock Exchange and Grayscale Investments for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. The proposal outlines a plan to convert Grayscale’s existing $16.1 million XRP Trust into a fully tradable ETF, with Coinbase Custody Trust Company acting as the custodian and BNY Mellon handling administrative duties.

The first key deadline is set for mid-March, marking the start of a 45-day review period. After that, the SEC may either make a decision or extend the timeline, with a final decision expected by mid-October 2025. But Grayscale isn’t the only firm pushing for an XRP ETF. The Chicago Board Options Exchange has also filed a 19b-4 application for Bitwise’s XRP ETF, with other firms also vying for approval.

He noted that while previous filings have seen starts and stops, with some firms withdrawing their applications, the fact that multiple issuers are now refiling suggests that the SEC is at least open to considering these ETFs. Hougan remains cautiously optimistic, pointing out that while approval could take time, the SEC is becoming more willing to engage in discussions about these products. He also highlighted a key difference between XRP and other commodity-based ETFs like Bitcoin and gold — those assets had regulated futures markets before their ETFs were approved, whereas XRP does not. Although a futures market is not mandatory for XRP ETFs, it would play a key role in the approval process. What makes these filings particularly striking is the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple, arguing that XRP had been sold as an unregistered security. Ripple scored a partial victory in August 2023 when a federal judge ruled that XRP is not a security when traded on secondary markets. However, regulatory uncertainty still persists, making the ETF approval process for XRP more complex compared to spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) or Ethereum ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, pointed out the irony — while the SEC remains in litigation with Ripple, it is simultaneously reviewing an ETF that would hold XRP. Geraci even called it an “enormous message,” suggesting that the SEC’s stance on XRP might be shifting. Shocked more people aren’t talking about SEC accepting XRP ETF filing… They have open litigation w/ Ripple. Meanwhile, they just acknowledged filing of ETF holding asset in dispute (they easily could have rejected this filing). Enormous message IMO. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) February 14, 2025 Adding to the growing buzz, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have estimated a 65% probability of XRP ETF approval by the end of 2025. Our official alt coin ETF approval odds are out. Litecoin leads w 90% chance, then Doge, followed by Solana and XRP. We are only doing for 33 Act $IBIT -esque filings. But def poss to see futures or Cayman-subsidiary type 40 Act stuff get through as well. https://t.co/JSaNnifjbu — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 10, 2025 XRP’s make-or-break moment looms XRP is at a make-or-break moment, approaching a resistance level that has defined its fate for years. Over the past two months, XRP has tested the $3.15 to $3.50 range, a zone that has consistently determined whether XRP breaks into a major rally or gets stuck in consolidation. On Jan. 16, XRP reached a multi-year high of $3.39, but that attempt to push higher ultimately failed. Then, on Feb. 3, XRP plunged 43% to $1.94 as global markets were shaken by Trump’s tariff threats, causing a widespread selloff that led to one of the worst declines in crypto history. Despite the chaos, XRP has since rebounded and is once again nearing the same resistance level, setting the stage for another potential breakout. Beyond the short-term volatility, something even more significant is unfolding. XRP is nearing the completion of a rounding bottom pattern that has been forming since 2018, a structure that has taken nearly seven years to develop. XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news If XRP reaches its all-time high of $3.89, the pattern will officially complete, signalling the end of a prolonged accumulation phase. At that point, XRP would enter price discovery, meaning there would be no historical resistance left to hold it back. The question now is what will provide the final push. Broader market conditions are not fully supportive yet, as Bitcoin hasn’t hit a new all-time high, and liquidity remains concentrated in just a few assets. One of the biggest potential catalysts is ETF approval. If the SEC greenlights an XRP ETF, institutional demand could surge, driving prices past resistance with sheer volume. Another key factor could be strategic adoption — if XRP is included in a financial system reserve or gains a major institutional use case, the surge in demand could propel it into uncharted territory. The third wildcard is the SEC lawsuit appeal. If the appeal is dismissed, legal clarity alone could trigger a wave of buying. Now, all eyes are on whether XRP can finally push through or if history will repeat itself once again. The next attempt to clear $3.50 may prove to be the most significant in its history. XRP price prediction: Could history repeat itself? XRP’s 2017 bull run remains a key reference point, with several indicators suggesting that XRP is now mirroring the setup that led to its parabolic rise. One of the bullish arguments comes from Egrag Crypto, which points to the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB), a technical indicator used to determine whether an asset is in a bullish or bearish phase. #XRP – Double Digits – 1500% Pump ⛽️: Let’s break down what’s happening with #XRP : 1⃣ Bull Market Support Band (BMSB): This is our key indicator for determining whether we’re in a #BullRun or a #BearMarket . Currently, we're positioned above the BMSB. I mentioned in a previous… pic.twitter.com/PNB4OmuCN8 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) February 6, 2025 “Currently, we’re positioned above the BMSB,” he explains, noting that he had predicted XRP would revisit this level, even when the price was at $3.40. A successful retest of this support could signal that the market is gathering strength for the next move. Egrag draws parallels to 2017 when XRP followed a nearly identical pattern. He notes that back then, XRP nearly hit the BMSB, which preceded a 1,500% surge in just four weeks, targeting the Fib 1.618 level. Fibonacci levels are widely used in technical analysis to predict price movements, and in 2017, XRP’s breakout followed this exact pattern. If history repeats itself, Egrag suggests a 1,500% surge to $27. Javon Marks takes this further, highlighting how XRP’s recent price action mirrors its 2017 breakout. Prices recently tested the all-time high as resistance, just as they did in 2017 before surging beyond it. Marks’ new second target is at $99, an astonishing 3,900% increase from current levels. $XRP to $99+🪞: The truth is, most of what we have to connect dots with on XRP is its past price performance and man oh man is this breakout and run shaping up extremely similar to 2017. Prices recently met the All Time High, using it as a resistance, just as it did in 2017… https://t.co/gjFsTxYSwG pic.twitter.com/F0wVWE8v0z — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) February 7, 2025 Beyond Fibonacci extensions, Elliott Wave theory also points to significant potential for XRP. Dark Defender has been tracking XRP’s wave structure since July 2023, when the price was around 40 to 50 cents. XRP had a 4th Wave on his Intermediate Cycle, which I highlighted in Dark Blue, aiming for $5.85 with the 5th Wave. On the other hand, Primary Cycle Waves, highlighted in Light Blue, still aim for $18.22. (Not Financial Advice) I have used the same structure since July 23,… pic.twitter.com/CZXFSRyftb — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) February 3, 2025 According to his analysis, XRP is currently in Wave 4 of the Intermediate Cycle, with Wave 5 targeting $5.85. His Primary Cycle Waves, which track long-term movements, suggest a major upside target of $18.22. “I’ve used the same structure since July 2023, and we are following it as the Northern Star,” Dark Defender explains, suggesting XRP has consistently respected this pattern. If his wave count holds, XRP could be on the verge of completing a major cycle. However, big breakouts don’t happen in isolation. XRP still faces its biggest resistance zone between $3.15 and $3.50, which requires a major catalyst to break through. For traders looking to take advantage of this setup, risk management is key. Placing stop-loss orders can help minimize losses in case of rejection, and avoiding over-leveraging is crucial, as sudden pullbacks could lead to liquidation. However, nothing in the crypto market is guaranteed. The same indicators that suggest explosive upside potential can also fail under changing market conditions. Trade wisely, manage risk, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

After a somewhat tricky 2024, many cryptocurrencies are looking to recoup losses, sustain gains and push beyond resistance levels. Cardano, in particular, has been dominating headlines with big moves and ecosystem development that have sparked a bullish Cardano price prediction. Late last month, the network announced the launch of its highly anticipated Plomin Upgrade and this month, it's the ETF hype. However, one underdog, Panshibi , has been outperforming ADA. This new kid has caused quite a stir with its Panda-themed revolution and AI innovation in the meme market. Let's dive in and explore the latest happenings around the crypto world. Panshibi's AI meme revolution heats up the crypto market. After weeks of presale, Panshibi is still raising the dust as one of the most outstanding meme projects of the year. The presale has already raked in close to a million dollars in its fourth stage after selling out three stages in record time. At its core, Panshibi is upgrading the meme culture from a mere fad-driven speculative hype to an ecosystem thriving on innovation and purpose. The project is a powerful synergy of communities that brings together Asian cultural heritage, Panda lovers and meme enthusiasts. It spices things further by incorporating AI and social-fi to give everyone a chance at an inclusive community and financial freedom. Among its many perks is the stake-to-earn program, which allows token holders to stake their tokens and receive up to 1200% APY annually. The fun doesn't end with the lovable Panda theme. Panshibi offers an immersive gamified experience with various in-game rewards and VIP perks. To show its commitment to security and transparency, the Panshibi team aced a smart contract audit, in addition to locked liquidity and team allocations. The demand and support Panshibi's visionary meme revolution saw is not surprising. Even many experts tip it as one of 2025’s most promising meme coins. Cardano’s Recent Price Surge: Will It Sustain A Bullish Run In 2025 Another altcoin that has been hitting the headlines frequently is Cardano. Despite a tumultuous 2024, Cardano turned its fortunes around in November 2024 after surging 286% to a yearly high of $1.3 after Trump's victory and increased ecosystem activities. While it has noticeably traded below the $1 mark for most of 2025, Cardano price predictions suggest a possible return to a >$1 price in the coming months. These projections are hinged partly on a steady increase in the accumulation of $ADA by Cardano whales. Over the last five days, Binance reports that Cardano whales have bought up about 170 million tokens, which amounts to approximately $136 million. These numbers, of course, suggest massive investor confidence tied not only to Cardano’s intrinsic promise but also to its recent projects and collaborations. Just recently, it announced a deal with Argentina company Globant, which involves the latter using the Cardano blockchain to create decentralized applications. In addition to that, Grayscale Investments also filed for an ADA spot ETF. X analyst Ali Martinez predicted a rebound from current levels at $0.77. The positive sentiment, whale accumulation and SEC projection could see Cardano price prediction surpass its yearly high of $1.3. Conclusion Cardano has been on the rise lately, and there are plenty of reasons to believe it may have a better year than it did in 2024. However, analysts predict a better outing for the Panshibi in 2025 due to its presale heroics. And with a possible 140,000% ROI awaiting token holders after said presale, a massive breakout is extremely likely. The best way to take advantage of Panshibi's promising run is by getting in early. The price now stands at $0.005 in stage 4. The revolution is just getting started, and Panshibi is at the helm!

Meanwhile, Panshibi emerges as a compelling player, driven by a devoted community and transformative technology. Embracing AI and Culture: Panshibi's Dynamic Entry Known for its unconventional approach, Panshibi integrates cultural appreciation with technological advancements, promoting a flourishing ecosystem.

At its core, Panshibi introduces a gamified, stake-to-earn experience, appealing to a broad spectrum of investors and Panda aficionados. Its enticing rewards scheme and commitment to security via smart contract audits bolster investor confidence, reinforcing its status as a promising prospect for 2025. Cardano's Strategic Moves and Future Prospects Cardano is witnessing a wave of positive momentum after overcoming the hurdles of the previous year. The altcoin's strategic partnerships and ecosystem expansion play crucial roles in this resurgence. Notably, collaborations such as those with Argentina-based Globant and Grayscale Investments suggest a fortified roadmap for future growth. Analysts continue to predict a bullish outlook for Cardano, especially as investor interest is rekindled by significant whale activity and ecosystem advancements. This optimistic sentiment may well drive Cardano past its previous peaks, encouraging speculation and strategic investment. Looking Ahead: Opportunities in the Crypto Arena As the digital currency sphere undergoes a transformation, both established coins and newcomers like Panshibi present unique opportunities. Panshibi, with its innovative blend of cultural and technological elements, is poised to redefine meme coins' potential.

This announcement arrives alongside a notable price surge, with Cardano jumping to $0.80—up nearly 55% from its monthly low. Amid this excitement, speculations swirl around a secret VIP meeting that Hoskinson hinted at for March 1. Globant Collaboration Shakes Up the Cardano News Scene The new deal, revealed via a tweet from Angry Crypto Show , will see Globant develop decentralized applications on Cardano’s blockchain. The two entities also aim to launch AI-based projects soon, fueling more Cardano News chatter about potential real-world adoption. Globant’s portfolio includes clients like Walt Disney and Nissan, suggesting a wide-reaching impact if Cardano’s technology integrates seamlessly with these global brands. Notably, Cardano’s market cap now stands at about $28.5 billion, with a fully diluted valuation of $35.7 billion. Optimists point to this Globant partnership as evidence that Cardano is edging closer to mainstream recognition. Cardano Whales, who typically shift the market through large-scale buys, have also shown renewed interest, seizing the opportunity to accumulate tokens amid the partnership buzz. Speculation Grows Around Charles Hoskinson’s VIP Meeting Another key piece of Cardano News is Hoskinson’s mysterious VIP engagement slated for March 1. Some community members hope Elon Musk might be involved, potentially paving the way for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to adopt Cardano’s blockchain. Others suggest political figures like Donald Trump or tech entrepreneurs like David Sacks could be on the list. The VIP dinner gets moved Cardano Whales have been particularly vocal about this upcoming rendezvous. They believe any high-profile endorsement could catapult Cardano into the spotlight, mirroring how Musk’s interest in Dogecoin influenced that coin’s trajectory. However, skeptics urge caution, recalling earlier unfulfilled promises—such as a rumored Chainlink partnership and an Ethiopia education initiative that still lacks tangible results. Where Does Cardano Stand Technically? Amid all this Cardano News, technical indicators reveal a stable climb. According to Cardano’s price chart , the token has retested $0.802—its highest level in months. The price currently finds support above the 50-week moving average, reinforcing a bullish outlook. Experts note that Cardano has completed the second phase of the Elliott Wave pattern and could now enter the highly bullish third phase. If this trend continues, the next target might be $2—nearly a 155% leap from current levels. Cardano Whales are monitoring these signals closely, with many believing that the Globant deal and potential VIP endorsement could accelerate the token’s path toward that ambitious price point. Remittix Breaks $12M Barrier: A Rising PayFi Powerhouse While Cardano Whales focus on the new partnership and potential price action, another story is unfolding in parallel. Remittix continues to exceed expectations by raising over $12 million in its presale, selling more than 460 million tokens at $0.0599 each. Branded a PayFi disruptor, Remittix aims to unify crypto’s speed with the familiarity of global banking. For instance, users in remote parts of Africa or Southeast Asia can send cryptocurrency that arrives as fiat in a recipient’s bank account—offering a frictionless, cost-effective alternative to expensive remittance services. Remittix’s approach preserves user privacy by only requiring standard bank details, so recipients remain blissfully unaware the transaction originated in crypto. This synergy could be game-changing in regions where traditional banking infrastructure is limited or prohibitively expensive. Moreover, Remittix’s upcoming Remittix Pay API will allow freelancers and businesses to accept crypto payments, automatically settling the proceeds in fiat. Such flexibility resonates with people seeking greater financial autonomy, mirroring the ethos that draws Cardano Whales to ADA’s long-term potential. The project also shines for its security measures, including a locked liquidity pool and team tokens, plus a fully audited smart contract. Will Cardano Keep On Capturing Attention? Cardano News continues to capture the crypto community’s attention, fueled by a significant new partnership with Globant and the prospect of a headline-grabbing VIP meeting. While Cardano Whales remain instrumental in driving market sentiment, everyday investors also watch closely for any breakthroughs that could trigger a price rally to $2 or beyond. Yet, the blockchain’s track record of delayed promises tempers some of the enthusiasm, leaving room for healthy debate. Meanwhile, Remittix has emerged as an intriguing challenger, bridging the gap between decentralized crypto and conventional finance. Its presale momentum—and potential to reshape cross-border payments—shows that innovative PayFi solutions can thrive in a market often dominated by big-name blockchains. Should it keep evolving at this pace, Remittix might command as much attention from whales and institutions as Cardano does now.

Both projects are strengthening their ecosystems, drawing renewed investor confidence. Meanwhile, Panshibi ($SHIBI) is emerging as a major contender, capturing the attention of big investors seeking high returns. With its innovative Social-Fi integration and skyrocketing presale demand, SHIBI is positioning itself as the next breakout crypto, offering massive returns. Panshibi Surges as Solana & Cardano Investors Seek High-Growth Opportunities Panshibi ($SHIBI) is gaining investor attention at a record pace. The project has become one of the most discussed meme coins on Telegram, Twitter and major crypto forums. Unlike typical meme coins, Panshibi offers real utility through social-Fi and AI-powered features. Holders can join quests, earn rewards and engage in activities that promote long-term growth. The project has a $10 million presale cap, strict liquidity locks and a structured roadmap. Security remains a priority, with a 10-year liquidity lock and a two-year team token lock. These measures ensure stability and prevent early sell-offs, making Panshibi a strong long-term investment. As Cardano and Solana struggle to maintain key levels, traders are shifting their focus to high-growth opportunities. Many are pouring into Panshibi, seeing its potential before it even reaches exchanges. With each presale stage raising the token’s price, early investors stand to gain significantly. While the broader market remains uncertain, Panshibi continues to gain momentum, positioning itself for a major breakout. Solana Gains Strength as ETF Speculation Fuels Demand Solana’s price has been volatile since reaching its all-time high of $294 in January. After a long correction period, the token is regaining momentum. Although Solana recently failed to break the $200 resistance, demand for SOL continues to grow. Speculation about a potential ETF approval this year is driving renewed interest. On-chain data reveals that Solana’s seven-day average transaction fees have surpassed Ethereum’s gas fees since January 9. The blockchain’s lower costs and higher transaction speed continue to attract users and developers. Solana is currently trading at $190.97 after falling 2.84% intraday. The token is also holding above its 200-day EMA, confirming a bullish outlook. The MACD on the 4-hour chart has formed a bullish crossover, further strengthening this trend. Solana has now broken above the key $200 level and analysts are watching to see if it can test the $231 pivot in the coming week. Cardano News: ADA Struggles to Keep Up as Investors Look Elsewhere Cardano’s research-driven development has earned praise. However, agility matters in a fast-moving market. ADA’s slow progress has raised concerns, pushing investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. CoinMarketCap reports that the Cardano coin's valuation is $0.77 yet shows a daily loss of 1.09%. Trading volume has seen a more serious 27.23% decrease, indicating waning market confidence. While some analysts predict a short-term rise to $0.9385 by mid-March, overall sentiment remains negative. In other Cardano news, certain projections suggest Cardano could replicate its 2020 parabolic rally. However, many investors are skeptical that history will repeat itself. As doubts grow, traders are exploring faster-growing alternatives with stronger upside potential.

As investors search for high returns, Panshibi ($SHIBI) stands out by leveraging its unique social-Fi features and robust presale momentum. With an eye on potential breakouts, investors are paying close attention to SHIBI's progress. The Ascent of Panshibi in the Crypto World In a market saturated with meme coins, Panshibi distinguishes itself through tangible utility, encompassing AI-powered tools and community-centric rewards. Discussions in popular crypto forums reflect the growing interest in Panshibi, especially given its structured roadmap featuring a $10 million presale limit and secure liquidity measures. Investors are drawn to Panshibi’s strategy of prioritizing stability with measures such as a 10-year liquidity lock, reducing the risk of early sell-offs. This foresight positions Panshibi as an attractive long-term prospect amidst shifting investor sentiments in other markets. Solana's Renewed Demand Driven by ETF Speculation Solana has faced volatility but shows signs of resurgence as speculation about a potential ETF approval reignites interest. The blockchain's competitive advantages, such as lower transaction fees and higher speed, have positioned it favorably among users and developers. Currently trading at $190.97, Solana is closely watched by analysts for any movement towards the $231 pivot, marking a significant bullish trend if achieved. Its technical indicators, like the MACD crossover, support a positive outlook. Cardano's Slow Progress Challenges Investor Confidence Despite earning respect for its research-driven approach, Cardano (ADA) is experiencing a lag that has some investors considering other options. Market data reflects this, with notable drops in trading volume and valuation, leading some traders to explore quicker growth opportunities. Predictions of a potential price rally to $0.9385 by mid-March offer a glimmer of hope, yet the sentiment remains cautious as traders assess the viability of historical patterns repeating. Last Call for Panshibi's Presale Before Market Listing With a current price of $0.005, SHIBI presents an alluring opportunity before its anticipated market debut. As interest grows, early investors keen on maximizing gains are taking note of the closing window.

In a new petition on CoWorker.org, JPMorgan Chase workers say CEO Jamie Dimon should reconsider the bank’s return-to-office (RTO) policy, and that the idea of remote work equating low performance has been thoroughly debunked. The workers say they are “concerned about the future of our workplace – its integrity, employee satisfaction, and the increasing toxicity that has metastasized in our company culture in the last couple of months.” The petition, which now has 1,595 of its 2,000 signature goal, says that a hybrid model that combines in-office with remote work is better for the employees, customers, shareholders and the “global community.” “The recent mandate for 100% in-office work is a great leap backward: It hurts employees, customers, shareholders, and the firm’s reputation. From a corporate-citizenship perspective, it worsens traffic and pollution while disproportionately pushing out women, caregivers, senior employees, and individuals with disabilities. Many of these are top performers, and many of them only able to join the workforce under hybrid work rules. This directly contradicts JPMC’s commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Remote work may not suit in-person services, but it’s the way of the future for all knowledge work. Indeed, it’s often the only way to get anything done, even from the office!” JPMorgan informed employees on January 10th that they would need to appear in person at the office five days a week after years of using a hybrid model stemming from the complexities of Covid-19. In leaked audio obtained by The Hill , Dimon slammed remote working, even only on Fridays. “It simply doesn’t work… And it doesn’t work for creativity. It slows down decision-making… And don’t give me the s*** that ‘work from home Friday’ works. I call a lot of people on Friday. There’s not a goddamn person to get a hold of… You don’t have to work at JP Morgan. So, the people of you who don’t want to work at the company, that’s fine with me… I’m not mad at you. Don’t be mad at me.” It’s a free country. You can walk on your feet. But this company is going to set our own standards and do it our own way.

Top Crypto Analyst Believe This New Meme Token On Presale Is Set To Rally In 2 Weeks,https://timestabloid.com/can-shib-reach-0-00005-with-uae-partnership-top-crypto/,"UAE partnership buzz has fueled speculation of Shiba Inu (SHIB) reaching $0.00005, but a new meme token is quietly gaining ground. In its presale stage, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is attracting attention with a stage-based pricing structure that rewards early investors. Meanwhile, growing interest in AI coins, known for reshaping traditional industries with advanced technology, is influencing the crypto market. With a top analyst predicting a rally within two weeks, the presale race is heating up amongst crypto users. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Battles Downtrend As UAE Partnership Gains Attention Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently formed a UAE partnership with the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MoEI), sparking speculation about its potential to reach $0.00005. This UAE partnership aims to bring blockchain technology into public sector services, boosting Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) credibility. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at approximately $0.00001655 , requiring an appreciation of over 200% to achieve $0.00005. Despite a downward trend in Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price, whales are still buying up the token, with one transaction involving over $20 million worth of SHIB moving to self-custody. Analysts believe this UAE partnership could be a game-changer, but the outcome will depend on market conditions and investor sentiment. As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to build on its UAE partnership, the crypto world is watching closely to see if it can hit the $0.00005 milestone. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Poised For Rally Amid AI Agent Boom The rapidly growing AI agent cryptocurrency sector, now valued at over $6 billion , is transforming the digital landscape. Amid this buzz, FloppyPepe (FPPE), a new meme token inspired by Matt Furie’s Pepe the Frog, is gaining momentum. With its playful charm, unique ecosystem, and presale discounted price of $0.0000002 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) is catching investors’ eyes beating the Shiba Inu prediction after the UAE partnership. A key highlight is the Meme-o-Matic , an AI agent enabling decentralized meme creation through user-submitted text prompts, videos, and images. Complementing this is FloppyX , an intelligent video AI bot framework that generates videos using text-based interactions. FloppyX offers real-time reactions, character depth, sentiment analysis, and more, creating a dynamic user experience. With its beta AI agent launching within two weeks, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to make waves in the meme coin and AI agent sectors. Adding to its appeal, this new meme token is collaborating with a leading artist to release regular hand-drawn pieces of FloppyPepe (FPPE) art, blending digital advancement with traditional creativity. To build investor confidence as a promising new meme token, FloppyPepe (FPPE), completed a smart contract audit by SolidProof, verifying its high standards for safety and transparency in its ongoing presale. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Gains Traction With Loyal Community Support Taking a community-driven approach to growth, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is rapidly building vibrant communities on Telegram and X, reflecting its rising popularity. Its private sale, which sold out in less than 24 hours, has added to the buzz surrounding its ongoing presale. A top crypto analyst believes this new meme token is set to rise in 2 weeks, challenging the momentum of Shiba Inu (SHIB), which is predicted to rally following the UAE partnership. FloppyPepe (FPPE), currently in its ongoing presale, is gaining attention from investors and top crypto analysts. Even popular crypto YouTuber NASS CRYPTO has highlighted FloppyPepe (FPPE) as an AI gem with significant growth potential. Sharing this insight with over 1 million subscribers, NASS CRYPTO hinted that this new meme token could be on the verge of massive gains. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) deflationary tokenomics are crafted to support long-term value. With 1% of every FloppyPepe (FPPE) transaction burned to increase scarcity and redistribution rewards encouraging holders, the token is structured to maintain profitability and stability. As demand grows and supply decreases, this new meme token value is set to rise, positioning early adopters and loyal community members for potential gains. Consider joining the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale at the current low price of $0.0000002 attracts potential gains when the price goes up.

Ever since Dogecoin’s rise, traders have been looking for other crypto assets that could replicate its story. First was Shiba Inu, then Floki and Pepe, among many others. Now, traders are looking at Cutoshi, a next-gen utility memecoin, as a potential candidate. Could Dogecoin Break $1? Memecoin king Dogecoin (DOGE) has come a long way since it started as a joke crypto. In 2021, the coin went from $0.01 and reached its all-time high at $0.73 in just a few months. This is an astounding 7200% increase in just a few months, which saw Doge reach a market cap of $85 billion. After a spectacular rise in 2021, it still has a strong community. Many of them believe that Doge still has the potential for massive gains. Most recently, analysts have revealed a major potential upside in the charts. Namely, Dogecoin had retested the $0.382 Fibonacci level, setting it up for a major rally. Analysts believe that the token could reach $0.618 in the following weeks, and even reach its new ATH of $1.272 . Source: The Crypto Basic The reason for these strong technicals is likely the excitement around Doge. Notably, Elon Musk now heads an unofficial department in the US government, which he calls DOGE. This department is in charge of holding government officials accountable. With Musk gaining more publicity than ever, Dogecoin traders hope that this biggest promoter of Dogecoin will help boost the token. This seems to be working, as the token has recently gained institutional recognition. Notably, investment firm Grayscale launched its own Grayscale Dogecoin Trust . This investment product will enable major institutions to gain exposure to Dogecoin, boosting its price. Just a few years ago, it was unthinkable that major financial players would invest in a joke crypto. However, with Musk in the pro-crypto Trump administration, it is not impossible. Still, due to its large market cap, Dogecoin is unlikely to see gains like in the early days. Can Cutoshi Replicate Dogecoin’s Success? While Dogecoin’s biggest gains are likely behind it, a new memecoin is emerging that may replicate its success. MemeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO) recently made news for significant acceleration in its presale. This new token already secured over $1.7 million in funding and is racing toward trading on the open market. On Thursday, February 13, Cutoshi developers announced that the development of its DEX and wallet is going faster than expected. For that reason, they cut the remaining six stages of the presale to just two. For traders, this was a good sign, as it shows that the team is confident about its success. The team is building a DeFi platform, with a memecoin twist to it. Cutoshi is both a memecoinand a utility token. Notably, it powers a decentralized ecosystem that allows users to trade without restrictions. What is more, Cutoshi is committed to decentralization and enables self-custody for its users. This roadmap, as well as early successes, have attracted significant investor interest. For this reason, some even believe that Cutoshi could replicate Dogecoin's early success.

Nonetheless, as Dogecoin encounters rising competition and regulatory oversight, a newcomer is emerging that investors think might outpace it. Remittix , which altcoin investors refer to as the next XRP, is emerging as a transformative player in blockchain payments, distinguished by its practical use and increasing acceptance, unlike conventional meme-based assets. Dogecoin faces challenges on its path to $1 While Dogecoin continues to be a significant token in the cryptocurrency landscape, its path to $1 has encountered obstacles, even with the recent recognition of Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF application by the SEC. This action may offer Dogecoin significant financial visibility, possibly increasing demand. Nonetheless, despite increasing institutional support, Dogecoin's price recently fell to $0.26, illustrating persistent market fluctuations. Per X platform, an analyst called Ali stated that DOGE “has pulled back from the 0.618 Fib level, also known as the Golden Ratio”, which often indicates that a bullish reversal will occur. In contrast to developing blockchain assets that emphasize practical financial uses, Dogecoin has an inadequate payment system. Altcoin Investors Are Calling The Next XRP: Remittix’s rise to dominance As Dogecoin finds it difficult to surpass the $1 mark, Remittix is rapidly gaining traction as the upcoming major player in blockchain finance. Investors are viewing Remittix as the next XRP because of its quick crypto-to-fiat transfers, minimal fees, and smooth connection with worldwide banking systems. Remittix is offering a complete ecosystem for payments and remittances. The capacity to transform cryptocurrency into traditional currency and deposit it straight into bank accounts is revolutionary, addressing one of the major obstacles in blockchain finance. Consequently, both institutional and retail investors are considering Remittix as a leading investment option. Dogecoin vs. Remittix: Which will hit $1 first? The discussion persists on whether Dogecoin or Remittix will be the first to exceed the $1 mark. Dogecoin boasts a rich history and a robust community, yet it falls short in real-world adoption compared to Remittix , which is a financial giant. Investors looking for sustained growth and viable blockchain uses are betting on Remittix to surpass Dogecoin in terms of both price gains and user adoption. In contrast to Dogecoin's speculative characteristics, Remittix's banking connections, smooth fiat transactions, and prospects for widespread adoption position it as the perfect blockchain-based financial solution. As an increasing number of companies utilize Remittix for daily payments and international transactions, its value proposition grows even more compelling. Why Remittix’s presale and giveaway are accelerating its growth A major factor contributing to Remittix’s swift ascent is its effective presale, which has attracted considerable interest from initial investors. Having raised more than $12 million, it is becoming one of the most in-demand blockchain endeavors of 2025. In contrast to meme coins that rely on hype from the community, the presale success of Remittix is grounded in concrete financial solutions, making it a much more dependable investment. Moreover, Remittix's current giveaway is enhancing adoption even more, bringing in thousands of new users who see its practical payment functions. By encouraging new users to navigate its ecosystem, Remittix is promoting ongoing market expansion. Dogecoin’s Meme Appeal vs. Remittix’s Real-World Utility Although Dogecoin is cherished by many, its absence of an operational payment system places it at a disadvantage in an ever-changing cryptocurrency landscape. Remittix, conversely, is transforming the functioning of blockchain finance, providing an efficient method for people and companies to send money globally. Remittix’s advanced financial framework, widespread acceptance, and practical usability position it as the better option for investors aiming for enduring stability and expansion.

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 126,300 followers on the social media platform X that XRP appears to be on the verge of a breakout as it forms a cup-and-handle pattern. The structure suggests that an asset is bullish as buyers step in to prevent prices from revisiting recent lows. Says Martinez, “If XRP is following a cup and handle pattern, a breakout could set the stage for a move toward $3.35!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that XRP will trigger a breakout after breaching the pattern’s resistance at $2.80. At time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.74. Turning to the layer-1 protocol Avalanche ( AVAX ), Martinez says the altcoin will likely see a rise in demand once it falls to the lower boundary of a wide trading range. “The key support level for Avalanche AVAX stands at $20!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that AVAX is trading between a range high of $56 and a range low of $20. At time of writing, AVAX is worth $24.95. Looking at top memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the trader believes the altcoin is carving a local bottom at a key Fibonacci retracement level. Traders use the Fibonacci tool to spot potential entry and exit points based on the Fibonacci ratio. “Dogecoin DOGE has pulled back to the 0.618 Fib level, also known as the Golden Ratio. This is a key area where bullish reversals often occur!” Source: Ali Martinez/X According to the trader’s chart, he suggests that DOGE needs to hold $0.25 to have a shot at reversing its downtrend. At time of writing, DOGE is worth $0.266. As for fellow memecoin Pepe ( PEPE ), the analyst warns that the altcoin needs to hold its diagonal support to avoid witnessing a deep corrective move. “This is a crucial level for PEPE. If it holds above $0.0000092, a rebound could follow. But a break below may open the door for a move toward $0.0000032.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, PEPE is trading for $0.00000978.

From DeFi offering unrestricted banking services to NFTs that redefine ownership of digital assets, real breakthroughs are happening far from the usual noise and speculation. These aren’t mere ideas; they’re practical, investable ventures that are making waves right now. We’re diving into four of the best crypto coins that are not just awaiting approval but are actively expanding and carving out significant market presence. 1. Web3Bay: Fairness in Online Shopping Redefined Forget everything you know about online shopping. Traditional platforms dominate with high fees, algorithm manipulation, and invasive data practices. Enter Web3Bay (3BAY), which flips the script with a decentralized marketplace where transparency and freedom rule the day. Sellers get to keep a bigger slice of the pie with reduced fees, while buyers gain 3BAY tokens, not just from purchases but also through active participation and engagement. Web3Bay runs on community-led governance, unlike the top-down control seen in traditional retail, empowering users with real decision-making power. The buzz is real: $1.4 million has already been funneled into Web3Bay’s presale, with over 350 million 3BAY tokens snapped up across three sold-out stages. The fourth stage is flying off the shelves at just $0.004562625 per token, with early investors eyeing a jaw-dropping 6,430% ROI by launch. As conventional e-commerce tightens its grip, Web3Bay stands out as a rare gem that hands power and profits back to the user. Will you seize the moment with one of the best crypto coins before it hits the mainstream? 2. Helium: Take Control of Your Wi-Fi Tired of being at the mercy of traditional internet giants? Helium challenges this norm by empowering you to build your own decentralized wireless network. Say goodbye to big telecom and hello to personal hotspots, rewarding you with HNT tokens for expanding IoT coverage for devices like smart meters and GPS trackers. This straightforward swap of resources for rewards could revolutionize smart cities and industries relying on IoT. With HNT currently trading at $4.33, its growth is steady, signaling a simmering potential ready to explode. 3. Gala: Actual Ownership of Your Gaming Loot Gamers pour billions into virtual goods without true ownership—Gala Games is changing the game by using blockchain to ensure you really own your digital assets. From weaponry to virtual real estate, Gala enables gamers to trade, sell, or hold onto their assets across various games. With GALA token trading at $0.03108 and a bustling $119.5 million in daily transactions, the platform is more than just active—it’s a thriving digital ecosystem. 4. Bittensor: AI Liberation from Corporate Clutches AI development is currently a playground for the big tech elite. Bittensor disrupts this by democratizing AI, opening up the field to a broader spectrum of developers and researchers through a decentralized, open-source network that also rewards contributions. TAO tokens incentivize the community to refine and advance AI models. Bittensor is not just one of today’s best crypto coins for its ideals but also poses a challenge: Can it rival the efficiency of AI giants like Google and OpenAI with its decentralized model? That’s the billion-dollar question. Choosing Today’s Best Crypto Coins The blockchain space is bursting with innovation, but it’s the real-world applications that distinguish the best crypto coins from the fleeting trends. Helium is proving that decentralized networks can take on telecom titans. Bittensor is on a mission to make AI universally accessible, while Gala asserts the rights of gamers to own their digital treasures truly. Each initiative is not just making a statement—they’re gaining substantial traction. With $1.4 million already raised and over 350 million tokens distributed, Web3Bay exemplifies that decentralized commerce is not just viable—it’s vibrant and growing. These opportunities are fleeting; those who act swiftly are the ones who stand to gain the most.

Ripple (XRP) Tumbles 6% in 3-Days as Traders Take Profits on ETF Hype Ripple (XRP) price came under noticeable selling pressure over the weekend, as investors capitalized on the recent buzz surrounding a potential XRP spot ETF to lock in profits. The week began on a high note, with XRP surging by 22% between Feb. 10 and Feb. 14. Much of this upside momentum stemmed from renewed optimism that the US SEC’s acknowledgment of the Grayscale’s Dogecoin and XRP spot ETF filings could lead to an influx of institutional demand. However, the gains were short-lived. Hours after the official confirmation surfaced, XRP’s price retraced sharply, reflecting a classic “sell-the-news” scenario often observed in cryptocurrency markets. Ripple (XRP) Price Action The Ripple price action chart above highlights how quickly market sentiment can shift when major announcements fail to deliver immediate follow-through. Having reached a peak of $2.80 on Friday, XRP shed roughly 7% to trade at $2.60 by Monday morning. This rapid reversal indicates that, despite the bullish catalyst of the SEC acknowledgment, many short-term traders deemed the move overextended and chose to exit their positions. A look at the chart reveals three consecutive losing sessions since the ETF acknowledgment. This pullback underscores the delicate balance between bullish optimism over potential regulatory breakthroughs and the reality of profit-taking by short-term traders. As is often the case in crypto markets, a single catalyst can spark both surges and sell-offs in quick succession, leaving the long-term direction in question. Still, XRP’s ability to remain above the $2.60–$2.65 support zone has provided a degree of optimism. While the market has witnessed a steady outflow of speculative capital, the robust bid at these price levels suggests that buyers remain prepared to defend XRP against further declines. Whether this support will hold if the broader market sentiment sours remains to be seen, but for now, it has acted as a buffer against a steeper correction. The price reversal in recent days may also reflect a typical pattern in cryptocurrency trading, where investors buy the rumor (or hype) and sell the news. Once the acknowledgment of the ETF filing was made public, many short-term speculators who had been anticipating a more substantial surge found an opportunity to take profits. As a result, the market is now in a consolidation phase, with XRP looking to establish a new equilibrium before the next major move. Speculative Demand Plunges into Negative Values as Markets Await Next Bullish Catalyst Even as XRP has lost 7% of its value since the SEC acknowledged the XRP spot ETF, the derivatives market offers a deeper glimpse into the evolving sentiment. Data from CryptoQuant ’s Taker Buy/Sell ratio reveals that bearish momentum could persist unless a fresh catalyst materializes. This ratio measures whether the most recently executed trades were initiated by buyers or sellers, providing real-time insight into the market’s appetite for risk. According to the chart below, XRP’s Taker Buy/Sell ratio dropped into negative territory at 0.93 on Feb. 17, an 8% decline from the 1.02 reading recorded on Feb. 13. A negative Taker Buy/Sell ratio implies that sellers are more aggressive than buyers, often indicating waning speculative demand. Ripple (XRP) Take Buy/Sell Ratio | Source: CryptoQuant In other words, instead of stepping in to buy the dip, traders appear to be positioning for further downside or closing out existing positions in anticipation of more significant volatility ahead. Such a drop in speculative demand can be concerning for a market reliant on momentum-driven inflows. Historically, when Taker Buy/Sell ratios fall below 1.0 for an extended period, it suggests that the path of least resistance may be to the downside. This is particularly relevant now, given XRP’s proximity to the $2.60 support level. If that level fails, the psychological $2.50 mark could be tested next, potentially triggering a wave of sell orders from traders seeking to minimize losses. Still, the situation is not entirely bearish. A quick recovery in the Taker Buy/Sell ratio—coupled with a renewed wave of buying interest—could reignite upward momentum, especially if broader market sentiment turns positive or additional regulatory progress unfolds. Until then, XRP appears to be in a wait-and-see phase, with its near-term fate hinging on whether buyers can outmatch the current wave of speculative selling. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Struggle to Hold Key Support at $2.59 Amid Weak Momentum Ripple’s XRP trades at $2.639, down 0.79% on the day, as price action battles to maintain footing above the 50-day EMA at $2.5889. The coin remains trapped between the 50-day EMA and the 200-day EMA at $1.7337, forming a precarious range where a decisive break could determine the next trend. XRP Price Forecast A short-term bullish setup emerged with a 21.95% gain in five days, but sellers quickly erased momentum, leading to a 6.87% retracement in three days with high selling volume. The 100-day EMA at $2.2536 is a crucial support level; a breakdown below could see XRP testing the 200-day EMA at $1.7337. However, a strong recovery above $2.6453, the 20-day EMA, could re-ignite bullish sentiment. Volume bars reveal declining bullish activity, reinforcing concerns about a sustained rally. If bulls fail to reclaim $2.65, XRP risks slipping toward $2.25. A breakout above $2.65, however, could see renewed strength toward $3.00. Until a definitive move occurs, traders remain cautious.

BTC-S&P 500 Correlation Hits Zero,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-independent-btc-sp-500-correlation-zero/,"Data shows the Correlation between Bitcoin and S&P 500 has declined to zero recently, a sign that BTC is no longer attached to the stock market. Bitcoin Correlation To S&P 500 Has Witnessed A Plunge Recently In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed about the trend in the Correlation between Bitcoin and S&P 500. The “Correlation” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of how tied together the prices of any two given assets are. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Investors Sitting On 54% Profit Despite Price Plunge When the value of this metric is positive, it means the price of one of the assets is reacting to movements in the other by traveling in the same direction. The closer is the indicator to 1, the stronger is this relationship. On the other hand, the metric being under the zero mark implies that while there is also some correlation present between the assets in this case, it’s a negative one. This suggests that the charts are moving in the opposite direction to each other. For this zone, the extreme point is -1, corresponding to the tightest relationship. Now, here is the chart for the Correlation shared by the analytics firm, which shows the trend in the metric’s value for Bitcoin and S&P 500 over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Correlation between Bitcoin and S&P 500 rose close to the 1 mark during January, which means the prices of the two were showing a strong positive relationship. Since peaking at the start of this month, though, the indicator has observed a sharp downward trajectory, and its value has today come down to exactly zero. Such a value implies there is no correlation whatsoever present between the assets. In statistics, the variables are said to be independent in this scenario. The Correlation can be a useful indicator to watch for when an investor wants to diversify their holdings. Assets that have a close relationship may not be worth investing in at the same time, but ones that have a low value of the metric can make for smart diversification options. As it is currently, the S&P 500 could provide something different to Bitcoin investors and vice versa. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Volume Close To Growing Again: Bullish Sign? “The last time we saw such a low correlation was on November 5th, 2024, just before Bitcoin soared past the 100k mark,” notes IntoTheBlock. With BTC free from the stock market once more, it’s possible that the cryptocurrency could show a big move this time as well. It only remains to be seen, however, how long the coin can stay away from the influence of traditional assets. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued its recent trend of consolidation during the last few days as its price is still locked around the $96,000 level.

This represents an increase of over $220,000 in just a few months. JPMorgan expands crypto ETF portfolio with major investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum funds The bank disclosed in its most recent 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it has greatly expanded its exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The bank has invested $984,000 in Bitcoin ETFs and $32,300 in Ethereum ETFs through various products. Among its Bitcoin ETF investments, JPMorgan has made a $523,000 investment in the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO), a $290,000 investment in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), a $68,000 investment in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), a $55,000 investment in the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), and a $37,000 investment in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). The bank places its bets on Ethereum spot ETFs, which include investments in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), which amounts to $23,800, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), worth $6,200, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), valued at $2,100, and a small amount of $102 in the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH). JPMorgan joins Goldman Sachs in increasing Bitcoin ETF holdings JPMorgan Chase’s choice to expand its ETF portfolio is in sync with other financial institutions, such as Goldman Sachs, that are also stepping up their stake in Bitcoin ETFs. According to Goldman Sachs’ latest SEC filing, the bank now holds $1.27 billion in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), representing 24,077,861 shares. Goldman Sachs also disclosed a $288 million stake in Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), holding 3,530,486 shares. Goldman Sachs’ Bitcoin ETF holdings have increased dramatically, with an 88% rise in IBIT shares and a 105% rise in its FBTC position in the last quarter. However, the growth in institutional investment has not affected digital asset funds, which have recorded their first significant withdrawal in 2025. Investors removed $415 million from crypto funds last week, with most of the outflows coming from Bitcoin-based products, such as spot ETFs, which saw net withdrawals of $430 million. According to CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s cautious stance on interest rate cuts triggered the sell-off. “ The U.S. central bank need not be in a hurry to cut rates ,” Powell said, reinforcing investor concerns that looser monetary policy may take longer than expected.

The proposal by investment firm Strategic Capital cited issues such as CEO pay, financial performance, and transparency. Strategic Capital, which has a 5.4% stake in Gunho, said GungHo has failed to launch a new game of similar success to Puzzle & Dragons since 2012 and squandered 100 billion yen ($640 million) on new games. A key concern raised was that CEO Kazuki Morishita’s salary increased from 120 million yen to 340 million yen ($2.2 million) in the last ten years, while the operating profits decreased by 69%. The report also pointed out that Morishita earns nearly the same pay as Nintendo’s CEO despite the tremendous disparity between the two companies’ sizes. Strategic Capital proposed seven changes, the first of which was a remuneration review of GungHo with an emphasis on executives. GungHo’s response and rationale In response to all of the proposals by Strategic Capital, the Board of Directors of GungHo voted against them in a unanimous manner. The company justified Morishita’s high compensation package asserting that he has been GungHo’s CEO for more than two decades. They specifically noted that he was responsible for the development of Ragnarok Online as well as the popularity of Puzzle & Dragons for over a decade. GungHo also dismissed the notion that it cannot create another hit game, saying that the mobile gaming market is very saturated. They added that this makes it nearly impossible for a company to produce a game like Puzzle & Dragons again. The mobile gaming industry has advanced quite strongly since the time Puzzle & Dragons set a precedent for the gacha mechanics. However, the game was not unique of its kind. Dragon Collection , first launched in 2010 as a card-battle game on the GREE platform, is generally considered the first mobile Japanese game to feature gacha. On remuneration, GungHo claimed that it complied with rules and regulations by adopting a completely transparent remuneration policy. The company further noted that the inclusions made by shareholders in their demand for extra disclosure were irrelevant. Despite rejecting the proposals, GungHo has since made changes in its shareholder return policy. It changed the policy regarding dividends and share repurchases to focus on an active return to its shareholders. Also, the company enhanced its remuneration policy by including independent outside directors in the committee responsible for setting executives’ pay. On the same day, GungHo released its financial statements for the fiscal year 2024, in which all the key performance indicators had declined.

While Solana and Dogecoin remain top players in the market, their large market caps limit growth. As such, investors are always on the lookout for ‘the next Dogecoin or Solana.’ An analysis by DeepSeek AI, points to a new token priced at just $0.01. When asked to pick one under $1 cryptocurrency that could outperform Solana and Dogecoin in 2025, its answer was Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a player many have yet to discover. Unlike meme-driven Dogecoin or the high-performance but saturated Solana ecosystem, Mutuum Finance is a rising force in decentralized finance (DeFi). Offering an innovative lending and borrowing protocol, it aims to revolutionize how users interact with crypto liquidity, giving everyday investors access to secure, overcollateralized loans while generating passive income through lending pools. Currently, MUTM is in its first phase of the presale at $0.01, a low entry price that makes it an attractive bet for early investors. Over 50% of Phase 1 tokens have already been sold, and the presale has now surpassed 1,000 holders. This is the only opportunity to buy MUTM at $0.01, as Phase 2 will bring a price increase to $0.015, pushing it closer to its confirmed launch price of $0.06, a 600% gain for early investors. In contrast, Solana is trading at $195, making a 10x return significantly harder to achieve. Dogecoin, despite its cult-like following, remains heavily reliant on hype rather than real-world adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Gaining Momentum in DeFi Mutuum Finance is performing well in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market by transforming the lending and borrowing sector. By eliminating middlemen, the platform enables lenders to earn passive income while giving borrowers access to secure, overcollateralized loans. Mutuum Finance offers two lending approaches, enhancing user flexibility: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Features dynamic interest rates to optimize returns. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Allows direct lending, reducing dependence on liquidity pools and giving users greater control over their assets. Mutuum Finance implements a robust token buyback strategy, using platform profits to sustain demand for MUTM and drive long-term value growth. Borrowers benefit from competitive interest rates, instant liquidity, and upcoming multi-chain support, creating a scalable and rewarding ecosystem. Presale with High Growth Potential The ongoing MUTM presale has attracted strong investor interest, with 45.5% of the 4 billion token supply allocated to early buyers for post-launch liquidity. Currently priced at $0.01 in the first presale phase, the token is set to reach $0.06 upon launch, a confirmed 600% gain. Analysts foresee potential growth to $1 as exchange listings roll out. Over $640,000 has already been raised from more than 1,000 investors, with Phase 1 surpassing the halfway mark as demand surges. Mutuum Finance is committed to continuous innovation, with future developments including: Advanced analytics and enhanced smart contracts Strengthened security measures Multi-chain integration Staking rewards and ecosystem expansion These enhancements position MUTM for sustainable growth, making now an opportune moment for early investors to secure tokens before further price increases. To drive adoption, Mutuum Finance is launching a $100,000 giveaway, awarding 10 lucky winners $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. Additionally, the referral program rewards users with bonus tokens for successful invites, fostering community engagement and long-term loyalty. Mutuum Finance is set to disrupt DeFi with real utility, strong tokenomics, and high-growth potential. Over 50% of Phase 1 is sold, and 1,000+ holders have already joined. This is the last chance to buy MUTM at $0.01 before the price increases.

The current market sentiment appears bearish, with major assets experiencing notable declines. SOL has also broken below its crucial support level of $180. Solana (SOL) Price Action and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, SOL has been gaining support from this crucial level since November 2024 and has tested it multiple times. Source: Trading View However, this time, as the asset fails to sustain, it loses this key level and closes a daily candle below $180, partially confirming a bearish move ahead. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, there is a strong possibility that SOL could witness a 15% price drop, reaching the $155 level in the coming days. $115 Million Worth SOL Outflow Following this notable breakdown, investors and long-term holders have been accumulating SOL tokens, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow and outflow reveal that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $115 million worth of the asset, indicating potential accumulation. Source: Coinglass In this bearish market trend, such outflows can create buying pressure and potentially lead to a price rebound. However, intraday traders appear to be following long-term holders, as they seem to be betting on the long side. $45 Million Worth Long Bet Data shows that traders holding long positions are strongly dominating the asset and are over-leveraged at $174.3, with $45 million worth of long positions. With such significant open positions, this level acts as a crucial support. Conversely, $180 is another key level where traders holding short positions are over-leveraged, with $15.50 million worth of short positions. This suggests that short sellers are exhausted, which could help bulls reclaim the lost support level. Source: Coinglass Current Price Momentum SOL is currently trading near $177 and has experienced a 6% price drop in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume surged by 110%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors amid the price decline.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-18 02:00:08

Is This the Future of E-Commerce?,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bays-1-4m-presale-proves-investors-love-blockchain-shopping-is-this-the-future-of-e-commerce/,"Online shopping has long been dominated by centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay, where high transaction fees and restrictive policies limit seller profits and increase costs for buyers. Web3Bay aims to disrupt this industry by leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace. Unlike traditional platforms, Web3Bay eliminates intermediaries, allowing buyers and sellers to transact directly. This approach significantly reduces transaction fees, which can range from 10% to 15% on centralized marketplaces, giving sellers a better profit margin and buyers lower prices. Additionally, all transactions are secured and verified through smart contracts, ensuring fraud prevention and transparency without relying on third parties. Web3Bay Presale Success and Market Potential Web3Bay’s 3BAY token presale has gained strong momentum, reflecting investor confidence in decentralized e-commerce. As of February 14, 2025, the presale has raised over $1.4 million, selling nearly 340 million tokens across four stages. Currently priced at $0.004562625, the token’s value is set to increase progressively across 28 stages, reaching an estimated launch price of $0.1959. The structured price increases reward early backers, potentially offering a 6000% ROI post-launch. Web3Bay’s success aligns with the broader market shift towards blockchain-based solutions in finance, gaming, and now e-commerce. Investors view the platform as a viable alternative to centralized giants, with its low-cost transactions, decentralized governance, and direct user control driving adoption. Challenges and Future Prospects for Decentralized Shopping While Web3Bay’s fee-free model and decentralized governance are appealing, it faces challenges in user acquisition, merchant adoption, and competition with established platforms. Success will depend on the platform’s ability to provide a seamless shopping experience, integrate with existing crypto payment networks, and onboard sellers at scale. However, the growing dissatisfaction with centralized platforms and increasing demand for fairer, blockchain-powered marketplaces suggest a strong future for Web3Bay. If the platform delivers on its promises, it could position itself as a major competitor to Amazon and eBay, redefining online shopping through blockchain technology.

Base, ZKsync Era, and Arbitrum One are the chains taking the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place after Ethereum, having accumulated $39.53 million, $37.69 million, and $34.60 million in DeFi fees, respectively. The data also indicated that Ethereum Layer 1 is still leading in weekly DeFi fees, accumulating a little over $1 million. Base and Arbitrum One are the 2nd and 3rd chains in weekly fees, accumulating over $179,000 and $22,000, respectively. The Ethereum on-chain data platform highlighted the massive gap between Ethereum and other chains in terms of fees. The chain is still significantly lower from its daily DeFi fee highs recorded in May 2023 and March 2024. Ethereum has recorded a little over $170,000 in daily DeFi fees as of February 15, lower than its highs of over $11 million in May 2023. Growthepie also highlighted that the other chains are also down significantly, with most posting zero daily fees while some managed only a few thousand dollars in fees. The data further revealed that Ethereum CeFi transaction fees are significantly lower than DeFi fees, with all-time CeFi fees standing at a little over $635 million. Weekly CeFi transaction fees on Ethereum Layer 1 are still higher than DeFi weekly fees on the chain, standing at a little over $1.9 million as of February 15. The DeFi transaction count on Ethereum Layer 1 is notably lower than Base, ZKsync Era, and Arbitrum One, standing at a little over 149 million all-time transactions. Base has recorded over 352 million all-time DeFi transactions, while ZKsync Era and Arbitrum One have recorded over 150 million and 155 million transactions, respectively. Vitalik Buterin advocates for Ethereum Layer 1 dominance in DeFi Reasons to have higher L1 gas limits even in an L2-heavy Ethereum https://t.co/BMFhzoO8bE — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 14, 2025 The Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently released a proposal suggesting the scaling of Ethereum Layer 1 10 times more amid the slowing activity on the base layer. Buterin explained the need for more scaling to support over 120 million Ethereum users weekly. The Ethereum co-founder added that the scaling would lower Ethereum’s gas fees, improve the network’s security, and introduce rollups support. Buterin also expressed concern about potential censorship on Layer 2s, especially when the chains are congested. The blockchain’s co-founder explained that centralized sequencers worsened L2 censorship. The scaling proposal suggested force-inclusion mechanisms that would allow users to shift to the base layer and complete transactions in case of censorship. Buterin confirmed that the mechanism would also allow massive exit events without crippling gas fees. The proposal also suggested a continued increase in Ethereum’s base layer gas limits. Buterin pointed out the recent increase in gas limits from 30 million to 36 million. The Ethereum co-founder still pointed out the issues that might come in the long term, including the difficulty in reducing the gas limit compared to increasing the limit. Ethereum Layer 2 facing scalability issues the clip for you @rajgokal https://t.co/nDPDyfp1kf pic.twitter.com/j7WKD5TOmM — Good Game (@goodgamepodxyz) February 9, 2025 Buterin’s suggestion to scale up Ethereum Layer 1 comes amid the chain’s Layer 2 struggles, including decreasing gas fees and users. On-chain data has revealed that Ethereum Layer 2 gas fees had dropped below 1 Gwei, the lowest it has been in 5 years. The low fees further indicated the dwindling on-chain activity on the chain’s Layer 2s. A recent interview with Alliance DAO’s Qiao Wang on The Good Game podcast revealed that he had lost faith in the capabilities of Ethereum L2s. The Alliance DAO co-founder further highlighted that protocols performed better on other chains than Ethereum. Wang insisted that it would be wiser for developers to build on Solana rather than Ethereum. The Alliance DAO co-founder still mentioned that the blockchain’s scalability remained an issue despite its strong ecosystem. Wang also explained that current users were depending on the chain because ‘they have been in it for too long.’ The DeFi protocol’s executive said that the issues on the blockchain led to him shifting to other options.

He saw the initiative as something positive and simply helped spread the word. Despite defending his actions, Milei acknowledged the political backlash and the lessons he has learned from the controversy. “I made no mistakes because I acted in good faith. But when I look at the political repercussions, I realize I have something to learn. I need to understand that after becoming president, I continued acting like the same Javier Milei as before. Unfortunately, this situation shows me that I need to raise my filters and not make myself so accessible.” Argentine President Javier Milei LIBRA gained huge attention after Milei mentioned it publicly, which contributed to its rapid price surge from zero to over $4. Its value quickly plummeted to less than 50 cents leading to speculations of market manipulation. Early investors reportedly cashed out over $100 million, leaving later purchases with significant losses. Political tensions have increased in Argentina as a result of the incident, and opposition leaders are calling for Milei to be removed from office for allegedly deceiving the people. The nation’s anti-corruption office is currently conducting a separate inquiry in addition to a legal probe headed by Federal Judge María Servini. The S&P Merval stock index fell by about 5% as a result of the scandal, which also rocked Argentina’s financial markets. Even though Milei insists he did nothing wrong, the debate is still going strong and his administration is coming under more scrutiny.

This impressive climb is primarily attributed to unexpected USD weakness, triggered by disappointing US economic data and a shift in market sentiment regarding future Federal Reserve actions. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors tracking global financial trends, these Forex movements offer valuable insights into broader market dynamics and risk appetite. Let’s dive into the key factors propelling the Aussie Dollar’s ascent and what it means for the currency market. Decoding the Australian Dollar’s Stunning Rise Amidst USD Weakness The Australian Dollar’s (AUD) recent strength is primarily a story of USD weakness. Several factors have converged to weaken the US Dollar, paving the way for the Aussie to shine. Let’s break down the key drivers: US Retail Sales Miss: January’s US Retail Sales figures were shockingly weak, contracting by 0.9% month-over-month, significantly missing the -0.1% forecast. This disappointing data ignited concerns about a potential slowdown in the US economy, prompting investors to reassess their USD holdings. Tariff Delay Relief: US President Trump’s decision to postpone the implementation of reciprocal tariffs offered temporary relief to risk-sensitive currencies like the Australian Dollar. This move eased immediate concerns about escalating global trade tensions, boosting risk appetite and benefiting the AUD. Fed Rate Pause Expectations: The weak Retail Sales data has led to increased speculation that the Federal Reserve might hold off on further interest rate hikes in March. Market participants are now pricing in a higher probability (around 55%) of rates remaining on hold, reducing the appeal of the USD, which typically benefits from higher interest rate expectations. While US Industrial Production showed a modest 0.5% increase in January, slightly beating estimates, the negative Retail Sales data overshadowed this positive figure, reinforcing concerns about the health of the US economy and further contributing to USD weakness . Forex News : Aussie Dollar’s Momentum and Technical Outlook From a technical perspective, the AUD/USD pair is exhibiting bullish momentum. Having gained 0.65% to reach 0.6355, the pair has decisively broken above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a key indicator of short-term trend. Key technical indicators further support this bullish outlook: Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI currently sits at 66, nearing overbought territory but still trending upwards. This indicates strong buying pressure and suggests further potential for upward movement in the AUD/USD pair. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): The MACD histogram is showing increasing green bars, a clear sign of building upside momentum. This reinforces the bullish sentiment and suggests that the upward trend is likely to continue in the near term. However, traders remain vigilant. The market is still sensitive to potential shifts, especially concerning new tariff announcements and any unexpected positive US economic data surprises, which could swiftly reverse the current trend and impact the Currency Market . Australian Dollar vs. RBA Rate Cut Speculation Despite the Aussie’s recent strength, domestic factors are still at play. Speculation about a potential 25-basis-point rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) persists. This speculation is fueled by: Cooling Inflationary Pressure: Domestic inflation in Australia is showing signs of easing, which could prompt the RBA to consider a rate cut to stimulate economic growth. Subdued Consumer Outlook: Concerns about consumer spending and overall economic activity in Australia are adding to the pressure on the RBA to consider easing monetary policy. The interplay between global factors driving USD weakness and domestic pressures on the RBA creates a complex landscape for the AUD/USD pair. While the current momentum favors the Aussie, the potential for an RBA rate cut could limit its upside in the longer term. Navigating the Forex Market : Key Factors for the Australian Dollar Understanding the fundamental drivers of the Australian Dollar is crucial for navigating the Forex market. Several key factors influence the AUD’s value: Factor Impact on AUD RBA Interest Rates Higher rates generally support AUD, lower rates weaken AUD. Iron Ore Prices As Australia’s top export, rising iron ore prices boost AUD, falling prices weaken it. Chinese Economic Health Strong Chinese economy (Australia’s largest trading partner) strengthens AUD, weaker economy weakens it. Trade Balance Positive trade balance (more exports than imports) strengthens AUD, negative balance weakens it. Market Sentiment (Risk-On/Risk-Off) Risk-on sentiment (investors seeking riskier assets) is positive for AUD, risk-off (flight to safety) is negative. By monitoring these factors, traders and investors can gain a better understanding of potential AUD movements and make more informed decisions in the dynamic Currency Market . Conclusion: Aussie Dollar’s Bullish Run Amidst Uncertainty The Australian Dollar’s recent surge to multi-month highs is a compelling example of how global economic factors and market sentiment can swiftly influence Forex movements. Fueled by unexpected USD weakness and temporary relief from trade tensions, the Aussie has capitalized on the opportunity. However, with RBA rate cut speculation looming and ongoing global economic uncertainties, the path ahead for the AUD/USD pair remains subject to shifts. Traders should closely monitor upcoming economic data releases, central bank announcements, and geopolitical developments to navigate this dynamic market effectively.

Bloomberg Analysts Say FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Next In Line For 6,429% Surge",https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-and-dogecoin-doge-losing-steam-bloomberg/,"Top Bloomberg analysts have picked the new FloppyPepe (FPPE) as the better buy ahead of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). The new token combines the perks of being an AI agent with its meme appeal, giving it an edge over other crypto assets in both spaces. With the AI crypto sector gaining traction and the meme ecosystem looking set to recover, FloppyPepe (FPPE) could be the next big crypto asset. Analysts predict a 6,429% surge for FloppyPepe (FPPE), and early presale investors could gain more. Learn more about FloppyPepe (FPPE) in this article. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Combines AI Crypto Features with Meme Appeal There’s a growing interest in the AI crypto sector, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to benefit from this. The new AI crypto project will ride on the technological advancement of the AI crypto space and Matt Furie’s cultural significance in the meme space to build a strong community where creatives can access tools for content creation, get the recognition they deserve, and earn from their creations. FloppyPepe (PEPE) will feature video generation and text-to-image AI agents. These AI agents will enable users to show their creativity by helping creators produce top-quality videos and images that can bring them income and fame. Creators will have access to these AI agents on FloppyPepe’s fast-growing Telegram community , and the text-to-image agent is set to be ready for use in two weeks. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining massive attention in the crypto space. Top YouTube channels like NASS CRYPTO are already telling millions of their subscribers that the meme coin is the next big thing. Bloomberg analysts also believe the AI crypto coin could pump massively soon. FloppyPepe’s (PEPE) deflationary nature makes the Bloomberg analyst’s prediction a strong possibility. With every 1% of the meme coin’s transaction, tokens are burned to induce scarcity. The AI crypto coin also gives redistribution rewards , encouraging long-term token holding. This allows FloppyPepe (FPPE) to remain profitable, stable, and responsive to the power of demand and supply in the market. Hence, it may remain a top-performing meme coin and AI crypto token for long. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Tipped to Rebound If Key Support Holds Firm Crypto analysts have revealed that Shiba Inu (SHIB) has moved above a descending trendline, indicating a growing buy action at its critical support area. This could prevent further Shiba Inu (SHIB) downtrend, helping the meme coin maintain its current price of $0.000016. According to Bloomberg analysts, if it holds its key support area, Shiba Inu (SHIB) could test the resistance around $0.00001950 – $0.00002050. A successful breach of this resistance region will see Shiba Inu (SHIB) rebound. However, if Shiba Inu (SHIB) loses its current support zone, it could drop to a lower support level of around $0.0000140. Dogecoin (DOGE) to Retest $0.30 Resistance Soon Bloomberg analysts have identified Dogecoin’s (DOGE) current price as a critical support level. According to them, the Dogecoin (DOGE) $0.2585 current price is above its VWAP (Volume-weighted Average Price), and it’s a key support area. If Dogecoin (DOGE) happens to break out of this zone, a significant upward trend could emerge, pushing the meme coin towards $0.30 resistance. However, a break below the VWAP could prompt a Dogecoin (DOGE) downward rally, with $0.20 being its next support. Bloomberg analysts say optimism on Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF approval could keep Dogecoin (DOGE) above its VWAP. Conclusion FloppyPepe (PEPE) is not like every meme coin or AI crypto token, which gives it a better profit potential than Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and other AI crypto tokens. The meme coin runs a stage-based pricing presale, implying that early presale investors would gain the most from its potential boom. This has increased interest in its presale. Skeptical investors have become more trusting of FloppyPepe (FPPE) after learning it passed smart contract audits by Solidproof . FloppyPepe (PEPE) looks poised to boom, and smart investors won’t miss out on it. Join the presale now at a low price of $0.0000002.

Today, we’re diving deep into the GBP/JPY currency pair, which is currently at a fascinating juncture. After a recent dip, GBP/JPY is testing a critical support level around 191.00. Is this a temporary pause before a rebound, or are we looking at further declines? Let’s break down the latest GBP/JPY price analysis to understand what’s driving this currency cross and what traders should watch out for. Decoding the GBP/JPY’s Price Action: What’s Happening? The GBP/JPY pair is currently hovering around the 191.00 mark during the European trading session on Monday, continuing a losing streak for the third day in a row. This price point is particularly interesting because it coincides with the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Let’s look at the key factors influencing this: Immediate Support Test: GBP/JPY is testing immediate support at the nine-day EMA, precisely at 191.00. This level is acting as a crucial near-term floor. Bearish Momentum Building: The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped below 50. This is a significant signal, indicating that bearish momentum is gaining strength. Resistance Looms: On the upside, the pair faces immediate resistance at the 14-day EMA, currently positioned at 191.17. Breaking through this resistance is key for any potential bullish reversal. Descending Channel Pattern: A look at the daily chart reveals that GBP/JPY is moving within a descending channel. This pattern generally suggests a prevailing bearish bias in the medium term. Essentially, GBP/JPY is caught in a tug-of-war between short-term support and increasing bearish pressure. The next moves around these EMA levels will be critical in determining the pair’s direction. Technical Analysis Breakdown: EMAs and RSI in Focus For traders relying on technical analysis , several indicators are painting a mixed picture for GBP/JPY. Let’s dissect the key technical signals: Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) Nine-day EMA (around 191.00): Currently acting as immediate support. A hold here could suggest a temporary stabilization. 14-day EMA (around 191.17): Serving as immediate resistance. Overcoming this level is needed to alleviate bearish pressure. Neutral Short-Term Momentum: The fact that GBP/JPY is trading around both the nine-day and 14-day EMAs suggests that short-term price momentum is currently neutral or indecisive. Relative Strength Index (RSI) Below 50 Level: The 14-day RSI falling below 50 is a significant bearish signal. It indicates that selling pressure is outweighing buying pressure, suggesting further potential downside. Descending Channel Bearish Bias: The descending channel pattern on the daily chart reinforces the overall bearish outlook for GBP/JPY. Traders often look for continuation patterns within channels. In summary, while the EMAs suggest short-term neutrality, the RSI and the descending channel pattern lean towards a bearish outlook. Traders should monitor these indicators closely for confirmation of the next directional move. Key Support Levels to Watch: Will 191.00 Hold? Identifying support levels is crucial for understanding potential downside targets and areas where buying interest might emerge. For GBP/JPY, here are the critical support zones: Immediate Support: Nine-day EMA at 191.00: This is the most immediate level currently being tested. A sustained break below this could open the door for further declines. Five-Month Low at 187.05 (February 7th): This recent low acts as a significant support zone. A move below 191.00 could target this level. Descending Channel Lower Boundary (around 186.00): The lower boundary of the descending channel, near the psychological level of 186.00, represents a more significant longer-term support. A break below the 191.00 level could trigger increased selling pressure, potentially leading GBP/JPY towards the 187.05 and then the 186.00 support zones. Traders should be prepared for potential volatility around these levels. Navigating Resistance Levels : Where Could GBP/JPY Rebound? On the flip side, understanding resistance levels is essential for identifying potential upside barriers and areas where selling pressure might strengthen. For GBP/JPY, key resistance levels include: Immediate Resistance: 14-day EMA at 191.17: This is the immediate hurdle for any potential bullish recovery. A break above this could signal weakening bearish momentum. Descending Channel Upper Boundary (around 192.50): The upper boundary of the descending channel represents a more significant resistance level. A successful break above this would be needed to negate the current bearish bias and suggest a potential trend reversal. If GBP/JPY manages to break above the 14-day EMA at 191.17, it could pave the way for a test of the descending channel’s upper boundary around 192.50. Overcoming this channel resistance is crucial for any sustained bullish recovery. British Pound (GBP) Performance in the Broader Forex Market To get a complete picture, it’s important to analyze the British Pound’s performance against other major currencies in the broader forex market . The table below provides a snapshot of the percentage change of GBP against various currencies today: USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD 0.08% -0.04% -0.24% 0.03% -0.18% -0.23% 0.09% EUR -0.08% 0.03% -0.37% 0.05% -0.17% -0.21% 0.12% GBP 0.04% -0.03% -0.29% 0.02% -0.15% -0.24% 0.08% JPY 0.24% 0.37% 0.29% 0.28% 0.10% 0.22% 0.32% CAD -0.03% -0.05% -0.02% -0.28% -0.18% -0.26% 0.07% AUD 0.18% 0.17% 0.15% -0.10% 0.18% -0.04% 0.29% NZD 0.23% 0.21% 0.24% -0.22% 0.26% 0.04% 0.32% CHF -0.09% -0.12% -0.08% -0.32% -0.07% -0.29% -0.32% The heat map above visualizes percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is on the left, and the quote currency is at the top. For instance, selecting British Pound (GBP) from the left and US Dollar from the top shows the percentage change for GBP/USD. As the table indicates, the British Pound was weakest against the Japanese Yen today. This reinforces the bearish sentiment observed in the GBP/JPY pair’s price action. Conclusion: Navigating the GBP/JPY Crossroads GBP/JPY is currently at a critical juncture, testing support around the nine-day EMA at 191.00. The increasing bearish momentum, signaled by the RSI and the descending channel pattern, suggests potential for further downside. However, the pair’s ability to hold above the 191.00 support could lead to a period of consolidation or a potential rebound towards the 14-day EMA resistance at 191.17. Traders should closely monitor price action around these key levels and be prepared for potential volatility as GBP/JPY navigates this crucial phase in the forex market .

40478442,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129603,1739846151,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Defiant Gold Price Holds Strong at $2,900: Tariffs & Safe-Haven Demand",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/defiant-gold-price-tariffs/,"In the volatile world of cryptocurrency and global finance, even traditional safe havens like gold are experiencing significant price swings. Despite a slight uptick in the US Dollar, Gold price is demonstrating remarkable resilience, clinging to gains near the coveted $2,900 mark. What’s fueling this defiance, and can it sustain its upward trajectory? Let’s dive into the factors impacting the precious metal, including Trump’s tariff threats and the ever-influential Federal Reserve. Why is the Gold Price Showing Such Strength? Several factors are contributing to gold’s current robust position. Despite modest USD strength, gold is finding support from persistent concerns surrounding potential global trade wars. Former US President Donald Trump’s protectionist policies, particularly his threats of new tariffs, are injecting uncertainty into the global economic outlook. This uncertainty, in turn, is bolstering gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset. Trump’s Tariff Threats: The specter of increased tariffs imposed by the US, especially on major trading partners like Mexico, China, and Canada, is creating jitters in the market. Investors are wary of the potential for retaliatory tariffs and the disruption to global trade flows, driving them towards safe assets like gold. USD Weakness (Relatively): While the US Dollar has seen a slight recovery, it remains under pressure following weaker-than-expected US Retail Sales data. This lingering USD weakness provides a tailwind for gold, making it relatively cheaper for investors holding other currencies. Geopolitical Tensions: Ongoing geopolitical risks, including the conflict in Ukraine, continue to underpin demand for safe-haven assets. Despite talks between US and Russian officials, escalating military actions in eastern Ukraine are keeping investors on edge. The Role of the Federal Reserve and Interest Rates The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance is always a critical factor influencing both the US Dollar and gold prices. Recently, market expectations regarding Fed interest rate cuts have shifted, further impacting the dynamics. Hawkish Fed Stance: Initially, there was anticipation of aggressive interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve . However, recent economic data and Fed communications suggest a more cautious approach. The market is now increasingly pricing in a potential rate cut in September, rather than earlier in the year. Impact on USD: The perception of a less dovish Federal Reserve has provided some support to the US Dollar. A stronger dollar typically exerts downward pressure on gold prices, as gold is priced in US dollars. However, the impact has been modest, indicating the strength of other supporting factors for gold. Inflation Expectations: Comments from Kevin Hassett, former Director of the US National Economic Council, suggesting that a drop in Treasury yields could signal expectations of lower inflation, are also being factored into market sentiment. Lower inflation expectations can sometimes reduce the appeal of gold as an inflation hedge, but the current focus on safe-haven demand and tariff risks seems to be overriding this. Technical Analysis: Gold Price Outlook From a technical standpoint, Gold price charts suggest continued bullish momentum, although some caution is warranted at current levels. Key Technical Levels for Gold (XAU/USD) Level Type Price Significance Current Price (approx.) $2,900 Round Figure Support Immediate Support $2,885 Near-term Support Swing Low Support $2,855 Stronger Support Level Key Support Zone $2,834 – $2,815 Major Support Area Immediate Resistance $2,925 Horizontal Resistance All-Time High $2,942 – $2,943 Critical Resistance Level The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart has retreated from overbought conditions, providing room for further upside. However, the $2,925 area and the all-time high near $2,942-$2,943 represent significant resistance levels. A decisive break above these levels could signal a powerful continuation of the uptrend. Conversely, failure to overcome these resistances could lead to a period of consolidation or a potential pullback towards support levels in the $2,885-$2,855 range. Tariffs and Trade Wars: A Looming Threat? Donald Trump’s tariff plans are a major talking point and a significant driver of market uncertainty. His proposals for reciprocal tariffs and threats of levies on automobiles are raising concerns about a potential global trade war. Tariffs FAQs What are tariffs? Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, designed to protect domestic industries by making imported products more expensive. Tariffs vs. Taxes: Tariffs are paid by importers at the port of entry, while taxes are paid by consumers or businesses at the point of sale. Are tariffs good or bad? Economists are divided. Some argue tariffs protect domestic jobs and industries, while others warn they can lead to higher prices for consumers and retaliatory trade wars. Trump’s Tariff Plan: Trump aims to use tariffs to support the US economy, focusing on countries like Mexico, China, and Canada. He intends to use tariff revenue to reduce income taxes. Federal Reserve Policy: Understanding the Basics Understanding the Federal Reserve’s role is crucial for navigating financial markets. Here are some frequently asked questions about the Fed and its impact on the US Dollar. Fed FAQs What does the Federal Reserve do? The Fed is the central bank of the US, responsible for monetary policy, aiming for price stability and full employment. How does the Fed impact the USD? The Fed influences the USD primarily through interest rate adjustments. Higher rates tend to strengthen the USD, while lower rates can weaken it. How often does the Fed meet? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) holds eight policy meetings per year to assess economic conditions and make monetary policy decisions. What is Quantitative Easing (QE)? QE is a policy where the Fed injects liquidity into the financial system by buying bonds, typically weakening the USD. What is Quantitative Tightening (QT)? QT is the reverse of QE, where the Fed reduces its balance sheet, generally positive for the USD. Conclusion: Gold’s Resilient Stance Gold price is currently navigating a complex landscape of USD fluctuations, tariff threats, and evolving Federal Reserve policy expectations. Despite headwinds from a slightly firmer dollar, the precious metal is drawing significant support from safe-haven demand fueled by geopolitical uncertainties and the looming possibility of trade wars. While technical indicators suggest further upside potential, key resistance levels are approaching. Investors should closely monitor developments related to US trade policy, Fed pronouncements, and global risk sentiment to gauge the next move for gold.

The broader market has struggled to regain strength, with most altcoins trading sideways. However, some Ethereum rivals have shown resilience, positioning themselves as strong alternatives. ​​Ethereum Rivals: Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL), a layer-one blockchain project, continues to gain attention as a major Ethereum rival. In the past 24 hours, the Solana price dropped over 5%, settling at $180 amid market volatility. Despite the decline, SOL has maintained steady growth, eyeing more gains ahead. Over the last year, its value surged more than 100%, reinforcing its position among Ethereum rivals. A crypto analyst highlighted that the $180 to $190 range remains a critical support zone for SOL. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price has hovered around $2,600 for five consecutive years, underscoring the evolving competition between these two leading blockchain networks. Cardano (ADA) Cardano price climbed to $0.80, reflecting a 10% weekly gain amid a broader market rebound. The third-generation blockchain, known for its proof-of-stake (PoS) model, continues to attract investors seeking energy-efficient alternatives. Analysts highlight a potential breakout after ADA formed a cup-and-handle pattern, suggesting bullish momentum. With Ethereum trading around $2,600 for five years, Cardano remains among the top Ethereum rivals gaining attention. Market sentiment points to sustained upward pressure, reinforcing optimism among traders tracking ADA’s performance. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink (LINK), a key blockchain abstraction layer, continues to enhance smart contract integration. Despite gaining over 160% in recent years, LINK struggles to sustain momentum. The LINK price is $18.89, reflecting a 0.38% daily dip. According to Coinglass, trading volume surged 85.79% to $874.14 million, while open interest declined 0.69% to $566.01 million. Source- Coinglass Conclusion These Ethereum rivals to buy offer distinct advantages and potential upside if bullish momentum returns.

This movement comes amidst ongoing discussions about its longer-term performance and accumulation trends. According to an analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Shiven Moodley, there are indications that TON holders are positioning for a potential rebound. Moodley’s observations, which are detailed in a recent post on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, suggest that the asset may be entering an accumulation phase despite its recent downward trajectory. Related Reading: Analyst Says Toncoin (TON) May Be Primed for Major Recovery—Here’s Why Toncoin Shows Signs of Accumulation Moodley points to several metrics as evidence. The 180-day Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted returns, signals a period of accumulation. This is further supported by stable TVL (Total Value Locked) in lending protocols and a noticeable reduction in speculative trading activity. Notably, the asset’s volatility has declined since the price spikes in December 2024 and February 2025. If this trend persists, it could imply that selling pressure is diminishing, potentially paving the way for a future rebound. Key on-chain indicators also paint a picture of potential opportunity. The Normalized Risk Metric (NRM), which evaluates TON’s valuation relative to historical moving averages, highlights accumulation at a price level of $3.82. Additionally, record lows in the Long-Term NRM suggest that longer-term holders are increasingly accumulating TON at these levels. Historically, similar setups have preceded market recoveries, giving investors a reason to believe that a medium-term price reversal may be on the horizon. Moodley wrote: It remains to be seen whether TON’s price action can stage a full recovery. However, long-term accumulation traders are best positioned to benefit from macro policy changes that could shift sentiment in the broader crypto market. The conditions could align for a potential rebound with selling pressure fading and risk metrics signalling a low-risk environment. On-Chain Metrics Hint at Long-Term Opportunity Another metric Moodley pointed out is the Risk Exposure Ratio—which tracks leveraged positions within TON’s DeFi ecosystem—it has recently reached a new high, exceeding 0.24 in early 2025. This suggests a growing influence of leveraged activity. However, if the ratio begins to decline, it could indicate a stabilization in market conditions, potentially leading to more stable price movements. Furthermore, the Probability of Spend metric shows that coins older than 400 days are unlikely to move, indicating strong conviction among long-term holders. This trend has historically correlated with phases of accumulation and recovery. As Moodley notes, short- to medium-term holders appear to be exiting their positions, likely contributing to the recent price weakness. Meanwhile, long-term holders remain consistent, suggesting a belief in the asset’s long-term potential.

33767162,[object Object],1739847607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,XRP Price Pump To $3.35 On The Horizon With Bullish Cup And Handle Pattern Formation,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-pump-to-3-35-looms/,"The XRP price is getting ready for a significant pump, as a new Cup and Handle pattern has just formed on its chart. A crypto analyst who identified the pattern has released an analysis, predicting that XRP could rise to $3.35, marking a new local high for the cryptocurrency. Cup And Handle Pattern To Trigger A Price Surge The Cup and Handle pattern is a well-known bullish continuation pattern in which the price of a cryptocurrency moves upward in a rounded cup and corrects downwards as it forms a handle. This pattern is considered a bullish signal that marks the potential for a breakout. Currently, XRP is forming a distinct price chart pattern. Ali Martinez, a prominent crypto analyst, shared a brief analysis of this newly formed technical pattern, projecting a surge to new highs for the price. The rounded bottom of the cup in the pattern indicates a period of accumulation during which selling pressure decreases and buyers gain control. After XRP’s price surge to new highs earlier this year, the cryptocurrency experienced a major pull back that pushed its value below $3, forming the downward-sloping consolidations seen in the pattern’s handle. Martinez notes that if the coin can break out of the handle’s resistance, where volatility exists more, the next potential target would be $3.35. Currently, the XRP price is trading at $2.6, and Martinez has marked its critical resistance level between $2.7 and $2.8. These resistance levels align with the upper trendline of the handle pattern, which, once broken, would set the stage for a strong rally. Notably, a surge to $3.35 would represent a 28.8% increase in its price from its current market value of $2.6. As of writing, the cryptocurrency has increased by 9.6% over the last seven days after experiencing a decline of over 14% in the past month. XRP Enters Phase 4 For Market Domination Despite current volatility and price declines , a crypto analyst, identified as ‘the XRP guy,’ believes that the token’s price is getting closer to dominating the market. The analyst revealed that the cryptocurrency is currently in phase 4 of its rise to dominance, with this stage characterizing the potential end of the legal battle between Ripple and the US SEC . The analyst showed that XRP had already completed the previous phases. The first phase was the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin ; the second was Donald Trump’s inauguration as the US President and the third was Gary Gensler’s resignation as the former SEC chair. The next three stages are set to become significant catalysts for the asset’s price. The crypto expert also mentioned the start of the highly anticipated altcoin season, Ripple’s potential partnership with big banks , and the possible approval and launch of an XRP ETF . The analyst suggests that these events will make it incredibly bullish and recommends investors hold their coins and refrain from selling.",Altcoin News|XRP|Ali Martinez|Altcoin|Cup and Handle Pattern|Donald Trump|Gary Gensler|ripple|RLUSD Stablecoin|SEC|XRP ETF|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-18 03:00:07

And experts have finally found the 3 best options – RCO Finance (RCOF) , Dogecoin (DOGE), and SUI! At the top of the cheap altcoins to buy list we have RCOF, a promising new SolidProof audited platform that has incredible potential. Then we have DOGE and SUI, two crypto giants that are getting ready for huge rallies! RCO Finance: Bringing Groundbreaking Technology and Massive Adoption to the Crypto Market RCO Finance is a brand-new financial platform that hasn’t even launched yet. This means that you can still catch RCOF during its presale, which is why RCOF is among the best 3 cheap altcoins to buy right now. And out of the 3 cheap altcoins to buy, RCO Finance offers the most promise. First off, RCO Finance is already revolutionizing the crypto market, as it recently launched its Beta Platform even though it’s still in presale. This is quite unorthodox for crypto presales, as most wait until after the launch to provide investors with a working product or service. However, now, anyone can go to the RCO Finance website and check out its fully functioning Beta Platform and see for themselves if RCO Finance is worth investing in. And most who have done this say it is! The Beta Platform is a hit, as it has an incredibly intuitive user interface and great features. First, it gives users access to over 120,000 assets, allowing them to trade/invest in whichever asset they want from one place. Second, it allows users to manage multiple crypto wallets from one place. So, managing assets will be much easier thanks to the RCO Finance Beta Platform. The Beta Platform also displays all the latest news on its dashboard, and it’s a strict non-KYC platform that gives users the privacy and freedom they need! However, the Beta Platform is just one piece of the puzzle that makes RCOF the top contender among the best 3 cheap altcoins to buy right now. Namely, RCO Finance also has an incredible AI tool that will make trading and investing easier and more profitable than ever before! That’s because the AI Robo Advisor can create a sophisticated investment strategy for all RCO Finance users, no matter which assets they want to invest in. First off, the AI Robo Advisor asks users about their financial goals, market preferences, and risk tolerance, and then it combines this with market data and technical analysis. That’s how the AI Robo Advisor creates a tailored and data-driven strategy for every RCO Finance user, and it continues to update it 24/7. It digests real-time financial info from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, adding it immediately to users’ trades. This allows all RCO Finance users to make money no matter the state of the market! Furthermore, the AI Robo Advisor can also catch promising new crypto coins before they boom. It will tell you when to buy and sell, making sure you secure your profits while you can. So, with it, you’ll be able to catch crypto coins like FULLSEND, which went from an MC of $278K to $100 million in about a day! With these incredible money-making opportunities available, it’s no wonder that RCOF tops many experts’ best cheap altcoins to buy lists! DOGE Is Preparing for a Rally as Open Interest Rises Dogecoin is another great contender in the “best cheap altcoins to buy” race. We all know Dogecoin as one of the biggest memecoins in the crypto market, which is also supported heavily by Elon Musk. Right now, the DOGE price is at $ 0.27, and it’s finally recovering from the recent crypto market crash. Namely, DOGE rose over 7% in just one day, showing that its path to recovery is strong. Also, experts believe that Dogecoin will dominate the crypto market again this year, especially with Elon Musk leading the US D.O.G.E. They say that this could bring massive upside for DOGE, and investors agree. Dogecoin’s open interest has risen significantly in the past few days, showing that investors are buying up DOGE tokens now that they’re at a low price. With all this in mind, Dogecoin is set to inevitably rise in 2025. Experts say that Dogecoin could finally reach $1 this year, making it one of the best cheap altcoins to buy right now! SUI Is Expanding and Experts Expect More Price Rises for It Soon SUI has become a serious player in the crypto market over the past years, especially during 2024. In 2024, SUI saw a massive rise in adoption, with traders even trying to make memecoin trading a thing on the SUI network. This didn’t work out, but it doesn’t mean that it never will. SUI has also been expanding for months, and it has a new partnership that will help it engage in an aggressive ecosystem expansion strategy. Namely, SUI partnered with Ant Digital, forming an RWA tokenization team partnership to carve its place in the up-and-coming RWA sector. This could lead to even more adoption of SUI, which will also boost its price. At the moment, SUI is trading at $3.67, rising by nearly 7% in just 24 hours already. This shows massive strength for SUI, and it indicates more upside to come. And with the expansion into RWA, experts believe that SUI can reach $5+ in 2025 alone! So, SUI is another great contender among the best cheap altcoins to buy in 2025! >>> BUY RCOF NOW RCOF: The #1 Contender Among the Best Cheap Altcoins To Buy! There’s no question that RCO Finance, Dogecoin, and SUI are the 3 best cheap altcoins to buy right now. However, it’s also clear that RCOF is the most promising. It offers incredible technology, and it hasn’t even launched yet. Namely, RCOF is currently in Stage 5 in its presale, available for $0.1. Once it starts trading on crypto exchanges at $0.4-$0.6, experts expect RCOF to go on a huge rally, rising by 1,000x by mid-2025. So, by investing in RCOF now, you can turn $1,000 into $1,000,000 in a few months, and even more in the longer term!

While TRUMP Coin sees dramatic price swings fueled by major exchange listings and Chainlink (LINK) signals a potential rally, Web3Bay is tackling a more pressing issue—security in online shopping. Unlike speculative assets, Web3Bay’s smart contract escrow system actively prevents fraud, fake reviews, and chargebacks, creating a trust-based marketplace. As traders navigate volatile markets with meme coins and established networks, Web3Bay presents a practical blockchain use case, ensuring transparency and security in e-commerce—an approach that could reshape online transactions. Web3Bay’s Smart Contract Escrow Online shopping is plagued by scams, fake reviews, and chargebacks, leaving both buyers and sellers vulnerable. To address these challenges, Web3Bay tackles these issues head-on with its blockchain-based smart contract escrow system, ensuring transactions are secure, transparent, and dispute-free. By leveraging automation, payments are held in escrow until conditions are met, eliminating the risk of fraudulent listings and chargeback fraud, thereby protecting all parties involved. For small business owners, this development is particularly beneficial, as it means reduced losses from false claims and disputes, while shoppers gain confidence knowing they are dealing with verified sellers. Moreover, blockchain immutability prevents fake reviews, ensuring trustworthy product ratings. As a result, this trust-based ecosystem marks a major shift from traditional e-commerce, where fraud thrives due to centralized oversight gaps. Meanwhile, Web3Bay’s presale is gaining traction, having raised $1.4 million in stage 4 at a batch price of $0.004562625, with over 340 billion coins sold. Given the increasing demand for secure digital transactions, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leading solution in online fraud prevention. TRUMP Coin Skyrockets Over 20% After Upbit Listing TRUMP, a meme coin linked to former U.S. President Donald Trump, surged over 20% following its listing on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit. This development introduced new trading pairs with KRW, BTC, and USDT, fueling market enthusiasm and driving a sharp increase in price and trading volume. Previously, TRUMP had been listed on Binance and Coinbase, with its initial rally pushing the price above $70 and its market cap to $14.5 billion. However, it later dropped significantly, falling below $3.5 billion. Despite the decline, the Upbit listing has reignited investor interest, with analysts predicting a potential rebound toward $35–$40 in the near term. This price movement underscores the strong influence of major exchange listings on meme-based assets, particularly in regions with high retail trading activity like South Korea. With speculation mounting, TRUMP remains a closely watched token in the market. Chainlink’s Potential Surge: Indicators Point to a $23 Target Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $18.59, with its key support level between $17 and $18 holding firm. Significantly, the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal near this support, suggesting a potential rebound toward $21 and possibly $23. Analysts emphasize that the $21 level has previously acted as a consolidation zone, while $23 has been a significant resistance point. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 48.94, indicating a neutral market stance and the Directional Movement Index (DMI) reflects ongoing competition between buying and selling pressures. Additionally, whale investors control 67% of LINK’s circulating supply, and recent data shows that 57% of holders are in profit, with 40% at a loss. Considering these factors, combined with exchange outflows, selling pressure appears to be decreasing, supporting the possibility of a rally toward the $23 mark. Final Thoughts As cryptocurrency markets fluctuate, security and utility remain key factors for long-term adoption. TRUMP Coin’s price swings highlight the influence of exchange listings, while Chainlink’s indicators suggest potential growth based on technical signals. However, Web3Bay addresses a more fundamental need—fraud prevention in online shopping. By leveraging smart contract escrow, it eliminates chargebacks and fake reviews, offering a tangible solution beyond speculation. While traders chase volatility, Web3Bay builds a secure foundation for digital transactions, ensuring trust and transparency in e-commerce.

As of today, February 18, 2025, MKR has gained 7% in the past 24 hours, topping the crypto market and showing signs of a potential price rebound. MakerDAO (MKR) Current Price MKR is currently trading near $1,065, and during the same period, it has attracted interest and confidence from traders and investors, resulting in a 10% increase in trading volume. This impressive price surge amid bearish market sentiment appears to be shifting MKR’s sentiment from a downtrend to an uptrend. MKR Price Action and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, MKR has been moving in a downtrend, following a descending channel price action pattern. However, with the recent upside momentum, the price is on the verge of breaking out of this descending pattern. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price momentum and historical patterns, if MKR breaches this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $1,070 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 50% to reach the $1,600 level in the future. During the rally, MKR may face slight resistance near $1,100, as the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame currently lies near that level. Bearish On-Chain Metrics Following this bullish price action and recent price jump, investors and long-term holders have started dumping MKR tokens, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an inflow of $1.85 million worth of MKR tokens in the past 24 hours, which suggests a potential sell-off. Such inflows of assets from wallets to exchanges are often seen as a sign of a potential price drop and increased selling pressure. Source: Coinglass When combining these on-chain metrics with the technical analysis, it appears that the asset is bullish. However, as the price soars, it might have given those who purchased during the recent dip the opportunity to dump their holdings for profit booking.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,MKR|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-18 03:08:16

The proposed ETF will be structured as a “Commodity-Based Trust,” a model already used for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This filing marks the latest move by a U.S. exchange to offer an ETF containing spot XRP, the native token of Ripple’s XRP Ledger blockchain. The decision to file comes amid increasing interest in crypto ETFs and after a key legal ruling in favor of Ripple, which determined that XRP is not automatically considered a security. Multiple exchanges are exploring opportunities to offer similar products The buzz around these ETFs is evident, with 15 different ETFs now vying for attention, each competing to secure approval for listing. With institutional demand rising, many believe the SEC’s approval of these ETFs could trigger massive buying activity, pushing XRP’s value to new heights. Grayscale, a digital asset firm, is working on launching a spot XRP ETF. On January 30, 2025, NYSE Arca filed a form with the SEC to list Grayscale’s XRP Trust as an ETF. This starts a 240-day review period, with a decision expected by mid-October 2025. The SEC acknowledged the application on February 14, 2025. XRP Rally Soon? As major players in the market, including whales, have been gobbling up millions of XRP over the past few months, the anticipation for the approval of XRP-based Exchange Traded Funds is heating up.

Speaking to broadcaster TN on Monday, Milei insisted he merely “spread” information about the token, not promote it . He said: It is a problem between private parties because the State does not play a role here. Milei added that he had acted “in good faith.” $LIBRA crypto crash: Federal investigation into potential fraud Argentina’s federal prosecutor’s office has launched an investigation into whether Milei engaged in fraud, criminal association, or breached his duties when he publicly endorsed $LIBRA on social media. The digital currency initially surged in value before plummeting, prompting Milei to delete his post hours later, calling it a mistake. Crypto Rover @rovercrc · Follow 💥BREAKING: Argentinian President Javier Milei retweets “How To Buy $LIBRA ” Tutorial, days after deleting his post endorsing the project.THIS IS CRAZY 😱 9:55 PM · Feb 17, 2025 7.9K Reply Copy link Read 432 replies Rights group Observatory for the Right to the City, along with multiple complainants, alleges Milei was part of a “criminal organization” that orchestrated a fraud affecting over 40,000 investors, resulting in losses exceeding $4 billion. Crypto analysts suspect the $LIBRA collapse was a “rug pull”—a scam where developers hype a token, attract investors, and then cash out quickly. The Kobeissi Letter, a global capital markets analysis publication, reported that within minutes of its launch, large holders liquidated millions of dollars worth of $LIBRA, with some cashing out over $4 million. Economists, crypto experts, and opposition figures have heavily criticized Milei, branding the asset a potential Ponzi scheme. Former president Cristina Kirchner labeled him a “crypto-scammer,” while opposition lawmakers are pushing for impeachment proceedings. $LIBRA crypto crash sends shockwaves through Argentina’s financial markets In response to the backlash, Argentina’s presidency announced Saturday that the Anti-Corruption Office would investigate whether improper conduct occurred. A task force has been formed to conduct an urgent probe into $LIBRA’s launch and the individuals or entities involved. Authorities will also scrutinize Julian Peh, CEO of companies linked to $LIBRA, and Chamber of Deputies President Martin Menem, who had reshared Milei’s initial endorsement. The controversy has sent shockwaves through Argentina’s financial markets, with the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange closing 5.58% lower on Monday. Some stocks suffered losses of up to 8%. Despite the scandal, Milei remains focused on his political agenda. On Monday, he hosted Republican US Senator Steve Daines in Buenos Aires and is set to visit the United States later this week. However, political analysts warn that the controversy could dent his credibility, even as his anti-inflation measures continue to win public approval.

The price is trading above $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,750 and $2,780. Ethereum Price Regains Traction Ethereum price attempted a fresh increase above the $2,700 level, beating Bitcoin . ETH broke the $2,750 resistance but it failed to clear the $2,850 resistance zone. A high was formed at $2,847 and the price started a fresh decline . There was a move below the $2,750 and $2,720 support levels. A low was formed at $2,689 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,847 swing high to the $2,689 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,750 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,765 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,847 swing high to the $2,689 low. The main resistance is now forming near $2,800 or $2,820. A clear move above the $2,820 resistance might send the price toward the $2,850 resistance. An upside break above the $2,850 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,750 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,700 level. The first major support sits near the $2,680 zone. A clear move below the $2,680 support might push the price toward the $2,620 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,550 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,500.

However, in the last seven days, XRP is up by more than 8%. As of now, XRP is testing a previous resistance zone between $2.58 and $2.73. After a significant rally from the February low, the price has struggled to break past the $2.79 level. This is a crucial area to watch because if XRP can flip this resistance into support, it would signal a potential continuation upward. However, the price is still in the testing phase, and it has not yet confirmed this as a solid support level. Key Support and Resistance Levels If the price fails to maintain this level and closes below $2.58 on the daily chart, the breakout attempt will be considered unsuccessful. In that case, XRP could move back toward the next major support zone between $2.25 and $2.30, which was significant support previously. Below that, additional support is available further down, but these levels need to be closely monitored. The next significant resistance lies at $2.79, and if breached, it could signal a potential continuation towards $3. However, as long as XRP stays below $2.79, the price action is likely to remain under downward pressure. Bearish Divergence Currently, there is a larger bearish divergence on the daily chart, which is also visible on the 3-day chart. This bearish divergence is still in play, and if XRP drops below $2.58, it will likely continue, leading to a price pullback toward the next support area. Short-Term Pullback The recent short-term pullback in XRP’s price can be attributed to this bearish divergence. Since higher highs were seen in the price while the RSI showed lower highs, a bearish divergence formed.

With millions of early adopters and growing speculation, traders are eager to see how Pi Coin performs when real trading starts. Could this lead to outperforming other crypto coins like BTC? Key factors influencing its valuation include exchange listings, early holders’ actions, and market price anchoring. As launch day approaches, expectations remain high for Pi Network’s official entry into the crypto market. Bitcoin price is currently hovering above $96k. Is Pi Network Price Set to Outperform Bitcoin After Mainnet Launch? Pi Network Price has been gaining momentum as its Open Mainnet launch approaches on February 20. The recent 100% surge in Pi Coin’s price following its OKX listing has fueled speculation about a possible Binance listing. This led to a price rally from $50 to above $70. Over the past week, the Pi price has surged by 50%. However, neither Binance nor the Pi Core Team has confirmed any such plans, leaving traders uncertain. The mobile device mining method of Pi Coin provides broad accessibility to users who want to participate in its network. Pi Network leads the crypto ecosystem as it maintains more than 100 million users on its platform. Despite its growing adoption, critics argue that Pi Coin was never designed for speculation but rather for a barter-based economy. If it remains unlisted on major exchanges, adoption may be gradual rather than explosive. A Binance listing could significantly impact Pi Coin’s price, drawing more interest from traders. However, history has shown that tokens with rapid price spikes often face sharp corrections. Projects like Berachain and Hamster saw massive initial hype but eventually declined due to weak use cases. Without strong fundamentals, Pi Coin could face similar challenges despite its widespread popularity. While Binance has yet to announce any listing plans, other exchanges, including Bitget, OKX, and MEXC, have already shown interest in Pi Coin. Still, skepticism lingers due to past delays in Pi Network’s roadmap.

40481123,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129637,1739851389,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"EUR/USD Forecast Alert: Euro to Consolidate, UOB Group Predicts Range Bound Trading",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eur-usd-forecast-consolidation-range/,"Navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency trading often involves keeping a close watch on traditional financial markets. Understanding the dynamics of Forex pairs like EUR/USD can provide valuable insights into broader market sentiment and potential risk-on or risk-off behavior. Today, we delve into the latest EUR/USD forecast from UOB Group, offering a crucial perspective for your trading strategy. EUR/USD Forecast: Why Consolidation is Expected? According to UOB Group’s FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, the Euro (EUR) is poised for a period of consolidation against the US Dollar (USD). This Forex Forecast suggests a shift from recent upward momentum to a more sideways movement. Instead of a continued surge, the analysts anticipate EUR/USD to trade within a defined range of 1.0455 to 1.0515. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors driving this prediction: Short-Term View (24-Hour): UOB Group observed that the previous strong rise of the Euro appeared “overdone.” While they anticipated a test of 1.0495, they also believed that the significant resistance at 1.0530 would remain unchallenged. Recent price action validated this view, with EUR/USD rising to 1.0514 before easing back to 1.0491. Slowing Momentum and Overbought Conditions: Technical indicators point towards a deceleration in upward momentum and suggest that EUR/USD may be entering overbought territory. These conditions often precede periods of consolidation or even pullbacks. Consolidation Range: Based on these factors, UOB Group projects EUR/USD to consolidate within a 1.0455/1.0515 range for the immediate term. Longer-Term Euro to Dollar Outlook: Still Positive? While the short-term outlook suggests consolidation, the longer-term Euro to Dollar forecast remains positive, according to UOB Group. They maintain a technical target of 1.0530 for the Euro. This indicates that the analysts believe the recent upward trend is not entirely exhausted and that further gains are possible in the coming weeks, provided certain conditions are met. Key points for the 1-3 weeks view: Positive Outlook Maintained: UOB Group’s positive outlook on EUR remains valid from their previous analysis on February 14th. Technical Target: The technical target of 1.0530 is still in play. Crucial Support Level: To sustain the positive momentum, EUR/USD must hold above the 1.0400 level, which acts as a “strong support.” A break below this level could negate the positive outlook. Significant Resistance Levels: Beyond the initial target of 1.0530, another significant resistance level awaits at 1.0560. These levels will be crucial to watch for potential breakouts or reversals in Currency Trading . Actionable Insights for Currency Trading and Crypto Traders So, what does this EUR/USD Prediction mean for traders, especially those involved in the cryptocurrency market? Short-Term Strategy: For short-term traders, the anticipated consolidation range of 1.0455/1.0515 presents opportunities for range-bound trading strategies. This could involve buying near the lower end of the range and selling near the higher end, with appropriate risk management measures in place. Monitoring Support and Resistance: Keep a close eye on the key support level at 1.0400 and resistance levels at 1.0530 and 1.0560. Breaks beyond these levels could signal shifts in momentum and potentially larger price movements. Broader Market Context: EUR/USD movements can often reflect broader market sentiment. A period of consolidation in EUR/USD might coincide with consolidation or indecision in other markets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a breakout in EUR/USD could signal a broader shift in risk appetite. Risk Management is Key: As always, remember that Forex and cryptocurrency trading involves significant risk. Conduct thorough research, use appropriate risk management tools, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Conclusion: Navigating EUR/USD Consolidation In conclusion, UOB Group’s Forex Forecast suggests that EUR/USD is likely to consolidate within a 1.0455/1.0515 range in the short term. While the longer-term outlook remains positive with a target of 1.0530, traders should be prepared for range-bound trading conditions. Monitoring key support and resistance levels and understanding the broader market context will be crucial for navigating this phase of EUR/USD price action. Stay informed, trade cautiously, and leverage these insights to refine your trading approach in both Forex and cryptocurrency markets.

Silver is flashing green, and the Silver Price Forecast is turning heads. After a minor dip, XAG/USD is back on track, holding strong around the $32.35 mark. Is this just a temporary surge, or are we witnessing the start of a sustained bullish rally? Let’s dive into the factors driving this upward trend and what it means for investors like you. What’s Fueling the Bullish Silver Price Forecast? The recent performance of Silver (XAG/USD) is hard to ignore. After a brief dip below $32.00 in the Asian session, dip-buyers jumped in, showcasing strong underlying demand. Several technical indicators and market sentiments are aligning to support this bullish silver outlook : Breaking Key Resistance: XAG/USD decisively broke above the crucial 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a signal often interpreted as a shift in momentum towards the bulls. Positive Oscillators: Technical oscillators on the daily chart are showing positive signals, reinforcing the idea that the path of least resistance is upwards. Dip-Buying Behavior: The quick rebound from the $31.90 region demonstrates strong buying interest even on minor pullbacks, suggesting traders are eager to capitalize on any dips. These factors combined paint a picture of a market that is currently favoring bullish positions. But what does this mean for potential targets and key levels to watch? Navigating the XAG/USD Forecast: Key Levels and Targets While the Silver Price Forecast looks promising, it’s crucial to identify key levels to anticipate potential movements. Here’s a breakdown of important price points for XAG/USD: Level Significance $32.55 Immediate Horizontal Barrier: A break above this level could signal further upward momentum. $33.00 Psychological Round Figure: Overcoming this level could open the door to higher targets. $33.35 – $33.40 Friday’s Swing High: Retesting and breaking this range would confirm strong bullish strength. $34.00 Next Potential Target: A significant psychological level that could be tested if the rally continues. $34.45 – $35.00 Multi-Year Peak Region: The ultimate bullish target, revisiting levels not seen since October. On the downside, it’s important to consider potential support levels. The Silver Market Analysis suggests the following: Level Significance $31.90 Asian Session Low: A break below could trigger some corrective pullback, but buying interest is expected. $31.20 100-day SMA: Strong dynamic support; likely to limit deeper pullbacks. $31.00 Psychological Mark: A break below could shift the near-term bias to bearish. $30.25 Support Level: Next significant support zone if bearish momentum increases. $30.00 Psychological Mark: A crucial psychological support level. $29.55 – $29.50 Horizontal Support Zone: Strong support area that could halt further declines. Decoding the Silver Market Analysis: Factors to Watch Understanding the factors influencing silver prices is key to making informed investment decisions. Here are some crucial elements that impact the Silver Market Analysis : Safe-Haven Demand: Silver, like gold, benefits from geopolitical uncertainty and economic downturn fears. However, it’s generally considered a less potent safe-haven compared to gold. Interest Rates: As a non-yielding asset, silver tends to perform better in low-interest-rate environments. Keep an eye on central bank policies. US Dollar Strength: Silver is priced in USD, so a weaker dollar typically boosts silver prices, and vice versa. Industrial Demand: Silver has extensive industrial applications, particularly in electronics and solar energy. Economic growth and technological advancements can significantly impact demand. Gold’s Influence: Silver prices often mirror gold’s movements due to their shared safe-haven status. The Gold/Silver ratio can provide insights into relative valuation. FAQ: Your Burning Questions About Silver Answered Why do people invest in Silver? Silver attracts investors for several reasons: Store of Value: Historically, silver has served as a reliable store of value, preserving wealth over time. Portfolio Diversification: Adding silver to an investment portfolio can reduce overall risk by diversifying asset classes. Inflation Hedge: Silver is often seen as a hedge against inflation, although less effectively than gold. Intrinsic Value: Silver’s industrial applications and precious metal status give it intrinsic value. Investors can access silver through physical forms (coins, bars) or via Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track silver prices. Which factors influence Silver prices? A multitude of factors can sway silver prices: Geopolitical Instability: Events that create global uncertainty can drive safe-haven demand for silver. Recession Fears: Economic downturns can also increase silver’s appeal as a safe asset. Interest Rate Policies: Lower interest rates generally support higher silver prices. US Dollar Performance: A weaker dollar is typically bullish for silver. Investment Demand: Investor appetite for silver can significantly impact prices. Mining Supply & Recycling: Supply-side dynamics, including mining output and recycling rates, play a role. How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? Industrial demand is a significant driver for silver due to its unique properties: High Electrical Conductivity: Silver’s superior conductivity makes it essential in electronics. Solar Energy: Growing demand for solar panels increases silver consumption. Key Industries: The health of industrial sectors in major economies like the US, China, and India directly impacts silver demand. Jewelry Demand (India): In India, jewelry demand is a crucial factor influencing silver prices. How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? Silver and gold often move in tandem due to their shared safe-haven characteristics: Correlation: Silver prices generally follow gold price trends. Gold/Silver Ratio: This ratio indicates the relative value between gold and silver. A high ratio might suggest silver is undervalued, while a low ratio could imply gold is undervalued. Relative Valuation Tool: Investors use the Gold/Silver ratio to gauge potential opportunities between the two metals. Conclusion: Is the Silver Price Prediction Still Bullish? The current Silver Price Prediction leans towards a continued bullish trend. Technical indicators, dip-buying behavior, and a favorable macroeconomic backdrop are all contributing to the positive momentum in XAG/USD. While caution is always advised in volatile markets, the signals suggest that silver could have more room to run, potentially targeting higher levels in the near term.

40481233,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129614,1739851665,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pound Sterling’s Cautious Calm: UK Data Week Looms,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pound-sterling-uk-data-week/,"In the ever-turbulent world of Forex, the Pound Sterling (GBP) is currently exhibiting a moment of cautious calm . As we kick off a week packed with critical UK economic data releases, including employment figures and inflation metrics, investors are holding their breath. Will the data confirm expectations, or will it unleash fresh volatility? This week could be pivotal for the Pound, and here’s what you need to know to navigate the potential shifts in the Forex market . Pound Sterling Braces for UK Economic Data Barrage The Pound Sterling began the week maintaining its ground against major currencies. This steadiness comes as traders await a series of crucial UK economic data points. Tuesday is the day to watch, with the release of employment figures for the three months leading to December. This data will be a vital sign of the UK’s economic health and a potential indicator of business sentiment following recent policy changes. Specifically, the market is keenly observing: ILO Unemployment Rate: Expected to slightly increase to 4.5% in December from 4.4%. Average Earnings: Anticipated to remain robust, potentially accelerating to 5.9% from 5.6%. These figures are not just numbers; they are potential market movers. Strong wage growth, while seemingly positive, could fuel inflation concerns, especially in the service sector. This situation could lead to stagflation risks – a scenario of slow economic growth coupled with high inflation. For those tracking the Forex markets, these data points are critical for understanding the near-term trajectory of the Pound. BoE Governor Bailey’s Speech: A Glimpse into Monetary Policy? Adding to Tuesday’s significance is a scheduled speech by BoE Governor Bailey . Market participants will be hanging on every word, searching for clues about the Bank of England’s (BoE) future monetary policy direction. In their recent monetary policy statement, the BoE hinted at possible inflationary pressures before inflation resumes its downward path towards the 2% target. Bailey’s speech could either reinforce this stance or introduce new nuances, directly impacting the Pound Sterling’s valuation. Key Questions for Bailey’s Speech: Will he reiterate the BoE’s cautious approach to inflation? Will he provide any hints about future interest rate decisions? How will he address the concerns about wage growth and its impact on inflation? Answers to these questions could trigger significant movements in the Forex market , particularly for GBP pairs. Global Factors: Fed’s Caution and US Dollar’s Wobble The Pound’s steady performance also needs to be viewed in the context of global economic factors. Across the Atlantic, the US Dollar (USD) is showing signs of weakness. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is struggling to hold its ground, hovering near two-month lows. This USD softness is partly due to improved market sentiment, fueled by delays in the implementation of new US tariffs, reducing immediate global trade war anxieties. However, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) remains a key influence. Fed’s Logan recently reiterated the central bank’s cautious stance on interest rate cuts, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance on economic data. This cautious approach from the Fed contrasts with some expectations of more aggressive rate cuts earlier in the year, contributing to the current dynamic in the Forex market . GBP/USD Technical Outlook: poised for a breakout? Analyzing the GBP/USD pair technically, we see it trading around the 1.2600 level. After a period of consolidation, is the Pound Sterling gearing up for a breakout? Technical Indicators to Watch: Indicator Current Status Implication 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Around 1.2500 GBP/USD holding above this level suggests a bullish near-term outlook. 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) Above 60.00 Indicates increasing bullish momentum. Sustaining above 60.00 could signal further upward movement. Fibonacci Retracement (38.2%) Around 1.2620 Immediate resistance level. A decisive break above this could trigger further gains. Fibonacci Retracement (50%) At 1.2767 Key resistance zone on the upside. February 3 low At 1.2250 Acts as a crucial support zone on the downside. Traders should monitor these levels closely. A break above the 1.2620 resistance could open the path towards the 1.2767 level, while a drop below 1.2500 might signal a potential retest of the 1.2250 support. Understanding the Pound Sterling: Key FAQs For those new to Forex trading or seeking a refresher, let’s address some frequently asked questions about the Pound Sterling. What is the Pound Sterling? The Pound Sterling (GBP) isn’t just any currency; it’s the world’s oldest, dating back to 886 AD. It’s the official currency of the United Kingdom and a major player in global Forex market , ranking as the fourth most traded currency worldwide. In 2022, it accounted for 12% of all Forex transactions, averaging a staggering $630 billion daily. Key trading pairs include GBP/USD (‘Cable’), GBP/JPY (‘Dragon’), and EUR/GBP. The Bank of England (BoE) is the issuing authority, making its decisions paramount to the Pound’s value. How do BoE decisions influence the Pound Sterling? The Bank of England’s monetary policy is the single most critical factor influencing the Pound Sterling’s value. The BoE’s primary objective is price stability, aiming for a 2% inflation rate. Interest rate adjustments are their main tool. Raising interest rates to combat high inflation typically strengthens the GBP, making the UK a more attractive destination for global investors. Conversely, lowering rates to stimulate growth when inflation is low can weaken the Pound. Therefore, understanding the BoE Governor Bailey’s and the BoE’s stance is crucial for Forex market participants. How does economic data impact the Pound’s value? Economic data releases serve as vital health checks for the UK economy and can significantly sway the Pound Sterling’s value. Indicators like GDP, PMIs, and employment figures all play a role. Strong economic data generally bolsters the Pound, attracting foreign investment and potentially prompting the BoE to raise interest rates. Weak data, conversely, usually leads to a Pound Sterling depreciation. This week’s UK economic data releases are therefore particularly significant. What role does the Trade Balance play? The Trade Balance, reflecting the difference between exports and imports, is another key data point for the Pound. A positive trade balance, driven by high demand for UK exports, typically strengthens the Pound due to increased foreign currency inflows. Conversely, a negative balance can weaken it. Monitoring the UK’s trade performance offers insights into the fundamental strength of the Pound Sterling. Conclusion: Navigating the Week Ahead As the week unfolds, all eyes will be on the UK economic data releases and BoE Governor Bailey’s speech. These events are poised to inject volatility into the Forex market and dictate the Pound Sterling’s near-term direction. For traders and investors in the cryptocurrency and Forex spaces, staying informed and agile is key. Keep a close watch on the data, listen attentively to Bailey’s signals, and be prepared to adjust your strategies as the landscape evolves. This week promises to be a crucial chapter in the Pound Sterling’s story.
