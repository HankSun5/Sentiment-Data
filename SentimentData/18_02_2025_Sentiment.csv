With the blockchain industry evolving rapidly, selecting the right investments can make all the difference between riding the next wave of innovation or missing out on game-changing opportunities. This week’s top picks include projects that are reshaping global finance, decentralized infrastructure, and Web3 applications. Qubetics ($TICS) is revolutionizing cross-border payments, ensuring fast, seamless, and cost-effective global transactions. Meanwhile, Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is building the decentralized internet, aiming to replace centralized cloud infrastructure. And then there’s SUI, a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain that’s been making waves with massive gains and bullish market sentiment. With SUI currently trading at $3.29, showing strong momentum and liquidity inflows, it’s becoming one of the hottest cryptos of the week. As institutional adoption increases, ICP’s Web3 innovations are positioning it as a long-term winner. Meanwhile, Qubetics’ presale has raised $13.2 million, making it one of the most anticipated blockchain projects of the year. Qubetics: Cross-Border Transactions Simplified Qubetics is bringing a new era of seamless, low-cost international payments. Traditional remittance services are plagued by high fees, slow transactions, and hidden costs. Qubetics’ blockchain-based system eliminates intermediaries, enabling users to send money instantly, securely, and affordably. With TICS tokens, businesses and individuals can execute real-time cross-border transactions , making Qubetics a game-changer in financial services. Whether you’re a freelancer working with global clients, a business paying international suppliers, or an everyday user sending money abroad, Qubetics ensures that your funds arrive faster and at a fraction of traditional banking costs. Understanding Qubetics’ Cross-Border Payment System Qubetics’ payment network is designed to work across multiple fiat and digital currencies, giving users flexibility while ensuring compliance with international regulations. Smart contracts automate transactions, reducing errors and ensuring transparent, trustless payments. This is especially crucial for businesses looking to streamline supply chain payments, payroll processing, and B2B settlements. With 479 million tokens sold and over 20,300 holders, Qubetics has already gained massive traction. Its efficient cross-border system will help unbanked populations gain access to financial services, opening doors for economic inclusion worldwide. Internet Computer Protocol: The Future of Web3 Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is rewriting the rules of the internet. Instead of relying on centralized cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud, ICP enables fully decentralized applications (dApps) to run directly on the blockchain. Unlike most blockchains, which still require centralized servers for certain operations, ICP aims to replace traditional web infrastructure, offering a trustless, autonomous, and censorship-resistant alternative. This means users can host websites, run applications, and store data securely on the blockchain, reducing reliance on Big Tech monopolies. The real value of ICP lies in its ability to provide scalable, low-cost decentralized hosting. Imagine a world where social media platforms, online marketplaces, and financial applications operate entirely on a blockchain, free from corporate control. That’s what ICP is building, making it one of the most important long-term investments in crypto. SUI: Bullish Momentum and Market Potential SUI is making headlines in the crypto world with its strong price movement and growing ecosystem. Currently trading at $3.29, SUI has shown remarkable resilience, maintaining a tight trading range between $3.00 and $4.00. One of the biggest reasons behind SUI’s bullish momentum is the recent launch of tokenized funds on its network, attracting new liquidity and institutional interest. As more financial products migrate to SUI, the demand for its native token continues to rise. However, SUI faces a critical resistance level at $3.50. If it breaks past this price, analysts believe it could enter a strong upward trend. On the flip side, failure to hold above $3.00 could see a retest of lower support levels around $2.34. Still, its growing adoption and integration into major DeFi projects make it one of the top cryptos to watch this week. Conclusion This week, Qubetics , ICP, and SUI are proving to be some of the most promising investment opportunities in the crypto market. Qubetics is disrupting cross-border payments, Internet Computer Protocol is pioneering the decentralized internet, and SUI is gaining momentum with institutional adoption. The innovation behind these projects is not just theoretical—it’s being implemented and refined every day. With real-world use cases, partnerships, and growing adoption, the potential upside remains significant. Investors who position themselves early in these emerging technologies could benefit from substantial gains as adoption increases. As blockchain technology continues to redefine global finance and digital infrastructure, these three projects are well-positioned to be major players in the next crypto bull run. Whether you’re looking for long-term growth, innovative use cases, or explosive short-term gains, these cryptos deserve a spot in your portfolio.

The token associated with both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has increased and is actively used in the cryptocurrency market. Blockchain data firm CryptoQuant noted that the supply expanded, which led to the upgrade. At first, stablecoins exhibited more activity on the Ethereum blockchain. However, the trend of adoption has shifted over time to select XRPL, reflecting the relatively cheaper fees of the transactions. Adoption and exchange listings The credibility of RLUSD is boosted through multiple listings on the exchange platforms. The stablecoin has recently been integrated into the Margex trading platform that offers high leverage trading. Also, an asset under NYDFS got a listing on Zero Hash, making it more accessible in addition to its expansion. Another key milestone was RLUSD’s integration with the popular financial application Revolut. These factors have enabled the expansion of the stablecoin supply and an expansion into a variety of financial industries. RLUSD may expand across its networks. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has hinted at plans to integrate the RLUSD into the Cardano blockchain. If successful, this could increase its accessibility. Prior to RLUSD’s official launch, Ripple performed test minting on Ethereum and the XRPL in August. A push towards it has been seen recently as it costs less than Ethereum in terms of transaction fees. Currently, the XRPL has 37.4 million RLUSD, while Ethereum’s RLUSD supply has fallen to 83.3 million. More adoption of RLUSD in the XRPL has also improved the steadiness of the XRP market. This has impacted the price pattern of altcoins since their use and demand for stablecoins are high. As of the time of writing, XRP was around $2.64, registering a 3% decline in the last 24 hours. According to Coingecko, the market cap of RLUSD currently stands at $108 million. Analysts predict that the RLUSD growth will boost XRP prices in the long run. The continued adoption of XRP due to factors such as RLUSD, amongst other factors, has seen the token anticipated to hit $250 by 2026. Analysts have hinted that the whale movements could trigger the next rallying points in prices.

Investors are moved toward emerging digital assets that offer both high returns and practical uses because Bitcoin's market control has hit its maximum. A Solana ETF approval by regulatory bodies has the potential to serve as the key driver for cryptocurrency adoption in combination with emerging market players like Remittix. 1. Solana ETF Approval Could Be As Early As March With Altcoins Like Remittix Set To Explode As BTC Dominance Tops Out 2. Solana ETF Approval: A Catalyst for Market Dynamics 3. Remittix: Bridging Crypto and Traditional Finance 4. Conclusion Solana ETF Approval: A Catalyst for Market Dynamics The acceptance of Solana ETF can transform the current cryptocurrency market dynamic. The blockchain network Solana stands among the most desired platforms because of its efficient transaction processing and affordable costs. A review from analysts indicates that Solana ETFs may receive SEC approval until March 2025 as the regulatory environment now welcomes cryptocurrency investment products. A potential regulatory approval will enable institutional investment in Solana thus enabling growth in market liquidity and price consistency and improved credibility with traditional financial institutions. Bitcoin ETFs succeeded in paving the way for crypto adoption so authorities now focus on approving the Solana blockchain for regulatory validation besides Bitcoin. An ETF focused on Solana investment would enable both institutional and retail investors to join traditional financial markets thus integrating cryptocurrencies much deeper. The proposed market shift will favor alternative digital currencies which provide functional advantages particularly Remittix. Remittix: Bridging Crypto and Traditional Finance Digital currencies have expanded during recent years but many people across the world still do not have access to traditional banking services. An estimate from the World Bank shows that 1.4 billion adults across the world lack bank accounts. A substantial number of unbanked people still possess mobile devices that let them execute digital wallet payments alongside cryptocurrency operations. The solution comes from the Remittix (RTX) system. Remittix resolves the key obstacle to cryptocurrency adoption through its capability to turn cryptocurrency into FIAT money to allow effortless transactions. Remittix enables users to turn cryptocurrency into FIAT allowing bank deposits directly from anywhere across the world through a banking intermediary-free system. Remittix provides critical support to users in developing economies who want to take advantage of mobile and crypto usage opportunities despite restricted banking options. Through its platform Remittix enables users to preserve cryptocurrency's native characteristics of anonymous asset management together with systems of modern finance. The future demonstrates credit payments to freelancers in Africa through crypto which then automatically transforms to FIAT currency and funds instantly reach them without depending on centralized banking services. Remittix is currently creating such a future. Currently in its presale stage, Remittix offers an opportunity for early investors to acquire RTX tokens before they hit major exchanges. The Remittix presale aims to raise $36 million with a structured tokenomics model designed for long-term stability and value appreciation . The RTX presale enables investors to acquire tokens at reduced prices that may produce substantial profits after the token launches successfully in the market. Early investors obtain dual advantages by participating in the development of a project that intends to change worldwide payment systems while earning financial gains. Remittix establishes leadership in crypto-finance through its solution which combats high remittance fees while cutting down transaction speeds and granting users FIAT money access. The current financial sector evolves because Remittix and similar initiatives take a leadership role in this changing environment. The platform charges lower fees when sending money than Western Union and PayPal do. Conclusion Illuminating financial developments through the Solana ETF regulatory verification provides the perfect moment to study new answers such as Remittix. Taking part in the RTX presale places you ahead of others in witnessing an economic transformation where crypto advantages align with banking systems. As the financial world embraces decentralized finance, Remittix is a critical player in bridging the gap between crypto and mainstream finance. Become a part of a movement that promotes financial inclusion, empowers people globally, and reimagines the future of payments by joining the Remittix community today.

January 17, 2025, saw the launch of the $Trump meme, and it took not just the crypto ecosystem but also the world of trad-fi by storm, onboarding almost one million Trump loyalists to crypto, with 50% of holders being first-time crypto users. Trump, the gift that keeps on giving According to the official meme site , those eligible for the airdrop can claim three $Trump coins until March 1 for purchasing official merchandise. The claim page includes a message informing participants that the airdrop is Trump’s way of rewarding those who showed him love by buying a Trump product. Those eligible for the token claim can redeem their rewards through Crossmint; all they need to do is input the email address they used for their Trump product purchase. Every mail gets the same allocation regardless of how many products were purchased. The airdrop seems to be a part of a wider strategy from the Trump team to parlay holders of the $Trump meme into an active crypto community the site is aiming will be the “Biggest, Strongest Crypto Community the World has ever experienced!” The $Trump meme was a mixed bag for the crypto ecosystem Solana became the go-to chain for memecoins in this crypto cycle thanks to its rapid capabilities. However, the network has also led to significant losses for the newer, less experienced players, and that was before the POTUS, arguably the most powerful man on earth right now, decided to get fully involved with crypto. It all started with Trump endorsing crypto during his campaign. Then, he launched the official $Trump meme on the weekend before his inauguration, which made profits for some and losses for many. Since the meme launched, there have been mixed reactions regarding its impact on the ecosystem, with the demerits seemingly outweighing the merits. One camp believes the $Trump meme has helped the crypto space gain significant exposure and attract new users. Nevermind that the coin lacks a real use case or intrinsic value. For the most part, they are right; the meme did expose the larger mass of otherwise non-crypto-oriented noobs to crypto, Solana, and memes. However, those new users have been getting the undiluted experience of market volatility, which is also thanks to Trump and his memes. Those who have problems with the $Trump meme have accused it of draining liquidity from the space as those who made profits from investing cashed in their earnings. This extracted billions in liquidity from other memecoins and altcoins is making an already hard-to-trade market even more difficult to navigate. There is also the volatility linked to the meme’s hype, which saw its market cap surge to $14.5 billion at peak hours before crashing by about 70%. Since the launch, the space has seen a new wave of celebrity memes, including one from Trump’s wife, Melania. There have also been rumors of other presidents following Trump’s lead to create a memecoin like Faustin-Archange Touadéra, who reportedly launched $CAR. Critics also blame the $Trump meme for seemingly encouraging market manipulation at a crucial time for the space as it seeks mass adoption. The immediate liquidity extraction from the recently launched LIBRA meme backed by Argentine president Javier Milei does not help matters. Things have gotten so bad that one user even mused out loud, asking if Gary Gensler’s combative SEC had not been saving us from ourselves before.

Could Panshibi Actually Hit The 20x People Are Saying?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/why-will-doge-achieve-40-in-30d-could-panshibi-actually-hit-the-20x-people-are-saying,"The meme coin market is up and bustling already, with many of the top meme coins climbing to fresh gains. The newly-launched TRUMP coin nudged Dogecoin to new highs, and the Dogecoin price prediction is looking good for Q1. There's so much good cheer among meme coins, especially with the DeFi sector still reeling from financial changes in the past few weeks. We have a new meme coin project, Panshibi , looking to ride the momentum of the positive atmosphere to new profits. It's a new meme project filled with opportunities for fresh gains in 2025. The question is if DOGE and the SHIBI project will deliver their expected gains and which is the more profitable investment. Get familiar with Dogecoin! Dogecoin launched in 2013, offering the occasional laugh in the crypto-verse and a welcome relief from all the hard trading. Over time, the meme culture has eroded, but Dogecoin has maintained its top meme coin spot. Sure, the meme coin sector doesn't bear as much longevity for profits as the DeFi sector, but the short bursts on the average meme coin could make millionaires out of ordinary holders. The Dogecoin price prediction has the token setting its sights on the dollar mark, but so muchstands in the way. Convincing the meme enthusiasts is one thing, and getting them to be loyal supporters of the Dogecoin project is another. It gets even more difficult when there's a rather appealing platform like Panshibi (SHIBI) lurking. Could Dogecoin have one more trick up its sleeves for profits? Dogecoin price prediction: $1 looking likely? The Dogecoin price could be onto something special, especially as the token is sensitive to meme coin surges, as well as Bitcoin's uptrends. Dogecoin is about to receive another boon, this time from the SEC, as the DOGE ETF petitions are getting ‘high odds of approval’ from concerned parties. Analysts have deduced that the commission might be amenable to approving the launch of ETFs for Litecoin, Ripple, and Dogecoin later in 2025. The SEC is under new leadership, and crypto trading will be a lot freer, even for institutional traders. With the atmosphere being so positive around Dogecoin, the dreams of a dollar surge are almost feasible. However, it won't be a smooth ride there. The Dogecoin price prediction will have to contend with the Panshibi prospects. Just how much fun will that be? Panshibi profits explained! The Panshibi platform is an embodiment of excellent features, and the new project will be looking to take full advantage of the positive disposition towards memes in the past few weeks. Meme coin launches are a reminder of the prospects of becoming millionaires; you don't want to miss out on SHIBI tokens. Why? The Panshibi launch won't take place as the regular token launch does. The Devs have decided to have the tokens launched on centralized exchanges before they get to the DEXs. The reason is simple too. With the SHIBI tokens available to institutionalized traders, there will be a high demand for the Panshibi coins. And with that initial spike, the SHIBI price will be off to a flying start. By the time the tokens get to the DEXs, Panshibi will already be stable enough to compete at the top of the crypto ranks. From all indications, the Panshibi launch will see the token make a 145,000% surge for its users. And you know who will be the biggest winners? The early presale buyers. Join them today–get your SHIBI tokens before they launch! Panshibi presale: SHIBI up for grabs! The Dogecoin price prediction has a lot of gravitas, but clearly not as much as the incoming Panshibi launch. The presale is ongoing and in stage 4 in less than four weeks. Each SHIBI coin costs $0.005, and with that, you still have a chance at about 400% ROI before launch.

Among them, Dogecoin and the newly introduced TRUMP coin are garnering attention. The predictions for Dogecoin's value look promising this quarter, influenced by a shift in market dynamics. Meanwhile, a fresh player named Panshibi is stepping into the spotlight, hoping to capitalize on the buoyant sentiment surrounding meme coins. This innovative project could serve as a beacon for investors searching for new opportunities. Tracing the Journey of Dogecoin Since its inception in 2013, Dogecoin has been a hallmark of meme coin culture. Initially a tongue-in-cheek creation, it now stands as a testament to the potential and volatility of crypto investments. Although meme coins might not offer the prolonged profitability seen in DeFi, Dogecoin continues to captivate with its ambitious goal of reaching the dollar mark. Attracting a loyal community is essential for sustaining Dogecoin's upward momentum. However, competition from platforms like Panshibi (SHIBI) can challenge its market dominance, pushing Dogecoin to explore new strategies for retention and growth. Could Dogecoin's Price Breakthrough Hit $1? The possibility of Dogecoin making substantial gains is increasingly plausible, particularly in light of the crypto market's recent trends and regulatory changes. With potential ETF approvals for Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin and Ripple, we might witness a more favorable trading environment facilitated by the SEC. While the odds are favorable, the journey to a dollar won't be without challenges. Rivalry with promising tokens like Panshibi could make the road to massive profits an exhilarating yet uncertain ride. Exploring Panshibi's Potential Panshibi is setting the stage for what could be a game-changing debut in the meme coin universe. This new venture seeks to leverage the current excitement for meme coins, suggesting an enticing opportunity for those eager to explore SHIBI tokens. Departing from the conventional launch approach, Panshibi will first appear on centralized exchanges, a strategic move expected to boost initial demand and stabilize its market presence. As the tokens transition to decentralized exchanges, the groundwork for its competitive stance in the crypto hierarchy will already be laid. The anticipated growth of Panshibi could spell considerable gains, with the prospect of a remarkable surge making early participants the likely beneficiaries. Seizing the Opportunity with Panshibi Presale While Dogecoin's trajectory draws widespread attention, the unfolding Panshibi presale promises compelling returns. Currently, in stage four, each SHIBI coin is priced attractively at $0.005, presenting a golden chance to lock in a significant ROI ahead of the launch.

According to a report by The Perryman Group, most of the industry is concentrated in twelve states, with Texas being the largest contributor. Economic and Social Benefits The study shows that Bitcoin mining in Texas generates approximately $1.7 billion in gross product and creates more than 12,200 jobs, including those linked to utility-related activities. Other major states include Georgia which gives $316.8 million in annual gross product and 2,300 jobs, and New York with $225.9 million and 1,600 respectively. Bitcoin miners also play a role in local communities. Mining companies often make charitable contributions and sponsor local events. They also invest in community infrastructure which helps to improve the living standards. Additionally, these entities provide specialized training programs and prioritize hiring a diverse workforce. Due to their flexible power consumption, Bitcoin miners can adjust their energy usage during times of grid stress hence helping to stabilize demand. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), their predictable demand for power aids in energy planning and supports investments in power generation and transmission. Despite the economic benefits, the industry faces regulatory challenges at both the state and federal levels. Critics have raised concerns about the environmental impact of its high energy consumption, leading some states like New York to introduce restrictions on mining. At the federal level, lawmakers have debated potential taxation policies on mining operations and environmental reporting requirements. However, many firms have adopted strategies to reduce emissions and use renewable energy. Some are repurposing excess energy, such as using methane from oil fields or heat from mining operations for other uses like greenhouse farming. The United States’ Appeal and Trump’s Vision The U.S. is an attractive location for Bitcoin mining due to low-cost energy, particularly in states like Texas, Washington, and Wyoming, which offer some of the cheapest electricity rates in the country. U.S. President Donald Trump has also expressed strong support for the Bitcoin mining industry. During his 2024 presidential campaign, he stated his goal to make the nation the “crypto capital of the planet” and highlighted mining’s importance for national security. Trump has advocated for building power plants specifically for mining operations using fossil fuels and nuclear energy to support the sector. His vision includes ensuring all the remaining Bitcoin is mined in the U.S., with a focus on strengthening the nation’s role in crypto and AI.

Among these contenders, Remittix has surged in popularity by aiming to transform the colossal $190 trillion global payments sector. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI focuses on AI-driven blockchain, and Pluto Chain seeks to expand DeFi solutions to a broader user base. Remittix’s core offering merges decentralized finance with everyday banking networks, enabling users to send fiat payments worldwide using crypto. By tackling high fees and slow transaction times, Remittix endeavors to bring cross-border remittances into a new era. This article explores how each project competes for the title of Best Crypto Presale and why Remittix appears poised to dominate in 2025. Why Remittix Is the Best Crypto Presale Remittix has already raised over $12 million in its presale, selling more than 461 million tokens (70% of supply) at a current price of $0.0599. Such traction underscores substantial investor confidence as participants recognize the platform’s potential to reimagine global remittances. With PayFi as its flagship innovation, Remittix promises instant crypto-to-fiat conversions for over 50 crypto pairs and 30 fiat currencies. By minimizing hidden fees, Remittix allows a sender in Europe to transfer funds to a recipient in Asia without the recipient even knowing crypto was involved. Imagine an expatriate in the U.K. sending rent money back home with no bulky forex charges and no protracted delays. This straightforward mechanism is among the reasons many deem Remittix the Best Crypto Presale, especially in regions where up to 60% of the population remains unbanked. Looking ahead, Remittix has a “Remittix Pay” API so merchants can accept crypto and settle in fiat instantly. That approach could revolutionize global commerce by uniting blockchain technology with established banking rails. If Remittix captures even a fraction of the $190 trillion payments market, its token valuation may experience exponential gains, rewarding early participants in this ambitious presale. Beyond standard remittances, Remittix envisions bridging untapped corridors in Africa, Asia, and South America, areas often overlooked by major financial institutions. In these markets, a stable way to move money can drastically improve lives, and Remittix’s solution offers speed, accessibility, and cost efficiency. The project’s roadmap anticipates multiple exchange listings, further fueling the consensus that it’s the Best Crypto Presale to watch right now. Lightchain AI: AI-Driven Potential Lightchain AI Blockchain Lightchain AI prioritizes blockchain-based artificial intelligence, aiming to streamline data-intensive tasks and reduce gas costs for dApp developers. Interest has soared, with the project reportedly raising over $15.5 million, according to news outlets . This model could entice enterprises looking to deploy machine-learning workloads on a decentralized network. However, adoption timelines remain uncertain; larger corporations may tread carefully around on-chain AI solutions, given compliance and scalability questions. Even so, Lightchain AI’s success in the presale phase highlights market demand for forward-thinking technology. Pluto Chain: Another DeFi Player Pluto Chain, on the other hand, aims to create user-centric decentralized finance protocols that simplify staking, yield farming, and governance. Its roadmap is outlined in the Pluto Chain’s (PLUTO) Review , and the token’s availability on Coinbase underscores its public accessibility. Despite its growing user base, Pluto Chain competes in a crowded DeFi space populated by established giants. While it could find success through niche offerings or strategic partnerships, its overall market impact may be overshadowed by large-scale payment transformations like the one Remittix is pushing. Conclusion As the hunt for the Best Crypto Presale intensifies, Remittix, Lightchain AI, and Pluto Chain each bring unique value propositions. Pluto Chain zeroes in on DeFi simplification, while Lightchain AI banks on the rising intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Yet the most immediate real-world use case for global remittances is dominated by Remittix, which has already secured significant funding and a clear roadmap to tap the $190 trillion payments market. With over $12 million raised and more than 70% of tokens sold at $0.0599, Remittix stands ready to merge blockchain capabilities with everyday banking systems. Its “Remittix Pay” API, multi-fiat support, and drive for financial inclusion position it as a tangible solution for millions worldwide. That conviction is reinforced by multiple analyst opinions on Remittix , which highlight Remittix’s market-shifting potential. If the project delivers on its PayFi vision, Remittix could redefine cross-border transfers and simultaneously benefit those underserved by traditional finance. Given these factors, many analysts see it as the Best Crypto Presale of the year one that might shape the future of global finance.

Yet, the volatility unveiled hidden opportunities as some digital currencies defied trends with innovative strategies and steadfast growth. Key among these are Panshibi, a novel AI-driven meme coin, and Cardano, both making waves with their distinctive approaches. The Rise of Panshibi: A New Player in Meme Cryptos Panshibi, an AI-powered meme coin, capitalizes on the meme culture explosion by infusing technology and community spirit. This panda-themed token has seen exceptional success, amassing nearly $1 million in its presale. Investors are flocking to join the venture, drawn by the promise of rewards like annual returns up to 1200% for staked tokens. Their roadmap, including NFT projects and future exchange listings, positions Panshibi as a sustainable contender in the meme coin landscape. The success of Panshibi demonstrates a shift in focus towards coins offering more than just entertainment value. With community at its core and utility through artificial intelligence enhancements, Panshibi aims to be more than a fleeting trend. Cardano: The Veteran Thrives Amid ETF Speculation On another front, Cardano has surged with renewed vigor. The altcoin has seen impressive growth, partly fueled by the potential of an ETF launch spearheaded by Grayscale Investments. Cardano's price trajectory shows significant promise, indicating potential major gains, possibly reaching the $1 mark. The network has witnessed a surge in activity, with an increase of 20,000 active wallets, reflecting heightened institutional interest. Technical indicators, including Elliott Wave theory and RSI, suggest a positive outlook for Cardano, hinting at an impending bullish trend that could further uplift its market standing. Leveraging Market Dynamics The unfolding stories of Panshibi and Cardano reveal strategic positioning in a volatile environment. While Panshibi rides the wave of meme culture with added technological value, Cardano capitalizes on strong market fundamentals and institutional attention. Together, they showcase how adaptability and innovation can offer resilience and prosperity in crypto investments.

Bitcoin dropped to $92k and ETH followed suit with a drop to a monthly low of nearly $2,500. However, innovation and resilience have spotlighted two dark horses that defied the trend: Panshibi and Cardano. Despite the prevailing market uncertainty, Cardano's price has held its ground with an 12% gain in the past week. Panshibi is also riding the wave of the meme coin mania in its ongoing presale. The Panda-themed altcoin and its innovative AI appeal have raked in close to $1M in its ongoing presale. But can ADA break through key resistance levels, and will SHIBI sustain its meteoric rise? Let’s dive into the market dynamics shaping this frenzy. Panshibi: New AI meme coin gem soars to new ATH in presale. While the market reels, Panshibi, the innovative AI-powered meme coin, has dominated the crypto world with its high-demand presale and innovative meme revolution. Currently in Stage 4, its presale has gone far and wide, with almost $1M raised which reflects strong investors' confidence. The reasons are crystal clear! Panshibi has emerged as the real ""meme killer"" with its well-thought-out approach to upending the hype-fueled meme culture. First, Panshibi is creating an inclusive community that features an ingenious blend of meme virality, the lovable Panda theme and Asian heritage. Secondly, Panshibi's uniqueness and potential transcend its predecessors. It boasts an excellent real-world use case with artificial intelligence and social fi mechanics. This technological advancement helps users enjoy a gamified experience and long-term value. Then, there's the part where every user is rewarded for doing the bare minimum. Token holders earn a whopping passive income by staking their tokens and earning up to 1200% annually. This, and other mouthwatering rewards, had investors scrambling to participate. As with Shiba, timing is everything, and Panshibi is currently riding the positive sentiment around AI cryptos and meme coins. Lastly, Panshibi has a solid plan for the future. Roadmap activities like the NFT launch, staking platform development, and tier-one listing highlight its long-term focus on sustainability. Grayscale's ETF pursuit sent Cardano's price flying. Can it reach $1 this month? Cardano has been on an electrifying ride since the year started. After ending 2024 on a bullish note with increased whale accumulation and a 283% surge from September lows, Cardano again rode on the bullish sentiment with excellent gains this year. Technical analysis suggests that Cardano may be poised for a major breakout. Elliott Wave theory points to a completed corrective wave at approximately $0.54, aligning with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. This signals a potential trend reversal, with ADA beginning a five-wave impulsive rally. Momentum indicators also support a bullish case. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has rebounded from oversold territory, hinting at strong buying interest. Beyond the technicals, rising ETF speculations have fueled institutional demand. Earlier this week, Grayscale Investments filed for a spot in Cardano ETF, and a win could mark a historic moment for Cardano price. In fact, the network saw a 20,000 active wallets increase in active user wallets amid institutional interest. The positive sentiment has been reflected in the Cardano price action. This week alone, the altcoin gained over 12% from last week's low at $0.68. Panshibi takes meme virality to new levels. Despite being in presale, Panshibi has emerged as a defiant force with its AI-driven meme revolution. While Bitcoin and other altcoins wavered, Panshibi’s presale soared past $1 million, proving that innovation and community engagement can override bearish sentiment. SHIBI has proven to be more than a meme with its cutting-edge staking rewards, social-fi mechanics, and a roadmap packed with NFT launches and Tier-1 exchange listings. Fortunately, the price is still at a discounted $0.005 in stage 4 of its limited 60-day presale.

The crypto crashed shortly after, in a move described by the country’s fintech chamber as a “rug pull.” When markets opened in Buenos Aires on Monday, the S&P Merval dropped by amost 6%. The index, which tracks the biggest companies in the South American country, has since rebounded slightly but is still trading 3% lower than when it closed Friday. Argentina’s markets have been thrown into chaos after President Milei deleted his X post advertising $LIBRA, clarifying that he has no affiliation with the digital asset. However, the opposition politicians threatened an impeachment trial in Congress following the mishap. According to Leandro Santoro, who represents the opposition coalition, the president’s post was an embarrassing scandal on an international scale. He argues that such embarrassment requires them to launch an impeachment motion against President Milei. As a result of the sharp price drop in $LIBRA, over $50 million in long positions were liquidated within just two hours after the news broke (Coinglass, 2025). The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell from a neutral 50 to a fear level of 35 following this event (Alternative.me, 2025). The impact extended past $LIBRA because other tokens dependent on the Argentine market such as $PAMPAS fell 4.5% from $0.85 to $0.81 between 9:30 AM and 10:30 AM EST (CryptoCompare, 2025). $PAMPAS trading volume rose by 300% from 2 million to 8 million tokens showing a typical panic selling behaviour (CoinGecko, 2025). Argentina’s crypto market shaken by alleged presidential misconduct The $LIBRA token price also fell steeply: from $12.45 to $9.87 between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM EST, a 20.8% drop in one hour (CoinMarketCap, 2025). The effect was not only felt on the $LIBRA token but the other cryptocurrencies traded in Argentina also felt the heat with $BTC falling 3.2% from $45,000 to $43,560 and $ETH dropping 2.8% from $3,200 to $3,110 in the same period (CoinGecko, 2025). The trading volume of $LIBRA increased from 5 million to 15 million tokens in the first hour of the news (TradingView, 2025); this is a clear indication of panic unloading among investors. Political and economic analysts believe that the opposition does not have enough votes to carry out the impeachment threats. However, the charges, including fraud and the direct role in encouraging crypto, should hurt the government. As Argentina holds mid-term elections this year, this may affect Milei’s result. First, the president’s action impacted not only the opposition lawmakers but also investors. Most of the investors took to social media and got angry, claiming that he had defrauded them of their hard-earned money. On the other hand, Milei’s supporters are claiming that he is a political witch hunt victim. ONG Bitcoin Argentina , a non-profit organization that supports local education, said that such irresponsible promotion of assets is a threat to thousands of people. The nonprofit emphasized on education and transparency to protect people from such risks. During a morning conference, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to questions on the scandal, saying the public would have to see the results of the investigations. It is extremely serious if confirmed, especially in terms of a president’s powers to promote something private. If, as a president of a country, you propose something for private benefit, there is an obvious conflict of interest. President Claudia Sheinbaum Milei smells political interference from power-hungry people who mean harm to Argentina In the last few days, Milei has not become shy about criticism. He came out swinging hard in the face of criticism as he talked of political opportunists. He noted that the “filthy rats” of the political class wanted to fuel the scandal for their political mileage and to do harm. He noted that he is getting more convictions to make them understand that they should not be able to intervene in the events. The president acknowledged his limited understanding of the cryptocurrency initiative and, upon further investigation, opted to discontinue its promotion. The scandal happens as Milei is set to visit the United States this week, hoping to meet President Trump. The leader seeks to lobby Trump to support Argentina in getting more resources from the IMF under a new program still under negotiation, including exemptions from Trump’s tariffs.

From DeFi facilitating unrestricted banking to NFTs revolutionizing digital asset ownership, significant innovations are emerging beyond mere speculation. These top innovations have moved past the conceptual stage; they represent tangible investment opportunities. This article highlights the top four cryptos to buy that are actively developing, expanding, and capturing market share. 1. Web3Bay: Redefining Online Shopping with Fairness The convenience of online shopping masks the control traditional platforms hold over transactions. They set fees, manipulate visibility, and harvest user data. Web3Bay introduces a decentralized marketplace that eliminates these impositions, enabling direct and transparent interactions between buyers and sellers. Sellers retain a larger share of their profits, avoiding hefty platform fees. Meanwhile, buyers earn 3BAY tokens through purchases and participation, which contrasts sharply with the unilateral decisions made by traditional retail giants. The governance of Web3Bay is determined by its community, offering users real influence over its operations. Web3Bay has raised $1.4 million in its presale, with all tokens in the first three stages sold out, and the fourth stage nearly complete at $0.004562625 per token. Early investors are positioned for a potential return of up to 6,430% by the launch date. As traditional platforms tighten their grip, Web3Bay presents a compelling alternative that empowers its users. The critical question is whether you will join this shift in online shopping, marking one of the top cryptos to buy before it scales further. 2. Bittensor: Democratizing AI Development Today’s AI landscape is predominantly controlled by major corporations. Bittensor aims to disrupt this by decentralizing AI, granting wider access to developers and researchers. This open-source network compensates contributors, fostering a collaborative environment for AI development. The TAO token fuels this ecosystem, motivating developers to enhance AI models. While decentralization is appealing, the question remains whether Bittensor can compete with the computational power and efficiency of centralized AI behemoths like Google and OpenAI. 3. Helium: Decentralizing Wi-Fi Access Dominance by major internet providers may soon be challenged by Helium, which allows users to manage their own decentralized wireless networks. Users set up hotspots, earn rewards, and expand coverage for IoT devices, including smart meters and GPS trackers. The simple principle of sharing connectivity and earning HNT tokens in return positions Helium as a potential game-changer for smart cities and various industries reliant on IoT. Currently, HNT shows a modest price of $4.33, indicating slow but stable growth. 4. Gala: True Ownership of In-Game Assets The gaming industry sees substantial investment in digital items, yet players lack actual ownership. Gala Games addresses this by using blockchain technology to ensure real ownership of digital assets within games. Players can trade, sell, or retain their in-game items across various platforms, an innovation already implemented on Gala’s live platform. GALA token mirrors these advancements with a market movement reflecting a trading volume of $119.5 million at a price of $0.03108. Identifying the Top Cryptos to Buy Today While the blockchain sector is rife with innovative ideas, actual adoption distinguishes the top cryptos to buy from fleeting trends. Helium tests the feasibility of decentralized networks against traditional telecom giants, Bittensor seeks to make AI more accessible, and Gala champions genuine ownership of in-game assets. These projects not only advocate for their respective causes but also demonstrate significant market engagement, with Web3Bay showcasing the practical application of decentralized commerce, evidenced by significant early-stage investments and the potential for substantial returns. Such opportunities are for those who recognize and act on them promptly.

While investors have enjoyed the rapid gains, savvy investors question whether BROCCOLI can sustain its momentum or its just a short lived hype. Analysts are urging investors to rotate their BROCCOLI short-term gains into projects with real utility, and RCO Finance (RCOF) is emerging as the top pick. With AI-powered tools and high growth potential, the RCOF altcoin will redefine the DeFi sector. BROCCOLI: From Meme Hype to Market Reality Memecoins have historically provided short-term speculative gains, with only a few that go beyond the hype. The latest sensation, BROCCOLI , follows a viral sensation inspired by Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s dog. Changpeng revealed the name of his pet dog, Broccoli, sparking a meme coin frenzy that led to the token’s upswing. At press time, BROCCOLI is trading at $0.0009441 after surging by 1,075% in the past day. The reality of memecoins is short-lived, as, without real utility, sustainability remains questionable. Similarly, analysts warn that once speculative traders exit, BROCCOLI will face price stagnation. Investors seeking sustainable long-term returns should focus on projects offering real utility beyond speculation, such as RCOF, which integrates AI and blockchain technology. RCOF: The AI-Driven Altcoin Redefining Crypto Investment Amidst the memecoin hype and short-term gains, RCOF altcoin is positioning itself as an AI-powered trading platform that will revolutionize how we trade and invest. At its core is the AI Robo-advisor , which personalizes investment strategies based on investors’ risk profiles, financial goals, and market trends. RCOF users will stand out in the volatile crypto market with this tailored approach, enabling them to maximize their profits. Unlike human financial advisors, the Robo-advisor continuously adapts to real-time data to ensure optimal fund allocation while adjusting your investment portfolio. The tool helps curb human error and eliminates emotional bias that clouds investor judgment. Timing is everything in the crypto market, and RCOF’s predictive analytics is one of its outstanding features. For instance, the Robo-advisors could have identified BROCCOLI’s meteoric rise, allowing investors to capitalize on gains before its inevitable correction. The tool equips traders with accurate insights ahead of market movements. Unlike BROCCOLI, RCOF altcoin gives users access to over 120,000 tradable assets that include stocks, bonds, ETFs, forex, and tokenized real-world assets. This broad selection enables investors to diversify their investment portfolios to ensure balanced risk management. Investors can stake their assets in the RCOF liquidity pools so that there is sufficient liquidity for trading activities. The integration of liquidity pools improves the trading experience and ensures assets are exchanged quickly and efficiently. In return, investors earn passive income, such as RCOF tokens and dividends. Unlike legacy platforms that require identity verification, the RCOF altcoin operates without a KYC ecosystem. This gives investors the freedom to trade anonymously, with the platform guaranteeing security while maintaining full decentralization. Again, the RCOF altcoin has been thoroughly audited by SolidProof to confirm that the platform is free from vulnerabilities. This boosts investor confidence in the altcoin, as investors know that their assets are safe and secure. If you want to catch a glimpse into the future of trading, the altcoin recently launched its AI beta platform . This is a rare occurrence as other projects wait until after launching their token to test their beta phase. Over 10k active users are onboard, signaling strong market demand for the altcoin offering. Since this is its beta phase, investors can expect more enhancements upon its alpha phase rollout when the token is launched. RCOF Presale: Massive Returns Await Early Investors BROCCOLI’s rapid rise has thrilled many crypto investors, but those looking for long-term utility should rotate their gains to RCOF . This altcoin has high growth potential that could surpass BROCCOLI’s recent surge. The RCOF presale is in stage 5, with tokens priced at just $0.10, having raised $13.64M. Analysts predict that the listing price could be between $0.4 and $0.6, giving early investors a 500% ROI. Investors who bought RCOF tokens in stage 1 will boast over 3,000% ROI during listing, showing the importance of early entry into a promising project. The clock is ticking as the RCOF altcoin presale has limited allocated tokens up for grabs. With its AI-powered ecosystem and real-world utility, the altcoin is a game changer in DeFi.

It is currently trading below the $100,000 mark, an 11.4% decrease from its peak. The crypto asset’s recent trajectory has raised questions about its next move as it trades within a relatively tight range. According to CryptoQuant analyst Percival, Bitcoin is exhibiting a pattern that hints at upcoming significant market movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Late Longs Liquidated: Is a Breakout Finally on the Horizon? Potential Support Levels and Short-Term Indicators In a post titled “Bitcoin ready for either side,” Percival highlights the asset’s current “loading phase.” He explains that Bitcoin’s price dynamics have historically shown abrupt rises followed by prolonged periods of consolidation. The Choppiness Index—a measure used to determine whether the market is trending or consolidating—currently indicates instability, with daily and weekly readings at 62 and 72, respectively. Percival notes that this is a sign of impending volatility. Over the past 90 days, Bitcoin’s range has fluctuated within a band of roughly 16%, suggesting mounting pressure for a breakout. Percival outlines key price levels that could act as support if Bitcoin’s price declines further. The Short Term Holders Cost Base, located at $92,000, is the first significant support level. If that fails, the next support zone lies between $80,000 and $89,000, aligning with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). These levels could provide critical price floors as traders assess whether the current downtrend is nearing an end. The analyst also examines the short-term Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a metric that helps gauge whether coins moving on-chain are being sold at a profit or loss. Currently sitting just below 1, the SOPR suggests the market is near equilibrium. Percival compares the current scenario to August 2023, when a similar setup preceded significant price movements. At that time, low volatility cleared out traders with positions in the wrong direction before a major rally ensued. Today’s conditions—marked by a test zone near 0.99—suggest that sudden price swings could trigger liquidations and short-term panic. Bitcoin Market Sentiment and Next Steps Overall, Percival points out that Bitcoin’s market structure often involves false moves before establishing a clear trend. Breakout traders positioned near the current levels could find their positions shaken out before a sustained directional move materializes. This pattern highlights the importance of caution, particularly for traders attempting to time the market’s next breakout. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at $96,265 after seeing a 1% decrease in the past day. According to a renowned crypto analyst, Ali on X, the asset is likely to see a notable rebound in the near term based on its TD sequential indicator flashing a buy signal. After accurately timing the recent local top, the TD Sequential indicator is now flashing a buy signal on the #Bitcoin $BTC 4-hour chart, suggesting a potential price rebound! pic.twitter.com/3IzinRirxo — Ali (@ali_charts) February 17, 2025 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin market|btc|BTC market|BTCUSDT|crypto|cryptoquant,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-18 00:00:23

Solana (SOL), currently trading at $199.48, has seen a minor 2.29% dip, but its range of $198.11 to $205.83 suggests a solid foundation for future growth. Experts whisper about the possibility of a $635 Solana price tag, fueled by bullish momentum and increasing adoption. Yet, seasoned investors know that while Solana price predictions excite the masses, true wealth is built by getting in early on disruptive opportunities . That’s where one $0.0420 AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), is turning heads, with experts forecasting a jaw-dropping 3,210% surge before the year ends. Solana’s (SOL) Strength Is Clear, But AI Coins Are The Future AI is reshaping every industry, and crypto is no exception. Machine learning algorithms, predictive analytics, and smart automation are no longer theoretical concepts: they are driving multi-billion-dollar valuations. While Solana price speculations remain a hot topic, the real breakthrough investments are AI coins like the $0.0420 WallitIQ (WLTQ) . This isn’t just another AI coin; it’s a SolidProof-audited innovation hub designed for easy financial interactions and lucrative passive income opportunities. There’s no denying Solana’s (SOL) institutional support, high-speed transactions, and growing adoption among developers. A rally to $635 is entirely plausible. But let’s be honest, the true potential for 3,210% gains now lies in AI coins, where exponential growth is still up for grabs. Experts recognize that the combination of AI and blockchain is a seismic shift, and few projects embody this synergy as powerfully as WallitIQ (WLTQ). This next-generation AI coin doesn’t just promise high returns; it delivers real-world utility that’s redefining how users interact with crypto. The AI Coin That’s Reshaping Financial Transactions WallitIQ (WLTQ) isn’t just about speculation; experts have recognized its fully-fledged ecosystem that rewards users for engaging in the digital economy. Imagine a world where every transaction gives you up to 12% cashback, a revolutionary feature that turns spending into an opportunity for returns. While Solana (SOL) investors debate the Solana price trajectory, early adopters of this platform are already securing future profits. Unlike traditional cryptos, this AI coin integrates biometric authentication , giving only authorized users access to assets. Every investor dreams of making money while they sleep. That’s exactly what staking opportunities in WallitIQ (WLTQ) provide. By simply holding and staking tokens, users can generate passive income, compounding their gains over time. The added advantage? Custom alerts that keep users ahead of market trends. While many rely on slow-moving news sources, this AI coin delivers real-time insights directly to your device, helping you never miss an opportunity. Experts Predict A Parabolic Surge Before The Masses Catch On Experts are closely watching this new platform over Solana (SOL). With the upcoming beta launch , the window for entry at today’s undervalued WallitIQ (WLTQ) price is closing fast. While the Solana price might double or triple in the best-case scenario, the upside on this AI coin is far greater. Experts’ projections don’t lie: 3,210% gains aren’t just speculation; they are based on solid adoption trends, feature rollouts, and the increasing role of AI in decentralized finance. Many traders struggle with managing multiple wallets and transactions across various platforms. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) MVP build is set to eliminate that headache, offering an advanced solution for handling crypto assets with ease. As Solana (SOL) continues its upward trajectory, investors looking for the next explosive opportunity are turning their focus here. The Urgency Is Real: The Beta Platform Is Launching Soon While the Solana price chase continues, those who recognize the AI revolution’s true potential are acting now. The upcoming beta launch of this crypto project marks a pivotal moment; once adoption kicks in, early prices will be a thing of the past. Solana (SOL) remains a strong player, and its journey to $635 will be an exciting ride. But the bigger story is unfolding elsewhere.

Through continuous governance enhancements, AI partnerships, and ETF submissions, Cardano is bolstering its stance in the cryptocurrency market. Nonetheless, in spite of these optimistic signs, the ADA price prediction 2025 indicates that it might find it challenging to surpass Remittix, the 'new XRP,' which is transforming blockchain finance. By connecting crypto and traditional finance, Remittix is quickly emerging as the next big crypto. Remittix is currently in its presale phase, having raised over $11 million with each token sold at $0.0567. For early adoption and the benefit of prospective investors, Remittix has launched an exclusive giveaway. ADA Price Prediction 2025: Cardano’s expanding ecosystem With ADA price prediction 2025 remaining a hot topic among investors, Cardano is achieving considerable progress in governance, security, and institutional adoption. The move towards an official Constitution has reinforced its decentralized ecosystem, while the Plomin hard fork and Lace Wallet upgrades have improved security and adaptability. Grayscale's application for a Cardano ETF signifies increasing institutional interest, which could lead to broader mainstream adoption. With whale holdings surpassing 1.41 billion ADA , investor trust continues to be strong. Despite these advancements, the ADA price prediction 2025 indicates that Cardano's price moved -1.36% to $0.803 and trading volume moved -3.92% to $754.35m. Cardano's Market Outlook for 2025 vs. The Rise of Remittix Although Cardano's market outlook for 2025 is positive, the ADA price prediction for 2025 indicates that Remittix is rising as a strong competitor due to its advanced payment technology. Remittix is transforming worldwide transactions with its efficient crypto-to-fiat payment system. Cardano’s venture into AI and blockchain governance is praiseworthy; however, the ADA price prediction for 2025 indicates that Remittix’s genuine financial applications and international payment solutions provide it with a tangible advantage. With the rapid adoption of blockchain, investors are more often looking for assets that have direct financial integration instead of speculative growth. Why Remittix, the 'New XRP,' is Outshining ADA The main reason Remittix is gaining momentum against ADA is its capability to simplify financial transactions for both businesses and individuals. In contrast to Cardano's emphasis on long-term infrastructure advancement, Remittix is achieving immediate outcomes with its instant settlements, fiat integrations, and scalable payment network. Remittix guarantees smooth multi-chain interoperability, enabling users to easily transfer assets across different blockchain networks. Due to this characteristic, it competes directly with XRP's international payment system, offering quicker transaction times, reduced fees, and enhanced accessibility. Furthermore, Remittix is increasing its ties with financial institutions, enabling businesses to incorporate blockchain transactions inside traditional banking systems. Can ADA Compete With the 'New XRP'? Although the ADA price prediction for 2025 indicates potential new peaks, it also recognizes that Remittix's rapid adoption and effective financial solutions position it as the better option. The Cardano's market outlook for 2025 appears robust, yet its rivalry with Remittix, the 'New XRP,' is becoming more intense. As additional investors see Remittix as the 'New XRP', it is evident that its practical usability, scalability, and financial integration position it as the top altcoin for 2025. As Remittix grows its functionality, it is gaining recognition not only as an alternative to ADA but also as a genuine leader in blockchain-based financial services. In contrast to ADA, which continues to depend significantly on ecosystem growth, Remittix is actively delivering tangible payment solutions that are transforming global finance. This essential distinction is the reason investors are choosing Remittix.

Could Ripple finally reach $27 and break resistance? Table of Contents Ripple’s wild ride Is the XRP ETF finally coming? XRP’s make-or-break moment looms XRP price prediction: Could history repeat itself? Ripple’s wild ride Ripple ( XRP ) has experienced a rollercoaster ride in recent months, capturing the market’s attention with large price swings and major regulatory developments. On Jan. 16, the token surged to a multi-year high of $3.39, fueled by strong market sentiment. However, the rally was short-lived. As of Feb. 17, XRP has pulled back to $2.68, marking a 21% decline from its January peak. It remains approximately 31% below its all-time high of $3.89, which was reached in January 2018. Despite this pullback, XRP remains one of the top-performing assets in the top 100, delivering an impressive 145% return over the past 90 days. This outpaces heavyweights like Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ), both of which have lost value during the same period. Amid these fluctuations, broader market forces are also at play. The election of President Donald Trump introduced a more crypto-friendly atmosphere in the U.S., with the Trump administration’s positive stance on digital assets boosting investor confidence. This, in turn, has contributed to the upward trajectory of crypto assets, including XRP. Additionally, the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler has further fueled optimism, as market participants anticipate a more accommodating regulatory environment under the new SEC leadership of acting chair Mark Uyeda. With a mix of strong price action, regulatory intrigue, and shifting political winds, what can we expect from XRP? Let’s explore this further in our Ripple price prediction. Is the XRP ETF finally coming? Amid ongoing volatility and key developments, XRP has remained in the spotlight. A major turning point came on Feb. 13, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission formally acknowledged a filing from the New York Stock Exchange and Grayscale Investments for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. The proposal outlines a plan to convert Grayscale’s existing $16.1 million XRP Trust into a fully tradable ETF, with Coinbase Custody Trust Company acting as the custodian and BNY Mellon handling administrative duties. Update: @NYSE & @Grayscale have filed to convert Grayscale's XRP trust into an ETF. The trust currently has ~$16 mln in assets. pic.twitter.com/QAufZoKDkA — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 30, 2025 The SEC’s acknowledgement means that the review process has officially begun, setting the stage for a potential approval or rejection within a 240-day window. The first key deadline is set for mid-March, marking the start of a 45-day review period. After that, the SEC may either make a decision or extend the timeline, with a final decision expected by mid-October 2025. But Grayscale isn’t the only firm pushing for an XRP ETF. The Chicago Board Options Exchange has also filed a 19b-4 application for Bitwise’s XRP ETF, with other firms also vying for approval. Unlike Grayscale, which seeks to convert an existing trust into an ETF, Bitwise is launching a completely new fund. 🚨NEW: The @CBOE has just filed the 19b-4s on behalf of @BitwiseInvest and @CanaryFunds for their $XRP ETFs.

He noted that while previous filings have seen starts and stops, with some firms withdrawing their applications, the fact that multiple issuers are now refiling suggests that the SEC is at least open to considering these ETFs. Hougan remains cautiously optimistic, pointing out that while approval could take time, the SEC is becoming more willing to engage in discussions about these products. He also highlighted a key difference between XRP and other commodity-based ETFs like Bitcoin and gold — those assets had regulated futures markets before their ETFs were approved, whereas XRP does not. Although a futures market is not mandatory for XRP ETFs, it would play a key role in the approval process. What makes these filings particularly striking is the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple, arguing that XRP had been sold as an unregistered security. Ripple scored a partial victory in August 2023 when a federal judge ruled that XRP is not a security when traded on secondary markets. However, regulatory uncertainty still persists, making the ETF approval process for XRP more complex compared to spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) or Ethereum ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, pointed out the irony — while the SEC remains in litigation with Ripple, it is simultaneously reviewing an ETF that would hold XRP. Geraci even called it an “enormous message,” suggesting that the SEC’s stance on XRP might be shifting. Shocked more people aren’t talking about SEC accepting XRP ETF filing… They have open litigation w/ Ripple. Meanwhile, they just acknowledged filing of ETF holding asset in dispute (they easily could have rejected this filing). Enormous message IMO. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) February 14, 2025 Adding to the growing buzz, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have estimated a 65% probability of XRP ETF approval by the end of 2025. Our official alt coin ETF approval odds are out. Litecoin leads w 90% chance, then Doge, followed by Solana and XRP. We are only doing for 33 Act $IBIT -esque filings. But def poss to see futures or Cayman-subsidiary type 40 Act stuff get through as well. https://t.co/JSaNnifjbu — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 10, 2025 XRP’s make-or-break moment looms XRP is at a make-or-break moment, approaching a resistance level that has defined its fate for years. Over the past two months, XRP has tested the $3.15 to $3.50 range, a zone that has consistently determined whether XRP breaks into a major rally or gets stuck in consolidation. On Jan. 16, XRP reached a multi-year high of $3.39, but that attempt to push higher ultimately failed. Then, on Feb. 3, XRP plunged 43% to $1.94 as global markets were shaken by Trump’s tariff threats, causing a widespread selloff that led to one of the worst declines in crypto history. Despite the chaos, XRP has since rebounded and is once again nearing the same resistance level, setting the stage for another potential breakout. Beyond the short-term volatility, something even more significant is unfolding. XRP is nearing the completion of a rounding bottom pattern that has been forming since 2018, a structure that has taken nearly seven years to develop. XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news If XRP reaches its all-time high of $3.89, the pattern will officially complete, signalling the end of a prolonged accumulation phase. At that point, XRP would enter price discovery, meaning there would be no historical resistance left to hold it back. The question now is what will provide the final push. Broader market conditions are not fully supportive yet, as Bitcoin hasn’t hit a new all-time high, and liquidity remains concentrated in just a few assets. One of the biggest potential catalysts is ETF approval. If the SEC greenlights an XRP ETF, institutional demand could surge, driving prices past resistance with sheer volume. Another key factor could be strategic adoption — if XRP is included in a financial system reserve or gains a major institutional use case, the surge in demand could propel it into uncharted territory. The third wildcard is the SEC lawsuit appeal. If the appeal is dismissed, legal clarity alone could trigger a wave of buying. Now, all eyes are on whether XRP can finally push through or if history will repeat itself once again. The next attempt to clear $3.50 may prove to be the most significant in its history. XRP price prediction: Could history repeat itself? XRP’s 2017 bull run remains a key reference point, with several indicators suggesting that XRP is now mirroring the setup that led to its parabolic rise. One of the bullish arguments comes from Egrag Crypto, which points to the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB), a technical indicator used to determine whether an asset is in a bullish or bearish phase. #XRP – Double Digits – 1500% Pump ⛽️: Let’s break down what’s happening with #XRP : 1⃣ Bull Market Support Band (BMSB): This is our key indicator for determining whether we’re in a #BullRun or a #BearMarket . Currently, we're positioned above the BMSB. I mentioned in a previous… pic.twitter.com/PNB4OmuCN8 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) February 6, 2025 “Currently, we’re positioned above the BMSB,” he explains, noting that he had predicted XRP would revisit this level, even when the price was at $3.40. A successful retest of this support could signal that the market is gathering strength for the next move. Egrag draws parallels to 2017 when XRP followed a nearly identical pattern. He notes that back then, XRP nearly hit the BMSB, which preceded a 1,500% surge in just four weeks, targeting the Fib 1.618 level. Fibonacci levels are widely used in technical analysis to predict price movements, and in 2017, XRP’s breakout followed this exact pattern. If history repeats itself, Egrag suggests a 1,500% surge to $27. Javon Marks takes this further, highlighting how XRP’s recent price action mirrors its 2017 breakout. Prices recently tested the all-time high as resistance, just as they did in 2017 before surging beyond it. Marks’ new second target is at $99, an astonishing 3,900% increase from current levels. $XRP to $99+🪞: The truth is, most of what we have to connect dots with on XRP is its past price performance and man oh man is this breakout and run shaping up extremely similar to 2017. Prices recently met the All Time High, using it as a resistance, just as it did in 2017… https://t.co/gjFsTxYSwG pic.twitter.com/F0wVWE8v0z — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) February 7, 2025 Beyond Fibonacci extensions, Elliott Wave theory also points to significant potential for XRP. Dark Defender has been tracking XRP’s wave structure since July 2023, when the price was around 40 to 50 cents. XRP had a 4th Wave on his Intermediate Cycle, which I highlighted in Dark Blue, aiming for $5.85 with the 5th Wave. On the other hand, Primary Cycle Waves, highlighted in Light Blue, still aim for $18.22. (Not Financial Advice) I have used the same structure since July 23,… pic.twitter.com/CZXFSRyftb — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) February 3, 2025 According to his analysis, XRP is currently in Wave 4 of the Intermediate Cycle, with Wave 5 targeting $5.85. His Primary Cycle Waves, which track long-term movements, suggest a major upside target of $18.22. “I’ve used the same structure since July 2023, and we are following it as the Northern Star,” Dark Defender explains, suggesting XRP has consistently respected this pattern. If his wave count holds, XRP could be on the verge of completing a major cycle. However, big breakouts don’t happen in isolation. XRP still faces its biggest resistance zone between $3.15 and $3.50, which requires a major catalyst to break through. For traders looking to take advantage of this setup, risk management is key. Placing stop-loss orders can help minimize losses in case of rejection, and avoiding over-leveraging is crucial, as sudden pullbacks could lead to liquidation. However, nothing in the crypto market is guaranteed. The same indicators that suggest explosive upside potential can also fail under changing market conditions. Trade wisely, manage risk, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

After a somewhat tricky 2024, many cryptocurrencies are looking to recoup losses, sustain gains and push beyond resistance levels. Cardano, in particular, has been dominating headlines with big moves and ecosystem development that have sparked a bullish Cardano price prediction. Late last month, the network announced the launch of its highly anticipated Plomin Upgrade and this month, it's the ETF hype. However, one underdog, Panshibi , has been outperforming ADA. This new kid has caused quite a stir with its Panda-themed revolution and AI innovation in the meme market. Let's dive in and explore the latest happenings around the crypto world. Panshibi's AI meme revolution heats up the crypto market. After weeks of presale, Panshibi is still raising the dust as one of the most outstanding meme projects of the year. The presale has already raked in close to a million dollars in its fourth stage after selling out three stages in record time. At its core, Panshibi is upgrading the meme culture from a mere fad-driven speculative hype to an ecosystem thriving on innovation and purpose. The project is a powerful synergy of communities that brings together Asian cultural heritage, Panda lovers and meme enthusiasts. It spices things further by incorporating AI and social-fi to give everyone a chance at an inclusive community and financial freedom. Among its many perks is the stake-to-earn program, which allows token holders to stake their tokens and receive up to 1200% APY annually. The fun doesn't end with the lovable Panda theme. Panshibi offers an immersive gamified experience with various in-game rewards and VIP perks. To show its commitment to security and transparency, the Panshibi team aced a smart contract audit, in addition to locked liquidity and team allocations. The demand and support Panshibi's visionary meme revolution saw is not surprising. Even many experts tip it as one of 2025’s most promising meme coins. Cardano’s Recent Price Surge: Will It Sustain A Bullish Run In 2025 Another altcoin that has been hitting the headlines frequently is Cardano. Despite a tumultuous 2024, Cardano turned its fortunes around in November 2024 after surging 286% to a yearly high of $1.3 after Trump's victory and increased ecosystem activities. While it has noticeably traded below the $1 mark for most of 2025, Cardano price predictions suggest a possible return to a >$1 price in the coming months. These projections are hinged partly on a steady increase in the accumulation of $ADA by Cardano whales. Over the last five days, Binance reports that Cardano whales have bought up about 170 million tokens, which amounts to approximately $136 million. These numbers, of course, suggest massive investor confidence tied not only to Cardano’s intrinsic promise but also to its recent projects and collaborations. Just recently, it announced a deal with Argentina company Globant, which involves the latter using the Cardano blockchain to create decentralized applications. In addition to that, Grayscale Investments also filed for an ADA spot ETF. X analyst Ali Martinez predicted a rebound from current levels at $0.77. The positive sentiment, whale accumulation and SEC projection could see Cardano price prediction surpass its yearly high of $1.3. Conclusion Cardano has been on the rise lately, and there are plenty of reasons to believe it may have a better year than it did in 2024. However, analysts predict a better outing for the Panshibi in 2025 due to its presale heroics. And with a possible 140,000% ROI awaiting token holders after said presale, a massive breakout is extremely likely. The best way to take advantage of Panshibi's promising run is by getting in early. The price now stands at $0.005 in stage 4. The revolution is just getting started, and Panshibi is at the helm!

This announcement arrives alongside a notable price surge, with Cardano jumping to $0.80—up nearly 55% from its monthly low. Amid this excitement, speculations swirl around a secret VIP meeting that Hoskinson hinted at for March 1. Globant Collaboration Shakes Up the Cardano News Scene The new deal, revealed via a tweet from Angry Crypto Show , will see Globant develop decentralized applications on Cardano’s blockchain. The two entities also aim to launch AI-based projects soon, fueling more Cardano News chatter about potential real-world adoption. Globant’s portfolio includes clients like Walt Disney and Nissan, suggesting a wide-reaching impact if Cardano’s technology integrates seamlessly with these global brands. Notably, Cardano’s market cap now stands at about $28.5 billion, with a fully diluted valuation of $35.7 billion. Optimists point to this Globant partnership as evidence that Cardano is edging closer to mainstream recognition. Cardano Whales, who typically shift the market through large-scale buys, have also shown renewed interest, seizing the opportunity to accumulate tokens amid the partnership buzz. Speculation Grows Around Charles Hoskinson’s VIP Meeting Another key piece of Cardano News is Hoskinson’s mysterious VIP engagement slated for March 1. Some community members hope Elon Musk might be involved, potentially paving the way for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to adopt Cardano’s blockchain. Others suggest political figures like Donald Trump or tech entrepreneurs like David Sacks could be on the list. The VIP dinner gets moved Cardano Whales have been particularly vocal about this upcoming rendezvous. They believe any high-profile endorsement could catapult Cardano into the spotlight, mirroring how Musk’s interest in Dogecoin influenced that coin’s trajectory. However, skeptics urge caution, recalling earlier unfulfilled promises—such as a rumored Chainlink partnership and an Ethiopia education initiative that still lacks tangible results. Where Does Cardano Stand Technically? Amid all this Cardano News, technical indicators reveal a stable climb. According to Cardano’s price chart , the token has retested $0.802—its highest level in months. The price currently finds support above the 50-week moving average, reinforcing a bullish outlook. Experts note that Cardano has completed the second phase of the Elliott Wave pattern and could now enter the highly bullish third phase. If this trend continues, the next target might be $2—nearly a 155% leap from current levels. Cardano Whales are monitoring these signals closely, with many believing that the Globant deal and potential VIP endorsement could accelerate the token’s path toward that ambitious price point. Remittix Breaks $12M Barrier: A Rising PayFi Powerhouse While Cardano Whales focus on the new partnership and potential price action, another story is unfolding in parallel. Remittix continues to exceed expectations by raising over $12 million in its presale, selling more than 460 million tokens at $0.0599 each. Branded a PayFi disruptor, Remittix aims to unify crypto’s speed with the familiarity of global banking. For instance, users in remote parts of Africa or Southeast Asia can send cryptocurrency that arrives as fiat in a recipient’s bank account—offering a frictionless, cost-effective alternative to expensive remittance services. Remittix’s approach preserves user privacy by only requiring standard bank details, so recipients remain blissfully unaware the transaction originated in crypto. This synergy could be game-changing in regions where traditional banking infrastructure is limited or prohibitively expensive. Moreover, Remittix’s upcoming Remittix Pay API will allow freelancers and businesses to accept crypto payments, automatically settling the proceeds in fiat. Such flexibility resonates with people seeking greater financial autonomy, mirroring the ethos that draws Cardano Whales to ADA’s long-term potential. The project also shines for its security measures, including a locked liquidity pool and team tokens, plus a fully audited smart contract. Will Cardano Keep On Capturing Attention? Cardano News continues to capture the crypto community’s attention, fueled by a significant new partnership with Globant and the prospect of a headline-grabbing VIP meeting. While Cardano Whales remain instrumental in driving market sentiment, everyday investors also watch closely for any breakthroughs that could trigger a price rally to $2 or beyond. Yet, the blockchain’s track record of delayed promises tempers some of the enthusiasm, leaving room for healthy debate. Meanwhile, Remittix has emerged as an intriguing challenger, bridging the gap between decentralized crypto and conventional finance. Its presale momentum—and potential to reshape cross-border payments—shows that innovative PayFi solutions can thrive in a market often dominated by big-name blockchains. Should it keep evolving at this pace, Remittix might command as much attention from whales and institutions as Cardano does now.

Both projects are strengthening their ecosystems, drawing renewed investor confidence. Meanwhile, Panshibi ($SHIBI) is emerging as a major contender, capturing the attention of big investors seeking high returns. With its innovative Social-Fi integration and skyrocketing presale demand, SHIBI is positioning itself as the next breakout crypto, offering massive returns. Panshibi Surges as Solana & Cardano Investors Seek High-Growth Opportunities Panshibi ($SHIBI) is gaining investor attention at a record pace. The project has become one of the most discussed meme coins on Telegram, Twitter and major crypto forums. Unlike typical meme coins, Panshibi offers real utility through social-Fi and AI-powered features. Holders can join quests, earn rewards and engage in activities that promote long-term growth. The project has a $10 million presale cap, strict liquidity locks and a structured roadmap. Security remains a priority, with a 10-year liquidity lock and a two-year team token lock. These measures ensure stability and prevent early sell-offs, making Panshibi a strong long-term investment. As Cardano and Solana struggle to maintain key levels, traders are shifting their focus to high-growth opportunities. Many are pouring into Panshibi, seeing its potential before it even reaches exchanges. With each presale stage raising the token’s price, early investors stand to gain significantly. While the broader market remains uncertain, Panshibi continues to gain momentum, positioning itself for a major breakout. Solana Gains Strength as ETF Speculation Fuels Demand Solana’s price has been volatile since reaching its all-time high of $294 in January. After a long correction period, the token is regaining momentum. Although Solana recently failed to break the $200 resistance, demand for SOL continues to grow. Speculation about a potential ETF approval this year is driving renewed interest. On-chain data reveals that Solana’s seven-day average transaction fees have surpassed Ethereum’s gas fees since January 9. The blockchain’s lower costs and higher transaction speed continue to attract users and developers. Solana is currently trading at $190.97 after falling 2.84% intraday. The token is also holding above its 200-day EMA, confirming a bullish outlook. The MACD on the 4-hour chart has formed a bullish crossover, further strengthening this trend. Solana has now broken above the key $200 level and analysts are watching to see if it can test the $231 pivot in the coming week. Cardano News: ADA Struggles to Keep Up as Investors Look Elsewhere Cardano’s research-driven development has earned praise. However, agility matters in a fast-moving market. ADA’s slow progress has raised concerns, pushing investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. CoinMarketCap reports that the Cardano coin's valuation is $0.77 yet shows a daily loss of 1.09%. Trading volume has seen a more serious 27.23% decrease, indicating waning market confidence. While some analysts predict a short-term rise to $0.9385 by mid-March, overall sentiment remains negative. In other Cardano news, certain projections suggest Cardano could replicate its 2020 parabolic rally. However, many investors are skeptical that history will repeat itself. As doubts grow, traders are exploring faster-growing alternatives with stronger upside potential.

As investors search for high returns, Panshibi ($SHIBI) stands out by leveraging its unique social-Fi features and robust presale momentum. With an eye on potential breakouts, investors are paying close attention to SHIBI's progress. The Ascent of Panshibi in the Crypto World In a market saturated with meme coins, Panshibi distinguishes itself through tangible utility, encompassing AI-powered tools and community-centric rewards. Discussions in popular crypto forums reflect the growing interest in Panshibi, especially given its structured roadmap featuring a $10 million presale limit and secure liquidity measures. Investors are drawn to Panshibi’s strategy of prioritizing stability with measures such as a 10-year liquidity lock, reducing the risk of early sell-offs. This foresight positions Panshibi as an attractive long-term prospect amidst shifting investor sentiments in other markets. Solana's Renewed Demand Driven by ETF Speculation Solana has faced volatility but shows signs of resurgence as speculation about a potential ETF approval reignites interest. The blockchain's competitive advantages, such as lower transaction fees and higher speed, have positioned it favorably among users and developers. Currently trading at $190.97, Solana is closely watched by analysts for any movement towards the $231 pivot, marking a significant bullish trend if achieved. Its technical indicators, like the MACD crossover, support a positive outlook. Cardano's Slow Progress Challenges Investor Confidence Despite earning respect for its research-driven approach, Cardano (ADA) is experiencing a lag that has some investors considering other options. Market data reflects this, with notable drops in trading volume and valuation, leading some traders to explore quicker growth opportunities. Predictions of a potential price rally to $0.9385 by mid-March offer a glimmer of hope, yet the sentiment remains cautious as traders assess the viability of historical patterns repeating. Last Call for Panshibi's Presale Before Market Listing With a current price of $0.005, SHIBI presents an alluring opportunity before its anticipated market debut. As interest grows, early investors keen on maximizing gains are taking note of the closing window.

In a new petition on CoWorker.org, JPMorgan Chase workers say CEO Jamie Dimon should reconsider the bank’s return-to-office (RTO) policy, and that the idea of remote work equating low performance has been thoroughly debunked. The workers say they are “concerned about the future of our workplace – its integrity, employee satisfaction, and the increasing toxicity that has metastasized in our company culture in the last couple of months.” The petition, which now has 1,595 of its 2,000 signature goal, says that a hybrid model that combines in-office with remote work is better for the employees, customers, shareholders and the “global community.” “The recent mandate for 100% in-office work is a great leap backward: It hurts employees, customers, shareholders, and the firm’s reputation. From a corporate-citizenship perspective, it worsens traffic and pollution while disproportionately pushing out women, caregivers, senior employees, and individuals with disabilities. Many of these are top performers, and many of them only able to join the workforce under hybrid work rules. This directly contradicts JPMC’s commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Remote work may not suit in-person services, but it’s the way of the future for all knowledge work. Indeed, it’s often the only way to get anything done, even from the office!” JPMorgan informed employees on January 10th that they would need to appear in person at the office five days a week after years of using a hybrid model stemming from the complexities of Covid-19. In leaked audio obtained by The Hill , Dimon slammed remote working, even only on Fridays. “It simply doesn’t work… And it doesn’t work for creativity. It slows down decision-making… And don’t give me the s*** that ‘work from home Friday’ works. I call a lot of people on Friday. There’s not a goddamn person to get a hold of… You don’t have to work at JP Morgan. So, the people of you who don’t want to work at the company, that’s fine with me… I’m not mad at you. Don’t be mad at me.” It’s a free country. You can walk on your feet. But this company is going to set our own standards and do it our own way.

Top Crypto Analyst Believe This New Meme Token On Presale Is Set To Rally In 2 Weeks,https://timestabloid.com/can-shib-reach-0-00005-with-uae-partnership-top-crypto/,"UAE partnership buzz has fueled speculation of Shiba Inu (SHIB) reaching $0.00005, but a new meme token is quietly gaining ground. In its presale stage, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is attracting attention with a stage-based pricing structure that rewards early investors. Meanwhile, growing interest in AI coins, known for reshaping traditional industries with advanced technology, is influencing the crypto market. With a top analyst predicting a rally within two weeks, the presale race is heating up amongst crypto users. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Battles Downtrend As UAE Partnership Gains Attention Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently formed a UAE partnership with the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MoEI), sparking speculation about its potential to reach $0.00005. This UAE partnership aims to bring blockchain technology into public sector services, boosting Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) credibility. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at approximately $0.00001655 , requiring an appreciation of over 200% to achieve $0.00005. Despite a downward trend in Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price, whales are still buying up the token, with one transaction involving over $20 million worth of SHIB moving to self-custody. Analysts believe this UAE partnership could be a game-changer, but the outcome will depend on market conditions and investor sentiment. As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to build on its UAE partnership, the crypto world is watching closely to see if it can hit the $0.00005 milestone. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Poised For Rally Amid AI Agent Boom The rapidly growing AI agent cryptocurrency sector, now valued at over $6 billion , is transforming the digital landscape. Amid this buzz, FloppyPepe (FPPE), a new meme token inspired by Matt Furie’s Pepe the Frog, is gaining momentum. With its playful charm, unique ecosystem, and presale discounted price of $0.0000002 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) is catching investors’ eyes beating the Shiba Inu prediction after the UAE partnership. A key highlight is the Meme-o-Matic , an AI agent enabling decentralized meme creation through user-submitted text prompts, videos, and images. Complementing this is FloppyX , an intelligent video AI bot framework that generates videos using text-based interactions. FloppyX offers real-time reactions, character depth, sentiment analysis, and more, creating a dynamic user experience. With its beta AI agent launching within two weeks, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to make waves in the meme coin and AI agent sectors. Adding to its appeal, this new meme token is collaborating with a leading artist to release regular hand-drawn pieces of FloppyPepe (FPPE) art, blending digital advancement with traditional creativity. To build investor confidence as a promising new meme token, FloppyPepe (FPPE), completed a smart contract audit by SolidProof, verifying its high standards for safety and transparency in its ongoing presale. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Gains Traction With Loyal Community Support Taking a community-driven approach to growth, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is rapidly building vibrant communities on Telegram and X, reflecting its rising popularity. Its private sale, which sold out in less than 24 hours, has added to the buzz surrounding its ongoing presale. A top crypto analyst believes this new meme token is set to rise in 2 weeks, challenging the momentum of Shiba Inu (SHIB), which is predicted to rally following the UAE partnership. FloppyPepe (FPPE), currently in its ongoing presale, is gaining attention from investors and top crypto analysts. Even popular crypto YouTuber NASS CRYPTO has highlighted FloppyPepe (FPPE) as an AI gem with significant growth potential. Sharing this insight with over 1 million subscribers, NASS CRYPTO hinted that this new meme token could be on the verge of massive gains. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) deflationary tokenomics are crafted to support long-term value. With 1% of every FloppyPepe (FPPE) transaction burned to increase scarcity and redistribution rewards encouraging holders, the token is structured to maintain profitability and stability. As demand grows and supply decreases, this new meme token value is set to rise, positioning early adopters and loyal community members for potential gains. Consider joining the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale at the current low price of $0.0000002 attracts potential gains when the price goes up.

Now, traders are looking at Cutoshi, a next-gen utility memecoin, as a potential candidate. Could Dogecoin Break $1? Memecoin king Dogecoin (DOGE) has come a long way since it started as a joke crypto. In 2021, the coin went from $0.01 and reached its all-time high at $0.73 in just a few months. This is an astounding 7200% increase in just a few months, which saw Doge reach a market cap of $85 billion. After a spectacular rise in 2021, it still has a strong community. Many of them believe that Doge still has the potential for massive gains. Most recently, analysts have revealed a major potential upside in the charts. Namely, Dogecoin had retested the $0.382 Fibonacci level, setting it up for a major rally. Analysts believe that the token could reach $0.618 in the following weeks, and even reach its new ATH of $1.272 . Source: The Crypto Basic The reason for these strong technicals is likely the excitement around Doge. Notably, Elon Musk now heads an unofficial department in the US government, which he calls DOGE. This department is in charge of holding government officials accountable. With Musk gaining more publicity than ever, Dogecoin traders hope that this biggest promoter of Dogecoin will help boost the token. This seems to be working, as the token has recently gained institutional recognition. Notably, investment firm Grayscale launched its own Grayscale Dogecoin Trust . This investment product will enable major institutions to gain exposure to Dogecoin, boosting its price. Just a few years ago, it was unthinkable that major financial players would invest in a joke crypto. However, with Musk in the pro-crypto Trump administration, it is not impossible. Still, due to its large market cap, Dogecoin is unlikely to see gains like in the early days. Can Cutoshi Replicate Dogecoin’s Success? While Dogecoin’s biggest gains are likely behind it, a new memecoin is emerging that may replicate its success. MemeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO) recently made news for significant acceleration in its presale. This new token already secured over $1.7 million in funding and is racing toward trading on the open market. On Thursday, February 13, Cutoshi developers announced that the development of its DEX and wallet is going faster than expected. For that reason, they cut the remaining six stages of the presale to just two. For traders, this was a good sign, as it shows that the team is confident about its success. The team is building a DeFi platform, with a memecoin twist to it. Cutoshi is both a memecoinand a utility token. Notably, it powers a decentralized ecosystem that allows users to trade without restrictions. What is more, Cutoshi is committed to decentralization and enables self-custody for its users. This roadmap, as well as early successes, have attracted significant investor interest. For this reason, some even believe that Cutoshi could replicate Dogecoin's early success.

Nonetheless, as Dogecoin encounters rising competition and regulatory oversight, a newcomer is emerging that investors think might outpace it. Remittix , which altcoin investors refer to as the next XRP, is emerging as a transformative player in blockchain payments, distinguished by its practical use and increasing acceptance, unlike conventional meme-based assets. Dogecoin faces challenges on its path to $1 While Dogecoin continues to be a significant token in the cryptocurrency landscape, its path to $1 has encountered obstacles, even with the recent recognition of Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF application by the SEC. This action may offer Dogecoin significant financial visibility, possibly increasing demand. Nonetheless, despite increasing institutional support, Dogecoin's price recently fell to $0.26, illustrating persistent market fluctuations. Per X platform, an analyst called Ali stated that DOGE “has pulled back from the 0.618 Fib level, also known as the Golden Ratio”, which often indicates that a bullish reversal will occur. In contrast to developing blockchain assets that emphasize practical financial uses, Dogecoin has an inadequate payment system. Altcoin Investors Are Calling The Next XRP: Remittix’s rise to dominance As Dogecoin finds it difficult to surpass the $1 mark, Remittix is rapidly gaining traction as the upcoming major player in blockchain finance. Investors are viewing Remittix as the next XRP because of its quick crypto-to-fiat transfers, minimal fees, and smooth connection with worldwide banking systems. Remittix is offering a complete ecosystem for payments and remittances. The capacity to transform cryptocurrency into traditional currency and deposit it straight into bank accounts is revolutionary, addressing one of the major obstacles in blockchain finance. Consequently, both institutional and retail investors are considering Remittix as a leading investment option. Dogecoin vs. Remittix: Which will hit $1 first? The discussion persists on whether Dogecoin or Remittix will be the first to exceed the $1 mark. Dogecoin boasts a rich history and a robust community, yet it falls short in real-world adoption compared to Remittix , which is a financial giant. Investors looking for sustained growth and viable blockchain uses are betting on Remittix to surpass Dogecoin in terms of both price gains and user adoption. In contrast to Dogecoin's speculative characteristics, Remittix's banking connections, smooth fiat transactions, and prospects for widespread adoption position it as the perfect blockchain-based financial solution. As an increasing number of companies utilize Remittix for daily payments and international transactions, its value proposition grows even more compelling. Why Remittix’s presale and giveaway are accelerating its growth A major factor contributing to Remittix’s swift ascent is its effective presale, which has attracted considerable interest from initial investors. Having raised more than $12 million, it is becoming one of the most in-demand blockchain endeavors of 2025. In contrast to meme coins that rely on hype from the community, the presale success of Remittix is grounded in concrete financial solutions, making it a much more dependable investment. Moreover, Remittix's current giveaway is enhancing adoption even more, bringing in thousands of new users who see its practical payment functions. By encouraging new users to navigate its ecosystem, Remittix is promoting ongoing market expansion. Dogecoin’s Meme Appeal vs. Remittix’s Real-World Utility Although Dogecoin is cherished by many, its absence of an operational payment system places it at a disadvantage in an ever-changing cryptocurrency landscape. Remittix, conversely, is transforming the functioning of blockchain finance, providing an efficient method for people and companies to send money globally. Remittix’s advanced financial framework, widespread acceptance, and practical usability position it as the better option for investors aiming for enduring stability and expansion.

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 126,300 followers on the social media platform X that XRP appears to be on the verge of a breakout as it forms a cup-and-handle pattern. The structure suggests that an asset is bullish as buyers step in to prevent prices from revisiting recent lows. Says Martinez, “If XRP is following a cup and handle pattern, a breakout could set the stage for a move toward $3.35!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that XRP will trigger a breakout after breaching the pattern’s resistance at $2.80. At time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.74. Turning to the layer-1 protocol Avalanche ( AVAX ), Martinez says the altcoin will likely see a rise in demand once it falls to the lower boundary of a wide trading range. “The key support level for Avalanche AVAX stands at $20!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that AVAX is trading between a range high of $56 and a range low of $20. At time of writing, AVAX is worth $24.95. Looking at top memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the trader believes the altcoin is carving a local bottom at a key Fibonacci retracement level. Traders use the Fibonacci tool to spot potential entry and exit points based on the Fibonacci ratio. “Dogecoin DOGE has pulled back to the 0.618 Fib level, also known as the Golden Ratio. This is a key area where bullish reversals often occur!” Source: Ali Martinez/X According to the trader’s chart, he suggests that DOGE needs to hold $0.25 to have a shot at reversing its downtrend. At time of writing, DOGE is worth $0.266. As for fellow memecoin Pepe ( PEPE ), the analyst warns that the altcoin needs to hold its diagonal support to avoid witnessing a deep corrective move. “This is a crucial level for PEPE. If it holds above $0.0000092, a rebound could follow. But a break below may open the door for a move toward $0.0000032.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, PEPE is trading for $0.00000978.

From DeFi offering unrestricted banking services to NFTs that redefine ownership of digital assets, real breakthroughs are happening far from the usual noise and speculation. These aren’t mere ideas; they’re practical, investable ventures that are making waves right now. We’re diving into four of the best crypto coins that are not just awaiting approval but are actively expanding and carving out significant market presence. 1. Web3Bay: Fairness in Online Shopping Redefined Forget everything you know about online shopping. Traditional platforms dominate with high fees, algorithm manipulation, and invasive data practices. Enter Web3Bay (3BAY), which flips the script with a decentralized marketplace where transparency and freedom rule the day. Sellers get to keep a bigger slice of the pie with reduced fees, while buyers gain 3BAY tokens, not just from purchases but also through active participation and engagement. Web3Bay runs on community-led governance, unlike the top-down control seen in traditional retail, empowering users with real decision-making power. The buzz is real: $1.4 million has already been funneled into Web3Bay’s presale, with over 350 million 3BAY tokens snapped up across three sold-out stages. The fourth stage is flying off the shelves at just $0.004562625 per token, with early investors eyeing a jaw-dropping 6,430% ROI by launch. As conventional e-commerce tightens its grip, Web3Bay stands out as a rare gem that hands power and profits back to the user. Will you seize the moment with one of the best crypto coins before it hits the mainstream? 2. Helium: Take Control of Your Wi-Fi Tired of being at the mercy of traditional internet giants? Helium challenges this norm by empowering you to build your own decentralized wireless network. Say goodbye to big telecom and hello to personal hotspots, rewarding you with HNT tokens for expanding IoT coverage for devices like smart meters and GPS trackers. This straightforward swap of resources for rewards could revolutionize smart cities and industries relying on IoT. With HNT currently trading at $4.33, its growth is steady, signaling a simmering potential ready to explode. 3. Gala: Actual Ownership of Your Gaming Loot Gamers pour billions into virtual goods without true ownership—Gala Games is changing the game by using blockchain to ensure you really own your digital assets. From weaponry to virtual real estate, Gala enables gamers to trade, sell, or hold onto their assets across various games. With GALA token trading at $0.03108 and a bustling $119.5 million in daily transactions, the platform is more than just active—it’s a thriving digital ecosystem. 4. Bittensor: AI Liberation from Corporate Clutches AI development is currently a playground for the big tech elite. Bittensor disrupts this by democratizing AI, opening up the field to a broader spectrum of developers and researchers through a decentralized, open-source network that also rewards contributions. TAO tokens incentivize the community to refine and advance AI models. Bittensor is not just one of today’s best crypto coins for its ideals but also poses a challenge: Can it rival the efficiency of AI giants like Google and OpenAI with its decentralized model? That’s the billion-dollar question. Choosing Today’s Best Crypto Coins The blockchain space is bursting with innovation, but it’s the real-world applications that distinguish the best crypto coins from the fleeting trends. Helium is proving that decentralized networks can take on telecom titans. Bittensor is on a mission to make AI universally accessible, while Gala asserts the rights of gamers to own their digital treasures truly. Each initiative is not just making a statement—they’re gaining substantial traction. With $1.4 million already raised and over 350 million tokens distributed, Web3Bay exemplifies that decentralized commerce is not just viable—it’s vibrant and growing. These opportunities are fleeting; those who act swiftly are the ones who stand to gain the most.

Ripple (XRP) Tumbles 6% in 3-Days as Traders Take Profits on ETF Hype Ripple (XRP) price came under noticeable selling pressure over the weekend, as investors capitalized on the recent buzz surrounding a potential XRP spot ETF to lock in profits. The week began on a high note, with XRP surging by 22% between Feb. 10 and Feb. 14. Much of this upside momentum stemmed from renewed optimism that the US SEC’s acknowledgment of the Grayscale’s Dogecoin and XRP spot ETF filings could lead to an influx of institutional demand. However, the gains were short-lived. Hours after the official confirmation surfaced, XRP’s price retraced sharply, reflecting a classic “sell-the-news” scenario often observed in cryptocurrency markets. Ripple (XRP) Price Action The Ripple price action chart above highlights how quickly market sentiment can shift when major announcements fail to deliver immediate follow-through. Having reached a peak of $2.80 on Friday, XRP shed roughly 7% to trade at $2.60 by Monday morning. This rapid reversal indicates that, despite the bullish catalyst of the SEC acknowledgment, many short-term traders deemed the move overextended and chose to exit their positions. A look at the chart reveals three consecutive losing sessions since the ETF acknowledgment. This pullback underscores the delicate balance between bullish optimism over potential regulatory breakthroughs and the reality of profit-taking by short-term traders. As is often the case in crypto markets, a single catalyst can spark both surges and sell-offs in quick succession, leaving the long-term direction in question. Still, XRP’s ability to remain above the $2.60–$2.65 support zone has provided a degree of optimism. While the market has witnessed a steady outflow of speculative capital, the robust bid at these price levels suggests that buyers remain prepared to defend XRP against further declines. Whether this support will hold if the broader market sentiment sours remains to be seen, but for now, it has acted as a buffer against a steeper correction. The price reversal in recent days may also reflect a typical pattern in cryptocurrency trading, where investors buy the rumor (or hype) and sell the news. Once the acknowledgment of the ETF filing was made public, many short-term speculators who had been anticipating a more substantial surge found an opportunity to take profits. As a result, the market is now in a consolidation phase, with XRP looking to establish a new equilibrium before the next major move. Speculative Demand Plunges into Negative Values as Markets Await Next Bullish Catalyst Even as XRP has lost 7% of its value since the SEC acknowledged the XRP spot ETF, the derivatives market offers a deeper glimpse into the evolving sentiment. Data from CryptoQuant ’s Taker Buy/Sell ratio reveals that bearish momentum could persist unless a fresh catalyst materializes. This ratio measures whether the most recently executed trades were initiated by buyers or sellers, providing real-time insight into the market’s appetite for risk. According to the chart below, XRP’s Taker Buy/Sell ratio dropped into negative territory at 0.93 on Feb. 17, an 8% decline from the 1.02 reading recorded on Feb. 13. A negative Taker Buy/Sell ratio implies that sellers are more aggressive than buyers, often indicating waning speculative demand. Ripple (XRP) Take Buy/Sell Ratio | Source: CryptoQuant In other words, instead of stepping in to buy the dip, traders appear to be positioning for further downside or closing out existing positions in anticipation of more significant volatility ahead. Such a drop in speculative demand can be concerning for a market reliant on momentum-driven inflows. Historically, when Taker Buy/Sell ratios fall below 1.0 for an extended period, it suggests that the path of least resistance may be to the downside. This is particularly relevant now, given XRP’s proximity to the $2.60 support level. If that level fails, the psychological $2.50 mark could be tested next, potentially triggering a wave of sell orders from traders seeking to minimize losses. Still, the situation is not entirely bearish. A quick recovery in the Taker Buy/Sell ratio—coupled with a renewed wave of buying interest—could reignite upward momentum, especially if broader market sentiment turns positive or additional regulatory progress unfolds. Until then, XRP appears to be in a wait-and-see phase, with its near-term fate hinging on whether buyers can outmatch the current wave of speculative selling. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Struggle to Hold Key Support at $2.59 Amid Weak Momentum Ripple’s XRP trades at $2.639, down 0.79% on the day, as price action battles to maintain footing above the 50-day EMA at $2.5889. The coin remains trapped between the 50-day EMA and the 200-day EMA at $1.7337, forming a precarious range where a decisive break could determine the next trend. XRP Price Forecast A short-term bullish setup emerged with a 21.95% gain in five days, but sellers quickly erased momentum, leading to a 6.87% retracement in three days with high selling volume. The 100-day EMA at $2.2536 is a crucial support level; a breakdown below could see XRP testing the 200-day EMA at $1.7337. However, a strong recovery above $2.6453, the 20-day EMA, could re-ignite bullish sentiment. Volume bars reveal declining bullish activity, reinforcing concerns about a sustained rally. If bulls fail to reclaim $2.65, XRP risks slipping toward $2.25. A breakout above $2.65, however, could see renewed strength toward $3.00. Until a definitive move occurs, traders remain cautious.

BTC-S&P 500 Correlation Hits Zero,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-independent-btc-sp-500-correlation-zero/,"Data shows the Correlation between Bitcoin and S&P 500 has declined to zero recently, a sign that BTC is no longer attached to the stock market. Bitcoin Correlation To S&P 500 Has Witnessed A Plunge Recently In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed about the trend in the Correlation between Bitcoin and S&P 500. The “Correlation” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of how tied together the prices of any two given assets are. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Investors Sitting On 54% Profit Despite Price Plunge When the value of this metric is positive, it means the price of one of the assets is reacting to movements in the other by traveling in the same direction. The closer is the indicator to 1, the stronger is this relationship. On the other hand, the metric being under the zero mark implies that while there is also some correlation present between the assets in this case, it’s a negative one. This suggests that the charts are moving in the opposite direction to each other. For this zone, the extreme point is -1, corresponding to the tightest relationship. Now, here is the chart for the Correlation shared by the analytics firm, which shows the trend in the metric’s value for Bitcoin and S&P 500 over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Correlation between Bitcoin and S&P 500 rose close to the 1 mark during January, which means the prices of the two were showing a strong positive relationship. Since peaking at the start of this month, though, the indicator has observed a sharp downward trajectory, and its value has today come down to exactly zero. Such a value implies there is no correlation whatsoever present between the assets. In statistics, the variables are said to be independent in this scenario. The Correlation can be a useful indicator to watch for when an investor wants to diversify their holdings. Assets that have a close relationship may not be worth investing in at the same time, but ones that have a low value of the metric can make for smart diversification options. As it is currently, the S&P 500 could provide something different to Bitcoin investors and vice versa. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Volume Close To Growing Again: Bullish Sign? “The last time we saw such a low correlation was on November 5th, 2024, just before Bitcoin soared past the 100k mark,” notes IntoTheBlock. With BTC free from the stock market once more, it’s possible that the cryptocurrency could show a big move this time as well. It only remains to be seen, however, how long the coin can stay away from the influence of traditional assets. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued its recent trend of consolidation during the last few days as its price is still locked around the $96,000 level.

This represents an increase of over $220,000 in just a few months. JPMorgan expands crypto ETF portfolio with major investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum funds The bank disclosed in its most recent 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it has greatly expanded its exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The bank has invested $984,000 in Bitcoin ETFs and $32,300 in Ethereum ETFs through various products. Among its Bitcoin ETF investments, JPMorgan has made a $523,000 investment in the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO), a $290,000 investment in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), a $68,000 investment in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), a $55,000 investment in the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), and a $37,000 investment in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). The bank places its bets on Ethereum spot ETFs, which include investments in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), which amounts to $23,800, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), worth $6,200, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), valued at $2,100, and a small amount of $102 in the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH). JPMorgan joins Goldman Sachs in increasing Bitcoin ETF holdings JPMorgan Chase’s choice to expand its ETF portfolio is in sync with other financial institutions, such as Goldman Sachs, that are also stepping up their stake in Bitcoin ETFs. According to Goldman Sachs’ latest SEC filing, the bank now holds $1.27 billion in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), representing 24,077,861 shares. Goldman Sachs also disclosed a $288 million stake in Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), holding 3,530,486 shares. Goldman Sachs’ Bitcoin ETF holdings have increased dramatically, with an 88% rise in IBIT shares and a 105% rise in its FBTC position in the last quarter. However, the growth in institutional investment has not affected digital asset funds, which have recorded their first significant withdrawal in 2025. Investors removed $415 million from crypto funds last week, with most of the outflows coming from Bitcoin-based products, such as spot ETFs, which saw net withdrawals of $430 million. According to CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s cautious stance on interest rate cuts triggered the sell-off. “ The U.S. central bank need not be in a hurry to cut rates ,” Powell said, reinforcing investor concerns that looser monetary policy may take longer than expected. These short-term issues do not alter JPMorgan’s deliberate choice to expand its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF portfolio as it continues to follow institutional investment trends.

The proposal by investment firm Strategic Capital cited issues such as CEO pay, financial performance, and transparency. Strategic Capital, which has a 5.4% stake in Gunho, said GungHo has failed to launch a new game of similar success to Puzzle & Dragons since 2012 and squandered 100 billion yen ($640 million) on new games. A key concern raised was that CEO Kazuki Morishita’s salary increased from 120 million yen to 340 million yen ($2.2 million) in the last ten years, while the operating profits decreased by 69%. The report also pointed out that Morishita earns nearly the same pay as Nintendo’s CEO despite the tremendous disparity between the two companies’ sizes. Strategic Capital proposed seven changes, the first of which was a remuneration review of GungHo with an emphasis on executives. GungHo’s response and rationale In response to all of the proposals by Strategic Capital, the Board of Directors of GungHo voted against them in a unanimous manner. The company justified Morishita’s high compensation package asserting that he has been GungHo’s CEO for more than two decades. They specifically noted that he was responsible for the development of Ragnarok Online as well as the popularity of Puzzle & Dragons for over a decade. GungHo also dismissed the notion that it cannot create another hit game, saying that the mobile gaming market is very saturated. They added that this makes it nearly impossible for a company to produce a game like Puzzle & Dragons again. The mobile gaming industry has advanced quite strongly since the time Puzzle & Dragons set a precedent for the gacha mechanics. However, the game was not unique of its kind. Dragon Collection , first launched in 2010 as a card-battle game on the GREE platform, is generally considered the first mobile Japanese game to feature gacha. On remuneration, GungHo claimed that it complied with rules and regulations by adopting a completely transparent remuneration policy. The company further noted that the inclusions made by shareholders in their demand for extra disclosure were irrelevant. Despite rejecting the proposals, GungHo has since made changes in its shareholder return policy. It changed the policy regarding dividends and share repurchases to focus on an active return to its shareholders. Also, the company enhanced its remuneration policy by including independent outside directors in the committee responsible for setting executives’ pay. On the same day, GungHo released its financial statements for the fiscal year 2024, in which all the key performance indicators had declined.

While Solana and Dogecoin remain top players in the market, their large market caps limit growth. As such, investors are always on the lookout for ‘the next Dogecoin or Solana.’ An analysis by DeepSeek AI, points to a new token priced at just $0.01. When asked to pick one under $1 cryptocurrency that could outperform Solana and Dogecoin in 2025, its answer was Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a player many have yet to discover. Unlike meme-driven Dogecoin or the high-performance but saturated Solana ecosystem, Mutuum Finance is a rising force in decentralized finance (DeFi). Offering an innovative lending and borrowing protocol, it aims to revolutionize how users interact with crypto liquidity, giving everyday investors access to secure, overcollateralized loans while generating passive income through lending pools. Currently, MUTM is in its first phase of the presale at $0.01, a low entry price that makes it an attractive bet for early investors. Over 50% of Phase 1 tokens have already been sold, and the presale has now surpassed 1,000 holders. This is the only opportunity to buy MUTM at $0.01, as Phase 2 will bring a price increase to $0.015, pushing it closer to its confirmed launch price of $0.06, a 600% gain for early investors. In contrast, Solana is trading at $195, making a 10x return significantly harder to achieve. Dogecoin, despite its cult-like following, remains heavily reliant on hype rather than real-world adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Gaining Momentum in DeFi Mutuum Finance is performing well in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market by transforming the lending and borrowing sector. By eliminating middlemen, the platform enables lenders to earn passive income while giving borrowers access to secure, overcollateralized loans. Mutuum Finance offers two lending approaches, enhancing user flexibility: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Features dynamic interest rates to optimize returns. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Allows direct lending, reducing dependence on liquidity pools and giving users greater control over their assets. Mutuum Finance implements a robust token buyback strategy, using platform profits to sustain demand for MUTM and drive long-term value growth. Borrowers benefit from competitive interest rates, instant liquidity, and upcoming multi-chain support, creating a scalable and rewarding ecosystem. Presale with High Growth Potential The ongoing MUTM presale has attracted strong investor interest, with 45.5% of the 4 billion token supply allocated to early buyers for post-launch liquidity. Currently priced at $0.01 in the first presale phase, the token is set to reach $0.06 upon launch, a confirmed 600% gain. Analysts foresee potential growth to $1 as exchange listings roll out. Over $640,000 has already been raised from more than 1,000 investors, with Phase 1 surpassing the halfway mark as demand surges. Mutuum Finance is committed to continuous innovation, with future developments including: Advanced analytics and enhanced smart contracts Strengthened security measures Multi-chain integration Staking rewards and ecosystem expansion These enhancements position MUTM for sustainable growth, making now an opportune moment for early investors to secure tokens before further price increases. To drive adoption, Mutuum Finance is launching a $100,000 giveaway, awarding 10 lucky winners $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. Additionally, the referral program rewards users with bonus tokens for successful invites, fostering community engagement and long-term loyalty. Mutuum Finance is set to disrupt DeFi with real utility, strong tokenomics, and high-growth potential. Over 50% of Phase 1 is sold, and 1,000+ holders have already joined. This is the last chance to buy MUTM at $0.01 before the price increases.

The current market sentiment appears bearish, with major assets experiencing notable declines. SOL has also broken below its crucial support level of $180. Solana (SOL) Price Action and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, SOL has been gaining support from this crucial level since November 2024 and has tested it multiple times. Source: Trading View However, this time, as the asset fails to sustain, it loses this key level and closes a daily candle below $180, partially confirming a bearish move ahead. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, there is a strong possibility that SOL could witness a 15% price drop, reaching the $155 level in the coming days. $115 Million Worth SOL Outflow Following this notable breakdown, investors and long-term holders have been accumulating SOL tokens, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow and outflow reveal that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $115 million worth of the asset, indicating potential accumulation. Source: Coinglass In this bearish market trend, such outflows can create buying pressure and potentially lead to a price rebound. However, intraday traders appear to be following long-term holders, as they seem to be betting on the long side. $45 Million Worth Long Bet Data shows that traders holding long positions are strongly dominating the asset and are over-leveraged at $174.3, with $45 million worth of long positions. With such significant open positions, this level acts as a crucial support. Conversely, $180 is another key level where traders holding short positions are over-leveraged, with $15.50 million worth of short positions. This suggests that short sellers are exhausted, which could help bulls reclaim the lost support level. Source: Coinglass Current Price Momentum SOL is currently trading near $177 and has experienced a 6% price drop in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume surged by 110%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors amid the price decline.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-18 02:00:08

Is This the Future of E-Commerce?,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bays-1-4m-presale-proves-investors-love-blockchain-shopping-is-this-the-future-of-e-commerce/,"Online shopping has long been dominated by centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay, where high transaction fees and restrictive policies limit seller profits and increase costs for buyers. Web3Bay aims to disrupt this industry by leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace. Unlike traditional platforms, Web3Bay eliminates intermediaries, allowing buyers and sellers to transact directly. This approach significantly reduces transaction fees, which can range from 10% to 15% on centralized marketplaces, giving sellers a better profit margin and buyers lower prices. Additionally, all transactions are secured and verified through smart contracts, ensuring fraud prevention and transparency without relying on third parties. Web3Bay Presale Success and Market Potential Web3Bay’s 3BAY token presale has gained strong momentum, reflecting investor confidence in decentralized e-commerce. As of February 14, 2025, the presale has raised over $1.4 million, selling nearly 340 million tokens across four stages. Currently priced at $0.004562625, the token’s value is set to increase progressively across 28 stages, reaching an estimated launch price of $0.1959. The structured price increases reward early backers, potentially offering a 6000% ROI post-launch. Web3Bay’s success aligns with the broader market shift towards blockchain-based solutions in finance, gaming, and now e-commerce. Investors view the platform as a viable alternative to centralized giants, with its low-cost transactions, decentralized governance, and direct user control driving adoption. Challenges and Future Prospects for Decentralized Shopping While Web3Bay’s fee-free model and decentralized governance are appealing, it faces challenges in user acquisition, merchant adoption, and competition with established platforms. Success will depend on the platform’s ability to provide a seamless shopping experience, integrate with existing crypto payment networks, and onboard sellers at scale. However, the growing dissatisfaction with centralized platforms and increasing demand for fairer, blockchain-powered marketplaces suggest a strong future for Web3Bay. If the platform delivers on its promises, it could position itself as a major competitor to Amazon and eBay, redefining online shopping through blockchain technology.

Base, ZKsync Era, and Arbitrum One are the chains taking the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place after Ethereum, having accumulated $39.53 million, $37.69 million, and $34.60 million in DeFi fees, respectively. The data also indicated that Ethereum Layer 1 is still leading in weekly DeFi fees, accumulating a little over $1 million. Base and Arbitrum One are the 2nd and 3rd chains in weekly fees, accumulating over $179,000 and $22,000, respectively. The Ethereum on-chain data platform highlighted the massive gap between Ethereum and other chains in terms of fees. The chain is still significantly lower from its daily DeFi fee highs recorded in May 2023 and March 2024. Ethereum has recorded a little over $170,000 in daily DeFi fees as of February 15, lower than its highs of over $11 million in May 2023. Growthepie also highlighted that the other chains are also down significantly, with most posting zero daily fees while some managed only a few thousand dollars in fees. The data further revealed that Ethereum CeFi transaction fees are significantly lower than DeFi fees, with all-time CeFi fees standing at a little over $635 million. Weekly CeFi transaction fees on Ethereum Layer 1 are still higher than DeFi weekly fees on the chain, standing at a little over $1.9 million as of February 15. The DeFi transaction count on Ethereum Layer 1 is notably lower than Base, ZKsync Era, and Arbitrum One, standing at a little over 149 million all-time transactions. Base has recorded over 352 million all-time DeFi transactions, while ZKsync Era and Arbitrum One have recorded over 150 million and 155 million transactions, respectively. Vitalik Buterin advocates for Ethereum Layer 1 dominance in DeFi Reasons to have higher L1 gas limits even in an L2-heavy Ethereum https://t.co/BMFhzoO8bE — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 14, 2025 The Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently released a proposal suggesting the scaling of Ethereum Layer 1 10 times more amid the slowing activity on the base layer. Buterin explained the need for more scaling to support over 120 million Ethereum users weekly. The Ethereum co-founder added that the scaling would lower Ethereum’s gas fees, improve the network’s security, and introduce rollups support. Buterin also expressed concern about potential censorship on Layer 2s, especially when the chains are congested. The blockchain’s co-founder explained that centralized sequencers worsened L2 censorship. The scaling proposal suggested force-inclusion mechanisms that would allow users to shift to the base layer and complete transactions in case of censorship. Buterin confirmed that the mechanism would also allow massive exit events without crippling gas fees. The proposal also suggested a continued increase in Ethereum’s base layer gas limits. Buterin pointed out the recent increase in gas limits from 30 million to 36 million. The Ethereum co-founder still pointed out the issues that might come in the long term, including the difficulty in reducing the gas limit compared to increasing the limit. Ethereum Layer 2 facing scalability issues the clip for you @rajgokal https://t.co/nDPDyfp1kf pic.twitter.com/j7WKD5TOmM — Good Game (@goodgamepodxyz) February 9, 2025 Buterin’s suggestion to scale up Ethereum Layer 1 comes amid the chain’s Layer 2 struggles, including decreasing gas fees and users. On-chain data has revealed that Ethereum Layer 2 gas fees had dropped below 1 Gwei, the lowest it has been in 5 years. The low fees further indicated the dwindling on-chain activity on the chain’s Layer 2s. A recent interview with Alliance DAO’s Qiao Wang on The Good Game podcast revealed that he had lost faith in the capabilities of Ethereum L2s. The Alliance DAO co-founder further highlighted that protocols performed better on other chains than Ethereum. Wang insisted that it would be wiser for developers to build on Solana rather than Ethereum. The Alliance DAO co-founder still mentioned that the blockchain’s scalability remained an issue despite its strong ecosystem. Wang also explained that current users were depending on the chain because ‘they have been in it for too long.’ The DeFi protocol’s executive said that the issues on the blockchain led to him shifting to other options.

As reported by tier10k on X, Milei stated that he only shared information about the token and never encouraged people to invest in it. He downplayed the impact on Argentina, saying that only a handful of local investors — around four or five —were affected. He noted that most of the traders involved were from China and the U.S. Contrary to reports that 44,000 investors were affected, Milei stated that the real number was closer to 5,000, most of whom were experienced traders who understood the risks.

He saw the initiative as something positive and simply helped spread the word. Despite defending his actions, Milei acknowledged the political backlash and the lessons he has learned from the controversy. “I made no mistakes because I acted in good faith. But when I look at the political repercussions, I realize I have something to learn. I need to understand that after becoming president, I continued acting like the same Javier Milei as before. Unfortunately, this situation shows me that I need to raise my filters and not make myself so accessible.” Argentine President Javier Milei LIBRA gained huge attention after Milei mentioned it publicly, which contributed to its rapid price surge from zero to over $4. Its value quickly plummeted to less than 50 cents leading to speculations of market manipulation. Early investors reportedly cashed out over $100 million, leaving later purchases with significant losses. Political tensions have increased in Argentina as a result of the incident, and opposition leaders are calling for Milei to be removed from office for allegedly deceiving the people. The nation’s anti-corruption office is currently conducting a separate inquiry in addition to a legal probe headed by Federal Judge María Servini. The S&P Merval stock index fell by about 5% as a result of the scandal, which also rocked Argentina’s financial markets. Even though Milei insists he did nothing wrong, the debate is still going strong and his administration is coming under more scrutiny.

This impressive climb is primarily attributed to unexpected USD weakness, triggered by disappointing US economic data and a shift in market sentiment regarding future Federal Reserve actions. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors tracking global financial trends, these Forex movements offer valuable insights into broader market dynamics and risk appetite. Let’s dive into the key factors propelling the Aussie Dollar’s ascent and what it means for the currency market. Decoding the Australian Dollar’s Stunning Rise Amidst USD Weakness The Australian Dollar’s (AUD) recent strength is primarily a story of USD weakness. Several factors have converged to weaken the US Dollar, paving the way for the Aussie to shine. Let’s break down the key drivers: US Retail Sales Miss: January’s US Retail Sales figures were shockingly weak, contracting by 0.9% month-over-month, significantly missing the -0.1% forecast. This disappointing data ignited concerns about a potential slowdown in the US economy, prompting investors to reassess their USD holdings. Tariff Delay Relief: US President Trump’s decision to postpone the implementation of reciprocal tariffs offered temporary relief to risk-sensitive currencies like the Australian Dollar. This move eased immediate concerns about escalating global trade tensions, boosting risk appetite and benefiting the AUD. Fed Rate Pause Expectations: The weak Retail Sales data has led to increased speculation that the Federal Reserve might hold off on further interest rate hikes in March. Market participants are now pricing in a higher probability (around 55%) of rates remaining on hold, reducing the appeal of the USD, which typically benefits from higher interest rate expectations. While US Industrial Production showed a modest 0.5% increase in January, slightly beating estimates, the negative Retail Sales data overshadowed this positive figure, reinforcing concerns about the health of the US economy and further contributing to USD weakness . Forex News : Aussie Dollar’s Momentum and Technical Outlook From a technical perspective, the AUD/USD pair is exhibiting bullish momentum. Having gained 0.65% to reach 0.6355, the pair has decisively broken above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a key indicator of short-term trend. Key technical indicators further support this bullish outlook: Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI currently sits at 66, nearing overbought territory but still trending upwards. This indicates strong buying pressure and suggests further potential for upward movement in the AUD/USD pair. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): The MACD histogram is showing increasing green bars, a clear sign of building upside momentum. This reinforces the bullish sentiment and suggests that the upward trend is likely to continue in the near term. However, traders remain vigilant. The market is still sensitive to potential shifts, especially concerning new tariff announcements and any unexpected positive US economic data surprises, which could swiftly reverse the current trend and impact the Currency Market . Australian Dollar vs. RBA Rate Cut Speculation Despite the Aussie’s recent strength, domestic factors are still at play. Speculation about a potential 25-basis-point rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) persists. This speculation is fueled by: Cooling Inflationary Pressure: Domestic inflation in Australia is showing signs of easing, which could prompt the RBA to consider a rate cut to stimulate economic growth. Subdued Consumer Outlook: Concerns about consumer spending and overall economic activity in Australia are adding to the pressure on the RBA to consider easing monetary policy. The interplay between global factors driving USD weakness and domestic pressures on the RBA creates a complex landscape for the AUD/USD pair. While the current momentum favors the Aussie, the potential for an RBA rate cut could limit its upside in the longer term. Navigating the Forex Market : Key Factors for the Australian Dollar Understanding the fundamental drivers of the Australian Dollar is crucial for navigating the Forex market. Several key factors influence the AUD’s value: Factor Impact on AUD RBA Interest Rates Higher rates generally support AUD, lower rates weaken AUD. Iron Ore Prices As Australia’s top export, rising iron ore prices boost AUD, falling prices weaken it. Chinese Economic Health Strong Chinese economy (Australia’s largest trading partner) strengthens AUD, weaker economy weakens it. Trade Balance Positive trade balance (more exports than imports) strengthens AUD, negative balance weakens it. Market Sentiment (Risk-On/Risk-Off) Risk-on sentiment (investors seeking riskier assets) is positive for AUD, risk-off (flight to safety) is negative. By monitoring these factors, traders and investors can gain a better understanding of potential AUD movements and make more informed decisions in the dynamic Currency Market . Conclusion: Aussie Dollar’s Bullish Run Amidst Uncertainty The Australian Dollar’s recent surge to multi-month highs is a compelling example of how global economic factors and market sentiment can swiftly influence Forex movements. Fueled by unexpected USD weakness and temporary relief from trade tensions, the Aussie has capitalized on the opportunity. However, with RBA rate cut speculation looming and ongoing global economic uncertainties, the path ahead for the AUD/USD pair remains subject to shifts. Traders should closely monitor upcoming economic data releases, central bank announcements, and geopolitical developments to navigate this dynamic market effectively.

Bloomberg Analysts Say FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Next In Line For 6,429% Surge",https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-and-dogecoin-doge-losing-steam-bloomberg/,"Top Bloomberg analysts have picked the new FloppyPepe (FPPE) as the better buy ahead of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). The new token combines the perks of being an AI agent with its meme appeal, giving it an edge over other crypto assets in both spaces. With the AI crypto sector gaining traction and the meme ecosystem looking set to recover, FloppyPepe (FPPE) could be the next big crypto asset. Analysts predict a 6,429% surge for FloppyPepe (FPPE), and early presale investors could gain more. Learn more about FloppyPepe (FPPE) in this article. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Combines AI Crypto Features with Meme Appeal There’s a growing interest in the AI crypto sector, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to benefit from this. The new AI crypto project will ride on the technological advancement of the AI crypto space and Matt Furie’s cultural significance in the meme space to build a strong community where creatives can access tools for content creation, get the recognition they deserve, and earn from their creations. FloppyPepe (PEPE) will feature video generation and text-to-image AI agents. These AI agents will enable users to show their creativity by helping creators produce top-quality videos and images that can bring them income and fame. Creators will have access to these AI agents on FloppyPepe’s fast-growing Telegram community , and the text-to-image agent is set to be ready for use in two weeks. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining massive attention in the crypto space. Top YouTube channels like NASS CRYPTO are already telling millions of their subscribers that the meme coin is the next big thing. Bloomberg analysts also believe the AI crypto coin could pump massively soon. FloppyPepe’s (PEPE) deflationary nature makes the Bloomberg analyst’s prediction a strong possibility. With every 1% of the meme coin’s transaction, tokens are burned to induce scarcity. The AI crypto coin also gives redistribution rewards , encouraging long-term token holding. This allows FloppyPepe (FPPE) to remain profitable, stable, and responsive to the power of demand and supply in the market. Hence, it may remain a top-performing meme coin and AI crypto token for long. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Tipped to Rebound If Key Support Holds Firm Crypto analysts have revealed that Shiba Inu (SHIB) has moved above a descending trendline, indicating a growing buy action at its critical support area. This could prevent further Shiba Inu (SHIB) downtrend, helping the meme coin maintain its current price of $0.000016. According to Bloomberg analysts, if it holds its key support area, Shiba Inu (SHIB) could test the resistance around $0.00001950 – $0.00002050. A successful breach of this resistance region will see Shiba Inu (SHIB) rebound. However, if Shiba Inu (SHIB) loses its current support zone, it could drop to a lower support level of around $0.0000140. Dogecoin (DOGE) to Retest $0.30 Resistance Soon Bloomberg analysts have identified Dogecoin’s (DOGE) current price as a critical support level. According to them, the Dogecoin (DOGE) $0.2585 current price is above its VWAP (Volume-weighted Average Price), and it’s a key support area. If Dogecoin (DOGE) happens to break out of this zone, a significant upward trend could emerge, pushing the meme coin towards $0.30 resistance. However, a break below the VWAP could prompt a Dogecoin (DOGE) downward rally, with $0.20 being its next support. Bloomberg analysts say optimism on Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF approval could keep Dogecoin (DOGE) above its VWAP. Conclusion FloppyPepe (PEPE) is not like every meme coin or AI crypto token, which gives it a better profit potential than Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and other AI crypto tokens. The meme coin runs a stage-based pricing presale, implying that early presale investors would gain the most from its potential boom. This has increased interest in its presale. Skeptical investors have become more trusting of FloppyPepe (FPPE) after learning it passed smart contract audits by Solidproof . FloppyPepe (PEPE) looks poised to boom, and smart investors won’t miss out on it. Join the presale now at a low price of $0.0000002.

Today, we’re diving deep into the GBP/JPY currency pair, which is currently at a fascinating juncture. After a recent dip, GBP/JPY is testing a critical support level around 191.00. Is this a temporary pause before a rebound, or are we looking at further declines? Let’s break down the latest GBP/JPY price analysis to understand what’s driving this currency cross and what traders should watch out for. Decoding the GBP/JPY’s Price Action: What’s Happening? The GBP/JPY pair is currently hovering around the 191.00 mark during the European trading session on Monday, continuing a losing streak for the third day in a row. This price point is particularly interesting because it coincides with the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Let’s look at the key factors influencing this: Immediate Support Test: GBP/JPY is testing immediate support at the nine-day EMA, precisely at 191.00. This level is acting as a crucial near-term floor. Bearish Momentum Building: The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped below 50. This is a significant signal, indicating that bearish momentum is gaining strength. Resistance Looms: On the upside, the pair faces immediate resistance at the 14-day EMA, currently positioned at 191.17. Breaking through this resistance is key for any potential bullish reversal. Descending Channel Pattern: A look at the daily chart reveals that GBP/JPY is moving within a descending channel. This pattern generally suggests a prevailing bearish bias in the medium term. Essentially, GBP/JPY is caught in a tug-of-war between short-term support and increasing bearish pressure. The next moves around these EMA levels will be critical in determining the pair’s direction. Technical Analysis Breakdown: EMAs and RSI in Focus For traders relying on technical analysis , several indicators are painting a mixed picture for GBP/JPY. Let’s dissect the key technical signals: Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) Nine-day EMA (around 191.00): Currently acting as immediate support. A hold here could suggest a temporary stabilization. 14-day EMA (around 191.17): Serving as immediate resistance. Overcoming this level is needed to alleviate bearish pressure. Neutral Short-Term Momentum: The fact that GBP/JPY is trading around both the nine-day and 14-day EMAs suggests that short-term price momentum is currently neutral or indecisive. Relative Strength Index (RSI) Below 50 Level: The 14-day RSI falling below 50 is a significant bearish signal. It indicates that selling pressure is outweighing buying pressure, suggesting further potential downside. Descending Channel Bearish Bias: The descending channel pattern on the daily chart reinforces the overall bearish outlook for GBP/JPY. Traders often look for continuation patterns within channels. In summary, while the EMAs suggest short-term neutrality, the RSI and the descending channel pattern lean towards a bearish outlook. Traders should monitor these indicators closely for confirmation of the next directional move. Key Support Levels to Watch: Will 191.00 Hold? Identifying support levels is crucial for understanding potential downside targets and areas where buying interest might emerge. For GBP/JPY, here are the critical support zones: Immediate Support: Nine-day EMA at 191.00: This is the most immediate level currently being tested. A sustained break below this could open the door for further declines. Five-Month Low at 187.05 (February 7th): This recent low acts as a significant support zone. A move below 191.00 could target this level. Descending Channel Lower Boundary (around 186.00): The lower boundary of the descending channel, near the psychological level of 186.00, represents a more significant longer-term support. A break below the 191.00 level could trigger increased selling pressure, potentially leading GBP/JPY towards the 187.05 and then the 186.00 support zones. Traders should be prepared for potential volatility around these levels. Navigating Resistance Levels : Where Could GBP/JPY Rebound? On the flip side, understanding resistance levels is essential for identifying potential upside barriers and areas where selling pressure might strengthen. For GBP/JPY, key resistance levels include: Immediate Resistance: 14-day EMA at 191.17: This is the immediate hurdle for any potential bullish recovery. A break above this could signal weakening bearish momentum. Descending Channel Upper Boundary (around 192.50): The upper boundary of the descending channel represents a more significant resistance level. A successful break above this would be needed to negate the current bearish bias and suggest a potential trend reversal. If GBP/JPY manages to break above the 14-day EMA at 191.17, it could pave the way for a test of the descending channel’s upper boundary around 192.50. Overcoming this channel resistance is crucial for any sustained bullish recovery. British Pound (GBP) Performance in the Broader Forex Market To get a complete picture, it’s important to analyze the British Pound’s performance against other major currencies in the broader forex market . The table below provides a snapshot of the percentage change of GBP against various currencies today: USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD 0.08% -0.04% -0.24% 0.03% -0.18% -0.23% 0.09% EUR -0.08% 0.03% -0.37% 0.05% -0.17% -0.21% 0.12% GBP 0.04% -0.03% -0.29% 0.02% -0.15% -0.24% 0.08% JPY 0.24% 0.37% 0.29% 0.28% 0.10% 0.22% 0.32% CAD -0.03% -0.05% -0.02% -0.28% -0.18% -0.26% 0.07% AUD 0.18% 0.17% 0.15% -0.10% 0.18% -0.04% 0.29% NZD 0.23% 0.21% 0.24% -0.22% 0.26% 0.04% 0.32% CHF -0.09% -0.12% -0.08% -0.32% -0.07% -0.29% -0.32% The heat map above visualizes percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is on the left, and the quote currency is at the top. For instance, selecting British Pound (GBP) from the left and US Dollar from the top shows the percentage change for GBP/USD. As the table indicates, the British Pound was weakest against the Japanese Yen today. This reinforces the bearish sentiment observed in the GBP/JPY pair’s price action. Conclusion: Navigating the GBP/JPY Crossroads GBP/JPY is currently at a critical juncture, testing support around the nine-day EMA at 191.00. The increasing bearish momentum, signaled by the RSI and the descending channel pattern, suggests potential for further downside. However, the pair’s ability to hold above the 191.00 support could lead to a period of consolidation or a potential rebound towards the 14-day EMA resistance at 191.17. Traders should closely monitor price action around these key levels and be prepared for potential volatility as GBP/JPY navigates this crucial phase in the forex market .

40478442,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129603,1739846151,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Defiant Gold Price Holds Strong at $2,900: Tariffs & Safe-Haven Demand",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/defiant-gold-price-tariffs/,"In the volatile world of cryptocurrency and global finance, even traditional safe havens like gold are experiencing significant price swings. Despite a slight uptick in the US Dollar, Gold price is demonstrating remarkable resilience, clinging to gains near the coveted $2,900 mark. What’s fueling this defiance, and can it sustain its upward trajectory? Let’s dive into the factors impacting the precious metal, including Trump’s tariff threats and the ever-influential Federal Reserve. Why is the Gold Price Showing Such Strength? Several factors are contributing to gold’s current robust position. Despite modest USD strength, gold is finding support from persistent concerns surrounding potential global trade wars. Former US President Donald Trump’s protectionist policies, particularly his threats of new tariffs, are injecting uncertainty into the global economic outlook. This uncertainty, in turn, is bolstering gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset. Trump’s Tariff Threats: The specter of increased tariffs imposed by the US, especially on major trading partners like Mexico, China, and Canada, is creating jitters in the market. Investors are wary of the potential for retaliatory tariffs and the disruption to global trade flows, driving them towards safe assets like gold. USD Weakness (Relatively): While the US Dollar has seen a slight recovery, it remains under pressure following weaker-than-expected US Retail Sales data. This lingering USD weakness provides a tailwind for gold, making it relatively cheaper for investors holding other currencies. Geopolitical Tensions: Ongoing geopolitical risks, including the conflict in Ukraine, continue to underpin demand for safe-haven assets. Despite talks between US and Russian officials, escalating military actions in eastern Ukraine are keeping investors on edge. The Role of the Federal Reserve and Interest Rates The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance is always a critical factor influencing both the US Dollar and gold prices. Recently, market expectations regarding Fed interest rate cuts have shifted, further impacting the dynamics. Hawkish Fed Stance: Initially, there was anticipation of aggressive interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve . However, recent economic data and Fed communications suggest a more cautious approach. The market is now increasingly pricing in a potential rate cut in September, rather than earlier in the year. Impact on USD: The perception of a less dovish Federal Reserve has provided some support to the US Dollar. A stronger dollar typically exerts downward pressure on gold prices, as gold is priced in US dollars. However, the impact has been modest, indicating the strength of other supporting factors for gold. Inflation Expectations: Comments from Kevin Hassett, former Director of the US National Economic Council, suggesting that a drop in Treasury yields could signal expectations of lower inflation, are also being factored into market sentiment. Lower inflation expectations can sometimes reduce the appeal of gold as an inflation hedge, but the current focus on safe-haven demand and tariff risks seems to be overriding this. Technical Analysis: Gold Price Outlook From a technical standpoint, Gold price charts suggest continued bullish momentum, although some caution is warranted at current levels. Key Technical Levels for Gold (XAU/USD) Level Type Price Significance Current Price (approx.) $2,900 Round Figure Support Immediate Support $2,885 Near-term Support Swing Low Support $2,855 Stronger Support Level Key Support Zone $2,834 – $2,815 Major Support Area Immediate Resistance $2,925 Horizontal Resistance All-Time High $2,942 – $2,943 Critical Resistance Level The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart has retreated from overbought conditions, providing room for further upside. However, the $2,925 area and the all-time high near $2,942-$2,943 represent significant resistance levels. A decisive break above these levels could signal a powerful continuation of the uptrend. Conversely, failure to overcome these resistances could lead to a period of consolidation or a potential pullback towards support levels in the $2,885-$2,855 range. Tariffs and Trade Wars: A Looming Threat? Donald Trump’s tariff plans are a major talking point and a significant driver of market uncertainty. His proposals for reciprocal tariffs and threats of levies on automobiles are raising concerns about a potential global trade war. Tariffs FAQs What are tariffs? Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, designed to protect domestic industries by making imported products more expensive. Tariffs vs. Taxes: Tariffs are paid by importers at the port of entry, while taxes are paid by consumers or businesses at the point of sale. Are tariffs good or bad? Economists are divided. Some argue tariffs protect domestic jobs and industries, while others warn they can lead to higher prices for consumers and retaliatory trade wars. Trump’s Tariff Plan: Trump aims to use tariffs to support the US economy, focusing on countries like Mexico, China, and Canada. He intends to use tariff revenue to reduce income taxes. Federal Reserve Policy: Understanding the Basics Understanding the Federal Reserve’s role is crucial for navigating financial markets. Here are some frequently asked questions about the Fed and its impact on the US Dollar. Fed FAQs What does the Federal Reserve do? The Fed is the central bank of the US, responsible for monetary policy, aiming for price stability and full employment. How does the Fed impact the USD? The Fed influences the USD primarily through interest rate adjustments. Higher rates tend to strengthen the USD, while lower rates can weaken it. How often does the Fed meet? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) holds eight policy meetings per year to assess economic conditions and make monetary policy decisions. What is Quantitative Easing (QE)? QE is a policy where the Fed injects liquidity into the financial system by buying bonds, typically weakening the USD. What is Quantitative Tightening (QT)? QT is the reverse of QE, where the Fed reduces its balance sheet, generally positive for the USD. Conclusion: Gold’s Resilient Stance Gold price is currently navigating a complex landscape of USD fluctuations, tariff threats, and evolving Federal Reserve policy expectations. Despite headwinds from a slightly firmer dollar, the precious metal is drawing significant support from safe-haven demand fueled by geopolitical uncertainties and the looming possibility of trade wars. While technical indicators suggest further upside potential, key resistance levels are approaching. Investors should closely monitor developments related to US trade policy, Fed pronouncements, and global risk sentiment to gauge the next move for gold.

The broader market has struggled to regain strength, with most altcoins trading sideways. However, some Ethereum rivals have shown resilience, positioning themselves as strong alternatives. ​​Ethereum Rivals: Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL), a layer-one blockchain project, continues to gain attention as a major Ethereum rival. In the past 24 hours, the Solana price dropped over 5%, settling at $180 amid market volatility. Despite the decline, SOL has maintained steady growth, eyeing more gains ahead. Over the last year, its value surged more than 100%, reinforcing its position among Ethereum rivals. A crypto analyst highlighted that the $180 to $190 range remains a critical support zone for SOL. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price has hovered around $2,600 for five consecutive years, underscoring the evolving competition between these two leading blockchain networks. Cardano (ADA) Cardano price climbed to $0.80, reflecting a 10% weekly gain amid a broader market rebound. The third-generation blockchain, known for its proof-of-stake (PoS) model, continues to attract investors seeking energy-efficient alternatives. Analysts highlight a potential breakout after ADA formed a cup-and-handle pattern, suggesting bullish momentum. With Ethereum trading around $2,600 for five years, Cardano remains among the top Ethereum rivals gaining attention. Market sentiment points to sustained upward pressure, reinforcing optimism among traders tracking ADA’s performance. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink (LINK), a key blockchain abstraction layer, continues to enhance smart contract integration. Despite gaining over 160% in recent years, LINK struggles to sustain momentum. The LINK price is $18.89, reflecting a 0.38% daily dip. According to Coinglass, trading volume surged 85.79% to $874.14 million, while open interest declined 0.69% to $566.01 million. Source- Coinglass Conclusion These Ethereum rivals to buy offer distinct advantages and potential upside if bullish momentum returns.

40479166,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=698211,1739847605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/40479166.jpeg,Key Metrics Indicate Toncoin Accumulation Continues Despite Price Struggle,https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/key-metrics-indicate-toncoin-accumulation-continues-despite-price-struggle/,"After a steady decline, Toncoin (TON) has seen a slight price increase over the past day, rising by 1.7% to $3.85. This movement comes amidst ongoing discussions about its longer-term performance and accumulation trends. According to an analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Shiven Moodley, there are indications that TON holders are positioning for a potential rebound. Moodley’s observations, which are detailed in a recent post on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, suggest that the asset may be entering an accumulation phase despite its recent downward trajectory. Related Reading: Analyst Says Toncoin (TON) May Be Primed for Major Recovery—Here’s Why Toncoin Shows Signs of Accumulation Moodley points to several metrics as evidence. The 180-day Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted returns, signals a period of accumulation. This is further supported by stable TVL (Total Value Locked) in lending protocols and a noticeable reduction in speculative trading activity. Notably, the asset’s volatility has declined since the price spikes in December 2024 and February 2025. If this trend persists, it could imply that selling pressure is diminishing, potentially paving the way for a future rebound. Key on-chain indicators also paint a picture of potential opportunity. The Normalized Risk Metric (NRM), which evaluates TON’s valuation relative to historical moving averages, highlights accumulation at a price level of $3.82. Additionally, record lows in the Long-Term NRM suggest that longer-term holders are increasingly accumulating TON at these levels. Historically, similar setups have preceded market recoveries, giving investors a reason to believe that a medium-term price reversal may be on the horizon. Moodley wrote: It remains to be seen whether TON’s price action can stage a full recovery. However, long-term accumulation traders are best positioned to benefit from macro policy changes that could shift sentiment in the broader crypto market. The conditions could align for a potential rebound with selling pressure fading and risk metrics signalling a low-risk environment. On-Chain Metrics Hint at Long-Term Opportunity Another metric Moodley pointed out is the Risk Exposure Ratio—which tracks leveraged positions within TON’s DeFi ecosystem—it has recently reached a new high, exceeding 0.24 in early 2025. This suggests a growing influence of leveraged activity. However, if the ratio begins to decline, it could indicate a stabilization in market conditions, potentially leading to more stable price movements. Furthermore, the Probability of Spend metric shows that coins older than 400 days are unlikely to move, indicating strong conviction among long-term holders. This trend has historically correlated with phases of accumulation and recovery. As Moodley notes, short- to medium-term holders appear to be exiting their positions, likely contributing to the recent price weakness. Meanwhile, long-term holders remain consistent, suggesting a belief in the asset’s long-term potential.

In this scenario, long-term investors may be well-positioned to benefit from potential macroeconomic shifts that could ultimately boost Toncoin’s value.

And experts have finally found the 3 best options – RCO Finance (RCOF) , Dogecoin (DOGE), and SUI! At the top of the cheap altcoins to buy list we have RCOF, a promising new SolidProof audited platform that has incredible potential. Then we have DOGE and SUI, two crypto giants that are getting ready for huge rallies! RCO Finance: Bringing Groundbreaking Technology and Massive Adoption to the Crypto Market RCO Finance is a brand-new financial platform that hasn’t even launched yet. This means that you can still catch RCOF during its presale, which is why RCOF is among the best 3 cheap altcoins to buy right now. And out of the 3 cheap altcoins to buy, RCO Finance offers the most promise. First off, RCO Finance is already revolutionizing the crypto market, as it recently launched its Beta Platform even though it’s still in presale. This is quite unorthodox for crypto presales, as most wait until after the launch to provide investors with a working product or service. However, now, anyone can go to the RCO Finance website and check out its fully functioning Beta Platform and see for themselves if RCO Finance is worth investing in. And most who have done this say it is! The Beta Platform is a hit, as it has an incredibly intuitive user interface and great features. First, it gives users access to over 120,000 assets, allowing them to trade/invest in whichever asset they want from one place. Second, it allows users to manage multiple crypto wallets from one place. So, managing assets will be much easier thanks to the RCO Finance Beta Platform. The Beta Platform also displays all the latest news on its dashboard, and it’s a strict non-KYC platform that gives users the privacy and freedom they need! However, the Beta Platform is just one piece of the puzzle that makes RCOF the top contender among the best 3 cheap altcoins to buy right now. Namely, RCO Finance also has an incredible AI tool that will make trading and investing easier and more profitable than ever before! That’s because the AI Robo Advisor can create a sophisticated investment strategy for all RCO Finance users, no matter which assets they want to invest in. First off, the AI Robo Advisor asks users about their financial goals, market preferences, and risk tolerance, and then it combines this with market data and technical analysis. That’s how the AI Robo Advisor creates a tailored and data-driven strategy for every RCO Finance user, and it continues to update it 24/7. It digests real-time financial info from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, adding it immediately to users’ trades. This allows all RCO Finance users to make money no matter the state of the market! Furthermore, the AI Robo Advisor can also catch promising new crypto coins before they boom. It will tell you when to buy and sell, making sure you secure your profits while you can. So, with it, you’ll be able to catch crypto coins like FULLSEND, which went from an MC of $278K to $100 million in about a day! With these incredible money-making opportunities available, it’s no wonder that RCOF tops many experts’ best cheap altcoins to buy lists! DOGE Is Preparing for a Rally as Open Interest Rises Dogecoin is another great contender in the “best cheap altcoins to buy” race. We all know Dogecoin as one of the biggest memecoins in the crypto market, which is also supported heavily by Elon Musk. Right now, the DOGE price is at $ 0.27, and it’s finally recovering from the recent crypto market crash. Namely, DOGE rose over 7% in just one day, showing that its path to recovery is strong. Also, experts believe that Dogecoin will dominate the crypto market again this year, especially with Elon Musk leading the US D.O.G.E. They say that this could bring massive upside for DOGE, and investors agree. Dogecoin’s open interest has risen significantly in the past few days, showing that investors are buying up DOGE tokens now that they’re at a low price. With all this in mind, Dogecoin is set to inevitably rise in 2025. Experts say that Dogecoin could finally reach $1 this year, making it one of the best cheap altcoins to buy right now! SUI Is Expanding and Experts Expect More Price Rises for It Soon SUI has become a serious player in the crypto market over the past years, especially during 2024. In 2024, SUI saw a massive rise in adoption, with traders even trying to make memecoin trading a thing on the SUI network. This didn’t work out, but it doesn’t mean that it never will. SUI has also been expanding for months, and it has a new partnership that will help it engage in an aggressive ecosystem expansion strategy. Namely, SUI partnered with Ant Digital, forming an RWA tokenization team partnership to carve its place in the up-and-coming RWA sector. This could lead to even more adoption of SUI, which will also boost its price. At the moment, SUI is trading at $3.67, rising by nearly 7% in just 24 hours already. This shows massive strength for SUI, and it indicates more upside to come. And with the expansion into RWA, experts believe that SUI can reach $5+ in 2025 alone! So, SUI is another great contender among the best cheap altcoins to buy in 2025! >>> BUY RCOF NOW RCOF: The #1 Contender Among the Best Cheap Altcoins To Buy! There’s no question that RCO Finance, Dogecoin, and SUI are the 3 best cheap altcoins to buy right now. However, it’s also clear that RCOF is the most promising. It offers incredible technology, and it hasn’t even launched yet. Namely, RCOF is currently in Stage 5 in its presale, available for $0.1. Once it starts trading on crypto exchanges at $0.4-$0.6, experts expect RCOF to go on a huge rally, rising by 1,000x by mid-2025. So, by investing in RCOF now, you can turn $1,000 into $1,000,000 in a few months, and even more in the longer term!

While TRUMP Coin sees dramatic price swings fueled by major exchange listings and Chainlink (LINK) signals a potential rally, Web3Bay is tackling a more pressing issue—security in online shopping. Unlike speculative assets, Web3Bay’s smart contract escrow system actively prevents fraud, fake reviews, and chargebacks, creating a trust-based marketplace. As traders navigate volatile markets with meme coins and established networks, Web3Bay presents a practical blockchain use case, ensuring transparency and security in e-commerce—an approach that could reshape online transactions. Web3Bay’s Smart Contract Escrow Online shopping is plagued by scams, fake reviews, and chargebacks, leaving both buyers and sellers vulnerable. To address these challenges, Web3Bay tackles these issues head-on with its blockchain-based smart contract escrow system, ensuring transactions are secure, transparent, and dispute-free. By leveraging automation, payments are held in escrow until conditions are met, eliminating the risk of fraudulent listings and chargeback fraud, thereby protecting all parties involved. For small business owners, this development is particularly beneficial, as it means reduced losses from false claims and disputes, while shoppers gain confidence knowing they are dealing with verified sellers. Moreover, blockchain immutability prevents fake reviews, ensuring trustworthy product ratings. As a result, this trust-based ecosystem marks a major shift from traditional e-commerce, where fraud thrives due to centralized oversight gaps. Meanwhile, Web3Bay’s presale is gaining traction, having raised $1.4 million in stage 4 at a batch price of $0.004562625, with over 340 billion coins sold. Given the increasing demand for secure digital transactions, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leading solution in online fraud prevention. TRUMP Coin Skyrockets Over 20% After Upbit Listing TRUMP, a meme coin linked to former U.S. President Donald Trump, surged over 20% following its listing on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit. This development introduced new trading pairs with KRW, BTC, and USDT, fueling market enthusiasm and driving a sharp increase in price and trading volume. Previously, TRUMP had been listed on Binance and Coinbase, with its initial rally pushing the price above $70 and its market cap to $14.5 billion. However, it later dropped significantly, falling below $3.5 billion. Despite the decline, the Upbit listing has reignited investor interest, with analysts predicting a potential rebound toward $35–$40 in the near term. This price movement underscores the strong influence of major exchange listings on meme-based assets, particularly in regions with high retail trading activity like South Korea. With speculation mounting, TRUMP remains a closely watched token in the market. Chainlink’s Potential Surge: Indicators Point to a $23 Target Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $18.59, with its key support level between $17 and $18 holding firm. Significantly, the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal near this support, suggesting a potential rebound toward $21 and possibly $23. Analysts emphasize that the $21 level has previously acted as a consolidation zone, while $23 has been a significant resistance point. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 48.94, indicating a neutral market stance and the Directional Movement Index (DMI) reflects ongoing competition between buying and selling pressures. Additionally, whale investors control 67% of LINK’s circulating supply, and recent data shows that 57% of holders are in profit, with 40% at a loss. Considering these factors, combined with exchange outflows, selling pressure appears to be decreasing, supporting the possibility of a rally toward the $23 mark. Final Thoughts As cryptocurrency markets fluctuate, security and utility remain key factors for long-term adoption. TRUMP Coin’s price swings highlight the influence of exchange listings, while Chainlink’s indicators suggest potential growth based on technical signals. However, Web3Bay addresses a more fundamental need—fraud prevention in online shopping. By leveraging smart contract escrow, it eliminates chargebacks and fake reviews, offering a tangible solution beyond speculation. While traders chase volatility, Web3Bay builds a secure foundation for digital transactions, ensuring trust and transparency in e-commerce.

As of today, February 18, 2025, MKR has gained 7% in the past 24 hours, topping the crypto market and showing signs of a potential price rebound. MakerDAO (MKR) Current Price MKR is currently trading near $1,065, and during the same period, it has attracted interest and confidence from traders and investors, resulting in a 10% increase in trading volume. This impressive price surge amid bearish market sentiment appears to be shifting MKR’s sentiment from a downtrend to an uptrend. MKR Price Action and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, MKR has been moving in a downtrend, following a descending channel price action pattern. However, with the recent upside momentum, the price is on the verge of breaking out of this descending pattern. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price momentum and historical patterns, if MKR breaches this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $1,070 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 50% to reach the $1,600 level in the future. During the rally, MKR may face slight resistance near $1,100, as the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame currently lies near that level. Bearish On-Chain Metrics Following this bullish price action and recent price jump, investors and long-term holders have started dumping MKR tokens, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an inflow of $1.85 million worth of MKR tokens in the past 24 hours, which suggests a potential sell-off. Such inflows of assets from wallets to exchanges are often seen as a sign of a potential price drop and increased selling pressure. Source: Coinglass When combining these on-chain metrics with the technical analysis, it appears that the asset is bullish.

The proposed ETF will be structured as a “Commodity-Based Trust,” a model already used for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This filing marks the latest move by a U.S. exchange to offer an ETF containing spot XRP, the native token of Ripple’s XRP Ledger blockchain. The decision to file comes amid increasing interest in crypto ETFs and after a key legal ruling in favor of Ripple, which determined that XRP is not automatically considered a security. Multiple exchanges are exploring opportunities to offer similar products The buzz around these ETFs is evident, with 15 different ETFs now vying for attention, each competing to secure approval for listing. With institutional demand rising, many believe the SEC’s approval of these ETFs could trigger massive buying activity, pushing XRP’s value to new heights. Grayscale, a digital asset firm, is working on launching a spot XRP ETF. On January 30, 2025, NYSE Arca filed a form with the SEC to list Grayscale’s XRP Trust as an ETF. This starts a 240-day review period, with a decision expected by mid-October 2025. The SEC acknowledged the application on February 14, 2025. XRP Rally Soon? As major players in the market, including whales, have been gobbling up millions of XRP over the past few months, the anticipation for the approval of XRP-based Exchange Traded Funds is heating up. With institutions increasingly eyeing XRP and the SEC’s Ripple case potentially nearing its conclusion, the sentiment surrounding XRP has never been stronger.

Speaking to broadcaster TN on Monday, Milei insisted he merely “spread” information about the token, not promote it . He said: It is a problem between private parties because the State does not play a role here. Milei added that he had acted “in good faith.” $LIBRA crypto crash: Federal investigation into potential fraud Argentina’s federal prosecutor’s office has launched an investigation into whether Milei engaged in fraud, criminal association, or breached his duties when he publicly endorsed $LIBRA on social media. The digital currency initially surged in value before plummeting, prompting Milei to delete his post hours later, calling it a mistake. Crypto Rover @rovercrc · Follow 💥BREAKING: Argentinian President Javier Milei retweets “How To Buy $LIBRA ” Tutorial, days after deleting his post endorsing the project.THIS IS CRAZY 😱 9:55 PM · Feb 17, 2025 7.9K Reply Copy link Read 432 replies Rights group Observatory for the Right to the City, along with multiple complainants, alleges Milei was part of a “criminal organization” that orchestrated a fraud affecting over 40,000 investors, resulting in losses exceeding $4 billion. Crypto analysts suspect the $LIBRA collapse was a “rug pull”—a scam where developers hype a token, attract investors, and then cash out quickly. The Kobeissi Letter, a global capital markets analysis publication, reported that within minutes of its launch, large holders liquidated millions of dollars worth of $LIBRA, with some cashing out over $4 million. Economists, crypto experts, and opposition figures have heavily criticized Milei, branding the asset a potential Ponzi scheme. Former president Cristina Kirchner labeled him a “crypto-scammer,” while opposition lawmakers are pushing for impeachment proceedings. $LIBRA crypto crash sends shockwaves through Argentina’s financial markets In response to the backlash, Argentina’s presidency announced Saturday that the Anti-Corruption Office would investigate whether improper conduct occurred. A task force has been formed to conduct an urgent probe into $LIBRA’s launch and the individuals or entities involved. Authorities will also scrutinize Julian Peh, CEO of companies linked to $LIBRA, and Chamber of Deputies President Martin Menem, who had reshared Milei’s initial endorsement. The controversy has sent shockwaves through Argentina’s financial markets, with the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange closing 5.58% lower on Monday. Some stocks suffered losses of up to 8%. Despite the scandal, Milei remains focused on his political agenda. On Monday, he hosted Republican US Senator Steve Daines in Buenos Aires and is set to visit the United States later this week. However, political analysts warn that the controversy could dent his credibility, even as his anti-inflation measures continue to win public approval.

The price is trading above $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,750 and $2,780. Ethereum Price Regains Traction Ethereum price attempted a fresh increase above the $2,700 level, beating Bitcoin . ETH broke the $2,750 resistance but it failed to clear the $2,850 resistance zone. A high was formed at $2,847 and the price started a fresh decline . There was a move below the $2,750 and $2,720 support levels. A low was formed at $2,689 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,847 swing high to the $2,689 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,750 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,765 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,847 swing high to the $2,689 low. The main resistance is now forming near $2,800 or $2,820. A clear move above the $2,820 resistance might send the price toward the $2,850 resistance. An upside break above the $2,850 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,750 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,700 level. The first major support sits near the $2,680 zone. A clear move below the $2,680 support might push the price toward the $2,620 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,550 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,500.

However, in the last seven days, XRP is up by more than 8%. As of now, XRP is testing a previous resistance zone between $2.58 and $2.73. After a significant rally from the February low, the price has struggled to break past the $2.79 level. This is a crucial area to watch because if XRP can flip this resistance into support, it would signal a potential continuation upward. However, the price is still in the testing phase, and it has not yet confirmed this as a solid support level. Key Support and Resistance Levels If the price fails to maintain this level and closes below $2.58 on the daily chart, the breakout attempt will be considered unsuccessful. In that case, XRP could move back toward the next major support zone between $2.25 and $2.30, which was significant support previously. Below that, additional support is available further down, but these levels need to be closely monitored. The next significant resistance lies at $2.79, and if breached, it could signal a potential continuation towards $3. However, as long as XRP stays below $2.79, the price action is likely to remain under downward pressure. Bearish Divergence Currently, there is a larger bearish divergence on the daily chart, which is also visible on the 3-day chart. This bearish divergence is still in play, and if XRP drops below $2.58, it will likely continue, leading to a price pullback toward the next support area. Short-Term Pullback The recent short-term pullback in XRP’s price can be attributed to this bearish divergence. Since higher highs were seen in the price while the RSI showed lower highs, a bearish divergence formed.

With millions of early adopters and growing speculation, traders are eager to see how Pi Coin performs when real trading starts. Could this lead to outperforming other crypto coins like BTC? Key factors influencing its valuation include exchange listings, early holders’ actions, and market price anchoring. As launch day approaches, expectations remain high for Pi Network’s official entry into the crypto market. Bitcoin price is currently hovering above $96k. Is Pi Network Price Set to Outperform Bitcoin After Mainnet Launch? Pi Network Price has been gaining momentum as its Open Mainnet launch approaches on February 20. The recent 100% surge in Pi Coin’s price following its OKX listing has fueled speculation about a possible Binance listing. This led to a price rally from $50 to above $70. Over the past week, the Pi price has surged by 50%. However, neither Binance nor the Pi Core Team has confirmed any such plans, leaving traders uncertain. The mobile device mining method of Pi Coin provides broad accessibility to users who want to participate in its network. Pi Network leads the crypto ecosystem as it maintains more than 100 million users on its platform. Despite its growing adoption, critics argue that Pi Coin was never designed for speculation but rather for a barter-based economy. If it remains unlisted on major exchanges, adoption may be gradual rather than explosive. A Binance listing could significantly impact Pi Coin’s price, drawing more interest from traders. However, history has shown that tokens with rapid price spikes often face sharp corrections. Projects like Berachain and Hamster saw massive initial hype but eventually declined due to weak use cases. Without strong fundamentals, Pi Coin could face similar challenges despite its widespread popularity. While Binance has yet to announce any listing plans, other exchanges, including Bitget, OKX, and MEXC, have already shown interest in Pi Coin. Still, skepticism lingers due to past delays in Pi Network’s roadmap.

Understanding the dynamics of Forex pairs like EUR/USD can provide valuable insights into broader market sentiment and potential risk-on or risk-off behavior. Today, we delve into the latest EUR/USD forecast from UOB Group, offering a crucial perspective for your trading strategy. EUR/USD Forecast: Why Consolidation is Expected? According to UOB Group’s FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, the Euro (EUR) is poised for a period of consolidation against the US Dollar (USD). This Forex Forecast suggests a shift from recent upward momentum to a more sideways movement. Instead of a continued surge, the analysts anticipate EUR/USD to trade within a defined range of 1.0455 to 1.0515. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors driving this prediction: Short-Term View (24-Hour): UOB Group observed that the previous strong rise of the Euro appeared “overdone.” While they anticipated a test of 1.0495, they also believed that the significant resistance at 1.0530 would remain unchallenged. Recent price action validated this view, with EUR/USD rising to 1.0514 before easing back to 1.0491. Slowing Momentum and Overbought Conditions: Technical indicators point towards a deceleration in upward momentum and suggest that EUR/USD may be entering overbought territory. These conditions often precede periods of consolidation or even pullbacks. Consolidation Range: Based on these factors, UOB Group projects EUR/USD to consolidate within a 1.0455/1.0515 range for the immediate term. Longer-Term Euro to Dollar Outlook: Still Positive? While the short-term outlook suggests consolidation, the longer-term Euro to Dollar forecast remains positive, according to UOB Group. They maintain a technical target of 1.0530 for the Euro. This indicates that the analysts believe the recent upward trend is not entirely exhausted and that further gains are possible in the coming weeks, provided certain conditions are met. Key points for the 1-3 weeks view: Positive Outlook Maintained: UOB Group’s positive outlook on EUR remains valid from their previous analysis on February 14th. Technical Target: The technical target of 1.0530 is still in play. Crucial Support Level: To sustain the positive momentum, EUR/USD must hold above the 1.0400 level, which acts as a “strong support.” A break below this level could negate the positive outlook. Significant Resistance Levels: Beyond the initial target of 1.0530, another significant resistance level awaits at 1.0560. These levels will be crucial to watch for potential breakouts or reversals in Currency Trading . Actionable Insights for Currency Trading and Crypto Traders So, what does this EUR/USD Prediction mean for traders, especially those involved in the cryptocurrency market? Short-Term Strategy: For short-term traders, the anticipated consolidation range of 1.0455/1.0515 presents opportunities for range-bound trading strategies. This could involve buying near the lower end of the range and selling near the higher end, with appropriate risk management measures in place. Monitoring Support and Resistance: Keep a close eye on the key support level at 1.0400 and resistance levels at 1.0530 and 1.0560. Breaks beyond these levels could signal shifts in momentum and potentially larger price movements. Broader Market Context: EUR/USD movements can often reflect broader market sentiment. A period of consolidation in EUR/USD might coincide with consolidation or indecision in other markets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a breakout in EUR/USD could signal a broader shift in risk appetite. Risk Management is Key: As always, remember that Forex and cryptocurrency trading involves significant risk. Conduct thorough research, use appropriate risk management tools, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Conclusion: Navigating EUR/USD Consolidation In conclusion, UOB Group’s Forex Forecast suggests that EUR/USD is likely to consolidate within a 1.0455/1.0515 range in the short term. While the longer-term outlook remains positive with a target of 1.0530, traders should be prepared for range-bound trading conditions. Monitoring key support and resistance levels and understanding the broader market context will be crucial for navigating this phase of EUR/USD price action. Stay informed, trade cautiously, and leverage these insights to refine your trading approach in both Forex and cryptocurrency markets.

These factors combined paint a picture of a market that is currently favoring bullish positions. But what does this mean for potential targets and key levels to watch? Navigating the XAG/USD Forecast: Key Levels and Targets While the Silver Price Forecast looks promising, it’s crucial to identify key levels to anticipate potential movements.

Decoding the Silver Market Analysis: Factors to Watch Understanding the factors influencing silver prices is key to making informed investment decisions. Here are some crucial elements that impact the Silver Market Analysis : Safe-Haven Demand: Silver, like gold, benefits from geopolitical uncertainty and economic downturn fears. However, it’s generally considered a less potent safe-haven compared to gold. Interest Rates: As a non-yielding asset, silver tends to perform better in low-interest-rate environments. Keep an eye on central bank policies. US Dollar Strength: Silver is priced in USD, so a weaker dollar typically boosts silver prices, and vice versa. Industrial Demand: Silver has extensive industrial applications, particularly in electronics and solar energy. Economic growth and technological advancements can significantly impact demand. Gold’s Influence: Silver prices often mirror gold’s movements due to their shared safe-haven status. The Gold/Silver ratio can provide insights into relative valuation. FAQ: Your Burning Questions About Silver Answered Why do people invest in Silver? Silver attracts investors for several reasons: Store of Value: Historically, silver has served as a reliable store of value, preserving wealth over time. Portfolio Diversification: Adding silver to an investment portfolio can reduce overall risk by diversifying asset classes. Inflation Hedge: Silver is often seen as a hedge against inflation, although less effectively than gold. Intrinsic Value: Silver’s industrial applications and precious metal status give it intrinsic value. Investors can access silver through physical forms (coins, bars) or via Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track silver prices. Which factors influence Silver prices? A multitude of factors can sway silver prices: Geopolitical Instability: Events that create global uncertainty can drive safe-haven demand for silver. Recession Fears: Economic downturns can also increase silver’s appeal as a safe asset. Interest Rate Policies: Lower interest rates generally support higher silver prices. US Dollar Performance: A weaker dollar is typically bullish for silver. Investment Demand: Investor appetite for silver can significantly impact prices. Mining Supply & Recycling: Supply-side dynamics, including mining output and recycling rates, play a role. How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? Industrial demand is a significant driver for silver due to its unique properties: High Electrical Conductivity: Silver’s superior conductivity makes it essential in electronics. Solar Energy: Growing demand for solar panels increases silver consumption. Key Industries: The health of industrial sectors in major economies like the US, China, and India directly impacts silver demand. Jewelry Demand (India): In India, jewelry demand is a crucial factor influencing silver prices. How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? Silver and gold often move in tandem due to their shared safe-haven characteristics: Correlation: Silver prices generally follow gold price trends. Gold/Silver Ratio: This ratio indicates the relative value between gold and silver. A high ratio might suggest silver is undervalued, while a low ratio could imply gold is undervalued. Relative Valuation Tool: Investors use the Gold/Silver ratio to gauge potential opportunities between the two metals. Conclusion: Is the Silver Price Prediction Still Bullish? The current Silver Price Prediction leans towards a continued bullish trend. Technical indicators, dip-buying behavior, and a favorable macroeconomic backdrop are all contributing to the positive momentum in XAG/USD. While caution is always advised in volatile markets, the signals suggest that silver could have more room to run, potentially targeting higher levels in the near term.

As we kick off a week packed with critical UK economic data releases, including employment figures and inflation metrics, investors are holding their breath. Will the data confirm expectations, or will it unleash fresh volatility? This week could be pivotal for the Pound, and here’s what you need to know to navigate the potential shifts in the Forex market . Pound Sterling Braces for UK Economic Data Barrage The Pound Sterling began the week maintaining its ground against major currencies. This steadiness comes as traders await a series of crucial UK economic data points. Tuesday is the day to watch, with the release of employment figures for the three months leading to December. This data will be a vital sign of the UK’s economic health and a potential indicator of business sentiment following recent policy changes. Specifically, the market is keenly observing: ILO Unemployment Rate: Expected to slightly increase to 4.5% in December from 4.4%. Average Earnings: Anticipated to remain robust, potentially accelerating to 5.9% from 5.6%. These figures are not just numbers; they are potential market movers. Strong wage growth, while seemingly positive, could fuel inflation concerns, especially in the service sector. This situation could lead to stagflation risks – a scenario of slow economic growth coupled with high inflation. For those tracking the Forex markets, these data points are critical for understanding the near-term trajectory of the Pound. BoE Governor Bailey’s Speech: A Glimpse into Monetary Policy? Adding to Tuesday’s significance is a scheduled speech by BoE Governor Bailey . Market participants will be hanging on every word, searching for clues about the Bank of England’s (BoE) future monetary policy direction. In their recent monetary policy statement, the BoE hinted at possible inflationary pressures before inflation resumes its downward path towards the 2% target. Bailey’s speech could either reinforce this stance or introduce new nuances, directly impacting the Pound Sterling’s valuation. Key Questions for Bailey’s Speech: Will he reiterate the BoE’s cautious approach to inflation? Will he provide any hints about future interest rate decisions? How will he address the concerns about wage growth and its impact on inflation? Answers to these questions could trigger significant movements in the Forex market , particularly for GBP pairs. Global Factors: Fed’s Caution and US Dollar’s Wobble The Pound’s steady performance also needs to be viewed in the context of global economic factors. Across the Atlantic, the US Dollar (USD) is showing signs of weakness. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is struggling to hold its ground, hovering near two-month lows. This USD softness is partly due to improved market sentiment, fueled by delays in the implementation of new US tariffs, reducing immediate global trade war anxieties. However, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) remains a key influence. Fed’s Logan recently reiterated the central bank’s cautious stance on interest rate cuts, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance on economic data. This cautious approach from the Fed contrasts with some expectations of more aggressive rate cuts earlier in the year, contributing to the current dynamic in the Forex market . GBP/USD Technical Outlook: poised for a breakout? Analyzing the GBP/USD pair technically, we see it trading around the 1.2600 level. After a period of consolidation, is the Pound Sterling gearing up for a breakout? Technical Indicators to Watch: Indicator Current Status Implication 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Around 1.2500 GBP/USD holding above this level suggests a bullish near-term outlook. 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) Above 60.00 Indicates increasing bullish momentum. Sustaining above 60.00 could signal further upward movement. Fibonacci Retracement (38.2%) Around 1.2620 Immediate resistance level. A decisive break above this could trigger further gains. Fibonacci Retracement (50%) At 1.2767 Key resistance zone on the upside. February 3 low At 1.2250 Acts as a crucial support zone on the downside. Traders should monitor these levels closely. A break above the 1.2620 resistance could open the path towards the 1.2767 level, while a drop below 1.2500 might signal a potential retest of the 1.2250 support. Understanding the Pound Sterling: Key FAQs For those new to Forex trading or seeking a refresher, let’s address some frequently asked questions about the Pound Sterling. What is the Pound Sterling? The Pound Sterling (GBP) isn’t just any currency; it’s the world’s oldest, dating back to 886 AD. It’s the official currency of the United Kingdom and a major player in global Forex market , ranking as the fourth most traded currency worldwide. In 2022, it accounted for 12% of all Forex transactions, averaging a staggering $630 billion daily. Key trading pairs include GBP/USD (‘Cable’), GBP/JPY (‘Dragon’), and EUR/GBP. The Bank of England (BoE) is the issuing authority, making its decisions paramount to the Pound’s value. How do BoE decisions influence the Pound Sterling? The Bank of England’s monetary policy is the single most critical factor influencing the Pound Sterling’s value. The BoE’s primary objective is price stability, aiming for a 2% inflation rate. Interest rate adjustments are their main tool. Raising interest rates to combat high inflation typically strengthens the GBP, making the UK a more attractive destination for global investors. Conversely, lowering rates to stimulate growth when inflation is low can weaken the Pound. Therefore, understanding the BoE Governor Bailey’s and the BoE’s stance is crucial for Forex market participants. How does economic data impact the Pound’s value? Economic data releases serve as vital health checks for the UK economy and can significantly sway the Pound Sterling’s value. Indicators like GDP, PMIs, and employment figures all play a role. Strong economic data generally bolsters the Pound, attracting foreign investment and potentially prompting the BoE to raise interest rates. Weak data, conversely, usually leads to a Pound Sterling depreciation. This week’s UK economic data releases are therefore particularly significant. What role does the Trade Balance play? The Trade Balance, reflecting the difference between exports and imports, is another key data point for the Pound. A positive trade balance, driven by high demand for UK exports, typically strengthens the Pound due to increased foreign currency inflows. Conversely, a negative balance can weaken it. Monitoring the UK’s trade performance offers insights into the fundamental strength of the Pound Sterling. Conclusion: Navigating the Week Ahead As the week unfolds, all eyes will be on the UK economic data releases and BoE Governor Bailey’s speech. These events are poised to inject volatility into the Forex market and dictate the Pound Sterling’s near-term direction. For traders and investors in the cryptocurrency and Forex spaces, staying informed and agile is key. Keep a close watch on the data, listen attentively to Bailey’s signals, and be prepared to adjust your strategies as the landscape evolves. This week promises to be a crucial chapter in the Pound Sterling’s story.

The global financial landscape is bracing for a potential seismic shift as Danske Bank anticipates a crucial move from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). All eyes are on the upcoming interest rate decision , with expectations mounting for the RBA to initiate its easing cycle. But what does this mean for the volatile world of Forex, and could ripples even reach the crypto sphere? Let’s dive into Danske Bank’s analysis and unpack the potential market impact. Decoding the Expected RBA Rate Cut: What’s the Buzz? According to a recent report from Danske Bank, the RBA is widely tipped to deliver its first 25 basis point (bp) RBA rate cut early Tuesday morning GMT. Market sentiment strongly echoes this prediction, pricing in a significant 90% probability of this monetary policy adjustment. This anticipated move is not happening in isolation; it’s part of a broader global trend of central banks navigating economic headwinds and adjusting their strategies. Mohamad Al-Saraf, a leading FX analyst at Danske Bank, highlights the potential implications for the Australian Dollar (AUD) and the New Zealand Dollar (NZD). While both currencies showed strength last week amidst positive risk appetite, this week’s central bank actions could introduce volatility and mixed fortunes. Here’s a breakdown of what to expect: High Probability of a Rate Cut: Markets are almost certain that the RBA will reduce Australia interest rates by 25bp. Guidance is Key: The real market mover will be the RBA’s forward guidance. If the rate cut is accompanied by signals of further easing, expect potential downward pressure on the AUD. NZ Rate Cut Also on the Horizon: The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is expected to follow suit, with a larger 50bp cut anticipated shortly after the RBA announcement. Hawkish RBNZ Tone Could Support NZD: Having already aggressively cut rates, any hint from the RBNZ about slowing down the pace of future cuts could provide a boost to the NZD. Forex Market Trends: AUD vs. NZD – A Trader’s Playground? Danske Bank’s strategic outlook includes a continued short position on AUD/NZD, signaling an expectation for further divergence between the two currencies. This recommendation is part of their “FX Top Trades 2025,” suggesting a longer-term perspective on this currency pair. For Forex traders, this presents potential opportunities, but also necessitates careful risk management. Key Considerations for Forex Traders: Volatility Expected: Central bank announcements are notorious for triggering market volatility. Be prepared for rapid price swings in AUD and NZD pairs. Monitor Central Bank Statements: Pay close attention to the official statements from both the RBA and RBNZ. The nuances in their language will be crucial in determining market direction. Global Risk Sentiment: Keep an eye on broader global risk sentiment. External factors can amplify or dampen the impact of central bank decisions on currency valuations. Technical Analysis: Complement fundamental analysis with technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points in AUD/NZD and related pairs. Central Bank Policy and Crypto: Is There a Connection? While the immediate focus is on Forex markets, central bank policy decisions like interest rate cuts can indirectly influence the cryptocurrency landscape. Here’s how: Risk Appetite: Lower interest rates can sometimes fuel risk appetite across markets. Investors seeking higher returns might allocate capital to riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Currency Fluctuations: Significant movements in major currencies like AUD and NZD can impact crypto trading pairs involving these currencies. Inflationary Pressures: Aggressive rate cuts, if perceived as inflationary, could increase the appeal of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as potential inflation hedges. Market Sentiment: Broader market sentiment, influenced by central bank actions, can spill over into the crypto market, affecting investor confidence and trading activity. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is driven by a multitude of factors, and the impact of a single RBA rate cut might be diluted by other global events, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the crypto space itself. Navigating the Forex Seas: Actionable Insights For both seasoned Forex veterans and crypto enthusiasts dipping their toes into traditional markets, understanding central bank actions is paramount. Here are some actionable takeaways: Insight Action RBA rate cut is highly probable. Prepare for potential AUD weakness, especially if dovish guidance is provided. RBNZ rate cut is also expected. Monitor RBNZ communication for hints of slowing down the pace of cuts, which could support NZD. AUD/NZD volatility is anticipated. Implement robust risk management strategies when trading this pair. Central bank policies have indirect crypto impact. Stay informed about global macro trends and their potential influence on crypto market sentiment. Conclusion: Stay Informed, Trade Smart The expected RBA rate cut and the subsequent RBNZ decision are pivotal events for the Forex market trends . Danske Bank’s analysis provides a valuable framework for understanding the potential market reactions and navigating the anticipated volatility. While the direct impact on crypto might be less pronounced, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is crucial for a holistic view of the global financial landscape.

Today, we delve into a critical forecast for the USD/JPY currency pair, a key indicator in the global Forex arena. Leading financial institution UOB Group has released its latest analysis, and it’s sending ripples through the Forex market. Are you prepared for the potential shifts in the USD/JPY and what does it mean for broader market sentiment? Let’s explore the insights from UOB Group and what traders should anticipate. Why UOB Group’s Forex Analysis Matters for USD/JPY? UOB Group, a respected name in financial analysis, has offered a crucial perspective on the USD/JPY pair. Their recent report suggests that while the US Dollar (USD) might experience some downward pressure against the Japanese Yen (JPY), a significant breach of the major support level at 151.00 is improbable. This analysis isn’t just a shot in the dark; it’s rooted in a detailed evaluation of market momentum and trends. Why should Forex traders and even crypto enthusiasts pay attention to this? Expert Insight: UOB Group’s FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, bring years of experience to the table, making their forecasts highly regarded in the Forex community. Market Direction: Their analysis provides a potential roadmap for USD/JPY movements, helping traders anticipate market direction and adjust their strategies accordingly. Risk Management: Understanding potential support and resistance levels is vital for effective risk management in trading, whether you’re dealing with Forex or cryptocurrencies. According to their latest Forex analysis, the upward momentum for USD/JPY has largely diminished. This signals a potential shift from previous bullish trends, prompting traders to reassess their positions and outlook. But what exactly does this faded momentum mean for the immediate and near-term future of USD/JPY? Decoding the 24-Hour USD/JPY Forecast In their immediate 24-hour outlook, UOB Group analysts highlight a cautious stance. After observing “sharp swings” in the market, they initially anticipated a choppy trading range between 152.00 and 154.00. The actual trading range turned out to be 152.01/153.15, with the USD/JPY closing slightly lower. What are the key takeaways from this short-term Forex analysis? Tentative Downward Momentum: UOB Group notes a “tentative buildup in downward momentum,” suggesting that the immediate pressure might be towards a lower USD/JPY. Support Levels: Crucially, they identify a major support level at 151.00, but believe it’s unlikely to be reached today. An intermediate support level is also noted at 151.60. Resistance Levels: On the upside, resistance is pegged at 152.50. A break above 152.85 would negate the current downward momentum buildup, indicating a potential shift back upwards. For day traders and those closely monitoring short-term Forex fluctuations, these levels are critical. They provide actionable points for setting stop-loss orders and take-profit targets. But what about the bigger picture? Let’s examine the 1-3 week outlook. What’s the 1-3 Week Japanese Yen Outlook? Looking slightly further ahead, UOB Group’s 1-3 week Japanese Yen outlook remains consistent with their previous assessment. They reiterate that the recent upward momentum has largely faded, reinforcing the idea that the bullish run for USD/JPY may be taking a pause. What can traders infer from this medium-term Forex analysis? Range-Bound Trading: The analysts anticipate USD/JPY trading within a defined range of 151.00 to 155.00 for the time being. This suggests a period of consolidation rather than a strong directional move. Faded Upward Momentum: The key message is the “faded upward momentum.” This reinforces the idea that the previous bullish trend is losing steam, and traders should be wary of expecting significant upward movements in the short to medium term. Strategic Implications: For swing traders and those with a slightly longer timeframe, this range-bound forecast suggests strategies focused on trading within the 151.00-155.00 band, rather than chasing breakouts. Understanding these potential ranges is vital for planning trades and managing risk effectively. It suggests a period where careful, range-bound strategies might be more fruitful than aggressive directional bets. Currency Trading in a Range: Strategies for USD/JPY Given UOB Group’s expectation of a 151.00/155.00 range for USD/JPY, what are some effective currency trading strategies that traders can consider? In a range-bound market, several approaches can be particularly useful: Strategy Description Benefits Considerations Range Trading Buying near support (151.00) and selling near resistance (155.00). Capitalizes on predictable price swings within the range. Requires accurate identification of range boundaries; risk of false breakouts. Scalping Making numerous small trades to profit from minor price movements within the range. Potential for frequent small profits; can be less risky per trade. High transaction costs can erode profits; requires constant monitoring. Options Trading Using options strategies like straddles or strangles to profit from range-bound conditions and potential breakouts. Versatile strategies for different range scenarios; defined risk. Complexity; requires a good understanding of options pricing and strategies. It’s crucial to remember that all trading involves risk, and these strategies are not guarantees of profit. Always conduct thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before implementing any trading strategy. Actionable Insights for Forex and Crypto Traders What are the practical takeaways from UOB Group’s USD/JPY forecast for both Forex and cryptocurrency traders? Monitor Key Levels: Keep a close watch on the 151.00 support and 155.00 resistance levels for USD/JPY. These levels can act as potential turning points for price action. Adjust Risk Management: In a range-bound market, consider tightening stop-loss orders and adjusting position sizes to manage risk effectively within the expected trading range. Diversify Strategies: Explore range-bound trading strategies to capitalize on the anticipated market conditions. Consider incorporating scalping or options strategies into your trading plan. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of further updates from UOB Group and other analysts, as market conditions can change rapidly. Real-time news and analysis are crucial for making informed trading decisions. Broader Market Context: Remember that Forex markets can influence cryptocurrency markets and vice versa. Understanding trends in major Forex pairs like USD/JPY can provide valuable context for your crypto trading decisions. Conclusion: Navigating USD/JPY in a Cautious Forex Market UOB Group’s Forex analysis paints a picture of a USD/JPY pair that is unlikely to break below major support at 151.00 in the near term, with upward momentum having faded. The expectation of a 151.00/155.00 trading range suggests a period of consolidation and range-bound price action. For Forex traders, this forecast provides crucial levels and insights for strategy adjustments.

40483102,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129694,1739855290,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Oil Prices Today Under Renewed Pressure – ING Analysis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/oil-prices-today-pressure-ing/,"Cryptocurrency markets often mirror traditional financial markets, and shifts in commodities like oil can signal broader economic trends. Today, oil prices today are facing renewed downward pressure, according to a fresh analysis from ING. This could have ripple effects across various asset classes, including crypto. Let’s dive into the key factors driving this shift in the crude oil market . Why are Oil Prices Under Pressure Right Now? Despite managing a marginal gain last week, the underlying sentiment in the energy market analysis suggests weakening physical market tightness. ING’s commodity analysts, Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey, point to a crucial development: the potential restart of oil exports from Iraq’s Kurdistan region. Here’s a breakdown: Kurdistan Oil Exports Restart: There are increasing suggestions that Kurdistan oil exports could resume as early as March. This could inject approximately 300,000 barrels per day (b/d) into the global market via the Ceyhan pipeline. These exports were halted in early 2023 due to a payment dispute between Iraq and Turkey. Market Reaction: This news has immediately put downward pressure on flat prices this morning. The prospect of increased supply often leads to price corrections in commodity markets. Past Restart Rumors: It’s important to note that this isn’t the first time whispers of export resumption have surfaced. The market remains cautiously optimistic, given previous false alarms. OPEC+ Complications: A restart of Kurdistan oil exports could complicate Iraq’s compliance with OPEC+ output targets. Increased exports would make it harder for Iraq to adhere to agreed production cuts, potentially straining the OPEC+ agreement. Weakening Market Structure: Contango vs. Backwardation To understand the changing dynamics, it’s crucial to grasp the concepts of contango and backwardation in futures markets: Market Structure Definition Market Signal Backwardation Prompt (near-term) futures contracts are more expensive than later-dated contracts. Indicates a tight physical market with strong immediate demand. Contango Prompt futures contracts are cheaper than later-dated contracts. Suggests a well-supplied market, potentially with oversupply or weakening immediate demand. ING highlights that timespreads have weakened significantly since January peaks. While ICE Brent’s prompt spread remains in backwardation, NYMEX WTI’s prompt spread has flipped into a small contango. This shift indicates an easing of tightness in the physical oil market and a potentially changing supply-demand balance. Bearish Speculative Positioning: What Does it Mean? Analyzing positioning data provides insights into market sentiment. The latest data reveals a growing bearish stance among speculators: NYMEX WTI Net Longs Decline: The managed money net long position in NYMEX WTI fell by a significant 18,303 lots WoW to 122,237 lots as of last Tuesday. Fresh Shorts Driving the Move: This decrease was primarily driven by new short positions entering the market, rather than existing longs liquidating. This suggests a proactive bearish outlook. Stable ICE Brent Positioning: In contrast, speculative positioning in ICE Brent saw minimal change, with the net long position slightly reduced by only 569 lots to 289,154 lots. The divergence between WTI and Brent positioning could indicate regional differences in perceived market tightness or speculative interest. However, the overall increase in bearish bets signals a cautious approach to the crude oil market by financial players. Navigating the Volatile Energy Market: Key Takeaways The current landscape of the energy market analysis presents a complex picture. Here are the key takeaways: Supply-Side Sensitivity: Oil prices remain highly sensitive to supply-side developments, as evidenced by the reaction to potential Kurdistan oil exports resumption. Market Structure Shift: The weakening timespreads and contango in WTI suggest a potential shift from a tight to a more balanced or even oversupplied market. Bearish Sentiment: Speculative positioning indicates growing bearish sentiment, particularly in WTI, which could amplify downward price movements. OPEC+ Watch: The evolving situation with Iraq and OPEC+ output targets will be crucial to monitor. Any signs of discord or overproduction within the alliance could further pressure prices. Conclusion: Bracing for Potential Oil Price Swings For cryptocurrency investors and traders, understanding the dynamics of the oil prices today and broader commodity markets is essential. The current pressures on oil, driven by potential supply increases and shifting market sentiment, highlight the interconnectedness of global financial markets. Keep a close watch on energy market analysis updates and OPEC+ output decisions as these factors will likely continue to influence crude oil market volatility in the coming weeks. The potential resumption of Kurdistan oil exports is a key catalyst to watch closely.

40483314,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129800,1739855740,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Resilient Gold Price Climbs Above $2,900 Amid Geopolitical Jitters",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gold-price-geopolitical-fed/,"In a week that began with a sense of calm, Gold has shown remarkable resilience, bouncing back above the $2,900 mark. After a slight stumble on Friday, the precious metal is once again capturing investor attention. Even with US markets taking a break for President’s Day, the financial world remains keenly focused on movements in the Gold price , especially as geopolitical undercurrents and Federal Reserve commentary keep traders on their toes. Why is the Gold Price Showing Strength Today? The early part of the week is witnessing Gold price recovery, currently trading above $2,900. This upward tick follows Friday’s dip, indicating underlying strength in the market. While the US observes President’s Day, the Federal Reserve remains active, with a trio of speakers scheduled to deliver insights. Despite a relatively quiet macroeconomic calendar, these Fed speeches, combined with persistent geopolitical uncertainties, are injecting volatility into the markets. Over the weekend, the global stage was set with significant geopolitical developments. A high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia to discuss the Ukraine conflict has grabbed headlines. Notably, neither Ukraine nor European representatives are slated to participate in these discussions, adding another layer of complexity to the situation. These geopolitical factors are crucial drivers influencing the Gold price as investors seek stability amidst uncertainty. Geopolitics in Focus: How are Tensions Affecting Gold? Market participants are closely monitoring potential new developments regarding President Trump’s tariff plans. The anticipation of reciprocal tariffs could escalate global trade tensions, further bolstering Gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset . Reports from Bloomberg suggest that levies on automobiles could be implemented as early as April 2nd, adding to the apprehension in the market. Adding another dimension to the financial landscape, Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed incorporating Bitcoin into US reserves. This suggestion, highlighting Bitcoin’s blockchain transparency and accessibility, signals a potential shift in how digital assets might be viewed alongside traditional safe havens like Gold. While still in its proposal stage, this development underscores the evolving nature of safe-haven asset discussions and could, in the future, see Bitcoin and Gold competing or coexisting as hedges against economic uncertainties. Federal Reserve Speakers in the Spotlight: What to Expect? Despite the US holiday, the Federal Reserve is keeping a busy schedule with multiple speakers addressing various forums today: 14:30 GMT: Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker will speak on the economic outlook at the Central Banking Series Conference in the Bahamas. 15:20 GMT: Fed Governor Michelle W. Bowman will provide remarks on the economy and bank regulation at the American Bankers Association Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. 23:00 GMT: Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller will discuss the economic outlook at the UNSW Macroeconomic Workshop in Sydney, Australia. These speeches will be closely analyzed for any hints about future monetary policy and the Fed’s perspective on the current economic landscape. Any signals regarding interest rate paths or inflation concerns from these speakers could significantly impact market sentiment and, consequently, the Gold price . Technical Analysis of Gold: Navigating Calm Waters? Technical analysis indicates that Gold has successfully recovered above the $2,900 level after Friday’s nearly 1.5% decline. However, the US bond market closure for President’s Day might lead to thinner trading volumes, potentially exaggerating price movements. Traders should remain vigilant for headlines concerning Ukraine and any new tariff announcements, as these could inject volatility into what might otherwise be a calmer trading day. Key technical levels to watch for Gold (XAU/USD) include: Support Levels Resistance Levels S1: $2,859 R1: $2,922 S2: $2,836 R2: $2,962 Significant Support: $2,790 (October 31, 2024 high) Psychological Resistance: $3,000 The Daily Pivot point stands at $2,899, which is the immediate level Gold needs to maintain to sustain its upward momentum. Breaking through the R1 resistance at $2,922 would pave the way for further gains, with the $3,000 psychological barrier as the next major target. Conversely, failure to hold above the Daily Pivot could see Gold test the S1 support at $2,859. Gold FAQs: Unveiling the Yellow Metal’s Appeal Why the Enduring Fascination with Gold? Gold’s allure stretches back through human history, serving as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Beyond its aesthetic appeal and use in jewelry, Gold is predominantly viewed as a safe-haven asset . In times of economic or geopolitical turmoil, investors flock to Gold for its perceived stability and wealth preservation qualities. Its inherent value, independent of any single issuer or government, also positions it as a hedge against inflation and currency depreciation. Who are the Major Gold Accumulators? Central banks are the largest holders of Gold reserves globally. They strategically employ Gold to bolster their currencies during turbulent periods. Diversifying reserves with Gold is seen as a way to enhance the perceived strength of a nation’s economy and currency. Substantial Gold reserves can instill confidence in a country’s financial stability and solvency. Data from the World Gold Council reveals that central banks collectively added a staggering 1,136 tonnes of Gold to their reserves in 2022, valued at approximately $70 billion. This marks the highest annual purchase volume since record-keeping began. Emerging economies, particularly China, India, and Turkey, are leading the charge in increasing their Gold reserves. Decoding Gold’s Correlation with Other Assets Gold typically exhibits an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, both of which are also considered major reserve and safe-haven assets . When the US Dollar weakens, Gold prices tend to rise, offering investors and central banks a diversification avenue during volatile times. This inverse relationship is a cornerstone of portfolio diversification strategies. Furthermore, Gold often moves in opposition to risk assets. A bullish stock market tends to exert downward pressure on Gold price , as investors shift towards higher-yield investments. Conversely, market sell-offs in riskier asset classes often drive investors towards Gold, boosting its price as a safe haven. What Factors Drive Gold Price Fluctuations? A multitude of factors can influence Gold price movements. Geopolitical instability, escalating conflicts, or fears of severe economic recessions can trigger rapid increases in Gold prices due to its safe-haven status. As a non-yielding asset, Gold tends to benefit from lower interest rate environments, as the opportunity cost of holding Gold diminishes compared to interest-bearing investments. Conversely, rising interest rates typically weigh on Gold prices, making yield-generating assets more attractive. However, the US Dollar’s performance is arguably the most significant determinant of Gold price fluctuations, given that Gold is priced in USD (XAU/USD). A strong US Dollar generally acts as a headwind for Gold, keeping its price in check. Conversely, a weaker Dollar tends to propel Gold prices upwards, making it relatively cheaper for investors holding other currencies.

Backed by investments from Ripple Eco Fund and Futureverse, Doppler Finance is positioned to drive the growth of DeFi on XRP. Real Vision’s Raoul Pal reacted positively to the news, explaining that as more applications like DeFi are built on top of XRP, the network’s overall value will increase. In an interview with The Paul Barron Network, Pal said that the XRP Ledger’s potential is amplified when more use cases are developed, noting that the lack of practical use had previously limited its market impact. “The more that’s built on top of XRP, the more value will be created,” Pal stated. He added that as more users begin utilizing XRP in different applications, the network’s value will grow, transforming it into something much larger than its original purpose. Pal also said, “So XRP is in an exalted situation because there are a lot of holders, but the activity was, you know, under pressure because of regulation and lawsuits.” He explained that the XRP Ledger has some reasonable use, but if new applications like DeFi are built on top of it, the value can only increase if people start using it more. Doppler Finance’s success, combined with the recent emergence of XRP stablecoins gaining market share, suggests that the ecosystem is beginning to see substantial growth. While it remains early in the development of DeFi on XRP, the potential for increased exposure and network value looks promising, paving the way for future applications and growth.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|WALLET|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-18 05:16:59

For crypto traders watching broader economic trends, the movement of currency pairs like USD/CNH can offer valuable insights. Recent analysis from UOB Group suggests a potentially significant shift in the USD/CNH exchange rate, signaling opportunities and risks for those tracking global finance. Is a Further Dip Expected for USD/CNH? According to a recent report by UOB Group’s FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, the US Dollar (USD) against the Chinese Yuan (CNH) is showing signs of further weakness. Their analysis points to a potential dip below the 7.2500 level before any significant stabilization occurs. This forecast is crucial for anyone involved in Forex trading or monitoring global currency movements, and particularly relevant for crypto investors who understand the interconnectedness of traditional and digital financial markets. The UOB Group’s analysis hinges on a key technical level: 7.2800. As long as the USD remains below this threshold against the Chinese Yuan, the analysts believe the downward pressure will persist. Furthermore, their longer-term momentum indicators suggest a possible decline towards a major support level at 7.2300. Let’s break down the key points of their analysis: Key Resistance Level: 7.2800 USD/CNH Potential Downward Target: Below 7.2500, with major support at 7.2300 Driving Force: Increased downward momentum in the USD/CNH pair Decoding the 24-Hour Forex Forecast for USD/CNH In their 24-hour outlook, UOB Group highlighted the sharp drop in USD/CNH to 7.2685 last Thursday. Following a slight rebound to 7.2785 on Friday, their initial assessment pointed to a potential dip below the 7.2685 low, provided that the pair stayed below 7.2950. Interestingly, they initially deemed the 7.2500 support level as unlikely to be tested. However, market action proved surprising. USD/CNH surged to 7.2904 before unexpectedly plunging, almost reaching the 7.2500 mark, hitting a low of 7.2512. This dramatic price action has led to a significant surge in downward momentum. UOB Group’s updated 24-hour view is now more bearish. They state that “as long as USD remains below 7.2800 (minor resistance at 7.2710), it could dip below 7.2500 before stabilisation is likely.” While they previously considered the 7.2300 major support level distant, the increased momentum suggests it could become a more relevant target in the near term. Here’s a summary of the 24-hour outlook: Aspect UOB Group 24-Hour View Key Resistance 7.2800 (Minor: 7.2710) Potential Dip Below 7.2500 Stabilization Likely after dipping below 7.2500 Major Support (Previously Unlikely, Now More Relevant) 7.2300 1-3 Weeks Forex Forecast: Is a Sustained Decline in USD/CNH Imminent? Looking at the 1-3 weeks horizon, UOB Group’s prior analysis from February 14th (when USD/CNH spot was at 7.2785) acknowledged growing downward momentum. However, they initially cautioned that it wasn’t strong enough to confirm a sustained decline. Their condition for a continued downtrend was a clear break and hold below the 7.2500 level. They also noted that the probability of breaching 7.2500 would increase as long as USD/CNH remained below 7.3070. The subsequent market movement saw USD/CNH drop to 7.2512. While a definitive break below 7.2500 hasn’t been established yet, the analysts emphasize that the increased momentum now suggests a potential decline towards the next major support level at 7.2300. Furthermore, they have adjusted the “strong resistance” level downwards from 7.3070 to 7.2960. Key takeaways for the 1-3 week Forex forecast include: Increased Downward Momentum: Suggests potential for further decline. Key Level to Watch: 7.2500 – Break below needed for sustained decline. Next Major Support: 7.2300 – Increasingly likely target. Strong Resistance (Adjusted Lower): 7.2960. Actionable Insights for Forex and Crypto Traders What does this Forex forecast mean for traders, especially those in the cryptocurrency space? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor 7.2800 Resistance: For USD/CNH, the 7.2800 level is crucial. Sustained trading below this level reinforces the bearish outlook. Watch for Break Below 7.2500: A clear break and hold below 7.2500 could trigger further downside towards 7.2300. Consider CNH Strength: A weaker USD/CNH might indicate relative strength in the Chinese Yuan. This can have broader implications for Asian markets and potentially impact cryptocurrency flows in the region. Diversification and Risk Management: Forex market volatility, as highlighted by the unexpected plunge, underscores the importance of diversification and robust risk management strategies in all trading activities, including crypto. Stay Updated: Market conditions can change rapidly. Regularly review updated Forex analysis and news from reputable sources like UOB Group to stay informed and adapt your strategies accordingly. In Conclusion: Navigating Forex Uncertainty UOB Group’s Forex analysis presents a compelling case for potential further weakness in USD/CNH, with a dip below 7.2500 considered likely before stabilization. The increased downward momentum and adjusted resistance levels signal a shift in the short-term outlook. For Forex traders and crypto market participants alike, understanding these currency dynamics is vital for informed decision-making and risk management in today’s interconnected global financial landscape. Keep a close watch on the Chinese Yuan and USD/CNH movements as these forecasts unfold.

Within hours, LIBRA, the token he promoted, skyrocketed to a $4.5 billion market cap, only to crash soon after. Accusations of insider trading, market manipulation, and financial fraud have now taken center stage, raising serious concerns about the project’s legitimacy. Shocking Insider Revelations The controversy took a turn when former Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner accused Milei of promoting a scam that led to massive losses for retail investors while insiders walked away with millions. Although Milei denied any wrongdoing, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence uncovered clear evidence of insider trading. According to Arkham, a wallet that sniped $1 million of TRUMP meme coin at launch later turned its profits into LIBRA, purchasing $5 million worth of tokens immediately after Milei promoted it. This wallet had a history of buying tokens early and selling them for huge profits, raising suspicions of planned market manipulation.

According to Kobeissi, the scandal deepened when Investigative YouTuber Coffeezilla exposed Hayden Davis, CEO of Kelsier Ventures, a key insider in the LIBRA launch, personally made over $110 million. In comparison, ordinary investors saw $4.4 billion wiped out. Davis admitted in an interview that he and his team used insider knowledge to manipulate liquidity, control prices, and maximize profits. Further investigation revealed that Davis was also involved in Melania Trump’s meme coin . Blockchain data revealed direct links between LIBRA and MELANIA insiders. One wallet, DEfcyK, which played a major role in LIBRA, cashed out $87.4 million at the exact market peak, right before the crash. However, KIP Protocol, a Web3 company involved in the scandal has denied such claims. KIP stated that it joined the LIBRA project only after the token’s launch. Its role was limited to managing the selection of funded tech projects and providing technical infrastructure for AI initiatives. Selective Refunds and More Questions A bizarre twist emerged when Barstool Sports’ Dave Portnoy revealed that Davis refunded him $5 million in losses. This led to speculation about preferential treatment for high-profile investors. Davis justified his actions, claiming that if he didn’t take advantage of the situation, someone else would, exposing the reckless greed behind the scandal. Davis proposed three possible solutions for the $110 million he still holds: donating it to an Argentine nonprofit, refunding investors, or injecting it back into LIBRA to revive the token. However, investors fear this could be another manipulation attempt. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Argentina’s Javier Milei Faces Fraud Charges After LIBRA Crypto Rug Pull Scandal , The Impact on the Memecoin Market This scandal has shaken investor confidence in the memecoin sector. LIBRA’s collapse has highlighted the risks of investing in influencer-backed cryptocurrencies, especially when insiders have the power to manipulate price movements. With Davis openly admitting to multiple securities law violations, legal action may be imminent. Whether or not authorities intervene, this case serves as a wake-up call for crypto investors: not all hype is worth chasing, and the memecoin space remains a high-risk, high-reward battlefield where the biggest winners are often those who control the game. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Like a coiled spring, WTI futures are holding just above the $70 mark, as investors worldwide hold their breath for any signs of progress from the anticipated Russia-Ukraine peace talks. Will these talks bring relief to global energy prices, or will the oil market continue its volatile dance? Let’s dive into the factors influencing this crucial commodity. Why is WTI Trading Cautiously? The primary driver behind the current cautious sentiment in the oil market is the prospect of peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. News of a potential truce, spurred by discussions involving former US President Donald Trump, has injected a dose of uncertainty into the market. Here’s why: Trump’s Announcement: President Trump’s statement about “productive” conversations with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders regarding peace talks has been a significant catalyst. His directive to his team to initiate these discussions has raised hopes for a potential resolution to the prolonged conflict. Anticipated Impact of Peace: Market analysts, like those at Philip Nova, anticipate that successful peace negotiations could lead to a surge in Russian oil supply to the global market. This influx of supply would naturally exert downward pressure on crude oil prices . Geopolitical Sensitivity: The Russia-Ukraine conflict has been a major geopolitical factor influencing oil prices. Any movement towards de-escalation is closely monitored by traders and investors, leading to cautious trading strategies. OPEC’s Role in Stabilizing Oil Prices While peace talks are weighing on potential price decreases, another significant factor is providing some support to WTI and broader oil prices: OPEC’s potential decision to delay planned supply increases. OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) , along with its allies known as OPEC+, plays a crucial role in managing global oil supply. Here’s how their decisions impact the market: Supply Management: OPEC+ countries collectively decide on oil production quotas. These quotas are adjusted to balance global supply and demand, influencing prices. Planned Supply Increase Delay: Recent reports suggest OPEC is considering delaying its planned monthly supply increases, initially slated for April. This potential delay is seen as a move to prevent a price collapse amidst potential increased supply from Russia, offering temporary support to current price levels. Trump’s Pressure vs. OPEC’s Strategy: This potential delay contradicts previous calls from President Trump for Saudi Arabia to boost oil output. OPEC’s independent decision highlights their strategic approach to managing the oil market , balancing geopolitical pressures with market stability. Brent Crude Oil FAQs: Understanding the Benchmark To better understand the dynamics of the oil market , it’s helpful to understand benchmarks like Brent Crude Oil. Let’s address some frequently asked questions: What is Brent Crude Oil? Brent Crude Oil is a key benchmark for international oil prices, sourced from the North Sea. It’s categorized as ‘light’ and ‘sweet’ due to its properties, making it ideal for refining into valuable products like gasoline. Key features include: Benchmark Status: It sets the reference price for roughly two-thirds of globally traded oil. ‘Light and Sweet’ Qualities: High gravity and low sulfur content simplify refining. Reliable Supply: North Sea infrastructure ensures consistent production and transportation. What Factors Drive the Price of Brent Crude Oil? Several factors influence Crude Oil Prices , including: Supply and Demand Dynamics: Global economic growth fuels demand, while recessions dampen it. Geopolitical Instability: Wars, political unrest, and sanctions disrupt supply chains. OPEC Decisions: Production quotas set by OPEC significantly impact supply. US Dollar Value: As oil is dollar-denominated, a weaker dollar can make oil cheaper for buyers using other currencies, potentially increasing demand and vice versa. How Does Inventory Data Impact the Price of Brent Crude Oil? Weekly inventory reports provide insights into supply and demand balance. Key points to consider: Inventory Reports: American Petroleum Institute (API) and Energy Information Agency (EIA) reports are closely watched. Decreasing Inventories: Indicate higher demand, typically pushing prices up. Increasing Inventories: Suggest higher supply or lower demand, potentially lowering prices. EIA vs. API: EIA data is generally considered more reliable due to its governmental source, though both reports usually align closely. How Does OPEC Influence the Price of Brent Crude Oil? OPEC’s influence is substantial through production quotas. Here’s how: Production Quotas: OPEC sets quotas for member countries, adjusting supply levels. Lower Quotas: Reduce supply, generally leading to higher prices. Higher Quotas: Increase supply, typically leading to lower prices. OPEC+: Includes non-OPEC members like Russia, amplifying the group’s influence on global supply and Crude Oil Prices . Navigating the Uncertain Oil Market The current oil market is a complex interplay of geopolitical events and supply-side management. The anticipation of Russia-Ukraine peace talks introduces a bearish element, while OPEC’s potential supply adjustments aim to provide a bullish counterforce. Investors are advised to remain vigilant, closely monitoring developments in both peace negotiations and OPEC announcements to navigate these uncertain times effectively.

This week’s trading sessions are dominated by investor anxiety as they dissect the potential ramifications of former US President Donald Trump’s revived threats of tariffs on Eurozone imports. Will these Trump tariffs derail the Euro’s recent gains against the US Dollar ? Let’s dive into the factors influencing this crucial currency pair and what it means for traders. EUR/USD Grapples with Resistance Amid Tariff Fears The EUR/USD exchange rate is finding it difficult to decisively breach the psychological resistance level of 1.0500. This hesitation stems from a cloud of uncertainty surrounding the US Dollar’s near-term direction, coupled with renewed concerns about trade relations between the US and the Eurozone . Adding to the complexity, European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker Fabio Panetta recently voiced concerns about inflation potentially undershooting the ECB’s 2% target. This dovish stance from a key ECB official further muddies the waters for the Euro’s outlook. The immediate trigger for the current market unease is Donald Trump’s announcement on Friday regarding his intention to impose tariffs on imported vehicles, slated for around April 2nd. These Trump tariffs , with reciprocal measures expected, have sent ripples through the Forex market, particularly impacting the EUR/USD pair. Eurozone Under Tariff Threat: Key Impacts Market analysts anticipate that these potential levies will disproportionately affect major car exporters to the US, including: Germany Japan South Korea Data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) highlights Germany’s significant exposure, with vehicle exports to the US valued at $24.3 billion in 2023. This substantial figure underscores the potential economic impact on the Eurozone’s largest economy. ECB’s Dovish Stance: Inflation Concerns in the Eurozone Despite the looming threat of Trump tariffs , ECB’s Fabio Panetta suggests a potentially limited or even slightly negative impact on Eurozone inflation. His analysis is based on several key assumptions: Euro Weakness: Tariffs and retaliatory measures could weaken the Euro. Global Slowdown: A broader economic slowdown would counteract inflationary pressures. China Dumping: China might redirect goods affected by US tariffs into European markets, further suppressing inflation. Panetta emphasized the more pressing risk for the Eurozone as “inflation falling below the 2% target over the medium term,” signaling a continued dovish monetary policy approach from the ECB. Euro Price Movements Today Let’s examine the Euro’s performance against other major currencies today: USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD 0.12% -0.11% -0.48% 0.07% -0.23% -0.30% 0.17% EUR -0.12% -0.07% -0.64% 0.05% -0.26% -0.32% 0.15% GBP 0.11% 0.07% -0.46% 0.12% -0.14% -0.25% 0.22% JPY 0.48% 0.64% 0.46% 0.54% 0.28% 0.38% 0.62% CAD -0.07% -0.05% -0.12% -0.54% -0.27% -0.37% 0.11% AUD 0.23% 0.26% 0.14% -0.28% 0.27% -0.06% 0.41% NZD 0.30% 0.32% 0.25% -0.38% 0.37% 0.06% 0.47% CHF -0.17% -0.15% -0.22% -0.62% -0.11% -0.41% -0.47% The table shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. Base currency is picked from the left, quote currency from the top. US Dollar’s Temporary Stability: A Pause in Downward Trend? The recent upside attempts in EUR/USD are facing headwinds as the US Dollar appears to have found some temporary stability. After hitting a fresh two-month low on Friday, the US Dollar Index (DXY) is currently hovering around 106.80. Friday’s sharp sell-off in the US Dollar was triggered by disappointing US Retail Sales data for January, which contracted by 0.9%, significantly worse than the expected 0.1% decline. This weak data initially fueled expectations of a less hawkish Federal Reserve, weakening the US Dollar . However, the market’s focus quickly shifted back to the potential Trump tariffs . While investors initially anticipated immediate details of reciprocal tariffs following Trump’s social media activity, the lack of concrete plans has injected a degree of caution, providing some respite for the US Dollar . Federal Reserve and Economic Data in Focus Looking ahead, the US Dollar’s direction will be heavily influenced by speeches from various Federal Reserve officials this week. Their commentary will be crucial in shaping expectations regarding future monetary policy. Furthermore, traders will be closely watching the preliminary S&P Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data for February, scheduled for release on Friday, for further clues about the US economic outlook. Technical Outlook for EUR/USD : Key Levels to Watch From a technical perspective, EUR/USD is struggling to overcome the 1.0500 resistance level. Despite this struggle, the pair maintains a bullish bias as it remains above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around 1.0430. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching 60.00, suggesting building bullish momentum. A sustained RSI reading above 60.00 could signal a stronger upside move. Key technical levels to monitor include: Support: February 10 low at 1.0285 Resistance: December 6 high at 1.0630 Retail Sales Data: Understanding its Impact The US Retail Sales data, released monthly by the US Census Bureau, is a critical economic indicator. It measures the total receipts of retail and food stores in the United States, providing insights into consumer spending, a major driver of the US economy. Key takeaways about Retail Sales data: Frequency: Monthly Source: US Census Bureau Indicator Type: Leading indicator of consumer spending Market Impact: Strong readings are generally bullish for the US Dollar , while weak readings are bearish. While strong retail sales typically boost the US Dollar , it’s important to consider external factors that can distort the data. Furthermore, the Retail Sales Control Group component is closely watched as it feeds into Personal Consumption Expenditure estimates, further amplifying its market significance. Conclusion: Navigating the Forex Turbulence The EUR/USD pair finds itself at a critical juncture, caught between Trump tariffs threats and fluctuating US Dollar sentiment. While Eurozone faces potential headwinds from trade tensions, the ECB’s dovish stance adds another layer of complexity. Forex traders must remain vigilant, closely monitoring economic data releases, central bank communications, and geopolitical developments to navigate this period of uncertainty and capitalize on potential trading opportunities.

In other words, bitcoin’s volatility has compressed enormously. According to Glassnode data, the 2-week realized volatility, which provides of how turbulent the asset was in the past two weeks, measures volatility over the past two weeks annually, has dropped to an annualized 32%, one of the lowest levels in years. In addition, the options implied one-month volatility, which is the market’s expectation for volatility over four weeks, has slipped below annualized 50%, again one of the lowest levels in years. To put into context how much bitcoin has been in this sideways consolidation, consider what analyst Checkmate calls is the “Choppiness Index”. The data shows that bitcoin, on a weekly time frame, based on its choppiness, is at its highest level since 2015, which shows how tight this trading range has been. Volatility tends to mean-reverting, meaning an unusually stable market often paves the way for a big move in either direction and vice versa. The longer and tighter the consolidation, the violent the eventual volatility explosion.

Binance Opens Community Vote for Pi Coin Binance’s decision to launch a community vote is unusual, as the exchange rarely seeks public opinion on token listings. The move comes amid growing hype surrounding Pi Network, which has positioned itself as a major player in the crypto space. Binance announced that the vote aims to hear from its global user base, stating, “We have been listening to the vibrant discussions within our community about Pi Network. To ensure users’ voices are heard, Binance is launching a Community Vote.” How To & Who Can Vote? To take part in the voting process, users must be logged into their verified Binance accounts and hold at least 5 USD worth of assets. Each eligible user can cast one vote, choosing either “Yes” or “No” on whether Pi Coin should be listed. However, the voting runs from February 17, 2025, to February 27, 2025, and votes must be cast on Binance Square’s official post. Votes will be tracked daily, but Binance has stated that only valid votes will be counted, meaning users must maintain the minimum $5 balance throughout the voting period. Any votes that violate terms and conditions will be removed before the final results are announced. Early Voting Results Favor Pi Coin With just a few days into the voting, the Pi Network community has shown overwhelming support for a Binance listing . So far, 88% of voters support the listing, while only 12% oppose it. More than 2 million votes have already been cast, and engagement continues to rise as the deadline approaches. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Big News: Binance Rejects ‘Sale’ Rumors, Claims Smear Campaign by Rival Exchanges , Will Pi Coin Be Listed on Binance?

Binance confirmed that Pi Coin is still under review and will only be listed if it meets the exchange’s strict requirements. For now, Pi supporters will have to wait and see if the listing becomes a reality. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

40483573,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129804,1739856278,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Week for Pound Sterling: Navigating UK Inflation and Labor Market Uncertainty,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pound-sterling-uk-data-uncertainty/,"Are you keeping a close watch on the Pound Sterling (GBP)? This week is shaping up to be a pivotal one for the British currency as the UK is set to release key labor market and inflation data. Investors are holding their breath, and for good reason. These figures could significantly influence the Bank of England’s (BoE) future decisions on interest rates and shape the trajectory of the GBP/USD pair. Let’s dive into what’s expected and why it matters for your trading strategy. Why is the UK Labor Market Data in Focus? The UK labor market is under intense scrutiny. Why? Because recent signals suggest a potential slowdown, and this could be a game-changer for the UK economy. Remember Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ Autumn Budget announcement about increasing employer’s National Insurance contributions? That decision seems to have cast a shadow over private sector hiring. Hiring Slowdown: Post-announcement, the pace of hiring has noticeably decreased, indicating business owners’ unease. Job Additions Decline: In the three months to November, only 35,000 jobs were added, a stark contrast to the robust 173,000 in the preceding August-October period. BoE’s Concerns: Even Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has acknowledged “some softness” in the labor market, reinforcing expectations of a cooling job sector. All eyes are now on the upcoming UK labor market report for the three months ending in December. The forecast? The ILO Unemployment Rate is expected to nudge up to 4.5% from 4.4%. But that’s not the only figure traders are watching… Average Earnings: Will Wage Growth Fuel UK Inflation Data? Wage growth is the elephant in the room when it comes to UK inflation data. It’s been a major driver of persistent price pressures, especially in the service sector. The Average Earnings data, both including and excluding bonuses, is projected to show a robust acceleration to 5.9%, up from 5.6% previously. What does this mean? Inflationary Pressure: Strong wage growth could signal that inflationary pressures are proving stickier than hoped. BoE’s Dilemma: The Bank of England has already indicated potential near-term inflation acceleration due to energy prices. High wage growth would compound this concern. Stagflation Risk: A combination of softening employment and high inflation expectations fueled by wages raises the specter of stagflation – a challenging economic scenario. Later this week, the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Sales data will further paint the picture of the UK economy. These releases are slated for Wednesday and Friday, respectively, and are crucial for gauging the overall economic health. Pound Sterling (GBP) vs. US Dollar (USD): Navigating Sideways Trading In recent trading sessions, the Pound Sterling has been trading somewhat sideways against the US Dollar. The GBP/USD pair is hovering around the 1.2600 mark, showing resilience despite a struggling US Dollar Index (DXY). Factors influencing the GBP/USD: USD Weakness: The US Dollar is currently on the defensive, partly due to improved market sentiment. Trade War Fears Ease: A temporary reprieve from immediate global trade war anxieties, thanks to a delay in US President Trump’s tariff implementation, has boosted risk assets. US Inflation Data: Despite hotter-than-expected US CPI and PPI data last week, the market mood remains relatively buoyant. However, it’s worth noting that Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Lorie Logan has reiterated caution regarding interest rate cuts, emphasizing the need for patience and data observation. Geopolitical factors and potential shifts in US economic policy under President Trump are also on the Fed’s radar. Technical Outlook for GBP/USD: Key Levels to Watch From a technical analysis perspective, the Pound Sterling is currently testing key resistance levels. Key Technical Points: Fibonacci Retracement: GBP/USD is attempting to decisively break above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level around 1.2620. Bullish Momentum: Holding above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at approximately 1.2500 suggests a bullish near-term outlook. RSI Indicator: The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is climbing above 60.00, indicating strengthening bullish momentum if sustained. Support Zone: The February 3 low of 1.2250 stands as a significant support level. Resistance Zone: On the upside, the 50% Fibonacci retracement at 1.2767 presents a key resistance barrier. What’s Next for the Pound Sterling? The direction of the Pound Sterling hinges significantly on the upcoming UK economic data releases. Key Takeaways: Labor Market Data Impact: Weaker-than-expected labor market figures could pressure the Pound Sterling, signaling a potential economic slowdown and influencing BoE’s rate decisions. Inflation Data Significance: Strong inflation data, particularly driven by wage growth, could support the Pound Sterling but also raise concerns about persistent price pressures and stagflation. GBP/USD Trading Range: Expect continued volatility in the GBP/USD pair as traders react to the data and reassess the outlook for both the UK and US economies. This week is packed with crucial data points that will provide vital clues about the health of the UK economy and the future path of the Pound Sterling.

His initial assessment in September 2024 suggested that XRP was poised for a major shift against Ethereum. In February 2025, his latest analysis reinforces this perspective, asserting that XRP has begun flipping ETH, indicating further upward movement. Here is the #XRP / #ETH pair update. XRP started flipping Ether; take it or leave it. Massive Success is on its way. https://t.co/BqLdbA7v6f pic.twitter.com/6LIs133QJZ — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) February 16, 2025 XRP’s Chances of Surpassing ETH Dark Defender’s September 2024 analysis highlighted a key technical development in the XRP/ETH market. He pointed out that XRP had been in a six-year downtrend, but a crucial breakout had occurred, signaling a potential reversal. The chart from September showed XRP breaking above a long-term descending resistance line, a key technical indicator suggesting bullish momentum. At the time, he confidently stated, “We have waited for this moment for six years. XRP will flip ETH.” His analysis suggested that XRP had reached a long-term support level and was set to outperform Ethereum in the coming months. Other experts like Ben “Bitboy” Armstrong have been predicting since 2024 that XRP will flip ETH . Dark Defender’s projection showed an upward trajectory, with expectations of continued growth against the current second-largest digital asset. The Updated Analysis Dark Defender’s February 2025 update builds on his September 2024 forecast. According to his latest assessment, XRP has now started the process of surpassing Ethereum in relative performance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He states, “XRP started flipping Ether; take it or leave it. Massive success is on its way.” His latest chart presents a stronger bullish outlook, illustrating a continued rally with higher targets. The chart displays a clear five-wave Elliott Wave structure, with XRP entering an extended third wave, which is often associated with the strongest price movement in a trend. The first target in the chart is the Fibonacci 361.8% level, which would put XRP at $5.85 . Dark Defender has previously predicted this target, and it is the first step on XRP’s path to surpassing Ethereum. Following that, Dark Defender expects the digital asset to reach as high as $18.22. XRP is currently trading at $2.69, and a recent analysis shows that if it can hit approximately $6.7 , it would surpass ETH’s market cap. With Ethereum constantly failing to build bullish momentum, XRP could surpass it very soon and become the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market.

As US markets take a breather for President’s Day, the Dollar Index (DXY) is in a holding pattern, awaiting signals from geopolitical developments and upcoming Federal Reserve pronouncements. For crypto traders and investors, understanding the dollar’s movements is vital , as it frequently influences cryptocurrency valuations and trading strategies. Let’s delve into the factors shaping the US Dollar’s direction this week. Decoding US Dollar’s Market Consolidation The US Dollar Index (DXY), a benchmark for the dollar’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, is currently navigating sideways around the 106.80 mark. This market consolidation follows recent losses, indicating a period of indecision as traders assess the landscape. Several factors are contributing to this pause: President’s Day Holiday: With US bond markets closed for President’s Day, trading volumes are lighter, contributing to the subdued price action in the US Dollar. Geopolitical Uncertainty: All eyes are fixed on Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where US and Russian officials are meeting. Discussions are anticipated to revolve around potential breakthroughs concerning the Ukraine conflict, a situation with significant global economic ramifications. Economic Data Pause: Following last week’s concerning US Retail Sales data, which pointed to slowing economic growth, the economic calendar is relatively quiet until Friday’s S&P Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data. This lull leaves traders seeking alternative catalysts. Federal Reserve Speakers: Despite the holiday, three Federal Reserve policymakers are scheduled to speak. Their remarks could offer insights into the Fed’s current thinking on monetary policy and the economic outlook, potentially injecting volatility into the Forex market. Riyadh’s Geopolitical Stage: A Potential Catalyst for Forex Markets The meetings in Riyadh are arguably the most significant event on the radar this week. The potential for progress in US-Russia discussions concerning Ukraine is a major point of speculation. A perceived breakthrough could trigger significant market reactions, including in the Forex space. Traders should be prepared for: Headline Risk: News wires could flash updates from Riyadh at any moment, leading to rapid price swings in the US Dollar and related currency pairs. False Dawns: Be wary of premature celebrations of peace. Initial reports might suggest progress, but the reality of a lasting agreement could be more complex and drawn out. Knee-Jerk Reactions: The US Dollar Index (DXY) and other assets could experience sharp, immediate reactions to headlines, followed by potential reversals as the market digests the actual substance of any developments. Federal Reserve’s Voice: Decoding Policymaker Speeches Even with bond markets closed, the Federal Reserve remains influential. Speeches from Fed officials can provide crucial clues about the future path of monetary policy. On Monday, market participants are paying close attention to: Patrick Harker (Philadelphia Fed): Speaking on the economic outlook, Harker’s perspective on growth and inflation will be closely analyzed for hints about future interest rate decisions. Michelle W. Bowman (Fed Governor): Bowman’s remarks on the economy and bank regulation could shed light on the Fed’s concerns regarding financial stability and its approach to balancing inflation control with economic health. Christopher J. Waller (Fed Governor): Waller’s speech on the economic outlook, delivered in Sydney, Australia, will be scrutinized for any divergence in views from other Fed officials and for his assessment of global economic conditions. These speeches occur against a backdrop where the CME FedWatch tool indicates a roughly even split in expectations for interest rates in June – a 46.7% chance of no change. Any hawkish or dovish signals from these speakers could shift these probabilities and impact the US Dollar . Technical Levels for the US Dollar Index (DXY) From a technical analysis perspective, the US Dollar Index (DXY) is at an interesting juncture. With limited market activity on President’s Day, significant price movement may be constrained. However, key levels remain relevant for future trading: Level Significance 107.35 Immediate Resistance (previous support) 107.91 55-day SMA Resistance 108.00 Psychological Resistance 106.52 Support (April 16, 2024 high) 106.40 100-day SMA Support 105.89 Support (June 2024 resistance) 104.93 200-day SMA (Potential Downside Target) The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests there might be room for further downside in the near term. A break below the 106.52 support could open the door to testing lower levels, potentially even the 200-day SMA at 104.93. Understanding the US Dollar: Key FAQs for Crypto Traders For cryptocurrency traders, grasping the fundamentals of the US Dollar is essential. Here are some frequently asked questions: What is the US Dollar? The US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States and a globally dominant currency. It is the world’s most traded currency, involved in approximately 88% of all foreign exchange transactions. Historically, it was backed by gold until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971. How do Federal Reserve decisions impact the US Dollar? The Federal Reserve (Fed) and its monetary policy are the primary drivers of the US Dollar’s value. The Fed’s dual mandate of price stability and full employment is primarily managed through interest rate adjustments. Raising interest rates typically strengthens the USD to combat inflation, while lowering rates can weaken it to stimulate economic growth. What are Quantitative Easing (QE) and Quantitative Tightening (QT)? Quantitative Easing (QE) is an unconventional monetary policy where the Fed injects liquidity into the financial system by purchasing assets, like government bonds. This often weakens the US Dollar. Quantitative Tightening (QT) is the reverse process, where the Fed reduces its balance sheet, typically by not reinvesting maturing bonds. QT is generally supportive of a stronger US Dollar. Conclusion: Navigating the US Dollar Landscape The US Dollar is currently in a phase of market consolidation , influenced by the President’s Day holiday, geopolitical uncertainties emanating from Riyadh, and the anticipation of further signals from the Federal Reserve. For cryptocurrency traders, monitoring the DXY and understanding the factors driving the dollar’s movements is crucial for informed decision-making. Keep a close watch on headlines from Riyadh and the upcoming Fed speeches, as these events could trigger the next significant move in the Forex markets and potentially ripple through the crypto space.

40483870,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129826,1739856792,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Resilient Gold Price Holds Steady Amid Quiet US Markets: Will Geopolitical Storms Ignite a Surge?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gold-price-us-markets-calm/,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and seasoned investors alike are keeping a close watch on traditional safe-haven assets like Gold Price as markets navigate a week filled with geopolitical uncertainty and key Federal Reserve speeches. With US markets taking a breather for President’s Day, the spotlight shifts to global events and central bank rhetoric to determine the next move for precious metals. Will Gold Price maintain its composure, or are we on the cusp of a significant breakout? Gold Price Calms as US Markets Observe Holiday Gold Price (XAU/USD) began the week on a steady footing, hovering around the $2,900 mark after experiencing a dip on the previous Friday. The absence of US market participants due to President’s Day resulted in a calmer trading environment. However, this tranquility is likely to be punctuated by a series of Federal Reserve speakers and ongoing geopolitical developments, promising a potentially volatile week ahead for Gold Price . Geopolitical Tensions: The Unpredictable Catalyst for Gold Price The weekend was dominated by headlines concerning a proposed meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia to discuss the Ukraine conflict. Notably, neither Ukraine nor European representatives are slated to participate in these discussions, raising eyebrows and fueling geopolitical tensions . Such events often act as a tailwind for Gold Price , as investors seek refuge in safe-haven assets during times of international uncertainty. Key Geopolitical Developments to Watch: Trump-Putin Meeting: Monitor for any breakthroughs or escalations from the Saudi Arabia talks regarding the Ukraine conflict. Global Trade Tensions: Pay attention to updates on President Trump’s tariff plans, especially potential levies on automobiles due as soon as April 2nd, as reported by Bloomberg. These measures could significantly impact global trade and influence Gold Price . Federal Reserve Speakers in Focus: Guiding Interest Rates Outlook Despite the US market holiday, the Federal Reserve remains active, with three key speakers scheduled to deliver remarks throughout Monday. These speeches will be closely scrutinized for any hints regarding the future path of interest rates , a critical factor influencing Gold Price . Federal Reserve Speaker Schedule: Here’s a breakdown of the Fed speakers and their speaking times (GMT): Time (GMT) Speaker Event 14:30 Patrick Harker (Philadelphia Fed President) Economic Outlook Speech, Central Banking Series Conference 15:20 Michelle W. Bowman (Fed Governor) Remarks on Economy & Bank Regulation, ABA Conference 23:00 Christopher J. Waller (Fed Governor) Economic Outlook Speech, UNSW Macroeconomic Workshop Any hawkish signals from these speakers, suggesting potential interest rate hikes, could exert downward pressure on Gold Price . Conversely, dovish tones might provide support or even propel Gold Price higher. US Markets Absence: A Temporary Calm Before the Storm? The closure of US markets for President’s Day contributes to the subdued trading activity in Gold Price . However, this quiet period might be deceptive. The return of US trading on Tuesday could inject fresh volatility into the market, especially as traders react to the overnight news flow and digest the remarks from the Federal Reserve speakers. The direction of US markets heavily influences investor sentiment and risk appetite, which in turn affects the demand for safe-haven assets like Gold. Technical Analysis: Navigating Gold Price Levels From a technical standpoint, Gold Price is attempting to recover above the crucial $2,900 level after Friday’s decline. Traders are closely watching key support and resistance levels to gauge potential trading opportunities. Key Technical Levels for XAU/USD: Support Levels: S1: $2,859 S2: $2,836 Significant Support: $2,790 (October 31, 2024 High) Resistance Levels: Daily Pivot: $2,899 R1: $2,922 R2: $2,962 Psychological Level: $3,000 A sustained move above the Daily Pivot at $2,899 could signal further upside potential, while a break below the S1 support at $2,859 might open the door for deeper corrections. However, the impact of headline risks related to geopolitics and tariff announcements should not be underestimated, as these could override technical levels in the short term. Interest Rates and Gold Price : An Inverse Relationship? Understanding the relationship between interest rates and Gold Price is crucial for investors. Generally, higher interest rates tend to weigh on Gold Price . This is because: Opportunity Cost: Higher interest rates increase the attractiveness of interest-bearing assets (like bonds) compared to non-yielding gold. US Dollar Strength: Rate hikes often strengthen the US Dollar. Since Gold Price is typically denominated in USD, a stronger dollar can make gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially reducing demand and pushing prices down. Conversely, lower or falling interest rates can make gold more appealing as an alternative investment. Senator Lummis and Bitcoin in US Reserves: A Diversification Strategy? In a noteworthy development, Senator Cynthia Lummis suggested adding Bitcoin to the US reserves, emphasizing its transparency and accessibility. While this proposal is still in its early stages, it highlights the growing recognition of cryptocurrencies as alternative assets. If such a proposal gains traction, it could potentially influence investor sentiment towards both Bitcoin and Gold Price , although the immediate impact remains to be seen. Conclusion: Navigating the Week Ahead for Gold Price Gold Price begins the week in a state of calm, primarily due to the US markets holiday. However, this tranquility is likely to be temporary. Geopolitical developments, particularly regarding Ukraine and global trade, coupled with speeches from Federal Reserve officials concerning interest rates , are poised to inject volatility into the market. Traders should closely monitor these factors and key technical levels to navigate the week ahead effectively. The interplay between geopolitical tensions , central bank communication, and US markets activity will be crucial in determining the direction of Gold Price .

Gold is attempting a powerful comeback, hovering around the pivotal $2,900 mark as markets brace for a week dominated by critical geopolitical developments, particularly concerning Ukraine. After a sharp correction last Friday, all eyes are on whether gold can decisively close above this level, potentially paving the way for further upward momentum. This Monday, despite the US markets being closed for President’s Day, the financial world remains active, with a trio of Federal Reserve speakers ready to deliver insights amidst a relatively quiet macroeconomic calendar. The weekend was anything but quiet on the geopolitical front, setting the stage for a volatile week. Let’s delve into the key factors influencing the gold price this week. Geopolitical Tensions and the Gold Price Rally: Is Ukraine the Catalyst? The spotlight is firmly on Ukraine as US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss peace. Notably, neither Ukraine nor European representatives are invited to these crucial talks, adding a layer of complexity and uncertainty. This high-stakes meeting is unfolding as US officials are already on the ground in Riyadh, signaling the seriousness of these discussions. Geopolitical instability is traditionally a tailwind for gold, considered a safe-haven asset. Will developments surrounding Ukraine further fuel the gold price rally? Trade War 2.0 Fears: Another Booster for Gold? Market participants are also keenly awaiting further details on President Trump’s reciprocal tariff plans. The potential for heightened global trade war tensions is looming, especially with reports from Bloomberg suggesting levies on automobiles could be implemented as early as April 2nd. A full-blown trade war can disrupt global supply chains, increase inflation, and inject significant uncertainty into the global economy. In such environments, investors often flock to safe-haven assets like gold, potentially driving up the gold price . Bitcoin Joins the Safe-Haven Race? Senator Lummis Advocates for US Reserves In a noteworthy development, Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed adding Bitcoin to the US reserves, emphasizing the blockchain network’s transparency and accessibility. This suggestion comes as Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a digital gold, offering an alternative safe-haven asset. Could this proposal, if it gains traction, further solidify the appeal of alternative assets like gold and Bitcoin amidst economic and geopolitical uncertainties? While the immediate impact on gold price may be indirect, it signals a broader shift in how safe-haven assets are perceived. Federal Reserve Speakers in Focus: Will They Move the Gold Price Needle? Despite the US bank holiday, the Federal Reserve is active with three speakers scheduled throughout Monday: 14:30 GMT: Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker speaks on the economic outlook. 15:20 GMT: Fed Governor Michelle W. Bowman discusses the economy and bank regulation. 23:00 GMT: Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller provides insights on the economic outlook. While the macroeconomic calendar is light, these speeches could offer clues about the Fed’s stance on inflation and interest rates, which can indirectly influence the gold price . Any hawkish signals could temper gold’s gains, while dovish undertones might provide further support. Technical Analysis: Gold Navigates Key Levels From a technical perspective, gold is showing resilience after Friday’s decline, reclaiming the $2,900 level. However, with US bond markets closed, traders should be cautious and watch for headlines related to Ukraine and potential tariff announcements. Key technical levels to watch are: Support Levels: S1: $2,859 S2: $2,836 Significant Support: $2,790 (October 31, 2024, high) Resistance Levels: Daily Pivot: $2,899 (First level to reclaim) R1: $2,922 (First resistance to overcome) R2: $2,962 Psychological Level: $3,000 A sustained move above the R1 resistance at $2,922 would be a bullish signal, potentially propelling gold towards the $2,962 and then the psychological $3,000 level. Failure to hold above the Daily Pivot at $2,899 could see gold retesting support levels. US-China Trade War FAQs: Understanding the Implications The specter of a renewed trade war between the US and China is casting a long shadow over global markets. To understand the potential impact, let’s address some frequently asked questions: Question Answer What does “trade war” mean? It’s an economic conflict involving trade barriers like tariffs, leading to escalating import costs and a higher cost of living. What is the US-China trade war? An economic dispute that began in 2018 with the US imposing tariffs on China over unfair trade practices. China retaliated, and tensions have fluctuated since. What about “Trade War 2.0”? President Trump’s return and pledge for 60% tariffs on China have ignited fears of a renewed and intensified trade war, potentially disrupting global supply chains and fueling inflation. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty with Gold As geopolitical tensions surrounding Ukraine escalate and trade war fears resurface, gold is attempting to re-establish itself above the crucial $2,900 level. The week ahead is packed with potential catalysts, from peace talks in Saudi Arabia to speeches from Federal Reserve officials. Monitoring these developments closely will be crucial for understanding the future trajectory of the gold price . A successful reclaim of $2,900 could signal a renewed bullish phase for gold, driven by its safe-haven appeal in these uncertain times.

Known for pushing boundaries in large language models (LLMs), Mistral has just unveiled a game-changing innovation: Mistral Saba, a custom-trained model specifically designed for Arabic language and culture. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space watching AI advancements, this regional focus signals a potentially lucrative new direction for AI applications, especially in emerging markets. Let’s dive into why Mistral Saba is making waves and what it means for the future of AI. Why a Regional LLM? The Strategic Vision Behind Mistral’s Arabic Language Model In a world dominated by general-purpose LLMs, Mistral is taking a bold step by focusing on geographical specialization. Mistral Saba, their new Arabic language model , isn’t just another LLM; it’s a strategic move to capture the burgeoning market in Arabic-speaking countries. This approach highlights several key advantages: Enhanced Cultural Relevance: General LLMs, while powerful, may sometimes miss the nuances of specific cultures and languages. Mistral Saba is trained to understand and respond to Arabic content with a deeper level of cultural sensitivity, making interactions feel more natural and relevant. Improved Performance in Target Language: By concentrating on Arabic, Mistral can optimize the model’s architecture and training data for superior performance in this language compared to a general model attempting to handle numerous languages. Market Differentiation: In a crowded AI landscape, specialization is a powerful differentiator. Focusing on the Middle East AI market allows Mistral to carve out a niche and attract customers specifically seeking Arabic language capabilities. This strategic pivot towards regional models could be a pivotal moment in the LLM race, suggesting that the future might be about depth in specific areas rather than breadth across all languages and cultures. Mistral Saba: Under the Hood of this Powerful Regional LLM Mistral Saba is built as a 24 billion parameter model, placing it in the ‘small but mighty’ category. Let’s break down what this means and why it’s significant: Feature Mistral Saba General LLMs Parameter Size 24 Billion Varies (can be hundreds of billions) Language Focus Arabic, also proficient in South Asian languages Multi-lingual Performance Optimized for Arabic content, excels over general models in Arabic Good across many languages, but potentially less nuanced in specific languages Latency Lower latency due to smaller size Potentially higher latency While larger models often equate to ‘smarter’ answers, smaller models like Mistral Saba offer benefits such as faster response times (lower latency) and reduced computational costs. Mistral emphasizes that Saba outperforms their general-purpose small model, Mistral Small 3, when dealing with Arabic content. This highlights the effectiveness of custom training for specific linguistic needs. Beyond Arabic: Unexpected Language Versatility Interestingly, Mistral discovered that Saba’s expertise extends beyond Arabic. Due to the historical and cultural links between the Middle East and South Asia, Mistral Saba also demonstrates proficiency in Indian-origin languages, particularly South Indian languages like Tamil and Malayalam. This unexpected versatility expands the potential applications and market reach of this regional LLM , making it an even more attractive offering. What are the Potential Use Cases for Mistral Saba? As an off-the-shelf model accessible via Mistral’s API and for on-premise deployment, Mistral Saba opens up a wide range of exciting possibilities, especially within the Middle East AI landscape: Customer Support: Businesses in Arabic-speaking regions can leverage Mistral Saba to provide more effective and culturally attuned customer service through chatbots and virtual assistants. Content Generation: From marketing materials to news articles, Saba can generate high-quality, engaging Arabic content that resonates with local audiences. Fine-Tuning for Specific Industries: Companies in sectors like energy, finance, and healthcare, particularly those with sensitive data, can fine-tune Mistral Saba for internal use cases, benefiting from both its language capabilities and on-premise deployment option. Educational Tools: Saba could power innovative educational applications for Arabic learners, providing personalized and culturally relevant learning experiences. The on-premise deployment option is particularly significant for industries with strict data privacy and security requirements, offering a compelling advantage over cloud-based solutions. Mistral’s Strategic Play in the Global AI Race Mistral’s launch of Saba is more than just a product release; it’s a strategic move in the increasingly competitive global AI arena. Here’s why it matters: Geopolitical Positioning: By focusing on the Arabic language model and the Middle East, Mistral is positioning itself as a strong international alternative to U.S. and Chinese AI giants. This is particularly relevant in the current geopolitical climate where diversification and regional expertise are highly valued. Investor Appeal: With potential upcoming funding rounds, Saba’s launch could attract investment from Middle Eastern investors, aligning with the region’s growing interest in AI and technology. This would provide Mistral with further resources to compete on a global scale. Commitment to Multilingualism: Saba reinforces Mistral’s commitment to supporting multiple languages, a key differentiator rooted in their European identity. This dedication resonates with a global audience seeking AI solutions that are not solely focused on English. Mistral’s initiative could signal a broader trend in the AI industry, where companies begin to specialize in regional language models to cater to diverse global markets more effectively. This shift could lead to more culturally relevant and impactful AI applications worldwide. The Future of Regional LLMs and Generative AI Mistral Saba is a powerful example of how focusing on specific regions and languages can unlock new potential in generative AI . As Mistral plans to expand its regional language model efforts, we can anticipate further innovations that cater to the unique linguistic and cultural landscapes around the world. This targeted approach promises to make AI more accessible, relevant, and impactful for a global audience. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain world, the implications are clear: AI, especially specialized models like Mistral Saba, is poised to play an increasingly significant role in global markets. Understanding these developments is crucial for navigating the future of technology and innovation.

The death of Suchir Balaji, the OpenAI whistleblower who bravely exposed alleged copyright infringements by the AI giant, has been officially ruled a suicide. This shocking revelation, confirmed by a San Francisco autopsy report, arrives amidst swirling speculations and intense debates about AI ethics and corporate accountability, themes that resonate deeply with the crypto community’s values of transparency and decentralization. The Tragic Death of OpenAI Whistleblower Suchir Balaji Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old former OpenAI employee, became a central figure in a growing storm of controversy surrounding OpenAI’s AI model training practices. His accusations of copyright infringement against OpenAI, made public in October, sent ripples through the tech world and beyond. Balaji provided crucial documents to The New York Times, identifying him as a key source in their lawsuit against OpenAI. His untimely death on November 26th, initially shrouded in mystery, has now been officially declared a suicide autopsy by the San Francisco County Medical Examiner. Here’s a timeline of events leading to this tragic conclusion: October 2024: Suchir Balaji publicly accuses OpenAI of illegally using copyrighted material to train its AI models. He shares information with The New York Times. November 26, 2024: Balaji is found dead in his San Francisco apartment. Initial reports are vague, leading to online speculation. February 15, 2025: The San Francisco County Medical Examiner releases an autopsy report officially ruling Balaji’s death as suicide by self-inflicted gunshot. This definitive ruling, while bringing closure to the official investigation, does little to quell the larger questions surrounding AI ethics and the immense power wielded by tech corporations like OpenAI. Why Did the Suicide Autopsy Spark Controversy? Balaji’s sudden death, occurring so soon after his explosive revelations against OpenAI, understandably fueled suspicion and conspiracy theories. His family initially questioned the circumstances, adding to the online speculation. High-profile figures like Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson weighed in, and Congressman Ro Khanna even called for a “full and transparent investigation.” Several factors contributed to the heightened scrutiny: Timing of Death: Balaji’s death occurred shortly after he became a prominent whistleblower, raising immediate red flags for many. High Stakes Accusations: His allegations of copyright infringement struck at the heart of OpenAI’s operational ethics and legal standing, making him a potentially targeted individual in the eyes of some. Powerful Opponent: OpenAI, backed by massive resources and influence, represents a formidable adversary, further fueling concerns about potential retaliation against whistleblowers. Broader Context of AI Ethics: The case unfolded against a backdrop of increasing anxiety about the ethical implications of rapidly advancing AI technologies and the lack of regulatory oversight. Despite the autopsy report, the unease remains. The crypto community, familiar with the battles for decentralization and transparency, understands the risks faced by individuals who challenge powerful centralized entities. The question lingers: Does this suicide ruling truly disentangle the complex web of AI ethics , corporate accountability, and the vulnerability of whistleblowers in Silicon Valley? Copyright Infringement Claims: What Balaji Unveiled At the heart of this tragic story are Balaji’s claims of copyright infringement against OpenAI. He alleged that the tech giant illegally used copyrighted material – potentially vast amounts of text, code, images, and other creative works – to train its large language models (LLMs). This accusation aligns with a growing wave of lawsuits from publishers, artists, and copyright holders who argue that their intellectual property has been unlawfully exploited to fuel the AI revolution. The implications of these claims are significant: Aspect Implication Legal Ramifications If proven true, OpenAI could face massive legal challenges, financial penalties, and potential restructuring of its AI training methods. Ethical Concerns Using copyrighted material without permission raises serious ethical questions about fair use, intellectual property rights, and the moral obligations of AI developers. Industry Impact A successful lawsuit could set a precedent, forcing other AI companies to re-evaluate their training data sources and potentially impacting the pace and direction of AI development. Balaji’s revelations, now tragically intertwined with his death, have amplified the urgency of addressing these critical issues within the AI industry. The debate over copyright infringement in AI training is far from over, and Balaji’s sacrifice serves as a stark reminder of the human cost associated with these technological battles. Moving Forward: Accountability and Transparency in the AI Age The conclusion of the investigation into Suchir Balaji’s death, while providing answers, leaves behind a profound sense of loss and a renewed call for action. For the cryptocurrency community and beyond, this case underscores the critical need for greater accountability and transparency within the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Protect Whistleblowers: Stronger legal protections and societal support systems are crucial for individuals who dare to expose wrongdoing within powerful tech corporations. Demand Corporate Accountability: Tech companies, especially those developing transformative technologies like AI, must be held to the highest ethical standards and be transparent about their practices. Promote Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI must be guided by ethical principles that prioritize fairness, transparency, and respect for human rights and intellectual property. Foster Open Dialogue: Ongoing public discourse and critical examination of AI ethics are essential to navigate the complex challenges and opportunities presented by this technology. Suchir Balaji’s story is a stark reminder that the pursuit of technological advancement must not come at the expense of ethical considerations and human lives. His legacy should inspire a renewed commitment to building a more responsible and accountable AI future.

Buckle up, because recent economic news is sending shockwaves through the markets. The greenback is feeling the heat after unexpectedly weak retail sales figures were released, sparking fresh speculation about potential shifts in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy. Let’s dive into what this means for your trades and the broader market landscape. US Dollar Under Pressure as Retail Sales Disappoint The US Dollar Index (DXY), a key gauge of the dollar’s strength against a basket of major currencies, has taken a hit, falling close to the 107.00 mark. This downturn follows the release of January’s retail sales data, which painted a less-than-rosy picture of the US consumer. Here’s a quick snapshot of the key figures: Retail Sales (January): Actual: -0.9% vs. Expected: -0.1% Retail Sales (December – Revised): Previous: 0.6%, Revised: 0.7% Industrial Production (January): Actual: 0.5% vs. Expected: 0.3% While Industrial Production offered a slight silver lining by exceeding expectations, the significantly weaker Retail Sales figure is stealing the spotlight. A 0.9% drop is a substantial miss and raises serious questions about the health of consumer spending, a critical engine of the US economy. Interest Rates in Focus: Will the Fed Change Course? The disappointing Retail Sales data has immediately fueled speculation about the Federal Reserve’s future moves on interest rates . Traders are now reassessing the likelihood of rate cuts, or at least a slower pace of rate hikes, as the weak data could signal a cooling economy. Adding to this sentiment, US Treasury yields are also on the decline. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below 4.50%, making the US Dollar less attractive to investors seeking yield. Lower yields typically reduce demand for the dollar, contributing to its weakness. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently emphasized that any adjustments to monetary policy will hinge on “tangible progress” on inflation or signs of weakness in the labor market. While inflation remains a concern, this retail sales data could be interpreted as an early signal of economic softening, potentially influencing the Fed’s stance. The CME FedWatch Tool, a market gauge of Fed policy expectations, currently indicates a 55% probability of unchanged rates in June. This reflects the increased uncertainty in the market about the future Fed Rate Path . DXY Technical Outlook: Bearish Signals Emerge From a technical analysis perspective, the US Dollar Index ( DXY ) is showing signs of further weakness. Moving Averages: The DXY has broken below its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a bearish signal suggesting a potential shift in momentum. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI is weakening, reinforcing the negative momentum and indicating that the dollar is losing strength. MACD: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator remains in bearish territory, further supporting the downward outlook. Key technical levels to watch: Immediate Support: Around 106.30, near the 100-day SMA. A break below this level could confirm a short-term negative trend. Resistance: Initial resistance is seen at 107.50, followed by the 20-day SMA around 108.00. Understanding Interest Rates : FAQs for Traders Let’s clarify some common questions about interest rates and their impact on currencies and other assets: What are interest rates? Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money. They are charged by lenders and paid to savers. Central banks, like the US Federal Reserve, use base lending rates to manage inflation and stimulate economic growth. How do interest rates impact currencies? Generally, higher interest rates make a country’s currency more attractive to foreign investors. This increased demand can strengthen the currency’s value. How do interest rates influence the price of Gold? Higher interest rates can negatively impact gold prices. This is because they increase the opportunity cost of holding gold (which doesn’t yield interest) compared to interest-bearing assets. Additionally, higher US interest rates often strengthen the US Dollar, and since gold is priced in dollars, a stronger dollar can push gold prices down. What is the Fed Funds rate? The Fed Funds rate is the overnight lending rate between US banks. It’s the key rate set by the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Market expectations for future Fed Funds rates, tracked by tools like the CME FedWatch Tool, significantly influence financial markets. Conclusion: Navigating Market Uncertainty The weaker-than-expected US retail sales data has injected a dose of uncertainty into the market, sending the US Dollar lower and prompting a reassessment of the Fed Rate Path . For crypto and Forex traders, this volatility presents both risks and opportunities. Keep a close eye on upcoming economic data releases and Fed communications to gauge the evolving outlook for the US Dollar and interest rates . Technical analysis of the DXY suggests potential for further dollar weakness, but as always, prudent risk management is key in these dynamic market conditions.

President Milei has responded for the first time after the crypto scandal stating that he didn’t make a social media post regarding it persuading people but rather to raise awareness and support Argentine businesses supporting crypto. This led to solid volatility with LIBRA price shooting $0.75 in minutes, before crashing 50% from there in hours. LIBRA Whale Incurss $2.78 Million Loss In Recent Trades A LIBRA whale has faced significant losses totaling $2.78 million after two failed attempts to trade the meme coin. Three days ago, the whale invested 17,450 SOL (approximately $3.25 million) to purchase LIBRA. However, the subsequent sale of their holdings at 3,200 $SOL ($595,000) resulted in a staggering loss of 14,250 SOL, equivalent to $2.65 million. In a second attempt, following a retweet by Javier Milei about LIBRA purchasing methods, the whale spent an additional 2,855 SOL ($531,000) on the token. Unfortunately, this trade also ended poorly, with the whale selling for 2,159 SOL ($412,000), incurring a further loss of 696 SOL ($129,000), as per the on-chain data by SolScan . Source: SolScan After surging to $0.75 earlier today, the LIBRA price is down 50% trading at $0.3625 as of press time. However, it is still trading 34% up on the daily chart while its daily trading volume has surged by 740% to $162 million amid the LIBRA whale. Today another pump and dump in the meme coin has trapped traders looking to make a quick buck amid a massive $4.5 billion insider trading activity. Argentina President Javier Milei Claims No Wrongdoing As the LIBRA meme coin scandal busted, Argentina President Javier Milei came out defending himself following major lawsuits along with calls of impeachment against him. President Milei confirmed meeting with the creators of the LIBRA memecoin but emphasized that his social media posts were not intended to persuade people to invest. Instead, Milei stated that his intent was to raise awareness about the initiative, which aims to support Argentine businesses through the use of cryptocurrency. In an interview with local television station Todo Noticias, Milei said: “I’m not an expert. My specialty is economic growth, with and without money. As a guy who’s a super technology enthusiast seeing the possibility of a tool to finance entrepreneurs’ projects, I spread the word.” Celebrity meme coins have been a rage recently, especially after Donald Trump launched the TRUMP meme coin during his inauguration in January. Following the initial euphoria, the TRUMP price has crashed nearly 80% from the peak and is currently trading around $16.6. However, market analysts still remain optimistic about a TRUMP price rally to $50 by the end of February.

Authorities arrested four men, with one suspect facing 14 counts of burglary. In India, authorities seized almost $190 million in crypto linked to the infamous Bitconnect Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of $2.4 billion. Meanwhile, a pseudonymous programmer known as “Hu Lezhi” made shocking claims about brain-computer chips controlling populations after sending $5.6 million in Ethereum to WikiLeaks, Ethereum’s burn address, and other wallets. Crime Ring Steals Crypto ATMs and Rare Cards Australian police uncovered a huge trove of stolen items after dismantling a local crime syndicate responsible for targeting crypto ATMs and collector card stores across Melbourne. Authorities described the discovery as an “Aladdin’s cave” of stolen goods after an investigation into a series of commercial burglaries involving a “significant network of offenders.” Since mid-January, the group allegedly stole six crypto ATMs and tens of thousands of dollars worth of collector cards, according to a statement from Victoria Police on Feb. 17. The investigation led police to a stockpile of stolen items that included firearms, 100 car keys, a pill press machine, and an array of power tools. Among some of the recovered items were rare and valuable collector cards, including Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Magic: The Gathering cards. Detectives believe the group used stolen vehicles to carry out their crimes. Four men were arrested in connection with the spree. One of them faces 14 counts of burglary targeting commercial cryptocurrency ATMs and gaming stores, along with charges of handling stolen goods and illegally possessing firearms. He is scheduled to appear in court on May 2. Another suspect was charged with five commercial burglaries, three counts of vehicle theft, unlicensed driving, and possession of a prohibited weapon. His court date is set for Feb. 21. Two other men were released as the investigations are still under way. Detective Inspector Patrick Watkinson of the North West Metro Regional Crime Squad stated that police arrested the main offenders but suspected ties to a much larger criminal syndicate. He added that authorities also identified lower-level offenders involved in the distribution of stolen goods, as well as connections to Middle Eastern Organized Crime Syndicates that were directing these criminal activities. Over the past few years, Australia emerged as a growing hub for crypto ATMs. In fact, the state where the thefts took place hosted 313 Bitcoin ATMs and tellers. The country saw a surge in crypto ATM adoption after private firms entered the market in late 2022. Today, Australia ranks as the third-largest market for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ATMs, with 1,462 machines in operation. This is up from just 67 in August of 2022. Leading providers in the country include Coinflip, which operates 679 ATMs, Localcoin with 543, and Cryptolink with 98. (Source: Coin ATM Radar ) Despite Australia’s expansion in the crypto ATM sector, the United States is still the dominant player as it hosts 29,740 machines and accounts for 80% of the global market. Canada follows as the second-largest market, with 3,074 crypto ATMs making up 8.3% of the global share. Bitconnect Ponzi Scheme Assets Seized in India Indian authorities also recently seized close to $190 million in cryptocurrency linked to Bitconnect as part of an ongoing investigation into the global Ponzi scheme that collapsed in 2018. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Ahmedabad conducted raids in Gujarat on Feb. 11 and 15, and confiscated additional assets, including ₹13,50,500 (approximately $15,582), a sport utility vehicle, and electronic devices. The seized assets were reportedly tied to associates of Bitconnect, which is a scheme that defrauded 4,000 investors across 95 countries. The scheme led to an estimated $2.4 billion in losses. Bitconnect was launched in 2016, and operated by recruiting global promoters who were paid commissions to bring in new investors. The scheme unraveled in 2018, and its founder, Satish Kumbhani, was later charged by the US Department of Justice in February of 2022. Authorities allege that between November 2016 and January 2018, the accused collected huge amounts of funds from investors worldwide, including in India. Some victims even resorted to extreme measures to recover some of their losses. In August of 2024, the ED revealed that investor Shailesh Babulal Bhatt, who had lost money in Bitconnect Coin (BCC), allegedly kidnapped two of Kumbhani’s employees. He then extorted 2,091 Bitcoin, 11,000 Litecoin, and approximately $1.7 million in exchange for their release. (Source: FBI ) Luckily, law enforcement is hard at work to prevent similar losses from happening to other investors. The FBI’s “ Operation Level Up ” reportedly prevented roughly $285 million in potential crypto fraud losses between January 2024 and January 2025. Coder Sends Millions with Crypto Conspiracy Meanwhile, a pseudonymous programmer known as “Hu Lezhi” recently almost donated $2 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) to WikiLeaks, along with an on-chain message making shocking allegations about the Chinese military’s use of nano computer chips to control citizens. In a translated message that was sent on Fed. 17, Lezhi claimed that brain-computer chips have been deployed on a large scale for military purposes, and that major global powers are using base stations, radios, and nano-brain-computer chips to exert control over populations. The programmer also stated that they have been a victim of this technology since birth. Lezhi’s message also accused two hedge fund executives from Kuande Investment, which is more commonly known as WizardQuant, of using similar brain-computer weapons to manipulate their employees. The people named in the allegations are Feng Xin, a co-founder and chief risk officer at WizardQuant, and Xu Yuzhi, the company’s chief investment officer. Despite the severity of these claims, WizardQuant has not commented on the allegations. Some of Lezhi’s warnings (Source: Etherscan ) The on-chain activity tied to Lezhi reveals that they first reached out to WikiLeaks on Feb. 10, warning of a new type of crime in which victims are gradually deprived of their senses until they become “complete slaves to the digital machine.” Between Feb. 10 and 17, they transferred 711.5 ETH to WikiLeaks, with the largest single transaction amounting to about 591.6 ETH, which is valued at approximately $1.6 million, taking place on Feb. 17. Beyond the donation to WikiLeaks, Lezhi also sent 603 ETH, worth around $1.65 million, to Ethereum’s burn address, effectively destroying the funds while embedding similar on-chain messages. Additionally, they further transferred 700 ETH to the “ndao.eth” wallet and 33 ETH to an unidentified “Grant Provider” address. In total, 2,047 ETH equivalent to $5.6 million were moved from their Ethereum address “0x1a19.” No additional transactions have been recorded from this wallet since these transfers. WizardQuant was founded in 2014 and operates out of Shanghai and Beijing. The company employs between 51 and 200 people according to LinkedIn data.

40484634,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=129572,1739858330,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent USD/JPY Forecast: Yen Surges as Dollar Plunges Below Key Level,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usd-jpy-forecast-dollar-tumbles/,"Navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market requires a keen eye on global financial indicators. The recent movements in the Forex market, particularly the USD/JPY pair, are sending shockwaves. For crypto traders and investors who diversify into traditional markets, understanding these shifts is crucial. Let’s dive into the dramatic events unfolding in the USD/JPY market and what they signal for broader financial trends. Why is the USD/JPY Forecast Suddenly Bearish? The USD/JPY pair has experienced a sharp decline, breaching a critical technical level – the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This significant drop to 152.02 erased the gains from February 12th, signaling a strong shift in market sentiment. Several factors are contributing to this bearish outlook: Dollar Weakness: The primary driver is the weakening US Dollar. Recent US Retail Sales data came in worse than expected, putting downward pressure on the American currency. The US Dollar Index (DXY) has even hit a year-to-date low, reflecting broad dollar depreciation. Technical Breakdown: Falling below the 200-day SMA, a widely watched long-term trend indicator, suggests a potential trend reversal from bullish to bearish for USD/JPY. Increased Selling Pressure: Sellers have clearly taken control, as evidenced by the price action and bearish signals from technical indicators. Currently, the USD/JPY pair is trading around 152.26, down 0.36% from its opening price, further solidifying the negative momentum. Decoding the Technical Analysis for USD/JPY To understand the potential future trajectory of USD/JPY, technical analysis is essential. Let’s break down the key technical indicators and price levels: Bearish Indicators: 200-day SMA Breach: The decisive break below the 200-day SMA at 152.73 is a major bearish signal. This moving average is often seen as a demarcation line between long-term bullish and bearish trends. Bearish RSI: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is pointing downwards, indicating continued selling momentum and suggesting further downside potential. Key Support Levels: First Support: 150.93. This level is the February 7th swing low and represents the immediate support area. A break below this could accelerate losses. Second Support: 148.64. This is the December 3rd daily low and a more significant support level. A drop to this level would confirm a deeper bearish trend. Potential Resistance Levels (in case of recovery): 200-day SMA (around 152.73): Recapturing this level is crucial for any bullish reversal. It would now act as immediate resistance. Tenkan-sen (153.22): This level, part of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo system, represents short-term resistance. 154.00 Figure: A psychological resistance level and a significant barrier for bulls to overcome. Japanese Yen Strength: A Currency Heatmap Analysis To gain a broader perspective on the Yen’s strength, let’s examine its performance against other major currencies today. The table below provides a clear snapshot: Japanese Yen (JPY) Performance Against Major Currencies Today USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD -0.29% -0.20% -0.29% -0.10% -0.57% -1.01% -0.37% EUR 0.29% 0.08% 0.00% 0.18% -0.29% -0.73% -0.08% GBP 0.20% -0.08% -0.06% 0.10% -0.37% -0.81% -0.16% JPY 0.29% 0.00% 0.06% 0.17% -0.30% -0.74% -0.10% CAD 0.10% -0.18% -0.10% -0.17% -0.48% -0.91% -0.27% AUD 0.57% 0.29% 0.37% 0.30% 0.48% -0.45% 0.20% NZD 1.01% 0.73% 0.81% 0.74% 0.91% 0.45% 0.65% CHF 0.37% -0.08% -0.16% -0.10% 0.27% -0.20% -0.65% As the table illustrates, the Japanese Yen was the strongest against the US Dollar today. This heatmap visually represents currency percentage changes, with the base currency on the left and the quote currency at the top. For instance, the USD/JPY box shows the percentage change for JPY/USD. Actionable Insights for Traders For traders monitoring the Forex and crypto markets, here are some key takeaways and potential actions: Monitor Support Levels: Keep a close watch on the support levels at 150.93 and 148.64. A break below 150.93 could trigger further selling. Watch for Dollar Recovery: Any signs of US Dollar strength or positive US economic data could provide a bounce for USD/JPY. However, until the 200-day SMA is reclaimed, the bias remains bearish. JPY Strength in Focus: The Japanese Yen is currently exhibiting broad strength. This could impact other JPY pairs and potentially influence risk sentiment across markets. Diversification Considerations: For crypto investors, understanding Forex movements like USD/JPY can inform broader portfolio diversification strategies and risk management. Conclusion: Navigating Forex Volatility The USD/JPY pair’s drop below the 200-day SMA is a significant development in the Forex market, driven by a weakening US Dollar and reinforced by technical indicators. For traders and investors, staying informed about these shifts is crucial for making sound decisions in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets.

In Hong Kong, shares of HK Asia Holdings surged nearly 93% after the company announced its purchase of a single Bitcoin, signaling increasing corporate adoption of digital assets. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded their first major outflows of 2025, with Bitcoin investment vehicles seeing $430 million in withdrawals amid macroeconomic concerns. While Bitcoin struggled with outflows, altcoin ETPs tracking Solana, XRP, and Sui saw inflows, reflecting a shift in investor focus toward alternative assets. HK Asia Holdings Sees Shares Skyrocket After Symbolic Bitcoin Purchase Shares in HK Asia Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong-based investment firm, surged nearly 93% in value on Monday after the company announced its purchase of a single Bitcoin . The dramatic rally shows the growing impact of institutional Bitcoin adoption, even when acquisitions are modest in scale. The investment firm revealed in a Feb. 16 announcement that it had purchased one Bitcoin for approximately $96,150 on Feb. 13, financing the acquisition entirely from its internal resources. Despite the relatively small investment, the news sent HK Asia’s stock price soaring, closing at HK$5.50 (71 cents)—just short of its June 2019 peak of HK$6.50 (84 cents). The sudden stock surge, which saw HK Asia’s shares nearly double within a single trading day, highlights investor enthusiasm for companies entering the Bitcoin market. The firm’s stock opened at around 40 cents before spiking to its closing price by the end of the trading session. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has seen a growing number of firms exploring cryptocurrency-related investments, and HK Asia’s stock performance suggests that even symbolic moves into Bitcoin can trigger substantial investor interest. HK Asia is not the first publicly listed company to recognize Bitcoin as a strategic asset. In its statement, the firm’s board cited the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies in the commercial world as a driving force behind its decision. Although HK Asia’s purchase of a single Bitcoin is more symbolic than substantial, it signals a shift toward digital assets in corporate treasuries. While HK Asia’s stock price exploded following its announcement, other companies that have moved into Bitcoin have seen mixed market reactions: Ming Shing Holdings, a Hong Kong-based construction company, recently announced that its subsidiary, Lead Benefit, had acquired 500 BTC at an average price of $94,375, investing nearly $47 million. However, unlike HK Asia, its stock failed to respond positively to the news and is down 40% year-to-date. In Japan, investment firm Metaplanet has experienced an astronomical rise, with its stock price soaring over 3,900% in the past 12 months after it began accumulating Bitcoin in April 2024. Following its latest acquisition of 269.4 BTC on Feb. 17, Metaplanet now holds approximately 2,031.5 BTC, valued at $194.7 million. HK Asia’s rationale for purchasing Bitcoin aligns with the broader narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty and currency devaluation. The firm cited government money-printing policies as a key reason for its Bitcoin investment, echoing the sentiments of major institutional Bitcoin adopters such as MicroStrategy and Tesla. While HK Asia’s BTC purchase is relatively small, its management emphasized that the move was strategic rather than financial, describing it as a symbolic step toward aligning with the evolving global financial landscape. Will More Asian Firms Follow Suit? Bitcoin’s increasing integration into corporate treasuries has been dominated by US firms, but HK Asia’s stock surge could encourage more Asian-listed companies to explore similar investments. In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has recently relaxed its stance on crypto-related financial products, allowing for the listing of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and providing a regulated framework for institutional adoption. The success of Metaplanet in Japan and the sharp market reaction to HK Asia’s announcement could indicate a growing trend of Asian firms incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate strategies—not just for financial gain but to align with a shifting global monetary system. HK Asia Holdings' dramatic 93% stock surge following the purchase of a single Bitcoin highlights the market’s growing enthusiasm for companies that embrace digital assets. While the acquisition itself is symbolic rather than transformative, it sends a strong message about Bitcoin’s growing role in corporate finance. With regulatory landscapes evolving favorably across Asia and investor sentiment shifting toward crypto-backed financial strategies, it remains to be seen which firms will be next to follow HK Asia’s lead. Crypto ETPs Suffer First Major Outflows of 2025 Amid Fed Rate Uncertainty In other news, the cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) market faced its first significant sell-off of the year, marking the end of a 19-week inflow streak that had fueled optimism among investors. According to a recent CoinShares report , the past trading week saw $415 million in outflows, with Bitcoin ETPs bearing the brunt of the downturn. The sell-off comes amid mounting macroeconomic concerns, particularly Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks on interest rate cuts and unexpectedly high US inflation data. While Bitcoin faced heavy outflows, Solana (SOL), XRP, and Sui (SUI) ETPs recorded inflows. Bitcoin BTC investment products saw the largest outflows of any crypto asset, totaling $430 million, wiping out recent gains fueled by optimism over the US presidential election cycle. CoinShares research head James Butterfill attributed the mass exodus of funds to concerns over US economic policy, stating that Bitcoin is highly sensitive to interest rate expectations. Powell’s recent comments urging patience on rate cuts, combined with inflation exceeding forecasts, led many investors to de-risk their portfolios. Despite Bitcoin’s steep outflows, short-Bitcoin products did not experience a corresponding increase in investments. In fact, short-Bitcoin ETPs recorded $9.6 million in outflows, suggesting that investors are moving capital to the sidelines rather than actively betting against Bitcoin. The latest sell-off officially ended a 19-week streak of inflows, which had propelled crypto ETPs to an accumulated $29.4 billion—far exceeding the $16 billion recorded in the first 19 weeks of US spot Bitcoin ETF trading in early 2024. Ethereum ETPs also recorded minor outflows of $7.2 billion, reflecting broader risk-off sentiment across institutional crypto investment vehicles. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs saw capital flight, Solana (SOL), XRP, and Sui (SUI) emerged as the biggest beneficiaries of investor rotations. Solana (SOL) ETPs led the altcoin inflows, amassing $8.9 million in new investments. XRP ETPs closely followed, attracting $8.5 million in fresh capital. Sui (SUI) ETPs also recorded $6 million in inflows. The rising demand for Solana and XRP ETPs coincides with increasing speculation about the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving Solana and XRP spot ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate a 75% chance of Solana ETF approval in 2025, while XRP ETF approval is pegged at 65%. The prospect of institutional-grade Solana and XRP investment vehicles has triggered growing investor confidence, leading to an uptick in capital flows into existing ETP products tracking these assets. Macroeconomic Concerns Weigh Heavily on Crypto Investment Trends The recent crypto ETP outflows show the market’s sensitivity to US monetary policy. Despite Bitcoin’s narrative as a hedge against inflation and fiat debasement, short-term price action remains closely tied to central bank policies and liquidity conditions. Investors are now closely watching Fed policy signals for any indication of a shift toward rate cuts, which could reignite demand for risk assets, including crypto ETPs. Until then, capital is expected to rotate toward assets with stronger near-term bullish catalysts, such as Solana and XRP. The crypto ETP market has officially entered a new phase, as the first major outflows of 2025 highlight the challenges posed by macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin remains the dominant crypto investment product, but its sensitivity to interest rate expectations and profit-taking trends has led some institutional investors to diversify into altcoin-backed ETPs. If Solana and XRP ETFs secure SEC approval, crypto investment trends could shift significantly, paving the way for a more balanced distribution of capital between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and alternative blockchain ecosystems. Until then, the Fed’s stance on inflation and rate cuts will continue to dictate institutional appetite for crypto ETPs in the months ahead.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ASIA|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-18 06:00:00
40484647,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=698193,1739858401,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Glassnode Reveals Where Bitcoin Could Find Support If Current Level Breaks Down,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/glassnode-bitcoin-support-current-level-breaks-down/,"The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed where the next Bitcoin support level could be based on different pricing models. Bitcoin Is Currently Retesting 1-Year MVRV Z-Score Mean In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about how BTC has been looking on a couple of pricing models recently. The first of these models is based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score, which compares the market cap of Bitcoin with its realized cap and applies a standard deviation test to pull out the extremes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finally Independent? BTC-S&P 500 Correlation Hits Zero The “realized cap” here refers to an on-chain indicator that basically keeps track of the total amount of capital that the holders as a whole have invested into BTC. As the market cap represents the value that the investors are holding in the present, its comparison against this initial investment in the MVRV Z-Score provides information about the profitability of the userbase. Now, here is the model shared by the analytics firm, that uses the mean and two standard deviations (SDs) of the 1-year MVRV Z-Score to define Bitcoin price levels: As displayed in the above graph, the mean of the MVRV Z-Score is situated at $96,300 right now. Bitcoin’s spot price has been trading around this mark recently, which suggests the MVRV Z-Score has been equal to its 1-year mean. So far, BTC has managed to recover back above this mean level each time it has plunged under it recently, but if the line ends up failing, the cryptocurrency might have to search for support elsewhere. From the chart, it’s visible that the next support level in this model is currently at $80,100. At this price, the 1-year MVRV Z-Score would be -1.5 SD away from its mean. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Investors Sitting On 54% Profit Despite Price Plunge This isn’t actually the next major on-chain support level that Bitcoin can rely on, however, as this second model shared by the analytics firm has a historically significant line that’s closer. In the above graph, the average cost basis (formally called the realized price) of the Bitcoin short-term holders is shown. The “short-term holders” (STHs) refer to BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The realized price of the STHs has often acted as an important support boundary during bullish periods. At present, this level is equivalent to $92,000. As such, before BTC can retest the lower MVRV Z-Score pricing band, it will have to go through this line. BTC Price Bitcoin appears to have declined under the 1-year MVRV Z-Score mean today as its price is now trading around $95,400. It remains to be seen whether this is only a temporary deviation or not.

This crucial meeting, held during the latest Assiom Forex Congress, underscores the intensifying focus on navigating the complex landscape of crypto assets, digital finance, and the ever-present threat of cybersecurity risks. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto in Italy and beyond. Why is the Italian Central Bank Addressing Crypto Regulations Now? The initiative taken by the Italian central bank is not happening in isolation. Globally, regulatory bodies are grappling with how to effectively oversee the burgeoning crypto industry. The meeting, as reported by Cointelegraph, was specifically aimed at addressing the discrepancies in crypto regulations between major economic blocs like the United States and the European Union. Fabio Panetta, the governor of the Italian central bank, emphasized the necessity of these discussions to foster a more harmonized regulatory environment. But why is this harmonization so vital? Global Nature of Crypto: Cryptocurrencies operate without borders. Regulatory gaps between regions can create loopholes, potentially undermining the effectiveness of any single nation’s regulations. Investor Protection: Divergent rules can confuse investors and potentially expose them to varying levels of risk depending on their jurisdiction. A unified approach can lead to stronger, more consistent investor protection. Market Stability: Inconsistencies in regulations can lead to market fragmentation and instability. Harmonization aims to create a more level playing field and contribute to a more stable global crypto market. Combating Illicit Activities: A fragmented regulatory landscape can be exploited for illicit activities like money laundering and terrorist financing. International cooperation and alignment in regulations are crucial to combat these risks effectively. What are the Key Cybersecurity Risks Discussed with Crypto Service Providers? Cybersecurity is a paramount concern in the digital asset space. Crypto service providers , who manage and facilitate transactions in cryptocurrencies, are prime targets for cyberattacks. The meeting with the Italian central bank likely delved into a range of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and preventative measures. What are some of the specific risks they might have discussed? Cybersecurity Risk Description Potential Impact Wallet Hacking Unauthorized access to cryptocurrency wallets holding user funds. Direct financial loss for users; reputational damage for service providers. Exchange Hacks Breaches of crypto exchange platforms leading to theft of cryptocurrencies and sensitive user data. Massive financial losses; erosion of trust in the crypto market; regulatory scrutiny. Phishing Attacks Deceptive tactics to trick users into revealing private keys or login credentials. Individual financial losses; compromised accounts. 51% Attacks Exploiting vulnerabilities in blockchain consensus mechanisms to manipulate transaction records. Double-spending of cryptocurrencies; undermining the integrity of the blockchain. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities Flaws in the code of smart contracts that can be exploited to drain funds or manipulate contract execution. Financial losses for users and projects utilizing vulnerable smart contracts. Addressing these cybersecurity risks requires a multi-faceted approach involving technological safeguards, robust security protocols, user education, and proactive regulatory oversight. The Italian central bank’s engagement with crypto service providers signals a commitment to fostering a more secure environment for digital finance . How Does Digital Finance Fit into Italy’s Regulatory Agenda? The discussion wasn’t solely about cryptocurrencies but also encompassed the broader realm of digital finance . This suggests Italy is taking a holistic view of the evolving financial landscape. Digital finance encompasses a wide range of technological innovations in the financial sector, including but not limited to: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology: As discussed, these are central to the current wave of digital finance. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Many central banks, including the European Central Bank (ECB), are exploring the potential of issuing digital versions of fiat currencies. Neobanks and Fintech Platforms: These innovative financial institutions leverage technology to offer streamlined and often more accessible financial services. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): A burgeoning ecosystem of financial applications built on blockchain technology, aiming to provide traditional financial services in a decentralized and permissionless manner. Italy’s focus on digital finance demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to adapting its financial infrastructure to the realities of the 21st century. By engaging with crypto service providers and addressing crypto regulations and cybersecurity risks , the Italian central bank is actively shaping the future of finance within its borders and contributing to the global dialogue on these critical issues. What are the Potential Benefits of Stronger Crypto Regulations in Italy? While some in the crypto space may view regulations with skepticism, well-designed crypto regulations can bring significant benefits. For Italy, these could include: Increased Investor Confidence: Clear and consistent rules can make the crypto market more attractive to both retail and institutional investors, knowing their investments are operating within a regulated framework. Attracting Innovation: A predictable regulatory environment can encourage legitimate crypto businesses to establish themselves in Italy, fostering innovation and economic growth. Consumer Protection: Regulations can mandate consumer protection measures, safeguarding users from fraud, scams, and unfair practices within the crypto ecosystem. Tax Revenue Generation: A regulated crypto market can provide a clearer framework for taxation, potentially generating revenue for the Italian government. Financial Stability: By mitigating risks associated with illicit activities and market manipulation, regulations can contribute to the overall stability of the financial system. What’s Next for Crypto Regulations in Italy and the EU? The meeting between the Italian central bank and crypto service providers is just one step in an ongoing process. The EU is actively working on comprehensive crypto regulations through initiatives like the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. MiCA aims to create a unified legal framework for crypto assets across the EU member states. Italy’s proactive engagement suggests it is keen to be at the forefront of implementing and shaping these regulations. The discussions held at the Assiom Forex Congress signal a pivotal moment for the crypto industry in Italy. By prioritizing security and seeking to bridge the regulatory gap with the US, the Italian central bank is taking a responsible and proactive approach to integrating digital finance into its economic framework. The focus on cybersecurity risks and crypto regulations demonstrates a commitment to fostering a safe, innovative, and sustainable crypto ecosystem. As the global regulatory landscape continues to evolve, Italy’s actions will be closely watched by the crypto community and regulatory bodies worldwide.

That could, in turn, bump up XRP prices on any developments deemed bullish for the token or how the SEC approaches crypto cases. The SEC alleged Ripple Labs sold XRP in an unregistered securities offering in a widely-followed court case in 2020, which was resolved in Ripple’s favor in 2024. An appeal period, however, is ongoing and the case is not officially over yet, at least on paper. D.O.G.E. is a temporary non-governmental agency headed by Musk to slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies. It is themed after dogecoin (DOGE), a memecoin project widely touted by Musk in the past few years. The SEC is known in online crypto circles for its hard stance on local crypto companies and token issuers under the Biden administration, though this has started to shift as the crypto-friendly Donald Trump took office on Jan.20. XRP prices are down 1.4% in the past 24 hours, beating a 2% slide in bitcoin (BTC) and a 2.5% drop in the broader market tracked by the CoinDesk 20 index.",Markets|DOGE|Elon Musk|XRP,EN,0,0,DOGE|XRP|REGULATION|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-18 06:02:40

Activity in the U.S.-listed spot ETFs indicates that traders have strongly pivoted to ether from bitcoin (BTC). This month, the nine ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the U.S. have recorded a cumulative net inflow of $393 million, according to data from Farside Investors . This figure is also seven times larger than the inflows seen in January, as reported by Glassnode. Notably, these funds experienced outflows on only two trading days. In contrast, the 11 bitcoin ETFs have faced a net outflow of $376 million this month. Sentiment has been so weak that these funds have recorded inflows on just four trading days. The pivot to ETH is driven by carry trading , which involves purchasing spot ETFs and shorting ETH CME futures simultaneously. Plus, some of the inflows into ETFs could be outright bullish directional plays. However, investors' pivot to ether has not yet translated into higher prices for cryptocurrency. ETH, which powers Ethereum's smart contract blockchain, has primarily traded between $2,600 and $2,800 since the Feb. 3 crash. Bitcoin too has been locked in a narrow range below $100,000 amid volatile price action in memecoins. Still, some observers expect ether price gains on the back of Ethereum's impending Pectra upgrade, which is said to optimize both the execution and consensus layers of Ethereum and help it compete against rival Layer 1s such as Solana. ""ETH has a solid foundation for a resurgence. The Pectra upgrade, scheduled for April 8 for example, is bringing network improvements, faster transactions, and better staking mechanics,"" Nick Forster, founder of the decentralized options platform Derive.xyz said in an email. Forster explained that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's push for a 10x increase in the L1 gas limit points to improved application development and security. Further, the ETH Foundation's recent $120 million allocation to DeFi projects is signaling a renewed focus on adoption and institutional interest through ETHrealize. Led by Vivek Raman, ETHrealize aims to integrate traditional financial institutions into the blockchain world. ""There's now a 30% chance ETH will hit above $3K by the end of the quarter, up from 28% last week,"" Forster added.",Markets|Ether|Ether ETFs|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-18 06:05:03

If you’re looking to get a pulse on emerging trends and potential market movers, understanding what’s buzzing in the K-Community is crucial. This week, we’re diving deep into the heart of Korean crypto conversations to reveal the top tokens that have been generating the most buzz. Let’s explore the fascinating landscape of Korean crypto keywords that dominated discussions between February 7th and 13th on Bitcoin World’s K-Community platform. What are the Top Searched Tokens in the Korean Crypto Community? Search volume often reflects initial interest and curiosity in specific cryptocurrencies. When it comes to top searched tokens , the K-Community’s preferences offer a glimpse into potential investment trends and emerging narratives. Here’s a breakdown of the top 10 most searched tokens: Rank Token Search Volume 1 XRP 85,652 2 ONDO 35,633 3 ETH 27,474 4 BTC 23,158 5 SOL 16,392 6 PI 15,561 7 UXLINK 15,437 8 DOGE 14,643 9 MOVE 11,035 10 TRUMP 9,929 It’s fascinating to see XRP taking the crown by a significant margin. With over 85,000 searches, XRP demonstrates continued strong interest within the Korean crypto space. ONDO, ETH, and Bitcoin follow, indicating a blend of established giants and potentially newer, trending projects capturing user attention. Tokens like SOL, PI, UXLINK, DOGE, MOVE, and TRUMP round out the top 10, showcasing a diverse range of interests, from established Layer-1 solutions to meme coins and politically themed tokens. But search volume is just one piece of the puzzle. What about active conversations? Decoding the Top Mentioned Tokens: What’s Trending in K-Crypto Conversations? Mentions offer a different perspective, highlighting which tokens are actively being discussed and debated within the community. These top mentioned tokens reveal the coins that are not just being passively searched but are at the center of ongoing dialogues and community sentiment. Let’s see which tokens dominated the conversation: Rank Token Mention Count 1 BTC 1,620 2 ETH 951 3 XRP 516 4 TRUMP 432 5 SBD 342 6 ONDO 279 7 SOL 230 8 UXLINK 153 9 QTUM 95 10 BERA 84 Interestingly, while XRP topped the search charts, Bitcoin takes the lead in mentions. This suggests that while XRP might be attracting initial curiosity and searches, Bitcoin remains the central topic of discussion and analysis within the K-Community. Ethereum follows closely behind Bitcoin , reinforcing its position as a core cryptocurrency in the ecosystem. XRP, though lower in mentions compared to searches, still holds a significant spot in conversations. The presence of TRUMP in both lists is notable, indicating active discussion around politically themed tokens. SBD, ONDO, SOL, and UXLINK also feature in the top mentions, showing sustained community interest and engagement beyond initial searches. QTUM and BERA entering the mentions list, while not in the top searches, suggests developing conversations around these tokens that might be worth watching. Why are Korean Crypto Keywords a Powerful Indicator? The Korean crypto market is known for its dynamism and influence on global crypto trends. Understanding Korean crypto keywords is more than just tracking search terms; it’s about tapping into the pulse of a highly active and often trend-setting crypto community. Here’s why paying attention to these trends is vital: Early Trend Detection: Korean markets often react quickly to new developments and can be early indicators of global trends. Monitoring K-Community keywords can provide a head-start in identifying emerging narratives and potentially explosive tokens. The ‘Kimchi Premium’ Effect: Historically, the ‘Kimchi Premium’—where cryptocurrencies trade at higher prices in Korean exchanges—highlights the unique demand and sentiment within the Korean market. Understanding local interests can help anticipate potential price movements influenced by Korean traders. Community Sentiment Analysis: By analyzing both search and mention data, we gain a nuanced view of community sentiment. High search volume might indicate initial hype, while high mention counts suggest deeper engagement and conviction. Investment Insights: For investors, these Korean crypto keywords offer valuable insights into which tokens are gaining traction and community support within a significant crypto market. This information can inform investment decisions and portfolio diversification strategies. XRP’s Enduring Popularity and ONDO’s Emergence The dominance of XRP in search volume is a recurring theme in Korean crypto trends. XRP has consistently maintained a strong following in South Korea, possibly due to factors like: Strong Community Support: XRP boasts a dedicated and passionate community in Korea, who actively promote and discuss the token. Regulatory Clarity (Potentially): While regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving, there might be a perception of greater clarity or favorability towards XRP in certain regions, including South Korea. Speculative Interest: Ongoing developments and legal battles surrounding XRP might fuel speculative interest and drive search volumes as investors seek updates. ONDO’s impressive second place in search volume is also noteworthy. This could indicate a growing interest in Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, a narrative that ONDO is closely associated with. The surge in searches for ONDO might signal a rising awareness and adoption of RWA-related crypto projects within the Korean market. Bitcoin and Ethereum: The Pillars of Crypto Conversation While Bitcoin and Ethereum might not have topped the search charts this week, their dominance in mentions underscores their foundational role in the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin , as the original cryptocurrency, and Ethereum, as the leading smart contract platform, are consistently at the heart of crypto discussions globally, and the K-Community is no exception. Market Benchmarks: Bitcoin and Ethereum serve as benchmarks for the entire crypto market. Conversations often revolve around their price movements, technological developments, and broader market implications.

Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) discovered that nearly five trillion dollars in Treasury payments had been processed without a mandatory identification code today, making the money nearly impossible to track. The issue? The Treasury Access Symbol (TAS)—a required code that links federal payments to budget line items—was optional for years. According to D.O.G.E, billions of dollars were flowing unchecked, leaving little to no trail on where the money actually went. As of Saturday, the TAS field is now mandatory. “In the Federal Government, the TAS field was optional for ~$4.7 trillion in payments and was often left blank, making traceability almost impossible. As of Saturday, this is now a required field, increasing insight into where money is actually going,” D.O.G.E posted on X Monday night. The agency credited the US Treasury for helping uncover the issue. D.O.G.E uncovers billions in government waste The Bureau of the Fiscal Service, a division of the Treasury, confirmed that TAS codes classify every financial transaction reported to the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). But until now, agencies had the option to leave the TAS field blank, making it nearly impossible to track massive portions of the federal budget. The Treasury Access Symbol (TAS) is an identification code linking a Treasury payment to a budget line item (standard financial process). In the Federal Government, the TAS field was optional for ~$4.7 Trillion in payments and was often left blank, making traceability almost… — Department of Government Efficiency (@DOGE) February 17, 2025 The discovery was announced the same day D.O.G.E updated the DOGE.gov Savings page, reporting $55 billion in estimated savings since the department’s launch. The agency said the data would be updated twice per week until it could eventually provide real-time tracking. D.O.G.E outlined where those savings came from: Fraud detection and deletion Contract and lease cancellations or renegotiations Asset sales and grant cancellations Workforce reductions and program eliminations Regulatory cost cuts “We are working to upload all of this data in a digestible and fully transparent manner with clear assumptions, consistent with applicable rules and regulations,” D.O.G.E said on its website. D.O.G.E faces lawsuits over federal data access Meanwhile, attorneys general from 14 states have sued to block D.O.G.E from obtaining sensitive government records, saying that D.O.G.E and Trump’s administration are overstepping executive authority. Despite the lawsuits, a Washington federal judge ruled on Friday that D.O.G.E could continue accessing data from the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But not all agencies are complying. Michelle King, the head of the Social Security Administration, resigned after refusing to grant D.O.G.E access to agency records, according to a Fox News report. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields confirmed her departure, saying, “President Trump has nominated the highly qualified and talented Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration, and we expect him to be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner.” Fields added, “President Trump is committed to appointing the best and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them for far too long.” Elon’s budget cuts divide Conservatives Elon’s D.O.G.E is dividing conservatives, who are now his people. Some Republican budget experts praise Elon’s direct access to government records, arguing that D.O.G.E has uncovered more waste than previous cost-cutting efforts. Others say it’s too early to tell, claiming the agency is focusing on smaller agencies instead of making cuts to major budget areas like defense, Social Security, and Medicare. A White House report last week said at least $2.2 billion in initial savings, while the D.O.G.E website now lists over $5.6 billion. But Elon’s goal remains much higher. Elon initially wanted to cut $2 trillion from the budget, matching the size of the federal deficit. He has since adjusted that target to $1 trillion, a number that still dwarfs the agency’s current progress.

A recent survey suggests a significant portion are indeed concerned about the potential threat these futuristic machines pose to Bitcoin. Let’s dive into the intriguing findings of a survey conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos, which sheds light on the sentiment of Korean crypto investors regarding Bitcoin’s future and the looming specter of quantum computing. Korean Investors’ Bitcoin Price Predictions: A Rollercoaster of Expectations? The survey, conducted between February 11th and 14th, offers a fascinating snapshot of how Korean cryptocurrency investors perceive the immediate future of Bitcoin. It seems like sentiment is shifting, creating a more uncertain outlook compared to the previous week. Let’s break down the numbers: Bullish Expectations Wane: While still a significant group, 46.8% of respondents anticipate Bitcoin’s value to rise or experience a significant jump this week. This is a noticeable decrease from the 39.2% who held this optimistic view just the week before. Are Korean investors becoming less confident in immediate Bitcoin gains? Stable Market Predictions Dip: The percentage of investors predicting a stable market also saw a decline, dropping from 37.2% last week to 26.6%. This suggests fewer investors are expecting calm waters in the Bitcoin market. Bearish Sentiment on the Rise: Interestingly, the proportion of investors bracing for a decline or sharp drop in Bitcoin’s value has increased. 26.6% now anticipate a downturn, up from 23.6% in the previous survey. Is fear creeping back into the Korean crypto market? Korean Crypto Investor Bitcoin Price Predictions Prediction This Week (%) Last Week (%) Increase/Significant Jump 46.8% 39.2% Stable Market 26.6% 37.2% Decline/Sharp Drop 26.6% 23.6% Decoding Overall Market Sentiment: Neutrality Reigns, But Fear Lingers Beyond just Bitcoin’s price, the survey also probed the broader market sentiment among Korean investors. The results paint a picture of cautious neutrality, tinged with underlying anxieties: Neutral Ground Dominates: A significant 46.9% of participants expressed a neutral outlook on the overall cryptocurrency market. This suggests a wait-and-see approach is prevalent among Korean investors. Optimism Fades: Optimism, or extreme optimism, is present in 28.5% of respondents. While still a sizable group, it indicates that outright bullishness isn’t the dominant emotion. Fearful Undercurrent: A notable 24.6% of investors are experiencing fear or extreme fear. This highlights that despite the neutral majority, a considerable segment of the Korean market is feeling uneasy. Quantum Computers: A Real Risk to Bitcoin, or Just Crypto Conspiracy? Now, for the most intriguing part of the survey: the perception of quantum computers as a potential threat to Bitcoin. This cutting-edge technology, while still in its nascent stages, has sparked both excitement and concern within the cryptocurrency community. Are these concerns justified in the eyes of Korean investors? Let’s break down their perspectives: Quantum Threat is Real for Many: A substantial 34.1% of Korean investors believe that quantum computing is a viable technology that could exert selling pressure on Bitcoin. This indicates a significant portion of the market acknowledges the potential risk. Is this a well-founded fear, or are they being overly cautious? Conspiracy Dismissal: On the other hand, 25.6% dismiss the quantum computers concern as mere conspiracy. They believe that quantum computing won’t be capable of breaking Bitcoin’s robust encryption. Are they right to be so confident? Distant Future Perspective: Another 25.2% believe that quantum computing is still too far from commercialization to pose an immediate threat. They suggest Bitcoin will likely develop quantum resistance before it becomes a real problem. Is this a realistic timeline? Bitcoin’s Intrinsic Value Questioned: A smaller 5.4% hold a more pessimistic view, expressing skepticism about Bitcoin’s fundamental value. They believe Bitcoin’s value will eventually drop to zero, regardless of the impact of quantum computers . This highlights a deeper concern beyond just technological threats. Korean Crypto Investor Perceptions of Quantum Computing Risk to Bitcoin Perception Percentage (%) Quantum Computing as Selling Pressure Risk 34.1% Quantum Computing as Conspiracy/No Threat 25.6% Quantum Computing Distant/Bitcoin Will Adapt 25.2% Bitcoin Value Will Drop to Zero Regardless 5.4% The Quantum Computing Cloud Over Bitcoin: What Does It Mean? This survey reveals a nuanced picture of Korean crypto investor sentiment. While immediate Bitcoin price predictions are mixed, a significant portion are factoring in the long-term implications of quantum computers . The fact that over a third of respondents see quantum computing as a tangible risk to Bitcoin highlights a growing awareness of potential future challenges in the cryptocurrency space. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Stay Informed about Quantum Computing: Whether you believe it’s an immediate threat or a distant possibility, understanding the basics of quantum computing and its potential impact on cryptography is crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Concerns about quantum risk , among other factors, underscore the importance of diversification in any investment portfolio, including crypto. Monitor Bitcoin’s Quantum Resistance Development: Keep an eye on the progress of quantum -resistant cryptography within the Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Proactive development could mitigate future risks. Consider Long-Term Investment Horizons: The survey data suggests a degree of short-term uncertainty. Focusing on long-term investment strategies and understanding technological evolution is vital for navigating the crypto market. Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertainties of Crypto and Quantum Futures The survey of Korean cryptocurrency investors paints a fascinating picture of a market grappling with both immediate price fluctuations and long-term technological uncertainties. The significant percentage concerned about quantum computers underscores that these emerging technologies are no longer just a theoretical discussion point, but are entering the consciousness of mainstream crypto investors. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, staying informed, adaptable, and aware of both market sentiment and technological advancements will be key to navigating the exciting, yet unpredictable, world of digital assets.

After facing significant losses in memecoins, they shifted their focus back on the fundamentally strong tokens . As a result, the prices of Cardano, Aave, Maker, etc. and a few more are witnessing a rise in value and trader’s attention. This has also caused a notable flow of liquidity from the top tokens to other cryptos, which has compelled the Bitcoin price and Ethereum price to remain stuck just below the pivotal resistance zone. Bitcoin price is facing huge resistance at the 200-day MA at $98,903 and Ethereum at $2760. Nevertheless, while the BTC price is slowly losing its grip over the rally, the ETH price is constantly hitting the resistance, which has made it brittle. However, a drop in the volume has reduced the chances of a strong breakout, due to which the ETH price may remain consolidated within the range, despite showing strength compared to Bitcoin. As per the Glassnode data shared by Ali , the capital inflows into Bitcoin & Ethereum have reduced, which has kept the price accumulated within a range. The net position change for both BTC & ETH has dropped from $45 billion to $30 billion, marking a 30% dump. This suggests a major shift of focus for the retail traders, who are majorly responsible for keeping up the volatility of the tokens. Besides, the sellers also appear to have exhausted, which suggests the next move may be a bullish one. What’s Next for Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally? The bears are exerting significant pressure over the BTC price while the bulls are only able to hold the levels above the support at $95,610. They are failing to push the token into the resistance zone between $94,521 and $99, 439. However, as the current trade setup suggests, the bulls are currently exhausted, which may cause the price to drop below the range, activating a bearish pattern. Currently, the BTC price has reached a crucial juncture, as a drop below the support could validate a double-top or an ‘M-shaped’ pattern. This may drag the levels to the neckline around $92,500, which may further trigger a fresh descending trend. The RSI pattern hints towards a continued bearish trend while the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB) is about to undergo a bullish crossover suggesting a shift in the market trend. Hence, a rise from the levels may prevent excess loss but only a rise above the resistance may trigger a surge to $100K. Is Ethereum (ETH) Price Also in a Dire Straits? The Ethereum price faced a massive price drain in the first few days of the month that dragged the levels below the ascending support. Although the token is making constant efforts to elevate the levels above the range, the restricted buying volume is preventing it from doing so. However, the price has been tightly holding the support at $2,660 since the past weekend, hinting the bulls are accumulating strength to trigger a strong upswing. The Chaikin money flow has triggered a breakout into the positive zone, while the price continues to maintain its trend. This is an indicator of a potential bullish divergence as the strength is being accumulated within the market. Besides, the DMI currently remains sluggish after displaying a clear picture of a bullish crossover in the future. Meanwhile, the ADX has displayed a bearish divergence, hinting towards an extended consolidation if failed to rise above the resistance. Hence, the Ethereum (ETH) price is believed to remain within the accumulated range for some more time before making a huge move.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin|Ethereum,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|ETH|MARKET|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-18 06:14:22

The purchase, worth an undisclosed sum, followed a $10 million withdrawal from Binance, adding to ongoing speculation about WLFI’s asset management strategy. This latest transaction, first reported by on-chain analytics firm On-Chain Lens, signals a shift in WLFI’s approach, emphasising direct token accumulation. Onchain Lens @OnchainLens · Follow 6 hours ago, A newly created MultiSig wallet by #Trump ‘s World Liberty Finance ( @worldlibertyfi ) has withdrawn $10M $USDC from #Binance and bought 200M $WLFi .Address: 0xe54a7f3714c8d104783b207799d6d9985cd68539Data @nansen_ai 5:13 AM · Feb 18, 2025 15 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The project’s financial activities have drawn scrutiny, particularly given its ties to the Trump family, which retains a controlling stake in WLFI’s revenue. With no tangible DeFi lending services yet in place, questions continue to swirl over WLFI’s endgame—whether it is a legitimate financial venture or a political war chest in disguise. $455M raised, but where’s the utility? Despite branding itself as a decentralised finance (DeFi) lending platform, WLFI has yet to roll out any core financial products. According to a BitMart Research , the project has raised a staggering $455 million in token sales as of February 9, 2025. WLFI’s first public sale brought in $319 million by selling 21.3 billion tokens at $0.015 each, while a second round priced at $0.05 per token secured an additional $136 million. These numbers highlight significant investor interest, but with no lending or borrowing functionalities launched, the token’s actual use case remains unclear. Instead of focusing on DeFi services, WLFI has prioritised asset accumulation. The project now holds an estimated $327 million in digital and centralised exchange assets, suggesting a strategy focused on market positioning rather than practical utility. Source: BitMart WLFI’s asset allocations raise concerns WLFI’s approach to treasury management has sparked debate, particularly due to its concentration of funds in specific assets. Before its latest purchase, WLFI had $47.49 million in stablecoins and had transferred $307.4 million to Coinbase Prime, a move indicating a preference for regulated custodial storage. The platform’s investments also heavily favour Real-World Assets (RWAs) and DeFi protocols. Its exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum remains substantial, aligning with broader trends in the crypto sector. Market analysts argue that WLFI’s asset allocation strategy lacks transparency, particularly given its political affiliations and the control exerted by the Trump family over token revenues. Adding to the intrigue, Justin Sun, founder of TRON, has emerged as WLFI’s largest institutional investor, contributing $75 million. Sun’s involvement deepens WLFI’s ties to established crypto networks, but it also raises further questions about the project’s objectives. WLFI has channelled $63.41 million into Sun-linked assets such as TRX and Wrapped Bitcoin, reinforcing speculation that its financial ecosystem may be more about consolidation than decentralisation. Politics over DeFi? WLFI’s close association with the Trump family has led many to view it less as a financial innovation and more as a politically charged asset. The Trump family’s control over 75% of WLFI’s token sale revenue has intensified scrutiny over whether the project is a legitimate DeFi initiative or merely a mechanism to leverage political influence for financial gain. While crypto-backed political funding is not new, WLFI’s approach differs in scale and execution. By accumulating vast reserves and aligning itself with high-profile figures like Sun, the project presents itself as a power player in both financial and political spheres. Without a clear product roadmap, its status as a DeFi lender remains largely theoretical. As the crypto industry grapples with regulatory scrutiny, WLFI’s next moves will be crucial in determining its long-term viability. Whether the project will finally introduce real DeFi services or continue its asset accumulation remains to be seen. But with $455 million raised, a growing list of influential investors, and direct ties to a high-profile political dynasty, WLFI is unlikely to fade from the spotlight anytime soon.

Table of Contents Dogecoin recent dip casts a shadow of confusion on experts WallitIQ rises with solutions for market dominance Investments pour into WallitIQ amid Dogecoin price instability Amid the latest pullback, the Dogecoin price has ignited fresh debates, with experts dissecting whether it is on the brink of a significant rebound. While some experts see caution, others anticipate renewed momentum driven by rising network activity. Meanwhile, altcoin investments like WallitIQ (WLTQ) simplify market access by making strategic accumulation more accessible. Dogecoin recent dip casts a shadow of confusion on experts The recent dip in the Dogecoin price has elicited contrasting opinions among experts. Some view the decline as a strategic buying opportunity, citing historical data that suggests such corrections often precede significant surges. For instance, seasoned market expert Ali Martinez tweeted some time ago that a 13% dip in the Dogecoin price could lead to a substantial price explosion, referencing past patterns where similar downturns resulted in gains ranging from 9,470% to 30,700%. Conversely, other experts express caution, interpreting the recent downturn as a potential harbinger of further declines. One expert pointed out a bearish double-top formation in the Dogecoin price action, which often signals impending downward movement. This analysis suggests that if key support levels are breached, the Dogecoin price could fall below the $0.29 to $0.30 range. As chaos erupts among experts over the Dogecoin price action, a more promising investment is capturing the market’s attention.

Fantom migrated to Sonic (S) to bolster investor confidence and support stable price performances. FTM trades at $0.6045 after breaking out of a falling symmetrical triangle, and the enhanced network activity supports further gains. Magnified bullish momentum would support price upswings towards $0.85 – a more than 40% increase from the current price. Renewed optimism drives FTM’s recovery Fantom witnessed amplified network activity in the past seven days, with new wallets surging by 35%, according to IntoTheBlock . That reflects enhanced user engagement and growing adoption – catalysts for steady price actions. Also, existing participants displayed enthusiasm, with active addresses up 10% in the past week. IntoTheBlock confirms FTM’s shifting bias to bullish. Besides the positive network growth, the “in the money” metric jumped by over 20%, highlighting more holders in profit at prevailing prices. Source – IntoTheBlock The bullish concentration signals accumulation by dip-pocketed players and retail traders, highlighting their conviction of FTM’s impressive performance in the upcoming sessions. However, the 13% dip in large transactions indicates lessened whale activity within the Fantom ecosystem. FTM price: what’s next The altcoin hovers bullishly at $0.6045 with a 24-hour high and low at $0.6381 and $0.54, respectively. Source – CoinGecko It breached the descending channel’s resistance at $0.56. Stability beyond this level will propel the token towards $0.85, translating to a 40% uptick. Such a performance would magnify optimism, potentially pushing prices beyond the sought-after $1. Fantom might stretch the upside to $1.43 – an approximately 136% increase from the current price. Nevertheless, sudden selling pressure would shift the narrative to bearish. The alt will plunge to $0.56, and failure to hold this footing might call for the $0.40 – $0.45 region. Looming profit booking Also, the emerging profit-taking after the latest gains will delay the anticipated FTM growth. Fantom’s Market-Value Realized Value Short/Long difference has seen a significant dip, demonstrating changing market sentiments. Source – Santiment A decline in this indicator often signals profit-taking from participants who purchased at discounted prices. Such trends highlight looming selling momentum, challenging FTM’s upward movements. Meanwhile, Fantom’s fate depends on it holding above the $0.56 mark. Broad crypto market developments remain vital for the alt’s trajectory. Cryptocurrencies remained indecisive amidst macroeconomic uncertainties. Bearish sentiments like the latest scam project tied to the Argentine government have ruined sentiments. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s trends bring hope. CryptoQuant data shows BTC spot exchange reserves have plunged to record lows. Source – CryptoQuant The metric has seen steep declines since the 2020 – 2022 growth. That means more players withdrawing Bitcoin from crypto exchanges. That signals long-term holding. That will likely diminish selling pressure with few BTC accessible for trading. The declined reserve sparked speculations of potential supply shock that could propel BTC prices similar to previous cycles. Bitcoin uptrends will mean solid moves in the alt space, supporting FTM’s anticipated 40% surge.

Upbit crypto exchange, which controls more than 70% of the local crypto market, has been found in violation of obligations critical to preventing money laundering. Over 700,000 rule violations were discovered during a review of its business license renewal, according to The Korea Times . These violations could lead to fines totaling billions of shillings, with penalties of up to $68,600 for each breach under the country’s Special Financial Transactions Act. Kim Byoung-hwan, FSC governor, emphasized the urgency of the case, stating that a conclusion would be reached swiftly.

The initial mainnet release includes HyperEVM blocks built as part of Layer 1 execution, inheriting security from HyperBFT consensus. It also enables spot transfers between native spot HYPE and HyperEVM HYPE, with HYPE serving as the native gas token. Additionally, a canonical WHYPE system contract, deployed at address 0x555…5, has been introduced to support DeFi applications on the platform. HyperEVM Hits Mainnet In its official announcement , Hyper Foundation said that tooling and analytics may “not be polished” at the launch of the mainnet HyperEVM. However, the foundation assured that many experienced builders are working to improve these areas. To assist them, HyperEVM block data is streamed live to S3, allowing indexing without operating a node. A future network upgrade will enable general ERC20 native transfers and precompiles. The community can provide Feedback on these features during the testnet phase. Although they are already available on testnet, their mainnet rollout is staggered to ensure minimal disruption to current L1 users. The foundation maintained that HyperEVM is composable with the L1 state while not affecting the low-latency trading experience of existing users. “Thank you to all the builders and users who have shared feedback on testnet so far. It will be exciting to see new applications leveraging and building upon the existing on-chain financial system of Hyperliquid.” Hyperliquid Growth So Far Hyperliquid’s native token airdrop went live in late November 2024, which involved the allocation of 310 million HYPE tokens, or 31% of the total supply, to its community. Since then, HYPE’s value has soared from nearly $3.90 to approximately $26 at the time of writing. A month later, Hyperliquid introduced native staking on its mainnet, allowing token holders to earn rewards for helping secure the network. This feature lets users choose validators based on various criteria, including uptime, commission rates, reputation, and community contributions. At launch, the staking system included 16 validators. Meanwhile, data from DefiLlama currently shows that Hyperliquid earned $51.41 million in revenue in January, while its total value locked (TVL) is over $677 million.

Crypto analyst CryptoWzrd (@cryptoWZRD_) recently shared a technical analysis highlighting XRP’s bullish confirmation. According to the chart, XRP has formed a healthy bullish candle following a bullish hammer at a key support level, and the analyst expects a surge to $4.5. XRP'S NEXT RALLY Easy and Clear, $4.50 is coming.. $XRP is closing the week with a bullish confirmation following a hammer from a major WZRD Support.. this is BULLISH New high’s soon pic.twitter.com/L0s4t5hq10 — CRYPTOWZRD (@cryptoWZRD_) February 16, 2025 Technical Confirmation Supports Bullish Outlook XRP has recently seen a strong uptrend, and the latest price action suggests continued gains. The weekly candlestick structure indicates a bullish hammer, followed by a green candle, confirming a potential rally continuation. The presence of this bullish formation at a significant support level further strengthens the argument for a move higher. The analysis highlights XRP’s major support, which has provided a solid foundation for this upward movement. After a bearish turn in early February and a period of accumulation, the price broke out and has continued forming higher lows, a typical sign of sustained bullish momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 $4.5 XRP Price Target Based on Historical Analysis CryptoWzrd maintains a $4.5 target for XRP, a prediction in place since June 2023. With the recent bullish confirmation, the price action aligns with this forecast. The chart suggests that XRP’s next resistance level is around $3.23, and a breakout above this level could accelerate its move toward the $4.5 target. Historically, XRP has exhibited strong rallies after key technical breakouts. The cryptocurrency saw a major surge in late 2024, followed by a consolidation. This recent bullish confirmation indicates that XRP may be entering another upward phase. The digital asset also breached the $3.2 level in January, after rising to a multi-year high of $3.39. With additional bullish factors like the recent SEC acknowledgment of XRP ETF applications , the asset could hit $4.5 soon. The cryptocurrency market has also shown signs of recovery. XRP has historically moved in tandem with major market trends, and continued strength in the crypto sector could further support its rally. XRP is currently trading at $2.66, and a surge to $4.5 would represent a notable 69.2% increase and mark a new all-time high for the digital asset. XRP has risen over 350% from early November 2024. Its spectacular performance over the past few months shows it can easily close the 69.2% gap. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Sniping crypto is a rapidly-executed strategy used by crypto traders to take advantage of price volatility and market inefficiencies, especially with newly launched tokens. This practice usually involves automated bots or specific sniping tools that monitor blockchain activity and quickly place multiple buy or sell orders when specific conditions are met. Sometimes these bots can execute orders within milliseconds once an opportunity to gain big profit opens up. These snipers bots are designed to analyze the mempool – a waiting area for unconfirmed transactions – to predict emerging opportunities when prices are low and take action before regular traders in the broader market can spot them. There are a number of sniping strategies used by traders in the crypto sphere, the most common one being the token launch sniping strategy where bots specifically target new tokens and snatch them up immediately before the prices soar. Another type of sniping crypto is the liquidity snipe, which focuses on waiting for the token to reach significant liquidity for trading. Arbitrage sniping takes advantage of price differences of a certain crypto asset across different trading platforms by choosing the exchange offering the cheapest price on the market. Cross-chain sniping occurs when bots monitor and execute rapid trades on multiple chains simultaneously. There is also MEV sniping, a more complex form of sniping crypto where bots reordering transactions within a block to gain an advantage. This strategy is often employed within Ethereum ( ETH ) or other similar networks. You might also like: MELANIA team tokens worth $39m unlock amidst LIBRA collapse How does sniping crypto affect the market? Sniping crypto can cause major price volatility due to the high number of rapid trading that can bring the price down, similar to the effect seen in pump-and-dump schemes. While sniping can also enhance liquidity because of the heightened trading activity, it can also lead to sudden price fluctuations and abrupt liquidity drops, making it harder for regular traders to place orders at desired prices. Although traders can quickly profit off a new token by using sniper bots, this can potentially leave retail investors and regular traders at a disadvantage as they might not have access to such technology. For example, according data from Bubblemaps, an insider address linked to LIBRA sniped the tokens upon launch and gained a profit of $6 million. The blockchain analysis account accused the creator of taking advantage of their insider knowledge to snipe the coins while prices were low. The LIBRA meme coin collapsed on Feb. 15, losing $4.4 billion in market cap mere hours after its launch. The same thing happened to the Broccoli -themed tokens on Four.Meme, a series of meme coins named after former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s pet dog. A trader gained $10 million by sniping the newly launched meme coin, acquiring around 50% of each Brocolli-themed token supply upon launch.

In a Feb. 18 press release , the firm said its adjusted EBITDA hit £33.6 million, marking a 37% jump. CoinShares chief executive Jean-Marie Mognetti, addressing the firm’s financial results, called it “one of CoinShares’ strongest quarters since inception” as the political landscape changed considerably. “Q4 2024 was arguably the most transformative quarter in digital asset history, marked by groundbreaking policy shifts.

In light of this, we’ve unpacked the best cryptocurrency with self-governance features that, unlike a CBDC, make the most of the power of decentralization. On February 15, Leithner published a policy paper outlining a 10-step strategy aimed at transforming the EU’s Capital Markets Union (CMU) into a Savings and Investments Union (SIU) with a CBDC as its centerpiece. According to Leithner, a permanent digital euro would be a key component of the EU’s financial strategy. It would make financial transactions more efficient and strengthen the EU’s economic autonomy, competitiveness, and innovation. However, some analysts believe a functional, autonomous, and self-governing crypto ecosystem is already in place and that a CBDC represents a step backward. That’s because it can easily be tracked by the issuing government and wouldn’t honor crypto’s ideal of decentralization. Instead of a permanent CBDC, crypto purists argue the EU should use stablecoins pegged to the euro, which would better leverage the self-governing nature of cryptocurrencies. On that note, here are 4 of the best crypto with self-governance features that let you have a say on where the project’s headed. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Official Token of Best Wallet & the Best Crypto with Self-Governance As the name suggests, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native cryptocurrency of Best Wallet , a popular self-custodial crypto wallet with a growing user base of over 500K. In addition to being the only crypto wallet for buying verified crypto presales , Best Wallet is also a multi-currency wallet. This means you can trade just about any cryptocurrency you want. It also supports cross-chain interoperability and will soon include live charts, market news updates, and community sentiment scores to empower its users to make better investment decisions. With so much going for it, it’s no wonder why Best Wallet is confident of capturing 40% of the crypto wallet market by 2026. By becoming a $BEST holder, you’ll unlock special perks within the Best Wallet ecosystem. These include the power to vote on the project’s future, lower transaction fees, and higher staking rewards, as well as priority access to the top new meme coins in presale before anyone else. At the time of writing, the $BEST presale has over $10M in its kitty. You can grab this utility token for just $0.023975 each if you get in now. But hurry up because the price is set to increase in just a few hours. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Revolutionary AI Agent Offering Crypto Investment Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) has the potential to change the way people invest in crypto. After all, it harnesses the power of AI to identify potential 100x opportunities when they’re still in their early days. Essentially, $MIND is a self-evolving and autonomous AI agent that lives on dApps and social media platforms like X. There, it talks to crypto influencers and communities, absorbs all that’s being said about hundreds and thousands of cryptos, and finally, uses hive-mind analysis to drill down to the very best cryptos to invest in . Token holders will not only benefit from AI-powered crypto investment advice, but they’ll also get governance rights and the earliest access to all new cryptocurrencies $MIND creates. If you want to up your crypto game using the power of AI, consider investing in the $MIND presale . It’s currently ongoing and has already raised close to $6.5M. 1 $MIND is currently available at just $0.0033454. 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Fresh Approach to Investing in Meme Coins Navigating the crypto markets can be tough, especially if you’re a traditional trader who’s not accustomed to seeing such violent ups and downs in your portfolio almost every other day. Enter Meme Index ($MEMEX) . This revolutionary new crypto project is changing the way people invest in meme coins. By offering different baskets of the best meme coins , $MEMEX is helping investors diversify across an index of options, making meme coin investing less risky. All the baskets differ in terms of volatility, risk of loss, and profit potential. You can pick one that’s suited to the kind of investor you are. If you’d like a conventional slow-and-steady approach, check out the Meme Titan Index. It’s made up of only well-established meme coins, such as $DOGE and $SHIB. Risk-takers, on the other hand, can go for the Meme Frenzy Index. It contains coins that could explode and multiply your investment. $MEMEX offers self-governance, too, meaning it’ll be the community of token holders who decide on the composition of the baskets and other aspects related to the project’s future. The $MEMEX presale is doing really well. It now has over $3.7M in its kitty, and each token is currently being offered for just $0.0162933. Here’s how to buy Meme Index . 4. PancakeSwap ($CAKE) – Top Governance Token with Positive Momentum on Its Side Another popular cryptocurrency that offers governance rights to token holders in PancakeSwap. Holders of the $CAKE token will have the power to vote on important platform-related decisions, such as new asset listings and fee changes. They’ll also be allowed to contribute to strategic decisions regarding PancakeSwap’s development. The entire concept behind PancakeSwap is one of decentralization. Built on the BNB Chain, it empowers crypto participants to trade tokens without having to use a centralized exchange. $CAKE has a very healthy market cap of over $750M, and it’s currently among the top gainers ( +32% in the last 7 days ) in the space. It’s currently trading at $2.58. Bottom Line Even though the best cryptocurrencies with self-governance features offer unique benefits and huge yield potential, they’re still subject to the overall crypto market’s volatility.

The cryptocurrency has dropped over 12% in the last three days and some analysts suggest it risks a deeper correction to monthly lows. Related Reading: Cardano Price Eyes Impulse Move After Bearish RSI Divergence Was Invalidated, Here’s The Target LIBRA Token Crashes Solana’s Party The Solana network has been the talk of the town this cycle due to the memecoin frenzy, as it has been the go-to chain for these projects. The cryptocurrency has also been one of the leading tokens over the last year, outperforming most altcoins in 2024. Since 2025 started, SOL has shown strength despite the repeated market retraces, holding above key levels, quickly bouncing back, and even hitting its latest all-time high (ATH) of $295 nearly a month ago. Nonetheless, the most recent controversial launch of a Solana-based token has sent SOL’s price into a three-day pullback. On Friday, the Viva La Libertad project was announced alongside the Libra token, receiving the endorsement of Argentina’s President Javier Milei. The project aimed to “encourage Argentina’s economic growth by funding small businesses and startups” and surged to a $4.5 billion market capitalization following the president’s X post. However, it crashed 94% after the team wallets and insiders sold over $100 million worth of LIBRA at the token’s peak, resulting in President Milei’s distancing from the project. After the Libra crash, market sentiment shifted, with some community members expressing exhaustion from the numerous memecoin scams launched in the Solana network during the cycle. As a result, SOL’s price dropped to $190 and hovered within this range until Sunday. As more details of the Libra project came out, Solana dropped another 7.8% to the $180 support zone, sending the price to its lowest valuation in two weeks. Solana Loses $180 Support On Monday morning, the cryptocurrency briefly recovered to the $187 level but was rejected from the nearly one-month downtrend resistance line, as trader Crypto Rand noted. To the investor, there is a “Key squeeze over the main $180 support.” Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Solana remained within its key range. The $180 to $190 crucial zone holds the post-election breakout level and has been a significant bounce range for the cryptocurrency over the past four months. Nonetheless, SOL fell below its key support zone after President Milei retweeted a post about the Libra token on Monday afternoon. The X post explained the steps to invest in the cryptocurrency, briefly sending LIBRA 60% up before retracing 42% after Milei undid his retweet. Since then, Solana has hovered between the $175 to $178 price range, a 6.6 retrace in the daily timeframe. Is The SOL Season Over? Amid SOL’s recent price action, some analysts have pointed out its chart against Ethereum (ETH). According to Daan Crypto Trades, SOL/ETH will be “an interesting chart to watch for the next few weeks.” The trader explained that SOL interest peaked a month ago when the TRUMP memecoin was launched. The series of “scams, rugs, and grifts” during the weak market has destroyed the “on-chain/meme ecosystem,” which had fueled Solana’s “strong tun-up to that point.” Daan argues that “capital [is] rotating from SOL to ETH for the first in a while,” which could see the SOL/ETH trading pair retesting the 2021 ATH level at 0.058. This level has been “pretty influential this cycle” and was a key bounce point in Q4 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Big Breakout? Fed’s “Not QE, QE” Just Flipped The Switch Meanwhile, Michaël van de Poppe considered the valuation of SOL/ETH has topped after a “massive wick created a massive bearish divergence and valuations start to drop.” As a result, “ETH season starts over SOL season” and rotation from Solana towards Ethereum has started. The analysts compared the memecoin frenzy to 2020’s DeFi surge, concluding that the SOL “memecoin fiesta has been an inner-circle money printer for a small group, and everybody knows about it now.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|crypto analyst|crypto market|Crypto trader|ETH|ethereum|Javier Milei|libra|Libra memecoin|Libra token|LIBRAUSDT|memecoin frenzy|Sol|SOL/ETH|Solana memecoin|Solana network|Solana Price|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,SOL|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-18 07:30:07

The company revealed that it had acquired 269 BTC for approximately 4 billion yen, or $26 million. Metaplanet Continues To Bolster Its Bitcoin Reserves Metaplanet, often referred to as “Japan’s MicroStrategy” due to its aggressive Bitcoin treasury strategy, confirmed its latest acquisition of 269 BTC – its first purchase of the year. The transaction cost the company a total of $26 million. This latest purchase has increased the firm’s total BTC holdings to 2,031 BTC, acquired at an aggregate cost of $195 million, averaging $80,674 per coin. Commenting on the development, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich stated: We have completed the first Bitcoin purchase of 2025. We believe this year will be an important one for our company. After a long break, we are glad to resume acquiring Bitcoin. Earlier this year, Metaplanet unveiled an ambitious target of accumulating 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026. To achieve this, the firm announced plans to raise up to $745 million by issuing 21 million shares. In addition to today’s purchase, CEO Gerovich highlighted that the company had generated a BTC yield of 15.3% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. He also noted that Metaplanet has set a quarterly target of 35%. For those unfamiliar, BTC yield is a key performance metric that indicates the percentage ratio of BTC holdings to fully diluted shares over a specific period. It serves a similar function to earnings per share (EPS) for companies with substantial BTC holdings. Gerovich elaborated: It’s the clearest indicator of how effectively we are increasing BPS (Bitcoin Per Share). Our goal is to accelerate Bitcoin accumulation through effective Bitcoin treasury management, maximize BPS using capital market strategies, and thereby enhance shareholder value. Following today’s announcement, Metaplanet’s stock closed the day up 2.2% at 6,040 yen, or $39.88. On a YTD basis, the stock has surged 73.58%, while over the past year, it has delivered an astonishing return of 3,600%. Corporate BTC Purchases In 2025 The year 2025 has already seen significant corporate adoption of BTC. Less than two months in, several companies have added substantial amounts of Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries. For instance, Michael Saylor-led Strategy – formerly known as MicroStrategy – recently added 7,633 BTC to its reserves, bringing its total holdings closer to the pivotal 500,000 BTC mark. This was after the company had already scooped 10,107 BTC in January. Similarly, Semler Scientific acquired 871 BTC earlier this month. At press time, BTC trades at $96,702, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|btc|BTC Yield|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|digital currency|Metaplanet|Strategy,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-18 07:30:19

Accordingly, the TRUMP team announced that they will be giving away 3 TRUMPs worth $50 at their current value to customers who have purchased Trump-branded products in the past months. People who purchase Trump's perfumes, sneakers, cards or watches will benefit from the airdrop. According to the airdrop schedule, TRUMP tokens will be available to claim until March 1. “Trump Official Merchandise Buyers Will Receive 3 TRUMPs.

It was one of the biggest crypto engagement events in crypto history. TRUMP is creating the Largest, Most Powerful Crypto Community the World has ever experienced, and TRUMP is just getting started.” Donald Trump launched his own token, TRUMP, just a few days before his inauguration on January 20. With this move, Trump became the first president to launch a memecoin, and it rose above $75 upon its launch. However, with the subsequent sales, the TRUMP price dropped to $16.

Interestingly, its recent Hyperliquid EVM launch has increased its price by 10%. This update is a part of the bigger Hyperliquid ecosystem expansion and would bring more flexibility and efficiency to its structure. This would also cater to the HYPE price growth, as this was a much-awaited event, as evidenced by the investor’s enthusiasm. Let’s dive deep into that. HYPE Price Turns Bullish With HyperEVM Mainnet Launch The Hyperliquid EVM (HyperEVM) mainnet launch is a significant upgrade that brings general-purpose programmability, allowing innovative Smart contract development and execution, flexibility and efficiency, and much more. It will substantially facilitate seamless transactions, increasing the hype around this blockchain network and native token. HYPE is among the top altcoins in the market and has maintained a significant performance, and this launch has boosted its value. With strong bullish sentiments, the HYPE price surged to $27.32, marking a 10% increase within just ten minutes. This happened as investors’ interest grew, and the trading volume surged nearly 70% to $166.02M per CoinmarketCap . However, it also faced a sharp correction right after that, declining to $26.48 with a market capitalization of $8.84B. Now, the most important thing is the token sustaining this surge. Will HYPE Price Bullish Momentum Continue? The instant correction after launch builds concerns around the trajectory of this Hyperliquid token. The social sentiments and MACD indicate a bullish momentum, as the investors are eyeing further surge. However, the RSI is at 84, signaling overbought conditions. This could bring a potential correction, as it already faced a pullback from the resistance at $28.381. Some experts predict volatility between $25-$27, but a move past this could push the HYPE price to $30. However, with the failure to defend this level, the price could crash down to $22.5. If momentum holds, $30 is the target. Otherwise, look for swings between $25-$27 amidst selling pressure. Stay sharp, volatility is the name of the game, says analysts. Final Thoughts on HyperEVM Launch and Price Action The Hyperliquid EVM is part of this blockchain network’s DeFi adoption plan and ecosystem building. The instant bullish candle formation and 10% surge show the investor’s enthusiasm around this launch, where the $25-$27 level acts as the defining point for further bullish action or drop. Regardless, the HYPE’s demand is anticipated to continue due to constant upgrades and expansion in the Hyperliquid’s ecosystem. Moreover, it is among the few cryptos least affected by the crypto market crash . Investors must be careful around this altcoin in the current scenario.

Structured as a “Commodity-Based Trust,” this filing positions XRP alongside assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, signaling a growing acceptance of XRP in mainstream finance. The move follows a series of developments in the regulatory landscape surrounding XRP ETFs, making this a significant step for institutional and retail investors. Recent Developments in XRP ETFs Momentum for an XRP ETF has been building in recent months. Grayscale Investments recently filed for XRP ETF. The SEC has acknowledged the application, a crucial step that indicates the regulator is open to reviewing the case. In addition, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by major institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, has set a precedent for other digital assets like XRP to gain similar recognition. XRP’s unique positioning as a payment-focused cryptocurrency gives it a compelling use case within financial markets. Implications of MEMX’s Filing on XRP and the Market MEMX’s filing of an XRP ETF has several strategic benefits. First, it enhances accessibility to XRP for a wider investor base. Institutional investors hesitant to purchase cryptocurrencies directly due to regulatory or custodial concerns will now have a regulated and familiar investment vehicle through an ETF. This makes XRP more attractive to hedge funds, asset managers, and retail investors who prefer exposure to digital assets via traditional markets. Secondly, the filing signifies greater market validation for XRP. By listing XRP alongside commodities such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the ETF classification strengthens the perception of XRP as a legitimate financial asset rather than just a speculative cryptocurrency. This could improve investor confidence, encourage further adoption, and drive up demand for XRP in retail and institutional sectors. Liquidity and market stability are also crucial aspects of this development. With the introduction of an ETF, large-scale investment firms can participate in XRP trading without direct exposure to crypto exchanges. This could significantly increase trading volumes, reduce price manipulation, and provide greater liquidity to the market, making XRP less susceptible to extreme volatility. Additionally, the implications for XRP’s long-term value are substantial. Approval of the ETF could establish XRP as a preferred digital asset for cross-border payments and institutional settlements. XRP’s primary use case has always been facilitating efficient and low-cost international transactions, and an ETF would further solidify its role within the financial ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Role of MEMX’s High-Profile Partners in XRP’s Growth The significance of MEMX’s XRP ETF filing is amplified by the backing of its elite consortium of financial giants. MEMX was founded by institutions such as J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Charles Schwab, Morgan Stanley, Jane Street, Optiver, UBS, Virtu Financial, and Wells Fargo, among others. These entities’ collective influence and expertise bring several advantages to the XRP ETF’s potential success. Firstly, MEMX’s robust infrastructure, backed by top-tier financial firms, ensures that the ETF operates on a highly efficient, transparent, and scalable trading platform. This technological edge enhances the security and reliability of XRP trading, attracting more institutional participants. Secondly, these firms bring deep regulatory expertise, which could be instrumental in facilitating the approval process and ensuring compliance with SEC requirements. The involvement of such well-established financial institutions increases the credibility of the ETF and reduces potential hurdles in securing regulatory approval. Finally, market influence plays a crucial role. With institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity involved, the ETF could gain significant traction among global investors. These financial giants’ participation means greater marketing power, better liquidity, and broader adoption of XRP across multiple economic sectors. MEMX’s filing to list an XRP ETF marks a transformative moment in the crypto market, bridging traditional finance with digital assets. With the increasing acceptance of XRP as a commodity-based asset and the backing of some of the world’s most powerful financial institutions, this ETF could propel XRP into mainstream financial adoption. The benefits of enhanced accessibility, market validation, liquidity, and institutional interest all point to a brighter future for XRP. If approved, this ETF could redefine XRP’s role in the global financial landscape, cementing its status as a leading digital asset for payments and investment.

As more platforms start using it, the stablecoin is now gaining traction on the XRP Ledger, challenging Ethereum’s dominance. But what’s driving this growth, and what does it mean for Ripple and XRP? Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Supply Hits 120M According to data from CryptoQuant , the total supply of Ripple’s USD stablecoin (RLUSD) has now crossed $120 million. Notably, the token had already surpassed $100 million in supply back in January, just shortly after its launch. This is seen as a major milestone, especially since RLUSD is a highly regulated stablecoin. https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1891554959356768608 However, recent data suggests that RLUSD is now growing faster on the XRP Ledger, which offers lower transaction fees and greater efficiency. Initially, the stablecoin saw more activity on Ethereum. The stablecoin’s adoption received a boost when it was listed on the high-leverage trading platform Margex. Additionally, RLUSD secured a listing on Zero Hash and became available for trading on Revolut, expanding its reach into mainstream finance. XRP Ledger vs. Ethereum Ripple began test-minting RLUSD on both Ethereum and XRPL in August, a few months before officially launching it. Since then, the distribution has shifted. XRPL now holds around 37.4 million RLUSD, while Ethereum accounts for approximately 83.3 million. While Ethereum still holds the majority, XRPL is growing at a faster pace, indicating that users are finding it a more efficient network for stablecoin transactions. By strengthening RLUSD’s presence on XRPL, Ripple is positioning itself as a major player in blockchain-based financial solutions. How RLUSD’s Growth Could Impact XRP The increased adoption of RLUSD on XRPL has also had a positive impact on XRP’s price and liquidity. As of now, XRP is trading around $2.57 , despite a slight dip of 3% in the last 24 hours. The growth of RLUSD could support a long-term bullish outlook for XRP. Crypto analyst XRP Captain has even suggested that XRP could reach $250 by 2026, calling it the “largest breakout in history.”",News,EN,0,0,XRP|ETH|TRADING|WALLET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-18 07:47:32

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin’s recovery gains traction as Agent A.I. enters the market, blending real AI technology with meme coin hype. Table of Contents Agent A.I. integrates real AI technology with meme coin momentum Dogecoin shows signs of recovery amid market fluctuations Conclusion As interest swells in the cryptocurrency world, speculation grows over Dogecoin’s potential rise. The spotlight is on whether this meme coin can climb to new heights, driven by initiatives linked to Elon Musk’s activities. Enthusiasts and investors are eager to see how this will impact DOGE, especially with the market currently in a bull run. Adding excitement is a new entrant, Agent A.I., aiming to carve its niche. This unique project merges humor with high aspirations, modeled after successful meme coins like PEPE. The intrigue deepens as discussions around these digital currencies continue, drawing attention to the possibilities and future movements of DOGE and its counterparts. Agent A.I. integrates real AI technology with meme coin momentum Agent A.I. is a cryptocurrency project that merges AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins, aligning with two of the most dominant trends in the market. The rise of AI-based crypto projects has drawn significant investor interest, but many tokens rely on AI branding without actual innovation. Agent A.I. differentiates itself by offering genuine AI capabilities while exposing projects that fail to deliver on their claims. Agent A.I. is built as an intelligent and adaptive platform designed to: Process large datasets in milliseconds for better decision-making Scale computational power to match leading cloud services Continuously improve its performance through machine learning The development team is committed to advancing AI functionality while integrating blockchain solutions, ensuring long-term utility in a rapidly evolving market. Agent A.I. has structured its presale to reward early adopters with significant discounts. Stage 1 price: $0.0033 Final presale price: $0.1515 Total presale stages: 28 Early investor discount: 98% This model ensures that early participation offers the best entry points, with prices increasing at each stage. Agent A.I. combines real AI functionality with meme coin virality, positioning itself as a serious contender in the AI-crypto sector. With a limited presale supply and rising price tiers, AGNT presents an opportunity for early investors to capitalize on increasing demand as the project gains traction.

In the past week, it has increased by 7.72%. This rise hints at recovery after a tough month, where the price dropped by 25.25%. Over 6 months, however, Dogecoin’s price has surged by 160.25%, showing strong long-term growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 64.56. This is below the overbought level, suggesting room for further price increases. Continued buying could push the coin toward its nearest resistance at $0.3379. If Dogecoin breaks through the resistance at $0.3379, it may experience significant gains. On the other hand, if the price falls, support may be found at $0.1593. These levels are key for traders. Based on recent trends, Dogecoin might continue to rise. The weekly gain of 7.72% indicates positive momentum. Though the monthly decline urges caution, the impressive 6-month growth suggests potential for further gains. Conclusion Traditional tokens like DOGE may see limited short-term growth despite market optimism. In contrast, Agent A.I. emerges as a new player aiming to outshine fake AI tokens that offer little substance. This genuine memecoin seeks to combine humor with the potential for substantial gains. Agent A.I. adopts a community-driven approach with its presale strategy, offering early supporters significant discounts. With a capped supply of 5 billion tokens and a focus on community engagement, it sets the stage for possible success reminiscent of past memecoin surges. Participating early in Agent A.I.’s mission might be a timely move in the current bullish market. To find out more about Agent A.I., visit the website , Telegram , or X .

Those who previously purchased Trump-branded merchandise—such as perfumes, sneakers, trading cards, or watches—are eligible to receive three TRUMP tokens. At current prices, the airdrop is worth around $50 per email address used for the purchase. The claim window remains open until March 1. https://twitter.com/TrumpCoin1sol/status/1891533042847461693 Why This Airdrop Matters This move strengthens TRUMP’s brand within the crypto space, positioning it as both a collectible and a financial asset for Trump supporters. The airdrop could also boost adoption, attracting new buyers into the ecosystem. Trump-affiliated websites have long sold high-value merchandise, such as the Bitcoin Sneakers, which initially retailed for $500 a pair and later resold for as much as $2,500. TRUMP’s Controversial Journey TRUMP launched just days before Trump took office on January 20, making him the first sitting U.S. president linked to a memecoin. The token skyrocketed from just a few dollars at launch to an all-time high of $75, commanding a $13 billion market cap. However, recent sell-offs and broader market downturns have dragged its price down by over 75% from its peak.

He pointed out how loyal supporters who spent thousands on Trump’s NFTs are now getting just $50 worth of tokens, while those who bought TRUMP on the open market get nothing. Frustrated, he urged the crypto community to stop obsessing over politicians and meme coins and instead focus on real innovation, fundamentals, and utility. While some claim it a was damage control move by Trump’s team. https://twitter.com/thisisksa/status/1891566124963070235 Current Market Performance TRUMP has slipped 8% in the past 24 hours, following the general decline in the crypto market . Despite the dip, the memecoin continues to attract attention, with investors closely watching its next move. With the airdrop adding fresh tokens into circulation, the question remains—will this initiative drive new interest, or will it further increase selling pressure? We have to wait and watch to see how it unfolds in future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

40488132,https://nulltx.com/?p=145119,1739865156,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Dogecoin ($DOGE) Faces Declining Whale Activity and Bearish Signals, Is a Trend Reversal Coming?",https://nulltx.com/dogecoin-doge-faces-declining-whale-activity-and-bearish-signals-is-a-trend-reversal-coming/,"One of the most famous meme coins in the crypto world, Dogecoin ($DOGE), is going through an extended period of stagnation and even appears to be gaining some downside momentum. In recent weeks, whale activity on the Dogecoin network has fallen sharply, dropping nearly 88% since mid-November. This significant drop in whale trading, combined with a few other potentially “not good” for $DOGE signals, has some observers worrying that Dogecoin has entered a bear market. Recent figures indicate that a potential change in market sentiment is underway, with technical signals such as the death cross currently appearing between the market value to realized value ratio and the 200-day moving average, a pattern often linked to price declines. As the price of $DOGE continues to have difficulties, the need for it to break out above some crucial resistance levels and achieve a clean reversal has become all-important not just for the downtrend but also for (and especially for) the restoring of investor confidence in the coin that started as a joke. Declining Whale Activity and Market Sentiment In the past, the price movements of Dogecoin were significantly affected by activities involving large holders of the cryptocurrency. But now, the latest statistics show that transactions involving large amounts of Dogecoin have declined considerably. The number of such transactions has fallen by almost 90% since November 2021. This downward trend is not an isolated development. Dogecoin appears to be experiencing a declining overall interest from both institutions and individuals with deep pockets. Whales, who are usually in charge of moving large amounts of assets, can have a key effect on the price of assets like Dogecoin. When they accumulate, they drive the price up. When they sell, they drive the price down. The amount of activity from whales is akin to the amount of wind produced by a hurricane. The more wind there is, the higher the chance of serious damage. Conversely, a calm period usually means no imminent threat of hurricanes. A decline in the activity of whales could signal that the big players are not as confident as they once were in the future price of Dogecoin. Whale transactions have plummeted as Dogecoin has been sinking. The price of Dogecoin is down, and the lack of support from whale transactions could be a part of that. In the rough million-dollar-plus league, the number of transactions has dropped to about 5 to 10 in the first quarter of 2023, from 25 to 30 in the last quarter of 2022. And despite a short uptick in the last month with about 3 to 5 transactions, we’re back down again. Whether or not this supports or is part of a bear theory for DOGE isn’t clear. #Dogecoin $DOGE remains in a downtrend, forming lower lows and lower highs. A breakout above key resistance is needed to shift momentum! pic.twitter.com/kBomx6RXrG — Ali (@ali_charts) February 16, 2025 The Bearish Technical Indicators In addition to the downturn in whale activity, Dogecoin’s technical indicators are not showing encouraging signs. A death cross has formed wherein the MVRV ratio (Market Value to Realized Value) has crossed below its 200-day moving average (MA). A formation like this has historically happened before steep price declines. The last two times it happened, the price of $DOGE went down by 26% and 44%, respectively. #Dogecoin $DOGE just saw a death cross between the MVRV Ratio and its 200-day MA. The last two times this happened, prices dropped 26% and 44%. pic.twitter.com/G5CslTGuMJ — Ali (@ali_charts) February 17, 2025 One commonly used indicator for assessing asset valuation is the market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio. Death crosses between the MVRV ratio and the 200-day moving average (MA) can give us a hint at the kind of danger that might lie ahead for an asset’s price, as they represent signals that the asset’s market value is becoming increasingly detached from its actual realized value. This kind of cautionary flag can appear on a trader’s chart, suggesting that further price drops could be on the way. One of several bearish signals that suggest major problems are ahead for Dogecoin is the formation of the death cross. Recent price movements show a consistent downtrend, with Dogecoin forming a series of lower lows and lower highs. This pattern indicates that there’s not a lot of buying interest for $DOGE, with each attempted rally being met with stronger selling resistance. The downtrend, and the signals that it’s going to keep going, have a lot of investors asking questions about the health and potential of $DOGE. The Need for a Breakout Currently, Dogecoin’s price momentum is bearish, and it has a long way to go before shifting to bullish. To change the current price momentum, Dogecoin must first clear several key resistance levels. This price action would need to occur for a variety of reasons: easing and possibly reversing selling pressure, renewed interest from the Dogecoin whales, strong social media mojo that would just make folks want to buy the token, or, quite simply, a market that has revisited enthusiasm for Dogecoin as a speculative asset. If Dogecoin does not manage to break out soon, it could continue its downtrend and test lower support levels. The absence of whale support, coupled with what appear to be negative technical signals, leaves the meme coin in a very vulnerable space. To be sure, meme coins like Dogecoin can be highly volatile and are prone to the kind of sudden price swings that could send them in an opposite direction. But at present, the bearish trend seems to suggest that the path of least resistance is down. At present, Dogecoin’s future is unpredictable. If the market mood continues to swing toward caution and if the concentration of assets among the largest holders of Dogecoin remains subdued, then Dogecoin could very well be on its way to post another disappointing performance. However, if something happens to refocus investor interest on Dogecoin and if buy orders come flooding back into the market to push past some key price levels tied to resistance, then could find itself back in the performance lane it was enjoying for most of 2021. To sum up, Dogecoin’s market is at present undergoing a period of sizeable difficulties. Falling whale activity, when viewed alongside bearish technical signals like the death cross, strongly indicates that a downtrend is in place that is hard to dispute. For DOGE to regain any sort of momentum, a drive to breakout above key resistance levels will be necessary, not to mention a renewed fervor for the market in general. Until that happens, the forecast for Dogecoin is at least cloudy, with a sizeable chance of meme-coin capitulation, and has drawn the close scrutiny of investors paid to watch it when they can.

40488243,https://nulltx.com/?p=145118,1739865312,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Whale Makes Major Bet on AAVE: A Bullish Signal for the Market?,https://nulltx.com/whale-makes-major-bet-on-aave-a-bullish-signal-for-the-market/,"In a move that has the crypto community whispering, a deep-pocketed whale wallet (0x755) has just wired a staggering sum to one of the top DeFi lending protocols, AAVE . Over the past half day, the whale has invested 905,242 USDC to purchase 3,530 AAVE tokens at an average price of around 256.46 USD. This latest bold buy brings the wallet’s total AAVE holdings to 6,530 tokens, now worth a solid 1.65 million USD. The whale’s price target seems to be in excess of half a million bucks—526,000 USD to be exact, for about a 8.77% gain—because AAVE’s price right now is less than 256.46 USD, and way less if you consider the price was around 260 just before the whale made his big buy. This move comes on the heels of a series of strategic acquisitions over the past few months, with the whale accumulating a total of 22,953 AAVE between November 2024 and February 2025. The accumulation took place via CoW Swap, with an average price of $260.76 per token, for a total expenditure of about $5.99 million. Importantly, the whale has already locked in substantial profits by selling 16,424 AAVE tokens at an average price of $293.43, which allowed them to secure a net profit of $4.82 million. With this latest purchase, it seems the whale is doubling down on their bullish outlook for AAVE, suggesting they believe the token still has significant upside potential. Whale’s Strategy: A Long-Term Bullish Outlook The recent movements of the whale have driven a great deal of speculation over AAVE’s future and whether this large-scale buy could signal a market trend. For some, the whale’s latest investment is a potent sign of confidence in AAVE’s long-term value. After all, making a multi-million dollar investment in a single asset, particularly after locking in profits from previous trades, suggests a view that AAVE’s value will go up and not down. Whale Goes Big on $AAVE —Bullish Move Incoming? A sharp-eyed whale (0x755) just dropped 905,242 USDC to scoop up 3,530 AAVE at an average price of $256.46 in the past 12 hours. With this latest buy, the whale now holds 6,530 AAVE worth $1.65M, sitting on a sweet $526K profit pic.twitter.com/TZR6Tqqpla — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) February 17, 2025 The strategy employed by the whale over the past few months portrays it as a patient, long-term investor with a clear bullish outlook. Between late 2024 and early 2025, the whale accumulated a substantial number of AAVE, possibly positioning it for a price upturn. While capitalizing on price fluctuations to time the market, the whale has already made good on a large part of its AAVE holdings, which it sold at an average price significantly higher than what it is paying to buy back into the market now. This recent buyback move was made with the whale acquiring a good number of AAVE tokens at a price the trader itself seemingly deems a bargain. To have acquired the size of a position the whale now holds in AAVE during a period when the price was mostly just consolidating speaks volumes about a belief that could be held: AAVE is undervalued. AAVE’s future in decentralized finance appears bright to the whale. AAVE’s Strong Position in DeFi Those who keep a close eye on the DeFi space know that AAVE has caught the attention of big investors like this whale. AAVE is one of the top-tier platforms when it comes to decentralized lending and borrowing. It allows users to not only earn interest on their crypto holdings but also to take out loans in a manner that’s safe and sound because their assets are used as collateral. As the DeFi space keeps amassing wealth and power, platforms like AAVE are at the very center—no, the core—of what’s happening in that space, serving as a linchpin in the decentralized financial system and offering a variety of smooth-running, innovative products to users. AAVE’s possible ongoing expansion looks set to be powered by something quite different from what drove its initial wave of growth. Increasingly, retail and institutional investors alike are adopting the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. As these different groups adopt what are still niche-use applications, the overall “look” of DeFi is maturing; as its appearance has improved, so has its opportunity to capture traditional investors. AAVE sits in the DeFi niche, and in this context, it’s one of the key players that provide “look better” opportunities to DeFi’s potential new users. Moreover, the governance token model of AAVE lets holders take part in the decision-making that concerns the future development of the protocol. This decentralized way of operating seems to be what attracts both individual and institutional investors in AAVE—people who see long-term value in being able to steer a major financial platform in a given direction. AAVE’s Price Action and Future Outlook In examining the price action of AAVE, the recent price movement indicates that it is in the middle of a consolidation phase, hovering around the $250-$260 range. This consolidation could mean that the market is building up momentum for the next major move. As the whale’s recent purchase shows, some investors believe that AAVE is currently undervalued and poised for a major breakout over the next few months. AAVE’s price action also reflects the overall state of the market. After the widespread chaos of 2023, the cryptocurrency market seems to be stabilizing. If enough bullish sentiment returns to the market, it isn’t unreasonable to think that AAVE could participate in the kind of resurgence that many tokens could experience. More than just a market dynamic play, though, AAVE has so many solid fundamentals and so much potential that it could emerge as a major player in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the future of finance in general. To wrap up, whale wallet 0x755’s large purchase of AAVE signals what some might call “whale confidence” in the token’s long-term potential. The same address, which now boasts 283,719 AAVE (worth about $689 million), has equally impressive trading moves in its recent history. Accumulating AAVE during a long consolidation from May to October 2022, the whale then offs traded part of its AAVE holdings at higher price points, securing somewhere around $1.3 billion in profits when taking into account the price of AAVE during those trade executed moments.

Ex-Binance CEO Sparks Debate Over BNB Chain Influence,https://coinpaprika.com/news/cz-s-crypto-comeback-ex-binance-ceo-sparks-debate-over-bnb-chain-influence,"CZ’s online activity is fueling speculation as he continues discussing BNB Chain , even after officially leaving Binance. The trading volume of BNB Chain briefly overtook Solana but later settled in third place behind Ethereum and Solana. While some credit CZ with driving Binance’s growth, critics accuse him of encouraging risky speculation. Despite stepping down in 2023 as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) remains a key figure in the crypto industry . He had publicly committed to focusing on Giggle Academy, his free educational initiative, but his frequent discussions about BNB Chain suggest he still holds sway over Binance’s ecosystem. As part of his legal deal, CZ agreed never to manage Binance again. After his release, he emphasized his commitment to Giggle Academy, a project aimed at providing global access to learning materials and helping young people avoid crypto scams. Before his arrest, he had actively promoted the initiative. “There are always more opportunities in the future than in the past… Giggle Academy has been going well and will be a big part of my life for the next few years… I will also dedicate more time and funding to charity (and education). I have some rough ideas… Oh, Binance seems to be doing well without me back-seat driving, which is excellent. Every founder’s dream,” CZ shared on X after his release. However, his actions tell a different story—BNB Chain remains a frequent topic of his online discussions. His interest in the project has led to BNB Chain’s trading volume surpassing Solana , at least temporarily. On February 16, crypto educator Crypto with Khan highlighted that BNB Chain’s 24-hour trading volume had exceeded Solana’s. CZ shared data from DeFiLlama showing that Binance Smart Chain (BSC) had even surpassed Solana in weekly volume. However, Solana has since reclaimed its second-place position, with BNB Chain now trailing behind both Ethereum and Solana. CZ’s continued involvement in the crypto space has drawn mixed reactions. Supporters see him as a visionary who remains crucial to Binance’s success. “What is happening with BNB Chain right now proves that a true dragon cannot be caged! CZ was jailed for four months and forced to leave Binance unfairly. He returned, took a short break, and is now focusing on BNB Chain. It’s already making waves under his influence, and the momentum is just beginning,” wrote Da Viking, a Floki core advisor. However, others argue that his actions are reckless, fueling unsustainable speculation. DeFi researcher Leviathan accused CZ of creating a speculative frenzy. “Congrats CZ, you drove hundreds of millions in volume on BNB while thousands of fake meme coins popped up, rinsing and rugging investors for millions,” he wrote. This criticism aligns with concerns that his tweets often lead to short-lived investment hype with little long-term value. CZ himself admitted that people tend to overanalyze his posts, reading into even casual mentions of certain projects. This followed backlash over a surge in meme coins and AI-related tokens after he posted about them. Amid this ongoing debate, Binance Labs has recently rebranded as YZi Labs , which CZ described as an effort to expand its vision. However, many speculate that this move could be a loophole allowing CZ to maintain influence without officially violating his ban from Binance management. While YZi Labs is presented as independent, some believe it offers CZ a way to remain deeply involved in the crypto space. Despite these controversies, BNB’s price has fluctuated, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding CZ’s role. Whether he remains a stabilizing force or a risky catalyst for speculation remains a key discussion within the industry.",,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|SOL|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-18 07:57:11

The artwork is called ""X.Masquerade"" and is the sixth chapter in the ""Story of Luci."" It ties into into an upcoming invite-only event that allows supporters to participate in a game by purchasing a ""Mask of Luci"" for 2.56 ETH ($6,800). ""We’re proud to stand beside him [Sam Spratt] and help share Masquerade with the world. It is our way of honoring Sam’s trust, the monumental work he’s created, and—above all—the shared values that underpin it,"" Kanbus posted on X The purchase comes alongside a timely boost to the NFT sector following a marketing push from NFT platform OpenSea that includes a token airdrop . Trading volume hit $40 million over the past 24 hours, a 29% rise on the previous day according to CoinGecko . However, the NFT market as a whole has failed to replicate the dizzying heights of previous cycles; activity is down and general sentiment is also waning as floor prices of collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club and are down by 71% and 91% respectively. Much of the market's plight is connected to this cycle's $73 billion rise of memecoins, which retail investors appear to prefer due to minimal transaction fees, more liquidity and a lower barrier for entry. But perhaps Kanbas' $3 million purchase demonstrates a maturing of the NFT market away from speculative profile picture (PFP) collections and towards real art, the value of which lies in the adoration of a few as opposed to the attention of many. The rapid growth of NFTs in 2022 was addictive; it captured millions of participants and racked up billions of dollars in weekly volume, but the market itself was unsustainable. When underlying assets used to purchase digital art began to tumble, NFT collectors attempted to cut losses by undercutting other sellers —creating a liquidity crunch and eventual cascade. All speculative bubbles pop at some point, the majority of 2017 ICO tokens are no longer operational but the ones that still exist are worth billions. For NFTs it now seems less about the monetary value and 'get rich quick' aspect and more about the cultural and creative value of the art itself.",Finance|NFT|non-fungible token|Non-Fungible Tokens,EN,0,0,MARKET|AIRDROP|BUSINESS|ETH|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-18 07:59:33

A Sharp Trader’s Big Win Raises the Question,https://nulltx.com/is-it-time-to-take-profits-on-arc-a-sharp-traders-big-win-raises-the-question/,"Lately, the cryptocurrency industry has been abuzz with the story of $ARC’s rise, a token that has seen a meteoric increase in value in recent months. As it continues to surge impressively, one sharp trader by the name of BjD4f in the crypto community has captured the spotlight for making some serious gains off $ARC and, more importantly, for actually realizing those gains in the form of cashing out. BjD4f offloaded 700,000 $ARC tokens for a total of $182,280 USDC, at a price of $0.26 per token. And now, the obvious question on many investors’ minds is: Should we be taking profits on $ARC as well? The $ARC token had an extraordinary run, and BjD4f (the trader) made a profitable move because of it. In December 2024, he purchased 2.575 million tokens at an average price of $0.03523 apiece. That means his total investment was just $90,700. But after two months, he cashed out 1.772 million of those tokens at an average price of $0.276 per token. So, what he did in between was hold on to the tokens and watch their value grow quite substantially—enough to net him a 6.5x return on his investment. The $ARC token has increased almost 19% in the past 24 hours, and its price action suggests that the momentum is not over yet. But with such substantial profits already in the bag, we have to ask: Is it time to take the profits, or is there still more upside left for $ARC? Analyzing the Surge: Is $ARC Heading Higher? The strong advance of ARC has garnered the attention of traders and investors, with the token recently increasing 18.85% in just 24 hours. Such a sharp increase in price over such a short time frame usually brings a lot of attention and is often a sign of increased interest in the market. The attention from traders and investors has, of course, been very good for the price of ARC and for anyone holding it. But it has also brought with it some questions, which I will attempt to answer here with a mix of facts, figures, and a bit of speculation. The continued expansion of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector powers the ARC surge. Within DeFi, ARC has emerged as a serious contender. As user demand for DeFi solutions like lending, borrowing, and trading grows, ARC has attracted both retail and institutional investors. The surge itself appears to be the product of both continued strength among DeFi tokens more generally and still-present interest in ARC specifically. If interest continues and even grows among DeFi users, the price gains we’ve seen over the past two days could stretch over a future return period as well. Any seasoned investor knows that markets are unpredictable, and the risk of a correction following a rapid rise is always a possibility. The recent performance of $ARC is impressive; it would take the average investor a long time to achieve what the token has done in just a few short months. Still, we need to ask ourselves whether the current price levels reflect the true, intrinsic value of the token or if we’re experiencing a speculative rally driven by a good old-fashioned hype train. The Decision to Take Profits For BjD4f, the action of selling 700,000 $ARC at $0.26 a token was a clear, profit-locking, risk-reducing move. With a 6.5x return on their initial investment, this trader has made a significant gain and, I suspect, is quite happy with their recent profits considering they still hold a sizable position of 800,000 $ARC. This sell-off could serve as a reminder to other traders that turning points in market are barely detectable until they are well underway. Taking profits in the face of recent price increases is a strategy that can help one preserve gains. ARC Rally! Is It Time to Take Profits? A sharp trader, BjD4f, just offloaded 700K $ARC for $182,280 USDC at $0.26 per token, locking in solid gains. But is it time for you to book profits too? pic.twitter.com/Z4HbjVE9cT — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) February 17, 2025 Realizing profits—especially after such a powerful price upswing—may also be a way to hedge against the risk of a price pullback. As the old saying goes, “buy low, sell high,” and with $ARC approaching (and even exceeding) its recent highs, the risk of a pullback could be more pronounced if traders keep looking to cash in on the upswing. Even so, there are also factors that indicate $ARC may keep climbing. The 18.85% surge in the last week demonstrates there is a strong push in the market, and if that push is being carried by increased interest in the DeFi sector, $ARC may just keep rising. For now, that puts it in the bucket of “tokens that have appreciated of late but whose long-term viability is very much in question.” Conclusion: To Sell or Not to Sell? Deciding whether to take profits or hold onto $ARC ultimately comes down to each investor’s risk tolerance and investment strategy. For those who entered the market early and have already seen big gains, selling some or all of their position may be a very smart way to go and secure those profits. For others who are more in the buy-and-hold camp and believe in the long-term prospects of ARC, taking the route of holding onto their tokens and hoping for them to appreciate further may be the way to go. One thing is for sure: $ARC has afforded early investors with spectacular returns, and the recent upsurge in the market has made it clear that there is still a lot of interest in the token. Whether $ARC will keep climbing or not is anyone’s guess, but for traders like BjD4f, who are still holding a lot of the asset, taking some profits while retaining what looks to be a pretty substantial position seems to make a lot of sense in this current market setup. To sum up, with a really good history of making money and a recent price upswing, ARC finds itself at an intriguing crossroads. Investors who might be tempted to buy now along with many wholesale investors will need to consider a number of factors: present market conditions, their individual risk profiles, and the project’s long-run prospects. And those who might prefer to wait for what could be the next price dip would need to re-evaluate the situation with the same factors. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Decentralized Networks Challenge Big Tech,https://coinpaprika.com/news/depins-the-future-of-telecom-decentralized-networks-challenge-big-tech,"DePINs are transforming telecommunications by introducing decentralized, community-powered networks. These innovative systems tackle the biggest flaws in traditional telecom, making connectivity more accessible and reliable. The technology is also expanding into sectors like AI, gaming , and supply chains. The telecom sector faces constant challenges, from expensive infrastructure upgrades to inconsistent coverage in remote areas. As a result, consumers are looking for better alternatives that guarantee fair access to the internet. Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) offer a solution to the issues linked to traditional telecom companies. Experts from Huddle01, Impossible Cloud Network, and Aethir have shared insights on how these blockchain-based networks break down barriers to connectivity. Traditional telecom networks have long relied on massive infrastructure projects requiring substantial funding. Because of this, governments and large corporations typically dominate the industry. DePINs are flipping this model by decentralizing control. Using distributed ledgers and token-based incentives, they allow community members to contribute and maintain a shared network. Service providers receive digital tokens as rewards for keeping networks operational. Smart contracts automate the entire process, ensuring seamless connectivity, secure transactions, and efficient network management. “ DePINs reimagine telecom infrastructure by embracing decentralization and community participation. Instead of relying on a single provider, they use a distributed network of contributors, making it easier to scale. They’re also more cost-effective, using underutilized resources like excess bandwidth and storage,” explained Ayush Ranjan, CEO at Huddle01. The demand for decentralized networks is growing rapidly. Recent reports indicate that DePIN revenue skyrocketed to over $500 million in 2024—a staggering 100-fold increase from two years prior. The number of active DePIN projects has nearly doubled, with these networks now representing a significant share of the overall crypto market. More than 13 million devices globally support DePIN operations each day. Industry leaders predict this trend will only accelerate. “This model gives DePINs the potential to surpass centralized networks run by tech giants like Google , Microsoft, and Facebook by hundreds, if not thousands, of times in the next 15 years. It might not be as flashy as meme coin trading, but it’s fundamentally changing the game,” said Kai Wawrzinek, CEO of Impossible Cloud Network. Today, DePINs collectively hold a market capitalization exceeding $23 billion, with daily trading volumes surpassing $2 billion. Leading projects in this space include Bittensor, Render, Filecoin, Theta Network, and The Graph. The push for decentralized telecom reflects a growing need for fairer and more inclusive internet access. Traditional telecom models often favor urban centers, leaving rural regions underserved. This became evident during the pandemic when students in remote areas struggled with online learning due to poor connectivity. Large telecom providers also tend to concentrate control, setting high service prices and limiting competition. Expanding coverage to less populated areas requires massive investment, making these locations less attractive for traditional providers. “Centralized telecom providers prioritize urban areas, leaving rural regions behind. Their business model focuses on profitability rather than universal service, which leads to major gaps in access,” noted Kyle Okatomo, CTO at Aethir. In addition to coverage limitations, security risks are a major concern in traditional telecom models. “Centralized data storage creates a single point of failure. This makes them prime targets for cyberattacks. Just think about the AT&T breach last year, which exposed sensitive information of 73 million customers,” Wawrzinek pointed out. Given these flaws, DePIN networks are gaining traction as a more efficient and secure alternative. Wawrzinek believes that DePINs represent a fundamental shift in ownership and control. “The goal is simple: take power away from a centralized entity and hand it back to the community.” By allowing users to create and manage their own networks, DePINs make internet access more decentralized. Instead of relying on large corporations, individuals can set up small, local connectivity hubs. Users pay for the bandwidth they consume, while those who contribute to the network receive compensation in return. A recent study highlighted how projects like Helium Mobile, DAWN, and WiFi Map are using token-based models to make connectivity more efficient. Helium allows users to operate decentralized wireless nodes, DAWN enables individuals to act as internet service providers, and WiFi Map rewards global WiFi sharing. “These models encourage active participation from both service providers and consumers. Instead of paying upfront for ownership, people earn ownership through contributions,” Ranjan explained. However, achieving mainstream adoption will require policy coordination and regulatory clarity. As DePINs continue to expand, they are gaining recognition from institutions. Harvard Business School recently added DePIN strategies to its curriculum, further legitimizing the concept. Regulatory uncertainty remains a challenge, though. Some governments and regulators remain skeptical of DePINs due to their association with cryptocurrencies. One example is the recent lawsuit against Nova Labs, the company behind the Helium Network. U.S. regulators accused the firm of misleading investors and violating securities laws. “Regulation is necessary for DePINs, but it has to be well thought out. Instead of blanket lawsuits, authorities need to engage in open discussions to understand these networks. We need clear guidelines around tokenomics, privacy, and infrastructure deployment—but we don’t need endless legal battles that slow down innovation,” Wawrzinek emphasized. Beyond regulation, improving public awareness and education is key to driving adoption. Many people still struggle to understand how DePINs work, making onboarding difficult. “The technical aspects of DePINs can be intimidating for newcomers. If we want mainstream adoption, we need to simplify the process,” Ranjan noted. Scalability is another concern. As these networks grow, they need to maintain efficiency and prevent congestion. Some projects are already addressing this by using advanced blockchain solutions like Layer-3 technology to enhance performance. Despite these hurdles, DePINs hold vast potential. Their decentralized approach is not limited to telecom; it is also being adopted in energy grids, supply chains, and AI infrastructure. Some developers are integrating AI to optimize efficiency, while others are applying the model to gaming, marketing, and retail industries. “ DePINs have the power to replace centralized systems and make them more efficient. They’re already disrupting telecom, but the impact extends far beyond that. If interoperability improves, DePINs could revolutionize multiple industries. Instead of benefiting corporations, individuals will reap the rewards. It’s time for big tech to adapt,” Wawrzinek concluded. If DePINs can navigate their current challenges, they may usher in a new era of decentralized infrastructure, reshaping industries worldwide.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|THETA|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-18 08:03:14
40488477,https://nulltx.com/?p=145116,1739865833,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Whale Deposits $7.3 Million Worth of $ONDO into Coinbase: Is a Rebound on the Horizon?,https://nulltx.com/whale-deposits-7-3-million-worth-of-ondo-into-coinbase-is-a-rebound-on-the-horizon/,"In a significant action in the crypto world, a whale has moved 5.82 million $ONDO tokens —worth a staggering $7.3 million—onto Coinbase, which is the largest crypto exchange in the world. This was noted by the on-chain analyst Onchain Lens, who shared the finding on the social media platform X. As is so often the case when a crypto whale takes a big action, this one has sparked a lot of speculation. Is the whale about to dump $ONDO on the market, which would obviously cause the price to go down? Or is the whale’s action something else entirely? Whale’s Profitable Move A whale’s recent decision to deposit a whopping $5 million plus into Coinbase serves as an attention-grabber on a couple of different levels. First, it highlights an intrinsic and potentially growing interest in the $ONDO token. After all, it would be one thing for an investor in $ONDO to place $5 million in the “savings account” that is Coinbase, but it’s another reality entirely for a whale to make that kind of move with that amount of token in question. Whale deposits $7.3M worth of $ONDO into Coinbase On-chain analyst Onchain Lens reported on X that an anonymous whale deposited 5.82 million ONDO ($7.3 million) into Coinbase Exchange. The whale had accumulated these tokens between March 26 and Oct. 4 last year for $5.04… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) February 17, 2025 I mean, really, when you think about it, you are not seeing that happen with many other tokens on the market today. Also, while we’re here on the surface, note the timing of this deposit. Could the whale be getting ready to take profits? $ONDO Shows Potential for a Rebound The situation is getting a more bullish take from analyst Ali Martinez, who now sees $ONDO as potentially poised for a rebound. “The TD Sequential indicator on the 4-hour chart for $ONDO is currently flashing a buy signal,” he said, speaking in the current tense, as if embodying an independent analyst. The indicator, of course, is not an independent voice, but a popular (and somewhat mysterious) technical analysis tool that traders use to identify possible trend reversals. Martinez is saying he sees a price rally for $ONDO in the short-term as possible, particularly if upward momentum is evident in the immediately succeeding hours and days. $ONDO looks ready to rebound, as the TD Sequential indicator flashes a buy signal on the 4-hour chart! pic.twitter.com/PLRcXDWB1m — Ali (@ali_charts) February 16, 2025 This favorable technical sign has prompted a number of people to guess that the whale’s deposit might be a sign that demand for $ONDO is about to go up in a big way. If other traders and investors parallel the whale and start to accumulate $ONDO, we could see an uptick in trading volume and, potentially, an increase in the price of the token. Also, the whale’s hefty deposit might attract the attention of larger institutional players who watch the moves of significant investors on exchanges like Coinbase. Market Sentiment and Investor Behavior Movement of large amounts of cryptocurrency, particularly when it comes to deposits and withdrawals, tends to reflect the kind of broad market sentiment that you see with natural persons (“people”) or institutional investors. In the case of $ONDO, the Whale appears to have deposited 5.82 million tokens into Coinbase exchange recently. This could be interpreted in a number of productive ways. On one hand, it might suggest that the Whale is getting set to take some profits by selling a portion of that which he holds on the exchange. On the other hand, this is a lot of tokens to just have sitting in an exchange when you consider trading volume. So the Whale could actually be positioning for a big move in the opposite direction. For investors who are closely tracking $ONDO, it is not enough to just watch the whale. One must also take into account the broader market context. The crypto market is notoriously volatile. While it is always nice to have positive technical indicators—like the TD Sequential buy signal—that one can point to as the basis for expecting an asset to move up, it is also prudent to consider what else might be bubbling under the surface of the crypto space. The direction of $ONDO’s price could be affected by registration developments, by macroeconomic trends, or by shifts in the sentiment of professional and retail investors, among what seem to be a rapidly dwindling number of both. What’s Next for $ONDO? Although retail traders and large investors are now paying attention to $ONDO, it is still uncertain whether the token will maintain its current momentum or reverse course. A deposit from a whale into Coinbase and some bullish technical signals suggest that $ONDO might be poised for price appreciation. Yet, it’s worth remembering that the crypto market can and does move quickly, and large price moves usually happen in tandem with some sort of event or piece of news. Always be cautious when trading, especially in an asset that is as volatile as $ONDO. Over the next few days, $ONDO’s price action is likely to be closely followed by traders and investors. They will be looking to see if the TD Sequential indicator buy signal will translate into a meaningful uptick in price. Another thing to keep an eye on: any large movements by whales, like additional deposits or withdrawals, which could also serve as a fine-tuning signal for prospective $ONDO traders and investors. Whales and technical indicators can always provide useful insights, but the crypto market is still a wild card. Investors in $ONDO need to be prepared for and accept the volatility that the asset class can throw at them, as well as consider with great care what investment strategy related to $ONDO serves their needs best. Conclusion A prominent whale has deposited 5.82 million $ONDO tokens into Coinbase, a move that has elicited considerable interest from the crypto community, especially when you consider the whale’s unrealized profits. Recent price signals from $ONDO have led some analysts to believe a potential rebound in the token’s price is underway. The crypto market’s volatility, however, necessitates caution. Large price-moving investors often trail-blaze market trends, but their actions shouldn’t be read as gospel when it comes to making profitable trades. At the moment, all eyes are on $ONDO to see if it can turn a series of recent bullish signals into a meaningful price rally. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

On the social media platform X, Hunter Horsley lists seven reasons why he expects Bitcoin to witness a massive breakthrough this year. According to Horsley, he expects Bitcoin to see more capital inflows this year from institutions, nation-states, sovereign wealth funds and other blue-chip investors. “This year you’re going to see: 1. More flows into ETFs 2. More corporates buying more Bitcoin 3. More nation states buying more Bitcoin 4. US Wealth Management buying for clients 5. Banks and FIs (financial institutions) launching services to help clients access Bitcoin 6. Regulators creating productive clarity 7. The world (geopolitics, monetary policy, etc.) increasingly in circumstances that drive the need for Bitcoin And, you’re going to see more reputable people revealing their convictions in Bitcoin. It’s going to be a watershed year.” Horsley also says that the stage is being set for Bitcoin to witness widespread adoption and ascend to a seven-figure price level. “People are wildly underestimating the massive leaps Bitcoin is going to take into the mainstream this year. Never been more optimistic… What’s the current best argument for why Bitcoin isn’t going to be widely adopted and go to $1 million? I see more and more evidence of why it will and less and less of why it won’t.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $96,243.

They have “burned” over $600,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) and donated more than $2.7 million in various forms of cryptocurrency to that many believe are charity organizations and foundations. These donations are intriguing enough, but what makes this situation truly mysterious is the odd and unclear message that they have attached to this amazing act of financial generosity. Mysterious Donations and Charitable Contributions Comprising both donations and burns, the total sum of Hu LeZhi’s acts of generosity might seem impressive at first glance. However, I maintain that it’s a bit unsettling when you consider it more closely. Actually, it begins with impressive numbers: Hu burned 500 $ETH and donated 25% of the incredibly large sum of 83 million dollars. That’s a lot of charity, and a lot of $ETH removed from circulation. But Hu’s not done raising questions about why he does what he does. Following those two big acts, Hu donated even more to even “worthier” causes, seemingly stirring the pot of intrigue around his motivations as he dons the beggar’s cloak and doles out Ethereum to various allegedly noble causes. A hefty 711 $ETH, worth close to $1.91 million, was dispatched to WikiLeaks, the internationally infamous non-profit best known for its perilous whistleblowing work. This tremendous donation could come across as an open endorsement of WikiLeaks’ audacious and legally controversial mission. You could argue, since issuing a donation in cryptocurrency could well be seen as a political gesture, that Hu LeZhi is standing in solidarity with WikiLeaks and its legally beleaguered work. Another big donor stepped up when Hu LeZhi sent 700 $ETH (around $1.87 million) to Endaoment. The organization he selected is quite a bit different from most of the Chinese state-affiliated actors who have made headlines for recently donating to U.S. charities. Those stories have raised alarms about Chinese influence in the U.S. But unlike Hu and those other state-affiliated givers, most Chinese cryptocurrency fans aren’t channeling their donations through organizations that are under the aegis of any particular state. An unknown programmer named 'Hu LeZhi' burnt 600 $ETH and donated 1411+ $ETH to a charity organization. He also sent 133 $ETH to @ethereumfndn with the message: ""At present, a new crime model of enslaving victims has emerged. The victims’ desires and senses are gradually… pic.twitter.com/sMKSMc68rE — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) February 17, 2025 The Cryptic Message: A Call for Awareness or a Warning? Even with all the generosity, the most troubling part of this story comes in the form of a mysterious message that accompanied a donation of 133 $ETH ($354K) to the Ethereum Foundation. The message, which was sent along with the donation, reads as follows: Currently, a new crime model has emerged that allows for the enslavement of victims. The desires and senses of the victims are taken away from them gradually until they become completely subservient to a digital machine. If I ever become a victim in the last stage of this crime, I will choose to die because living like that would not be worth it. The reason I would opt for death over life in this scenario is that I have military-grade brain-computer chips implanted in my skull. All military powers today use base stations, radios, and nano brain-computer chips to control all citizens, and I’m one of their many test subjects. This unusual and disconcerting communication seems to serve as a warning or a personal declaration, and it addresses several familiar concerns. First, there seems to be the basic fear, not entirely unfounded, that military powers are using technology to gain ever more control over citizens. In particular, brain-computer interfaces, or “BCIs,” are clearly something that Hu LeZhi imagines could be used in a very Orwellian manner. Next, too, there is the basic human concern with loss of autonomy and being forced to serve someone else’s agenda. The idea that a human programmer could be made to serve a power-mad authority is certainly worthy of a sci-fi story, and maybe even a nightmare or two. Some people think that this message could be a form of protest against what they see as excessive technological encroachment, especially regarding the burgeoning influence of AI and brain-computer interfaces. The veracity of these claims is hard to pin down. Still, the very notion that technology could be used to control or subordinate people strikes a chord with many critics of surveillance capitalism and our society’s obsession with collecting vast amounts of data. What Does This All Mean? Questions remain unanswered about what Hu LeZhi is really up to. The truly amazing charitable donations are one thing; the equally amazing decision to burn hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Ethereum is another. Where is Hu LeZhi going with this? What kind of message is (s)he trying to communicate? And do the crazy seemingly contrasting actions amount to any kind of protest against the alt-universe of crypto with its promises of a free, unfettered digital future, as well as a form of damnation for the brave new world of digital surveillance (and, in any case, a digital future controlled by a very small number of big global players, either in the free or the controlled world)? Although we might never completely grasp the reasons driving Hu LeZhi’s actions, one thing is evident: This maneuver has made an indelible mark on the crypto community and others. The impression left by cryptocurrency as it applies to charitable giving is sure to be a topic of conversation for some time, as is the growing sophistication of the digital systems that watch over—better said, watch into—our lives. At present, Hu LeZhi’s clandestine donations and obscure message are a reminder of the might of digital currencies and the worldwide influence they convey. But they also caution us to be on guard about the unexpected effects of technology in a world that’s changing faster than ever. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

By 2028, LINK could reach a maximum price of $102.75. In 2031, Chainlink will range between $256.84 to $319.36. Chainlink (LINK) emerged as a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market. It provides a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts with real-world data. As the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain technology continues to grow, Chainlink’s innovative solutions have attracted significant attention from investors, and developers alike. Chainlink continues to expand its reach, and utility across the blockchain ecosystem, showcasing its robust integration capabilities. Recent updates highlight 14 new integrations of 5 Chainlink services across 10 different blockchain platforms, including prominent names like Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Ethereum. These integrations enhance Chainlink’s network and solidify its position as a critical player in decentralized applications’ interoperability and functionality. Understanding Chainlink’s potential price movements involves analyzing market trends, technological advancements, partnerships, and overall market sentiment. This chainlink price history prediction aims to provide insights into its future performance by examining technical analysis, and fundamental aspects that could influence its value.

Whale transactions down 78% since November. Breakout is expected as volatility indicators tighten. Chainlink price analysis on February 18th shows LINK has been in a corrective phase since reaching a high of $30 in December 2024. The price has dropped by 29% following Donald Trump’s inauguration, signaling increased uncertainty in the crypto market. Despite expectations of favorable policies, LINK has struggled to regain momentum, consolidating around $19.40. Analysts suggest that a breakout is imminent as volatility indicators point to a major move. Data from Coinglass shows fluctuating spot inflows and outflows, indicating high trading activity. Periods of increased inflows suggest buying interest, while outflows reflect selling pressure, contributing to LINK’s volatile price action. However, on-chain data from Santiment and IntoTheBlock highlights a sharp decline in whale transactions. Large LINK transactions over $100K have dropped from 298 to 66 in the past week, reducing overall market liquidity. Despite this decline, 67% of LINK’s total supply remains in the hands of large holders. With whale transactions down 78% since November, bullish sentiment appears to be fading. Currently, 59% of LINK holders are in profit, while 35% are in losses, making this a pivotal moment for future price direction. LINK daily chart analysis: Support and resistance levels in focus On the daily timeframe, LINK has been consolidating between key support at $18.99 and resistance around $22. The RSI is at 38.97, indicating that the asset is nearing oversold conditions but has yet to confirm a reversal. LINK daily chart analysis: Support and resistance levels in focus The MACD histogram remains negative, showing bearish momentum, while the MACD line is below the signal line. If LINK breaks below $18.99, the next key support zone lies near $17.50, while a breakout above $22 could trigger a push toward $25. LINK 4-hour chart analysis: Short-term volatility expected On the 4-hour chart, LINK faces increased selling pressure as the RSI drops to 37.04, signaling weakening bullish momentum. The asset is trading near local support at $18.20, with resistance at $19.00. LINK 4-hour chart analysis: Short-term volatility expected The ATR value at 0.540 suggests declining volatility, meaning a breakout may be approaching. If selling pressure persists, LINK could drop to $17.80, while a move above $19.00 may lead to a retest of $20.00. Traders should monitor key technical levels closely as LINK remains in a consolidation phase with the potential for sharp price swings.

Chainlink’s historic price sentiment Chainlink price history Chainlink launched at around $0.20, staying mostly under $1 throughout 2018, with moderate market cap growth. In 2019, LINK saw substantial growth, reaching $1 in May and peaking around $3 by year-end, driven by its utility in providing reliable data feeds for smart contracts. 2020 marked a breakout year as LINK surged from $2 to $20 by August, fueled by DeFi demand. In 2021, it reached an all-time high of around $52 in May but dropped to $22 by mid-year due to market volatility. In 2022, LINK ranged between $15 and $25 amid broader market corrections. In 2023, it further declined, stabilizing in the $6 to $13 range as investor sentiment cooled. Starting 2024 at $15, LINK briefly spiked to $18 in February before falling to $12 by April. The coin’s price has fluctuated throughout 2024, peaking near $15 in May, dropping to around $10 by August, and stabilizing between $10 and $12.28 in October. In November, LINK is trading within the range of $10.68 to $11.94. In December, LINK maintained a range of $18.43 to $30.94. In January 2025, Chainlink peaked at $22.9 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, leading to a trading range of $19.20- $21.00 in February.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,LINK|TRADING|ALTCOIN|ICO|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SHIB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-18 08:07:02

The blockchain is clearly positioning itself to claim a sizeable portion of the decentralized world, with a number of new initiatives from Aptos Labs looking likely to bring a good return on investment in terms of ecosystem growth. The developments with Aptos this week are definitely something to be excited about if you’re an investor or developer working with the blockchain. Here are some of the key recent developments with the Aptos ecosystem. Key Developments and Strategic Partnerships This week saw the unveiling of Aptos Workspace, an integrated development environment (IDE) for Move smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). This new platform is expected to make the development process on Aptos much smoother, offering the requisite tools to build on the blockchain and do so more efficiently. “Aptos Workspace is a major step forward for the network, and it’s really only the first of many steps for building a more robust ecosystem,” Aptos co-founder Mo Shaikh told TechCrunch. Aptos is setting up an environment in which developers can create “sophisticated, scalable” applications. The developer experience and the adoption of Aptos as a blockchain for new projects go hand in hand, in the view of the Aptos people. To that end, they have created something called the Aptos Workspace. Aptos Workspace is not just an environment for developers to work in; it is aimed at reaching that elusive next stage of mass adoption in the decentralized application space. In another important development, Rewardy Wallet, a top Web3 wallet, has secured a partnership with Aptos. Aptos will underwrite Rewardy Wallet, which is seeking to expand into the realm of optimized reward distribution within the Web3 ecosystem. By using Aptos’s tools, Rewardy Wallet can now deliver a more efficient and scalable reward system, which puts it in an even stronger position in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. This partnership is notable not only because it brings together two blockchain companies but also because it adds to the growing list of partnerships with “user experience” and “innovation” as central themes. Also, Aptos’s strategic influence continues to spread throughout the crypto community; MEXC, a worldwide cryptocurrency exchange, has started supporting native USDC on the Aptos blockchain. This is a big deal for the network, as it opens up way more liquidity options for users and traders. MEXC is a large exchange and USDC is a super common stablecoin within the crypto ecosystem, so this partnership is straight-up advantageous to Aptos. Community Engagement and Ecosystem Expansion A new podcast episode from @theempirepod also dropped this week, featuring Avery Ching, the co-founder of Aptos Labs. During the episode, he took the time to discuss plans for Aptos in 2025 and gave the community a nice little peek into what’s next for them. Some of the key talking points of the episode included the Roadmap, ecosystem expansion plans, and ongoing development of the Move language, which is super interesting for a few reasons. Ching also addressed the obviously growing interest in AI and how Aptos plans to integrate AI technologies within its blockchain. Weekly $APT @Aptos Recap – Tuần 2, tháng 02/2025 Aptos Labs ra mắt Aptos Workspace – Aptos Workspace: Một môi trường phát triển tích hợp (IDE – Integrated Development Environment) dành cho các smart contract Move và dApps. @RewardyWallet thiết lập quan hệ đối… https://t.co/okACjE1Zw6 pic.twitter.com/ueoWQhLrvy — Blog Tiền Ảo (@blogtienao_hq) February 17, 2025 The Aptos Roadmap keeps building excitement with the emergence of new features and use cases. The community can expect an ongoing cadence of updates that keep scaling and user adoption top of mind. Aptos has been at the forefront of Blockchain AI integration. This continued development could very well position Aptos as the platform of choice for next-gen dApps—especially those with an AI component. In a surprising development, Aptos and other blockchain figureheads met with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s team this week to discuss potential collaborations using blockchain technology and digital assets. Also this week, trading platform Merkle Trade revealed its plans to integrate with Aptos, showcasing the blockchain’s increasing allure within trading and financial sectors. Altogether, these developments suggest that Aptos is amassing some high-profile partners—and that the nascent blockchain is winning over more traditional folks in politics and finance. Aptos Stablecoin Reaches New Heights Finally, Aptos has hit a fresh milestone, with its stablecoin market cap now at an all-time high of 848.9 million USD. This increase is a sign of burgeoning confidence in Aptos’s stablecoin, as users and institutions turn to it as a stable asset in the unpredictable world of crypto. Aptos likely has the infrastructure and developer adoption it needs to make a real play in the next coin-of-the-month contest, with its stablecoin poised to capture a larger share of the market in the next few months. Not only is Aptos’s native asset becoming more popular, but the digital currency sector as a whole is drawing more attention as an emerging alternative financial system. This is the main reason for the rapid growth in the stablecoin market cap. The uptake of Aptos’s stablecoin, APTOS, is thus a welcome sign for both Aptos and the digital currency movement. It indicates that Aptos is progressing toward another major Web3 naming milestone: “Aptos can now send and receive mainnet transactions at Web3 scale.” Looking Ahead for Aptos Looking forward, Aptos appears to be on an even more successful path. Its new product, Aptos Workspace, partnerships with prominent actors like Rewardy Wallet and MEXC, and a burgeoning stablecoin market cap all suggest a blockchain that’s moving rapidly toward maturity. And as the Aptos network pushes to extend its suite of developer tools, pulls in a new series of collaborations, and builds out its ecosystem, it seems to be claiming a clear spot among leaders in the Web3 space.

Hyperliquid’s native token , HYPE, will serve as the gas token for HyperEVM. A new system contract, WHYPE, has also been deployed to support DeFi applications and native spot transfers between Hyperliquid’s L1 and HyperEVM. A bug bounty program will provide mainnet-level rewards for vulnerabilities found during this period to promote security research. The debut coincides with Hyperliquid’s ongoing market growth . HYPE has risen approximately 553% from its launch in November 2024, outpacing other cryptocurrencies. The platform’s solid foundation has been aided by its pricing structure, which allocates profits to liquidity providers and a community-managed fund. Hyperliquid gained a lot of attention after its massive billion dollar airdrop, one of the biggest in crypto history. The platform’s appeal to traders is boosted by the fact that it aims to offer a CEX-like trading experience besides being a DEX. The Assistance Fund is one of its most notable characteristics, which is absent from many DEXs. In the event of security breaches or when liquidity needs to be boosted, the fund, which keeps growing as fees increase, serves as a safety net. A recent K33 Research report revealed that Hyperliquid held 55% of the 7-day trading volume for perpetual DEXs. Furthermore, the open interest on the platform increased to 47% of OKX’s levels and 13% of Binance’s.

He stated that he believed it could benefit Argentine entrepreneurs and dismissed allegations of misleading investors. Milei described the LIBRA incident as a wake-up call, saying it prompted him to rethink his accessibility as president. As a result, he plans to implement stricter screening for those seeking direct access to him. He also claimed that very few Argentinians were financially affected, asserting that most investors were from the U.S. and China and were experienced traders familiar with high-risk markets. Speaking publicly about the LIBRA meme coin for the first time since the controversy erupted, Milei sat down with national news channel Todo Noticias. He clarified that while he shared information about the project, he did not endorse it. Milei recalled meeting Hayden Davis, the CEO of LIBRA’s market maker, at the Tech Forum in October 2024. Davis, who later claimed to be an advisor to Milei on the project, reportedly met with the president on multiple occasions. On February 14, Milei posted about LIBRA on social media , shortly after the token’s launch, driving its market cap beyond $4 billion. However, a sudden sell-off by insiders caused a steep collapse, leading to accusations of a rug pull and prompting Milei to delete his post. Defending his actions, Milei said: “I shared it as I do with many technological advancements. My tweet was posted just minutes after the coin was created because I was interested in it. These were volatility traders who understood the risks.” During the interview, Milei appeared composed and reiterated that he had nothing to hide. When asked why he had publicly posted about the token, he responded, “I didn’t promote it, I shared it.” He acknowledged the backlash, calling it “a harsh lesson” but stopped short of labeling it a mistake. Milei also emphasized that moving forward, he and his sister, Karina Milei, who serves as the presidency’s Secretary General, will carefully filter who gains direct access to them. The president explained that his initial interest in LIBRA stemmed from a belief that it could provide a funding alternative for Argentine startups, particularly those lacking access to traditional financial markets. When speculation arose that his account had been hacked, Milei pinned his tweet to confirm he was in control. Later, after facing criticism, he decided to remove it. Most notably, he insisted that Argentinians were not significantly impacted by the LIBRA collapse, stating that most affected investors were American and Chinese. “Did the state lose money? No. Did Argentinians? Maybe four or five people at most. The majority were foreign investors,” he claimed. Although reports suggest that around 40,000 people traded LIBRA, Milei disputes this number, saying only about 5,000 investors were involved. He also denied misleading participants, arguing that those who joined the market were skilled in speculative trading and aware of potential losses. Despite admitting he is not a cryptocurrency expert, Milei spoke about his ties to Hayden Davis. Davis, the head of Kelsier Ventures—the main entity behind LIBRA —had reportedly met with the president at least ten times, including visits to Casa Rosada, the presidential office, and the official residence. According to Milei, Davis had suggested creating a structure to finance entrepreneurial projects in Argentina. “Davis proposed a framework to support Argentine startups,” Milei said, explaining why he found the idea appealing. He added that his enthusiasm for technology led him to share the project publicly as soon as it launched. Since the LIBRA fallout on February 14, over 100 criminal complaints have been filed against Milei and other figures allegedly linked to the scandal. Opposition lawmakers have even suggested pursuing an impeachment. Meanwhile, U.S. prosecutors are reviewing whether they have jurisdiction over the case, given that Davis is an American citizen who openly admitted to certain actions in interviews. The day after LIBRA’s launch, Milei voluntarily appeared before Argentina’s Office of Anti-Corruption, asking for an investigation into whether any government members—including himself—had engaged in wrongdoing. During his interview, Milei firmly denied accepting bribes in connection to LIBRA. He refrained from commenting in detail on Davis’s role in the situation but reiterated his stance that Argentina’s judicial system must conduct its own investigation. He added that, as far as he knows, none of his cabinet members were involved. Milei also pointed out that all cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on the blockchain, stating that this transparency should allow authorities to quickly determine whether any wrongdoing occurred. The president concluded by reassuring the Argentine people that he had always acted in good faith and would continue to do so.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-18 08:10:26

Following this downtrend, nearly 77% of SHIB holders are in losses, with the lack of profitability dampening the market sentiment. SHIB price trades at a weekly low of $0.0000153 today after a 3.55% drop in 24 hours. On-chain data reveals a key resistance zone, a breakout of which could spark a bullish reversal. 700T SHIB Holders Underwater At This Key Resistance Zone: Why it Matters? According to IntoTheBlock data, addresses that bought 757 trillion SHIB bought above $0.000016 are “Out of the Money”. Out of this amount, 637 trillion SHIB tokens, or 84% of the underwater, were purchased between $0.000016 and $0.000024. Approaching the $0.000018 level or clearing the $0.000022 hurdle would make majority of the underwater SHIB token holders to be profitable again. Hence, the $0.000018 to $0.000022 is a key resistance zone that needs to be overcome for Shiba Inu price to resume an uptrend. The aforementioned uptrend is contingent that these investors do not book profits at breakeven. 700T SHIB is Underwater According to GIOM Indicator Is Shiba Inu Price on the Verge of a Breakout? Analysts are bullish on SHIB’s price today despite the recent drop to weekly lows. According to VipRoseTr, SHIB shows signs of a bullish reversal after recovering from a key accumulation zone between $0.000012 and $0.000014. If SHIB continues trading above this support zone, the analyst noted that it could target the next resistance zone at $0.00002338, with a sustained rally set to push the price to a multi-month high of $0.0000365. VipRoseTr: X Another analyst, Javon Marks, also added that SHIB had broken out of a falling wedge pattern. This pattern usually suggests a bullish reversal, with the analyst projecting that the meme coin could surge by 422% to its all-time high of $0.00008841. Despite this bullish Shiba Inu price forecast , the daily chart shows that bears remain in control. Sellers Continue to Weigh on SHIB Shiba Inu’s 1-day chart shows that SHIB remains under bearish pressure , with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropping to 36. If the RSI continues to fall and hits oversold levels, it could mark a turnaround for SHIB price. However, a breach of support at $0.0000145 could extend the downtrend. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line is trending below the signal line, indicating that the trend remains bearish. SHIB/USDT 1-day Chart Sellers might continue to weigh on Shiba Inu’s price until it makes a decisive breakout past the $0.000018 zone, at which point many holders will start becoming profitable again. This break out could shift the market sentiment.

In just 30 days, Sonic’s TVL shot up an almost unimaginable 732%. Even then, the almost $3 billion worth of trades recorded on the platform as of mid-September made Sonic seem like a serious DeFi contender. Of course, the more users engage with a decentralized platform, the more we might anticipate its profile to grow within the DeFi sector. So, just what kind of platform has (mostly) recently made a place for itself among DeFi’s big hitters? Sonic just surpassed $400M! The numbers tell the story—TVL skyrocketed 732% in 30 days, with volume surging from $2M to $176M. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s a structural shift. pic.twitter.com/NWaQUAunq1 — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) February 16, 2025 Sonic’s Unprecedented Growth in 30 Days Sonic’s growth is striking, as the numbers show. The platform has undergone explosive growth recently, with its TVL increasing 732% in just the past month. By any measure, that’s quite a feat. This key indicator of the platform’s popularity and liquidity is now sitting right around $400 million. While it’s too early to know exactly what this might mean for Sonic—or if it might even be sustainable!—there is clearly considerable demand right now for what the platform is offering and for some very innovative earn solutions. The surge in trading volume is happening simultaneously with the increase in TVL. The daily trading volume has gone from $2 million to an incredible $176 million in hardly any time at all. This obvious jump in volume suggests that there is a very real hunger for the assets available on Sonic and that there’s an increasingly enthusiastic base of traders for the platform itself, all of which bodes extremely well for Sonic as it continues to build out its decentralized trading ‘futures’. A Surge in Weekly On-Chain Activity Maybe even more indicative than the increases in total value locked (TVL) and volume is the incredible surge in on-chain activity on the platform. Weekly on-chain activity on Sonic is up a staggering 1,415%. This is a clear sign of real growth. More users, more transactions, more attention from DeFi traders and investors: These are the old, but still relevant, signs of life that any emerging platform wants to show. And while some might quibble with calling a still-Q4-in-the-making for an unlaunched platform a “fundamental,” the bottom line is that Sonic is showing a heaping helping of growth in all the right places. Sonic’s user base keeps growing, and so does the platform’s ecosystem. The weekly activity surge indicates that users aren’t just visiting the platform. They’re engaging with it, utilizing its features, and driving liquidity in a way that overall drives the platform’s growth. The 1,415% activity spike makes it clear that Sonic isn’t just a passing trend but a rapidly developing DeFi (decentralized finance) protocol that is captivating a growing base of users. Weekly on-chain activity on Sonic ( $S ) has increased by +1415% This is reflecting a massive rise in user engagement and trading volume. With TVL hitting $400M and daily volume steady above $50M, #Sonic is rapidly gaining ground. pic.twitter.com/TBhOPq7Skp — Kapoor Kshitiz (@kshitizkapoor_) February 15, 2025 Steady Daily Volume Above $50M Sonic’s success is indicated by something else, too, and that is maintaining a steady daily trading volume above $50 million. This is even more impressive when considered in the context of the rapid growth the project is enjoying. But the number itself isn’t really speaking on behalf of Sonic. What’s more, it doesn’t seem to be the number that Sonic’s team is bragging about when it comes to the decentralized exchange. Instead, user experience seems to be the focus, and that experience seems to be what’s bringing users back. The platform’s stable volume in DeFi’s often volatile world is particularly noteworthy. Even when the larger market fluctuates, Sonic keeps a steady stream of trading, which highlights the platform’s strong structure and ability to play host to its high-volume trader constituency. Sonic’s Future Prospects: A Rapidly Gaining Ground Player Sonic is firmly positioning itself as one of the leading platforms in the DeFi space, with a current TVL of $400 million, a daily trading volume that is above $50 million, and an impressive 1,415% week-over-week growth in its on-chain activity. Not only is this platform achieving some truly eye-catching numbers in terms of its overall usage, but it also appears to be working its way up the ranks among its peer platforms and competitors in the DeFi sector. Sonic’s success can be attributed to its unique features, user-friendly interface, and ability to adapt to the needs of decentralized traders, through which it attracts and retains a growing user base. With a steady influx of users, Sonic’s ecosystem continues to strengthen, laying the groundwork for further growth. Sonic’s growth shows no signs of slowing down. With strong fundamentals, an increasing user base, and a dynamic ecosystem, Sonic is poised to keep rising in the decentralized finance space. If today’s trends are any indication, we can expect the platform’s total value locked, trading volume, and on-chain activity to keep climbing as it attracts more users and establishes itself as a dominant force in the DeFi world. Gaining more ground, Sonic is positioning itself to be a long-term leader in the ever-expanding DeFi market. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Market uncertainty creates challenges for traditional cryptos The cryptocurrency market faces significant challenges amid prevailing uncertainty. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $97,800, reflecting a 1.09% increase from the previous close, with an intraday high of $98,895 and a low of $96,353. Ethereum (ETH) stands at $2,726.31, up 1.16%, ranging between $2,680.93 and $2,785.84 today. XRP is priced at $2.81, a 10.20% rise, with intraday values between $2.54 and $2.81. Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) also show modest gains. Despite these upticks, traditional cryptocurrencies are grappling with volatility due to macroeconomic pressures, regulatory uncertainties, and geopolitical tensions. Recent inflation data exceeding expectations has heightened concerns about potential interest rate hikes, which could reduce liquidity and deter investment in speculative assets like cryptocurrencies.

Targets SEC, Dividing Crypto Industry",https://coinpaprika.com/news/musk-s-d-o-g-e-targets-sec-dividing-crypto-industry,"Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) is investigating the SEC , seeking reports on waste, fraud, and inefficiency within the agency. This move has sparked debate within the crypto industry, as some argue that dismantling the SEC could hurt the sector, which has recently benefited from the Commission’s evolving stance. Since taking office, Musk has been focused on cutting government inefficiencies, including mass layoffs in federal agencies. Now, D.O.G.E. is shifting its attention to the SEC, calling on the public to submit insights on alleged mismanagement within the organization. “D.O.G.E. is seeking help from the public! Please DM this account with insights on finding and fixing waste, fraud, and abuse relating to the Securities and Exchange Commission,” the group posted. This could mean that Musk is preparing for significant cuts at the SEC, in line with his broader government restructuring efforts. While some support his drive for efficiency, others warn that slashing the SEC’s resources could create unintended problems. Ironically, the crypto industry itself could be the SEC’s unexpected defender. After a long battle to oust former Chair Gary Gensler , the Commission is now shifting towards a more favorable stance on digital assets. The SEC has been backing off from enforcement, dropping lawsuits, and working with industry leaders to shape regulations , signaling a major shift from its previous hardline approach. Hester “Crypto Mom” Peirce, now leading the Crypto Task Force, has been vocal against SEC downsizing. She emphasized the importance of retaining skilled personnel to enact policies that benefit crypto markets. “We have a lot of really fantastic people at the SEC doing important work. U.S. capital markets are not just large, they are the most significant in the world! It’s about striking the right balance and using our resources effectively,” Peirce stated. This raises an important question: if the crypto industry spent years pushing the SEC toward a more cooperative stance, would dismantling it now be counterproductive? Even if Musk envisions a crypto industry with minimal government oversight, experts argue that a complete absence of regulation is neither realistic nor sustainable in the long term. Not all industry players share the same concerns. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, has taken a different approach, advocating for stronger measures against the SEC . He proposed that the agency should be forced to compensate defendants in cases where enforcement actions fail. This could lead to direct payouts for industry players and create deeper divisions between regulators and crypto firms. As the debate unfolds, it remains unclear what specific steps D.O.G.E. will take against the SEC. The move could gain support from those who favor less regulation, but it could also alienate crypto leaders who view the agency as a newly acquired ally. Meanwhile, some in the community are expressing an unusual sentiment: nostalgia for former Chair Gary Gensler. While his tenure was marked by intense crackdowns on crypto projects, some now see his enforcement actions as a necessary step in preventing scams and protecting investors. With the future of SEC oversight hanging in the balance, the industry remains divided on whether Musk’s intervention will be a strategic win or a costly misstep.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-18 08:14:14
