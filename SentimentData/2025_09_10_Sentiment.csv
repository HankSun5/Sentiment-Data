The company pulled in $972.2 million in net sales for the quarter ending August 2. That’s up from $798.3 million last year in the same quarter. The reason? A small lift in hardware sales, enough to tick the total revenue higher, but nothing major. Still, investors pushed the stock up 4% after hours, riding momentum and memes more than actual operational wins. This company, still known for the 2021 retail frenzy, posted a net income of $168.6 million, up from $14.8 million a year ago. The massive jump came down to some wild swings in asset values, especially crypto. GameStop now holds $528.6 million in Bitcoin, up sharply from last year. Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities hit $8.7 billion, compared to just $4.2 billion at the end of Q2 last year. Cut costs drive operating income turnaround GameStop slashed its spending in a big way. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses dropped to $218.8 million, down from $270.8 million last year. That’s a drop of over $50 million. This cost-cutting helped turn things around. Operating income swung to $66.4 million this quarter, up from a $22 million loss in the same period last year. When excluding impairment and other adjustments, adjusted operating income came in at $64.7 million, compared to an adjusted loss of $31.6 million last year. That shows GameStop leaned hard on cutting fat rather than growing core sales. The company’s adjusted net income, after removing impairment, unrealized digital asset gains, and other line items, came in at $138.3 million. That’s a massive spike from the $5.2 million adjusted net income posted in Q2 last year. But again, most of that is balance sheet math and crypto exposure. GameStop leaned into non-GAAP reporting this quarter. They highlighted several adjusted numbers: adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. All these tweaks remove transformation costs, severance, digital asset gains and losses, impairments, and divestitures. The company argued that these figures “provide useful information” for investors watching its core operations. Critics say they’re just cleaning up the mess to make the quarter look better. Either way, there’s a huge gap between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers this time. Capital expenditures were taken out of free cash flow calculations, painting a smoother financial picture. Meanwhile, crypto played a big role in inflating the company’s books. That $528.6 million Bitcoin stash is now a piece of their financial story.

The hack was massive in scope since the affected packages have over 1 billion combined weekly downloads. This attack on the software supply chain specifically targets the JavaScript/Node.js ecosystem. NPM Supply Chain Attack Popular dev qix fell victim to phishing.

It was also heavily obfuscated to avoid detection. The crypto-stealing malware has two attack vectors. When no crypto wallet extension is found, the malware intercepts all network traffic by replacing the browser’s native fetch and HTTP request functions with extensive lists of attacker-owned wallet addresses. Using sophisticated address swapping, it employs algorithms to find replacement addresses that look visually similar to legitimate ones, making the fraud nearly impossible to spot with the naked eye, said cybersecurity researchers. If a crypto wallet is found, the malware intercepts transactions before signing, and when users initiate transactions, it modifies them in memory to redirect funds to attacker addresses. The attack targeted packages such as ‘chalk,’ ‘strip-ansi,’ ‘color-convert,’ and ‘color-name,’ which are core building blocks buried deep in the dependency trees of countless projects. The attack was discovered accidentally when a build pipeline failed with a “fetch is not defined” error as the malware attempted to exfiltrate data using the fetch function. “If you use a hardware wallet, pay attention to every transaction before signing, and you’re safe. If you don’t use a hardware wallet, refrain from making any on-chain transactions for now,” advised Ledger CEO Charles Guillemet.

It affects any environment running JavaScript/Node.js applications, such as web applications running in browsers, desktop applications, server-side Node.js applications, and mobile apps using JavaScript frameworks. So a regular business web application could unknowingly include these malicious packages, but the malware would only activate when users interact with cryptocurrency on that site. Uniswap and Blockstream were among the first to reassure users that their systems were not at risk.

Vous signez, tout a l’air normal et vos fonds partent chez le pirate. Irrécupérables. L’attaque a été traquée dans des packages NPM vérolés , preuve qu’une simple brique de la chaîne logicielle peut ouvrir une brèche gigantesque . Oui, la régulation progresse et l’adoption grimpe, mais ce coup de semonce rappelle une réalité brute : la crypto, c’est top, si vous êtes carré . Le risque est bien là, et c’est pour ça que certains projets bossent dur pour remettre la sécurité au centre et rassurer les utilisateurs . On décortique l’attaque, puis focus sur deux initiatives qui veulent rendre la crypto plus sûre, plus simple, plus fiable . Un malware qui remplace vos adresses crypto Le hack mis au jour repose sur une méthode aussi simple qu’efficace : modifier les adresses de destination lors des transferts crypto. L’utilisateur pense envoyer ses fonds à un proche ou à un exchange, mais l’adresse est automatiquement remplacée par celle du pirate. Le pire ? L’attaque est invisible à l’œil nu : tant que vous ne vérifiez pas manuellement chaque caractère, la transaction part mais pas au bon endroit. Un type de hack, basé sur la supply chain logicielle , qui montre, malheureusement, que la menace ne vient pas toujours d’une faille blockchain, mais bien des outils annexes (plugins, bibliothèques, applications). La leçon est claire : il faut redoubler de vigilance avant de signer une transaction, même sur des plateformes réputées fiables. Pourquoi cet incident inquiète autant Ce n’est pas un “accident de parcours” . Ce hack met à nu une faille de fond dans la crypto. Plus l’argent afflue, plus les attaquants se professionnalisent et visent des maillons inattendus de la chaîne. Les devs encaissent en première ligne mais c’est l’utilisateur final qui paie la note . Avec les ETF BTC/ETH et le retour des capitaux institutionnels , la sécurité devient un sujet vital . Chaque incident ronge un peu plus la confiance du grand public et sert d’argument aux régulateurs les plus durs. D’où l’urgence de projets security-by-design : des protections intégrées dès le cahier des charges , pas bricolées après coup, pour protéger l’utilisateur par défaut . Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) : la Layer 2 qui sécurise et accélère Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) est pensé comme une évolution de Bitcoin . Construit en Layer 2 , il s’attaque aux limites historiques du réseau : lenteur, frais élevés et impact énergétique. Grâce à son consensus Proof-of-Stake , $HYPER propose des transactions quasi instantanées, à faible coût et plus écologiques, lui permettant de figurer parmi les meilleures crypto de 2025 . Tokenomics Supply : 21 milliards de tokens (x1000 par rapport à Bitcoin). Répartition : 30 % trésorerie · 25 % marketing · 5 % rewards · reste pour dev + écosystème. Prévente : déjà +13 M$ levés, sans allocations VIP, preuve de transparence. Utilité Le $HYPER sert à régler les frais réseau , à sécuriser les ponts inter-chaînes , et permet de staker avec des rendements pouvant atteindre 80 % APY.

Les pirates innovent à une vitesse folle , souvent plus vite que les régulateurs, parfois même que les devs. Mais tout n’est pas noir. Des projets comme Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) (Layer 2 plus fluide et plus sûre) ou Best Wallet ($BEST) (protection utilisateur au centre) montrent que l’écosystème sait contre-attaquer . La leçon pour les investisseurs : Vigilance quotidienne : vérifiez l’adresse à chaque envoi, verrouillez vos wallets, mettez à jour vos outils. Priorisez le “security-first” : suivez les projets qui intègrent la sécurité dès la conception. Au-delà des promesses, la vraie richesse à long terme est simple : des fonds en sécurité .",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-09 22:05:12

The capital raise, according to a statement, will be through an overseas issuance of new shares. This comes as the company is looking at using cryptocurrency as its primary treasury asset to offset domestic economic challenges. Metaplanet makes another aggressive move to buy BTC The Tokyo-based firm, which is listed on the Standard Market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, planned on issuing a total of 385 million new shares at a price of 553 yen per share, representing a 9.93% discount from the closing price on September 9. Payment date for the new shares is pegged at September 16, and the delivery date the following day, on September 17. The company expects its outstanding shares to grow from approximately 756 million to more than 1.4 billion after the capital increase. *Notice Regarding Determination of Issue Price and Other Matters* pic.twitter.com/DWM3r1oYCC — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) September 9, 2025 Metaplanet may be on track to meet its targets within set timelines Metaplanet stated that its strategy to acquire more Bitcoin is a response to Japan’s mounting economic challenges that include a weakening of the yen, high government debt, and prolonged negative interest rates. As recently reported by Cryptopolitan , MetaPlanet added 136 BTC worth 2.25 billion yen as part of its continued Bitcoin Treasury initiative. Its total Bitcoin holdings are now worth 304.563 billion yen, or $2.08 billion. The purchases build on the company’s plans to grow its digital asset stash to 100,000 BTC by the end of next year. Meta Planet’s current holding of 20,136 BTC indicates that it has achieved about 67% of its 2025 target and 20% of its 2026 target. MetaPlanet is also looking at acquiring 210,000 BTC by 2027 in a move that would account for 10% of the total Bitcoin in circulation. With the latest developments, MetaPlanet could be on track to meet its ambitious targets by the end of next year and 2027. And its 20,136 BTC holdings place it in sixth position globally among public firms with Bitcoin Treasury strategies. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

All three major indexes closed at record highs Tuesday, ignoring warning signs in the economy like it was business as usual. The S&P 500 finished the session up 0.27% at 6,512.61, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.37% to close at 21,879.49, a new intraday record too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 196.39 points, or 0.43%, landing at 45,711.34. One big reason? A surge in UnitedHealth stock. Meanwhile, new labor data dropped like a hammer. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised its numbers for the 12 months through March, cutting 911,000 jobs from the books, Cryptopolitan reported Tuesday. These weren’t tiny adjustments. This was the biggest downward revision since at least 2002. It was also way worse than Wall Street expected. Basically, job growth during that period was a lot weaker than people thought. “I think the economy is weakening,” said Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, during a chat with CNBC. “Whether it’s on the way to recession or just weakening, I don’t know.” Stocks rally despite ugly job numbers Despite the brutal revisions, markets barely reacted. Why? Because the data covered a period that ended six months ago. Traders didn’t see it as an immediate problem. But there’s a twist, this kind of bad labor data might pressure the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates faster than planned. That’s what Wall Street really cares about. Chris Zaccarelli, the chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, put it this way: “The jobs picture keeps deteriorating and while that should make it easier for the Fed to cut rates this fall, it could also throw some cold water on the recent rally.” So yeah, rate cuts could come. But they will likely not be the magic fix everyone’s betting on. Tech stocks, especially semiconductors, have been doing a lot of the heavy lifting lately. Broadcom and Nvidia helped push the Nasdaq to that record high earlier this week. But Broadcom took a hit on Tuesday, falling more than 2%, after rallying nearly 13% over the past week. That little stumble didn’t derail the bigger momentum, but it was a reminder that even hot stocks can cool fast. Traders watch inflation, and AI frenzy grows What’s next? Two big inflation reports that could shape what the Fed decides at its meeting next week. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for August comes out on Wednesday morning. Then on Thursday, it’s the Consumer Price Index (CPI). If either one shows inflation heating up again, it could kill the whole “rate cuts are coming” fantasy. “If the CPI shows a worsening trend of higher inflation on Thursday then the market will begin worrying about stagflation,” said Zaccarelli. “The bull market has been extremely resilient this year, but we could be approaching an inflection point where it is tested again.” In plain English: If prices rise and growth slows at the same time, things could get messy. While Wall Street kept one eye on inflation and the other on job data, a full-on buying frenzy broke out in the AI space. Nebius Group, a lesser-known infrastructure company focused on artificial intelligence, exploded almost 50% higher Tuesday. That came one day after it announced a multi-billion-dollar deal with Microsoft. The stock had already jumped 60% in extended trading on Monday. Nebius’s rival CoreWeave saw its own boost, up 8%, just from riding the same wave.

Below, we explore three trending meme coins that are generating serious buzz, why they stand out from the crowd, and why they may be among the best and most explosive affordable cryptos this year. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): The Dogecoin Rival That Could Explode in 2025 A bold new competitor to Dogecoin is making waves, introducing Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , the roided-up cousin of the original meme coin. With Dogecoin now established as a multibillion-dollar asset, its price action tends to mirror blue-chip cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While still iconic, Dogecoin’s volatility has cooled compared to its dramatic 2021 bull run highs. For investors looking for high-risk, high-reward meme coins in 2025, Maxi Doge is quickly becoming a hot choice. Since launching its presale just weeks ago, the project has already raised nearly $2 million, showing strong early demand. Built as an ERC-20 token, MAXI emphasizes community-driven growth, with plans to expand Telegram and Discord groups into full-fledged meme coin hubs featuring contests, trading competitions, and collaborations with other projects. From its 150.24 billion supply, 25% goes towards the “Maxi Fund,” a pool for marketing and strategic partnerships. Holders also benefit from lucrative staking rewards, currently offering up to 163% APY (though yields decrease as more stakers join). The token’s presale price is $0.0002565, with a slight price increase set to take effect within 60 hours. Investors can participate directly through the Maxi Doge official website, using crypto wallets like MetaMask and Best Wallet or a bank card. Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages. Visit the Official Website Here PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): The Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin Everyone’s Talking About Among the most innovative new meme coins of 2025, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is quickly becoming a standout project thanks to its unique model and rapid presale growth. Launched just over two weeks ago, this ERC-20 meme coin has already raised nearly $1 million, showcasing growing momentum and rising investor excitement. PEPENODE brands itself as the first “mine-to-earn” meme token. Instead of simple passive staking, users can build digital mining nodes that boost their staking rewards the more nodes they add. This gamified approach encourages continued token accumulation and long-term participation, making it one of the most creative meme coins to watch in 2025. Right now, PEPENODE is priced at $0.0010491 on its official presale site. Prices are designed to increase incrementally every few days until the presale concludes, rewarding early investors with the lowest entry point. Stay updated through PEPENODE’s official X and Telegram pages. Visit the Official Website Here Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE): Pepe’s Best Iteration Yet is Challenging Established Cryptos Like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Finally, Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is quickly carving out a name as one of the top meme coins to invest in 2025, blending humor with a strong retail trading community. Its beguiling premise helped it to become one of the largest meme coin presales in history, raising almost $74 million before listing. Originally launched on Ethereum earlier this year, WEPE has already surged over 250% since late May. In the past 24 hours alone, it rose 7.3%, outperforming bigger meme coins such as Dogecoin ($DOGE), Shiba Inu ($SHIB), and Pepe ($PEPE). The project’s core mission is simple: empower meme coin enthusiasts through community-led trading hubs where members share insights, signs, and collaborate on trading strategies. Now, WEPE is expanding onto Solana, a move designed to increase scalability and reduce transaction costs. The clever part? Every Solana WEPE purchase automatically burns an equal amount of Ethereum-based WEPE 1:1. This ensures supply remains unchanged while expanding distribution across two major blockchains. With Solana’s speed, lower gas fees, and massive user base, WEPE looks well-positioned to attract a wider audience and strengthen its momentum. The new Solana version of WEPE is priced at just $0.001 and will soon be available through the official Wall Street Pepe site. Stay updated through Wall Street Pepe’s official X and Telegram pages.

Market trends seem to support this outlook. At the end of last month, Bitcoin surged to a record-breaking $124,128, eclipsing its previous high of $122,838 reached only weeks earlier. That rally slowed, however, once July’s inflation report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics came in hotter than expected. On the regulatory side, President Trump recently approved the GENIUS Act, the country’s first comprehensive law for stablecoins, requiring them to be fully backed by reserves. Simultaneously, the SEC rolled out Project Crypto , a broad reform plan designed to modernize securities laws and provide blockchain firms with clearer guidance. These developments have many analysts pointing to the potential start of a new bull run. If Claude’s forecasts are on target, XRP, Pudgy Penguins, and Dogecoin could find themselves at the forefront of the next major wave of meme coins and altcoins. XRP (Ripple): Claude Predicts a Possible 17x Run Toward $50 Claude AI predicts that XRP ($XRP) may climb as high as $50 by late 2025, nearly 17x its current value around $3. The coin has already shown resilience, peaking at $3.65 on July 18 and breaking past its 2018 record of $3.40 before easing back by about 18%. Ripple’s global reach continues to grow. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund endorsed XRP as a promising option for cross-border payments in developing regions. Earlier this year, Ripple also resolved its prolonged dispute with the SEC after the agency abandoned its case, cementing the 2023 ruling that retail XRP trades are not securities sales. This outcome provided clarity and confidence not just for Ripple but for major altcoins more broadly. Claude’s conservative scenario puts XRP between $3.20 and $5, while its bullish outlook sets $50 as a stretch target contingent on the US approval of spot XRP ETFs. Technical readings back this up: the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 55, signaling that selling pressure is over and there is rising buying momentum. Additionally, the appearance of several bullish flag formations across its support and resistance lines over the year indicates the probability of further upside. Over the past year, XRP has gained 467%, pipping market leaders Bitcoin (104%) and Ethereum (88%). Pengu ($PENGU): Cross-chain Penguin Token is Now Solana’s Biggest Meme Coin. Claude AI Predicts Further Growth Yet Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) , expanded to Solana from Ethereum back in December but is already now the largest meme coin on Solana with a market cap just shy of $2.2 billion. Currently priced at $0.03465 after rallying 18% in the past week, PENGU is now the fifth-largest meme coin in crypto. As of this writing, it’s trading 49% short of its all-time high of $0.06845, set on December 17, 2024. Its RSI has dropped to 57 and is trending lower, suggesting that there is plenty of headroom left for growth in the short to mid-term as investors continue to target the psychological $0.05 level, which would clear the token above previous resistance levels. Technical patterns are also worth watching. Between January and April, PENGU formed a bullish descending wedge, a setup often linked to bullish reversals. Claude’s outlook sees the token potentially making a push toward $0.0791 by New Year if momentum continues. This would mean a 123% in 5 months, more than doubling from current price. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Still Commands the Market Launched in 2013 as a parody, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has grown into a top ten crypto, capitalizing $36.3 billion of the $4 trillion market. Its staying power stems from a dedicated community and its use as a payment option across a growing number of platforms. Although DOGE frequently tracks Bitcoin’s movements, its deep liquidity and strong base of supporters have helped it weather multiple market cycles. Currently trading around $0.2417, it has doubled in value over the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. After hitting an RSI of 80 in July, Dogecoin cooled almost to 40 in the midst of a market-wide selloff last month, although it’s now back up to 60, indicating rapidly growing buying momentum. While its large market cap ties its movements to major cryptos, DOGE has a history of sudden, outsized rallies. Analysts have noted falling wedge patterns forming between November and April, again in mid-July, and once more in August, a recurring sign of possible upward moves. Claude’s high-end projection sees DOGE at $0.39 by year’s end, which would be a tidy 62% increase. However, it is a little underwhelming for the “Doge Army” for whom the idea of Dogecoin reaching $1 remains a long-standing rallying cry. Adoption continues to grow as well. Tesla now accepts DOGE for select merchandise, and major platforms like PayPal and Revolut allow Dogecoin transfers. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A New Challenger to Dogecoin’s Throne For those seeking newer meme coin plays outside Claude’s forecast, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has emerged as an intriguing option. Dubbed the “amped-up cousin” of Dogecoin, MAXI offers a fresh take on the meme coin formula. Dogecoin, with its massive market cap, often mirrors Bitcoin and Ethereum’s moves and has lost much of its explosive volatility from earlier cycles. Maxi Doge, by contrast, is designed to capture that higher-risk, higher-reward appeal, and has already raised nearly $2 million just weeks into its presale. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MAXI is heavily focused on building strong community channels through Telegram and Discord, complete with contests and cross-project collaborations. Out of its 150.24 billion supply, 25% is set aside for the Maxi Fund, which will bankroll marketing and partnerships. Investors can also stake tokens, with current yields reaching 161% APY, though this will decline as more users participate. The presale price is $0.0002565, with a slight fixed increase scheduled within 60 hours. Interested buyers can join through the Maxi Doge website using wallets such as MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Investors who got into Tron (TRX) early know this feeling well. Now, a new project, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is showing the same signs of explosive potential. Its presale is moving at a blistering pace, with Phase 3 nearing the 10% sold mark just days after starting. This incredible velocity has secured its title as one of the highest-in-demand altcoins on the market. The numbers speak for themselves. Ruvi AI’s presale is on the brink of crossing the $3.6 million milestone, with over 265 million tokens already sold. This surge is driven by a fast-growing and powerful community of more than 3,500 investors who see the clear potential for a Tron-like ascent. The market has spoken: Ruvi AI is a project to watch. From Tron’s Rise to Ruvi AI’s Reign The comparison to Tron is about disruptive potential. Tron built a massive ecosystem by focusing on decentralized content and entertainment. Ruvi AI is set to do the same by targeting the booming $104 billion creator economy . By providing powerful, real-world solutions, Ruvi AI is laying the groundwork for mass adoption and a valuation that could rival today’s top projects. This potential is built on a rock-solid foundation of credibility. Ruvi AI has successfully completed a comprehensive smart contract audit with CyberScope , a reputable third-party security firm, assuring investors of the platform’s security. This, combined with a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , has established Ruvi AI as a legitimate, high-growth project attracting serious capital. A Super App to Revolutionize a Multi-Billion-Dollar Industry The engine behind Ruvi AI’s potential to become the next Tron is its revolutionary super app. This all-in-one ecosystem empowers content creators with a suite of AI-driven tools that streamline workflows and enhance creativity. By serving a massive and growing market, the app creates sustainable demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Helps creators identify viral topics before they become saturated, giving them a significant competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube and TikTok, saving hours of work. Native Media Creation: Allows users to generate professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, reducing production costs. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire content creation process, from planning to scheduling, for maximum efficiency. Last Call: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge Is Just Around the Corner The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token available at an attractive $0.020 . But with 10% of this phase selling out in mere days, this ground-floor opportunity is closing fast. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO, driving record sales as investors rush to lock in an immediate paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s journey is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience upon launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broader market adoption. For investors seeking to maximize their returns, the project’s VIP program offers a clear path to significant wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. Seizing the Next Big Opportunity As the presale accelerates toward a sell-out and a 40% price surge looms, the parallels to the early days of Tron are undeniable. For investors who missed that historic run, Ruvi AI presents a rare second chance to be part of what could be this bull run’s defining success story.

These three altcoins have comfortably outperformed the market average, yet their gains today may only be the beginning of a medium- and long-term drive. We examine their technicals (and fundamentals) in this article, considering where they could be heading in the coming weeks and towards the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction Today 9 September XRP (XRP): Altcoin Eyeing New Record Highs As Ripple Continues to Expand The third-biggest cryptocurrency in the market, XRP, has climbed over the psychologically important $3 level, making for a 2.5% gain in the past 24 hours. It’s also up by 7% in a week, and while it hasn’t yet erased a 6% loss in a month, doing so is likely only a matter of time. Its chart today suggests that now may be a perfect time to buy the coin, given that its indicators have begun rising without having yet moved into an overbought position. Source: TradingView For instance, its RSI (yellow) has just risen above 50, while its MACD (orange, blue) is also about to turn positive. The FOMC’s meeting next week could be the big catalyst for a major rally, and when combined with Ripple’s increasingly strong fundamentals, we could see the XRP hit new heights soon enough. Ripple has been expanding vigorously this year, particularly since it finally ended its legal case with the SEC in early August , and the expansion of its cross-border (and stablecoin) business will translate into greater demand for XRP down the line. As such, we could see the XRP price return to $3.50 as soon as the end of this month, while the alt could climb beyond $5 by the end of the year. Bonk (BONK): Analysts Predict That Meme Coin Could Soon Enter ‘Price Discovery’ At $0.00002345, BONK has managed an impressive 6% return in a day, and an even more impressive 15% increase in a week. As with XRP, it is still down in the past month (by 12%), yet this only means that it can still afford to rise further without becoming dangerously overbought. Its chart today confirms what it had been hinting at in previous days and weeks, which is that a breakout is underway. Source: TradingView Indeed, the BONK price has surged out of its most recent bullish pennant, while its RSI has gone from around 40 to 55 in only a day or two. This trend is likely to continue, with some online analysts predicting that the token will enter “price discovery” soon . This could mean that it will not only return to its current ATH of $0.00005825 but will surpass it in the following weeks, especially if the market enters an end-of-year rally. Hyperliquid (HYPE): DEX Growth Pushing Alt to New All-Time Highs Hyperliquid has gained by 6% in the past 24 hours, and actually set a new ATH of $55.04 only a few hours ago. In other words, it’s one of the most bullish altcoins in the top 100 right now, and could set new records in the coming hours and days. At $53.94, it’s up by 21% in a week and by 24% in a month, while it has also gained by just over 1,300% since its all-time low of $3.81 from November, which was when it listed. The coin is clearly going from strength to strength, which is all largely because its native platform, the DEX Hyperliquid, is doing very much the same. Hyperliquid has been setting new revenue records in recent weeks and months, recording $106 million in August and accounting for 70% of the DeFi perpetuals market. This is exceedingly bullish, and given that the wider market appears to be waking up again, the HYPE price is only likely to rise further. Encouragingly, HYPE’s technical indicators are rising but have not yet entered overbought regions, so there’s still an opportunity to buy the coin even now. Its crypto price prediction is therefore very positive, and the coin could potentially hit $100 by the middle of November, and end the year closer to $150. Bitcoin Hyper: Exciting New Later-Two Network Raises $14.6 Million in Presale As strong as the coins above are looking, traders may also be interested in diversifying into newer tokens, so as to widen their exposure to possible market-beating gains. To this end, they may want to investigate some of the more interesting presale tokens currently doing the rounds at the moment. One of the best of these is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a Solana-based layer-two network for Bitcoin . The focus is on verifiability—ensuring every state change can be reproduced from the Bitcoin chain without trusting intermediaries. Efficiency and security must be balanced. Frequent anchoring raises costs; infrequent anchoring weakens trust. Current research points to periodic… — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 8, 2025 Bitcoin Hyper has now raised just over $14.6 million in its ongoing presale, which has snowballed to become one of the biggest of 2025. The reason why the project is outperforming other presales is that it has some very promising fundamentals. It’s about to launch a fully fledged layer-two network for Bitcoin, offering smart contract functionality, as well as lower fees and faster confirmation times. This means it could help tap into Bitcoin’s enormous value for DeFi purposes, with the platform aiming to develop into a growing ecosystem of dapps and decentralized trading protocols. It makes use of Solana’s Virtual Machine and of zero-knowledge rollups, giving it a speed and security unsurpassed by other extant L2s. Native token HYPER will be necessary to pay for its transaction fees, something which could result in big demand for the token. Investors can buy it now by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as MetaMask or Best Wallet. HYPER is currently available at $0.012885, although this will continue to rise for the duration of the sale.

The company has partnered with BlackRock’s BUIDL fund through USDtb, a token issued with Anchorage Digital Bank, to position itself as a frontrunner in one of the most closely watched races in crypto. Leading decentralized exchange, Hyperliquid, is preparing to launch USDH as its native stablecoin. The decision over which issuer will oversee its minting and redemption has attracted a slate of major players. In August, Hyperliquid processed around $400 billion in perpetuals trading volume and has a stablecoin market cap of over $5.7 billion, so the stakes are high. Whoever wins the mandate will have access to one of the largest stablecoin liquidity bases in the market, and Ethena’s proposal shows it really wants to emerge as the winner. Proposals for Hyperliquid’s USDH. Source: Messari Ethena pitches revenue-sharing, migration, and security Ethena is offering a package designed to appeal to both Hyperliquid validators and its community. Central to its proposal is a pledge to redirect 95% of net USDH reserve revenues back to the ecosystem. The company said this would be done through the purchase and distribution of HYPE tokens, validator rewards, and ecosystem development funding, among other means preferred by the community. Ethena has also promised to shoulder the costs of migrating existing USDC trading pairs to USDH. Security is another pillar of the plan as Ethena proposed introducing a guardian network of Hyperliquid validators, including infrastructure partners like LayerZero, to oversee USDH operations. Part of the goal is to avoid a single point of failure and ensure transparent governance of the new stablecoin. “We want to play a role in supporting this story regardless of whether the community grants us the privilege and responsibility of delivering USDH,” Ethena wrote in its proposal. Ethena wants to offer more than an ordinary USDH stablecoin Ethena’s ambitions go beyond simply issuing USDH. The company laid out plans for hUSDe, a Hyperliquid-native synthetic dollar product that builds on its existing USDe model. To jumpstart adoption, Ethena has earmarked $75 million in incentives, with the potential to expand that figure to $150 million as the ecosystem scales, to support market development under the HIP-3 proposal. The incentive program would fund new markets, front-end integrations, and liquidity initiatives that tie together USDH, USDe, and hUSDe under a single umbrella. The company also said it will integrate with Securitize to enable tokenization of real-world assets and bring USDtb, the BlackRock-backed token, onto HyperEVM. That integration would allow for seamless minting and redemption flows, giving institutional users a clearer path to tap into Hyperliquid’s ecosystem. The field is competitive Since the announcement, Hyperliquid’s native token HYPE has been on the rise. At the time of writing, it sits at $53.55 per token, having risen by over 6% in 24 hours, with a market cap of $14.39 billion according to data from Messari. Ethena’s bid brings it into a crowded field of suitors . Paxos, known for its regulated custodial model, has pitched itself as the most compliant option. Frax has proposed integrating its algorithmic stablecoin model into Hyperliquid, while Sky, Native Markets and Agora, among others have also submitted competing frameworks. Each proposal focuses on a different philosophy on how to balance transparency, scalability, and user adoption. The outcome will be decided by Hyperliquid’s validators, who are expected to vote on September 14. With billions of dollars in potential liquidity at stake, the decision will likely shape the trajectory of Hyperliquid’s growth in the coming years. For Ethena, winning the mandate could cement its position as one of the most influential players in the stablecoin market. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This year, the opportunity is even greater, and it’s your turn to seize it. Why Should Your Brand Be a Part of Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025?

You’ll tap into an engaged audience of over 10,000 attendees, a powerful mix of industry leaders, emerging talent, and capital allocators, all eager to discover what’s next.

51468670,577350,1757458827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51468670.jpeg,New Bitcoin Reserve Bill Pressures Treasury On Custody Rules,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-reserve-bill-treasury-custody-rules/,"The US House Appropriations Committee has advanced H.R. 5166 — the Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) spending bill for FY2026 — with language that would formally direct the Treasury Department to spell out how the federal government will custody Bitcoin and other digital assets it acquires, explicitly including holdings earmarked for the newly created Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The bill was reported on September 5, 2025, as House Report 119-236 and placed on the Union Calendar. Congress Demands Public Information On Bitcoin Reserve At the statutory level, Section 138 of the reported bill requires the Treasury, within 90 days of enactment, to deliver a public plan for the “secure and efficient custody” of federal digital assets, “including assets held under the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile.” The plan must delineate custody architecture, legal authorities, cybersecurity controls, and interagency workflows for transfers and safekeeping. Section 137 adds a second mandate: a report on the practicability of establishing the reserve and the related stockpile, addressing potential barriers, the expected impact on the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, how Bitcoin and other digital assets would be presented on the federal balance sheet, and any third-party contractors used for custody. Read together, the two sections would force the Treasury to clarify both whether and how the federal government will maintain long-term Bitcoin holdings — and what that means for government accounting and forfeiture-fund mechanics. The committee report accompanying the bill underlines Congress’s intent to track the flow of seized assets into the program. It directs the Treasury to provide monthly tables of the Forfeiture Fund’s activity, including any “diversions from the Forfeiture Fund to the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and/or the digital asset stockpile.” That same report section labels the custody directive “Custody of Digital Assets,” emphasizing strong safeguards to prevent loss, unauthorized access, or liquidation. The push comes six months after the White House issued Executive Order 14233 , which created both the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile by consolidating government-owned crypto seized in criminal and civil cases. The order states that government BTC placed into the reserve “shall not be sold,” positioning Bitcoin as a strategic asset held for national objectives subject to law. It also instructs Treasury and Commerce to develop ways to acquire additional government BTC on a budget-neutral basis . H.R. 5166 would also bring the national-security community into the loop. Section 139 directs the Treasury Secretary and the Director of the National Security Agency to provide a classified report on inter-agency coordination within 90 days of enactment — a signal that lawmakers see digital-asset custody (and key management) as an operational risk surface as well as a balance-sheet question. The legislative pressure is occurring alongside separate efforts to codify the reserve. In March, Rep. Byron Donalds introduced H.R. 2112 to give the executive order “the force and effect of law,” while other measures, such as H.R. 2032, have proposed building out a decentralized, cold-storage reserve network for government BTC. None of those standalone bills has been enacted, but the appropriations route, if passed, would time-box the Treasury to deliver concrete answers shortly after the spending bill becomes law. What Changes If H.R. 5166 Becomes Law? First, the Treasury would owe the public a detailed custody blueprint, not just internal memoranda or ad-hoc practices developed for asset seizures. Second, Congress would receive an analytical roadmap for how a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and stockpile would interact with forfeiture processes and the federal balance sheet — key inputs for any future decision to scale the program beyond seized assets. Third, the classified NSA-Treasury report would institutionalize security coordination around wallet infrastructure and interagency transfers. Together, those steps would shift the federal government’s handling of Bitcoin from case-by-case liquidation towards a defined reserve posture aligned with the March 6 policy that reserve BTC is not to be sold. However, the measure does not itself appropriate BTC, purchase Bitcoin on the open market, or authorize immediate diversions into the reserve; it sets reporting and planning obligations contingent on enactment of the underlying appropriations bill. The House-reported text must still clear the full House, the Senate, and reconciliation before reaching the President’s desk. Until then, the timelines — “within 90 days of enactment” — are prospective.

After weeks of sideways trading, the SuperTrend indicator has turned bullish for the first time since late August, according to trader Ali (@ali_charts). Related Reading: This Bitcoin Cycle Changes Everything, Real Vision Analyst Explains Why XLM now faces a decisive test at the $0.386 resistance, a level where sellers have repeatedly pushed back in recent weeks. The bullish reversal came as XLM established support at $0.363, creating a stronger floor for accumulation. With volume steadily increasing around this zone, traders are treating the move as more than just a temporary bounce. If momentum holds, XLM could unlock a major upside move that shifts market sentiment. What’s Fueling Stellar’s Momentum? The broader crypto market’s recent stabilization has provided a healthy backdrop for altcoins like Stellar (XLM) to regain traction. Hidden accumulation patterns within key demand zones suggest larger wallets are quietly entering the market, strengthening the bullish case. On the technical front, the MACD has turned positive, while XLM’s RSI remains neutral at 48, leaving room for further gains without hitting overbought territory. Analysts note that a clean break above $0.386 could quickly open the door to higher targets at $0.390 and $0.400, with medium-term forecasts eyeing $0.45–$0.48 by October 2025. Institutional traders are also watching the $0.43 resistance closely. A confirmed breakout above this level could ignite stronger momentum, potentially pushing XLM into a sustained rally toward its 52-week high near $0.50. Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Ahead If Stellar manages to break and hold above $0.386, short-term targets sit at $0.41–$0.42, with a stronger push toward $0.45–$0.48 likely in the next 4–6 weeks. XLM's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: XLMUSD on Tradingview However, failure at resistance could send XLM back to retest support between $0.38 and $0.383, with a deeper drop toward $0.37 possible if sellers regain control. For now, XLM trades at $0.384 with a 3.5% intraday gain, reflecting cautious optimism. Traders are closely monitoring volume expansion and momentum indicators as confirmation signals.

The decision to diversify its AI system represents the company’s desire to maximize output from a range of AI providers, rather than depend on a single partner. Microsoft has begun incorporating technology from Anthropic into its flagship Office 365 applications, according to a report from The Information. For several years, Microsoft has primarily relied on OpenAI’s models for its AI-driven features in applications such as Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint, but developers working on Office AI enhancements found that Anthropic’s latest models outperformed OpenAI in certain tasks. Microsoft has begun incorporating Anthropic’s technology in its products The report specified that Anthropic’s models were said to handle complex financial functions in Excel more effectively and to produce more visually appealing PowerPoint presentations when given text-based instructions. This performance gap prompted Microsoft to begin blending Anthropic’s AI with OpenAI’s technology across Office tools. Microsoft is also currently advancing its own AI research and development while using DeepSeek’s models to bolster its Azure cloud services. According to the report, Microsoft will pay to access Anthropic’s models through Amazon Web Services (AWS) despite its competition with AWS in the cloud market. Microsoft plans to publicly announce its decision in the coming weeks, but the pricing of Office AI tools will remain unchanged for customers, the report added . Microsoft’s new partnerships Microsoft has been OpenAI’s largest backer , investing more than $13B into the San Francisco-based startup. The partnership secured Microsoft an early lead in the AI race with the rollout of generative AI features in Office 365 and the integration of OpenAI’s models into Azure. However, OpenAI is now facing stronger competition and its technology is failing to outperform them. The failure of GPT-5 to outperform Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 has driven Microsoft to acquire more partners for its AI systems. This multi-partner approach will help the company to meet the demand for AI features. AI adoption has spread among businesses as they are increasingly using the technology to streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance productivity tools. Microsoft’s efforts towards the improvement of the functionality and quality of its Office AI suite could help make it a more attractive option than its competitors like Google Workspace, which is also rolling out advanced AI features.

The Russian state-run news agency TASS reported that the comments came from Yevgeny Masharov, a member of the commission of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation for the Public Examination of Draft Laws and Other Regulatory Acts (OPRF). The OPRF is a policy-forming body, which advises the Kremlin and state lawmakers on legislative proposals. Masharov: Russian Crypto Bank Will Boost Transparency The policymaker opined that launching a state-operated crypto bank would help bring crypto into the legal sector and boost federal budget revenues. Masharov said: “A Russian crypto bank would solve several existing problems. It would bring hundreds of billions of rubles worth of [crypto] transactions out of the shadows.” Yevgeny Masharov (left) at a meeting of the commission of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation for the Public Examination of Draft Laws and Other Regulatory Acts (OPRF) earlier this month. (Source: @oprf_official/VK/Screenshot) Lawmakers have previously talked about the idea of launching state-run crypto exchanges . They also want to ban the quasi-legal coin exchanges that currently operate nationwide. Such a move would also help boost federal budget income, with new taxes imposed on crypto trading, he argued. Masharov noted that similar plans were already being put into place in nations like Belarus. TASS wrote that Minsk lawmakers are set to “develop a regulatory framework for the activities of a crypto bank in the near future.” Facebook and Instagram are already banned in Russia.

Earlier this month, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko told cabinet officials to develop more crypto-related industries to ensure Minsk can take a lead in the space. Lukashenko and other top Belarusian officials have been talking about creating a “national crypto bank” for some time. But the matter appears to have returned to the agenda in Minsk since Washington began rolling out crypto-related legislation earlier this year.

The policymaker added that launching a crypto bank would help “strike a blow against online fraud.” Moscow has been fighting a rise in what the financial sector calls “droppers.” This term refers to cash, card, and crypto mules that fraudsters, online casinos, and drug dealers use to launder money. Masharov said that the funds droppers collect are usually transferred to crypto wallets and then “legalized,” allowing criminals to spend them money on real estate and luxury goods. But restricting Russian crypto transactions to the confines of the bank, Moscow would be able to fight back against this form of fraud, the policymaker said. Bitcoin miners could also stand to benefit, he said. He added: “We still have no infrastructure that lets miners sell their coins in Russia.” And Masharov said that the new bank could also help Russian firms conduct safer cross-border business.

Here's what to know. https://t.co/KnhrPm9jhY — Bloomberg (@business) September 9, 2025 Russia remains disconnected from the SWIFT bank messaging network and heavily sanctioned by Washington, Brussels, and London. As such, many trade firms now use crypto in place of the US dollar in international trade payments. But most of these deals are conducted “outside the legal field,” Masharov said. This gives “fraudsters and Western intelligence agencies” the opportunity to “exploit gaps in legislation,” he concluded. In July this year, Masharov said Russian authorities should be have the power to seize tokens from illegal or quasi-legal Bitcoin miners . Bailiffs should be given the power to transfer these coins to Treasury-controlled crypto wallets , he urged.

Over the past week, the asset has advanced by 7.16%, reaching $3.01 after recovering from an early September price dip to $2.70. While Ethereum and some other altcoins have not joined this rebound, XRP has managed to sustain its upward momentum, drawing attention from analysts who are now outlining key resistance levels that could define the next phase of its performance. The Levels That Matter Most Market strategist EGRAG Crypto has identified the price thresholds XRP must overcome before bullish momentum can firmly return. In his assessment, the $2.94 region marks the first significant test. A daily close above this point is considered the initial confirmation of renewed strength. #XRP – Finishing or Continuation of the Throwback? : If #XRP can close above $2.94 with conviction, and push past the 33 SMA around $3.01, we’ll start to see early signs that the bulls are in control, potentially finishing the throwback. The low from September 1st could… pic.twitter.com/nUtQj2sDEj — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 8, 2025 XRP already achieved this requirement on September 8, closing at $2.9694, its highest closing value so far this month and the strongest finish since late August. However, one condition remains unmet, surpassing the 33-day simple moving average (SMA). This moving average, which stood at $2.9962 at the time, blocked XRP from breaking through the $3 threshold. As of now, the 33-day SMA has adjusted slightly to $2.9853, while XRP trades around $2.9616. According to EGRAG, closing above this SMA would not only confirm resilience but also signal the completion of what he termed a “throwback”, a corrective phase that pulled prices down to $2.70 earlier this month. If this plays out as expected, that price level could end up being the recent low. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Beyond the 33-Day SMA EGRAG also highlighted further milestones that would strengthen the bullish case. After reclaiming the 33-day SMA, XRP would need to rise above the 55-day SMA, which currently sits at $3.066. Crossing this threshold would provide additional evidence that buyers are regaining dominance. The analyst then identified $3.40 as the critical resistance level that could fully shift momentum in favor of the bulls. He labeled this range as the decisive confirmation zone, noting that it coincides with XRP’s January 2025 peak before the token entered a prolonged consolidation phase. A move above $3.40, according to his projection, could set the stage for a rally toward $4.20. Diverging Views and Risks While EGRAG emphasized caution, warning that weakness between $2.94 and $3 could lead to a continuation of the correction, other analysts are more optimistic. Market commentator Gordon argued that XRP’s extended consolidation provides a strong base for a significant breakout. He projected that, once momentum builds, the token could advance toward $6. Overall, XRP’s ability to close decisively above $2.94 and break through the 33-day and 55-day SMAs will be crucial in determining whether the market can transition out of correction territory. The coming days will reveal whether the asset can secure these levels and confirm a broader bullish reversal.

The window of opportunity for Ruvi AI (RUVI) at its current $0.020 price point is closing at an unprecedented rate, as its presale token became a top-trending asset after Phase 2 sold out in record time. For investors who have been waiting for the right moment, this might be one of the last chances to get in on the ground floor of a project with the potential for life-changing returns. The demand for Ruvi AI has been nothing short of explosive. The presale is on the verge of crossing the $3.6 million mark, with over 265 million tokens already sold to a rapidly growing and passionate community of more than 3,500 investors . The speed at which Phase 2 finished has sent a clear message to the market: Ruvi AI is one of the most sought-after projects of this cycle, and the opportunity to buy in at these low prices is disappearing fast. Credibility and Utility: The Foundation for Explosive Growth What makes Ruvi AI such a compelling opportunity is its powerful combination of real-world utility and rock-solid credibility. The project’s commitment to security and transparency is demonstrated by its successful completion of a comprehensive smart contract audit with CyberScope , a reputable third-party security firm. This crucial validation, along with a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , has cemented Ruvi AI’s status as a legitimate, high-growth AI project that is attracting serious attention from major players. A Revolutionary Super App for a $104 Billion Industry The engine driving this incredible demand is Ruvi AI’s revolutionary super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is designed to empower content creators in the booming $104 billion creator economy . By providing a suite of AI-powered tools that solve critical industry challenges, Ruvi AI is creating a foundation for mass adoption and sustainable, long-term demand for its token. Key features of the super app include: Advanced Trend Research: Helps creators identify viral topics before they become saturated, providing a significant competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram in minutes. Native Media Creation: Allows users to generate professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, reducing production costs. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire content creation process, from planning to scheduling, to maximize productivity. Last Call: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge Is Imminent The presale has now entered Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at a highly attractive $0.020 . However, given the speed at which Phase 2 sold out, this opportunity is extremely limited. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO, driving record sales as savvy investors race to lock in an immediate paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s path to a multi-million-dollar valuation for its early investors is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience upon launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broader market adoption. For investors aiming to maximize their returns, the project’s VIP program offers a clear and compelling path to significant wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. Don’t Let This Opportunity Slip Away As the presale accelerates and a 40% price surge looms, it’s clear that the chance to buy Ruvi AI at $0.020 is a rare one. For investors looking for this bull run’s defining success story, the time to act is now, before the window to potential millions closes for good.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $853.93. In 2031, AAVE will range between $1,280.9 to $1,387.64. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain .

Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $297.85 Market cap $4.53B Trading volume (24-h) $467.36M Circulating supply 15.22M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $309.84 24-hour high $295.32 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.07% 50-day SMA $300.57 14-Day RSI 47.66 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 48 (Neutral) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $242.56 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE has repeatedly faced rejection at $310. Support zone rests at $295–$283. Despite the volume uptick, signals still lean bearish. Aave 1-day price chart On the 1-day chart for September 9, AAVE closed at $297 after slipping below $300 again, leaving a weak red candle that sits right on mid-range support. The Bollinger midline at $317 has repeatedly capped recovery attempts, while the lower band at $283 now acts as soft support. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView RSI sits neutral near 50 but without direction, and MACD remains in bearish territory, suggesting momentum is still tilted down. Unless buyers can reclaim $317, the structure risks leaning back toward $283, where a stronger test of demand would occur. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour price chart, AAVE failed to hold above $310 and quickly punched lower, now consolidating around $294–$300. The Alligator lines are stacked bearishly, with short-term averages pressing from above near $302–$304. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has picked up slightly, but not enough to show conviction from either side. Immediate support rests at $295 and $290, while $303–$305 is the near-term lid that needs reclaiming for bulls to regain any traction. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $309.77 SELL SMA 5 $306.68 SELL SMA 10 $318.68 SELL SMA 21 $317.09 SELL SMA 50 $300.57 SELL SMA 100 $288.94 BUY SMA 200 $242.56 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 312.29 SELL EMA 5 $ 314.91 SELL EMA 10 $ 316.94 SELL EMA 21 $ 312.91 SELL EMA 50 $ 301.25 SELL EMA 100 $ 283.12 BUY EMA 200 $ 258.47 BUY AAVE price analysis conclusion Unless AAVE can firmly clear $310, price action will likely drift sideways with a slight downward bias. The $295–$283 zone is where buyers need to step in, while only a decisive break above $317 would start to tilt momentum back in favor of the bulls. Is AAVE a good investment?

A recent analysis from community figure Pumpius explored how XRP could, under certain conditions, rise to a three-digit price. Two Drivers Behind the Projection Pumpius argued that XRP’s growth will depend on practical use rather than speculation. In his view, the token’s value comes from its role as a bridge for liquidity, enabling the transfer of funds across markets and borders. He identified two scenarios that could substantially lift XRP’s price: Ripple obtaining a U.S. national trust banking license, and multinational corporations deploying the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for treasury and supply chain operations. HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED? What’s the true price potential of XRP if adoption goes all the way? From banks to central banks, from corporations to capital markets and beyond into genomic identity. Here’s the ladder pic.twitter.com/TDWECRNRtB — Pumpius (@pumpius) September 6, 2025 Banking License as a Catalyst Ripple applied to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in July 2025 to establish Ripple National Trust Bank. If approved, the institution would be allowed to provide custody services, manage stablecoins, and operate with tokenized assets under federal oversight. A decision is expected in October. Pumpius estimated that approval could result in annual settlement flows of roughly $500 billion through Ripple’s network, potentially supporting XRP’s climb to around $50 . While the filing does not explicitly reference XRP, Ripple’s existing products and ecosystem suggest indirect benefits. Ripple has prepared for this step by acquiring Standard Custody & Trust, securing partnerships with firms such as BNY Mellon for safeguarding reserves of its RLUSD stablecoin, and expanding into tokenization initiatives. Ripple’s RLUSD, launched in late 2024, has achieved a market capitalization of over $730 million, showcasing Ripple’s increasing presence in regulated financial sectors. Critics, however, remain cautious. Groups such as the Independent Community Bankers of America have raised concerns that federally chartered crypto banks could bypass certain consumer protection safeguards. Ripple is seeking a Federal Reserve master account to enable direct management of reserves associated with its RLUSD stablecoin. This move could enable Ripple to tap into major payment systems and bolster its initiatives in regulated digital financial services We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Enterprise Adoption as the Next Step In addition to regulatory progress, Pumpius suggested that large corporations moving treasury or supply chain functions to XRPL could unlock further value. He projected that if companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, or Tesla shifted even a portion of their operations, XRP could help facilitate up to $5 trillion in annual flows. Under this scenario, he argued that XRP could reach as high as $100. No major multinational has announced such a move, but Ripple already maintains relationships with more than 300 financial institutions. Many of these partners use XRP for cross-border settlement through its On-Demand Liquidity service . Smaller firms, including VivoPower and Trident Digital , have also adopted XRP for treasury or payment purposes, offering early examples of corporate integration at a smaller scale. Regulatory Clarity Could Encourage Growth The legal environment for XRP has improved following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2023 ruling that secondary market sales of the token are not considered securities transactions. Supporters argue this clarity may encourage additional institutional interest, although widespread corporate adoption remains speculative. While XRP remains far from the triple-digit levels suggested by Pumpius, his analysis reflects optimism within parts of the community about Ripple’s regulatory and enterprise prospects. Achieving a federal trust banking license coupled with substantial corporate adoption could mark a pivotal advancement for Ripple and the XRP ecosystem.

51471504,577373,1757462452,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51471504.jpeg,Here’s Why Crypto Analysts Are Predicting Dogecoin Price To Explode This Week,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-to-explode/,"The Dogecoin price is expected to stage a breakout in the days ahead, with crypto analysts highlighting key catalysts that could drive this rally. Despite weeks of sideways movement and steady dumping by whales , attention is now shifting to emerging technical indicators and a potential Dogecoin ETF as possible triggers for a price explosion this week. ETF Buzz Signal Dogecoin Price Surge This Week According to a TradingView analyst identified as ‘CryptoJobs,’ the possibility of Dogecoin’s first-ever ETF launching in the United States as early as next week could trigger an explosive price surge. This development would mark a major milestone for the popular meme coin, granting it unprecedented visibility and legitimacy within the broader financial system. Historically, ETF approvals have fueled rallies across the crypto market, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing notable spikes after similar announcements. Beyond the ETF hype, CryptoJobs highlights a key technical setup that further paints a bullish picture for the Dogecoin price trajectory. They note that Dogecoin is forming a classic Falling Wedge pattern on its 4-hour chart. Based on past trends, this pattern is considered a bullish reversal setup, often signaling that a breakout to the upside is near. The chart also illustrates that Dogecoin is moving within a solid medium-term accumulation phase , consolidating around key levels. These key price levels align with a long-term support range, which CryptoJobs identifies between $0.205 and $0.207. As price consolidates within the Falling Wedge, the analyst predicts that an explosive move of at least 15% could unfold as early as next week, potentially fueled by News of a Dogecoin ETF. The chart points to a potential upward rally toward $0.26 if DOGE sustains its bullish momentum . Further upside targets are projected near $0.277 and $0.28, while key support levels rest in the $0.21 to $0.19 range. Analyst Identifies Two Short-term Targets For DOGE Another well-followed TradingView analyst, Klejdi Cuni, has shared his perspective, pointing to two clear targets for Dogecoin’s next upward leg. Cuni highlights the strong support area around $0.207, which has repeatedly acted as a springboard for price rebounds over the past month. Each time DOGE has tested this level, it has bounced back with strong bullish momentum, reinforcing confidence in the area as a base for higher prices. In his latest chart analysis, the market expert outlines the potential for a minor pullback into the $0.213 – $0.216 range before momentum resumes. From there, his key upside targets are $0.23 and $0.24. These levels represent previous zones where price faced resistance, making them realistic short-term goals for traders watching the market closely. Cuni’s optimistic projection is further supported by a small bullish continuation pattern that has formed on the Dogecoin price chart.",Dogecoin|bitcoin|CryptoJobs|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|Dogecoin spot etf|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Ethereum|Falling Wedge Pattern|Klejdi Cuni,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|DOGE|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-10 00:00:52

PredictIt, a well-known platform, has officially received approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to launch an exchange. This crucial development marks a monumental step, transforming a popular betting site into a regulated financial entity. The details surrounding the specific type of exchange are still emerging, but the implications for the future of forecasting and regulated markets are profound. The PredictIt exchange launch represents a new chapter for the industry. What Does the PredictIt Exchange Launch Mean for Prediction Markets? For years, PredictIt has operated as a unique platform where individuals could place small-stakes bets on the outcomes of political events, economic indicators, and other real-world occurrences. Its primary goal was to provide data for academic research, operating under a “no-action” letter from the CFTC. This new approval, however, elevates its status considerably. The CFTC is the federal agency responsible for regulating the U.S. futures and options markets. Their explicit approval for the PredictIt exchange launch means the platform will now operate under a more formal regulatory framework. This transition is expected to bring increased transparency, enhanced user protection, and potentially broader institutional interest in prediction markets. This move is not merely a change in operational status; it signifies a maturation of the prediction market concept. It indicates that regulators are beginning to see the potential for these markets beyond simple entertainment, recognizing their utility as tools for forecasting and risk assessment. It’s a clear signal that the regulatory environment for such platforms is evolving. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: Why is CFTC Approval Crucial? Operating a prediction market in the U.S. has historically been fraught with regulatory ambiguities. Many platforms have faced legal challenges or been forced to operate offshore due to the complex nature of classifying these markets. Are they gambling? Are they derivatives? The CFTC’s decision provides much-needed clarity. The CFTC’s approval for the PredictIt exchange launch is crucial for several reasons: Legitimacy: It bestows official regulatory recognition, removing the “grey area” status. Investor Protection: Users can expect stronger safeguards against fraud, manipulation, and unfair practices. Market Integrity: The CFTC’s oversight helps ensure fair and orderly markets, building trust among participants. Precedent Setting: This could pave the way for other similar platforms to seek regulatory approval, fostering innovation within a controlled environment. This regulatory clarity is a significant benefit, not just for PredictIt, but for the entire prediction market ecosystem, offering a template for future developments. The Potential of PredictIt’s Exchange Launch: Opportunities Ahead With CFTC approval, PredictIt is poised to unlock a range of new opportunities. While the specific details of the exchange’s operation are yet to be fully disclosed, the shift to a regulated model could bring substantial advantages. Benefits for participants could include: Increased confidence in the platform’s stability and fairness. Potentially higher trading volumes and deeper liquidity, leading to more accurate prices. A broader array of market offerings, as regulatory clarity allows for expansion. Greater acceptance from financial institutions and data analysts who might have previously shied away from unregulated markets. Actionable Insight: For current PredictIt users, it is vital to review any updated terms of service and operational guidelines that will accompany the new exchange launch. Understanding these changes will be key to continued participation. What Challenges Lie Ahead for PredictIt’s New Exchange? While the CFTC approval is a major victory, the path forward for the PredictIt exchange launch will not be without its challenges. Transitioning from a research-focused platform to a fully regulated exchange comes with new responsibilities and potential hurdles. Some of the challenges PredictIt might face include: Operational Compliance: Meeting the ongoing, stringent reporting and compliance requirements of the CFTC. User Adaptation: Educating existing users about the new regulatory framework and any changes to their trading experience. Competition: Navigating a competitive landscape that includes both traditional betting sites and other emerging prediction platforms. Public Perception: Shifting the narrative from a “political betting site” to a legitimate, regulated financial exchange will require strategic communication. Successfully addressing these challenges will be crucial for PredictIt to fully capitalize on its newfound regulatory status and establish itself as a leading player in the regulated prediction market space. A New Era for Prediction Markets The announcement of CFTC approval for the PredictIt exchange launch is truly a landmark event. It signals a significant maturation of prediction markets, moving them from the periphery into a more mainstream, regulated financial environment. This development holds immense promise for increasing transparency, enhancing user protection, and fostering innovation in how we forecast and understand future events. As PredictIt embarks on this new chapter, the industry will be watching closely to see how this crucial approval reshapes the future of prediction and political betting. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is PredictIt? A1: PredictIt is an online platform that allows users to bet on the outcomes of future events, primarily political and economic, operating as a prediction market. It was initially designed for academic research purposes. Q2: What does CFTC approval mean for PredictIt? A2: CFTC approval means PredictIt has received official regulatory recognition from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to operate an exchange. This transition brings enhanced oversight, increased transparency, and stronger user protections, moving it from a “no-action” letter status to a formally regulated entity. Q3: How will this affect current PredictIt users? A3: While specific operational changes are yet to be fully detailed, users can expect a more regulated and secure trading environment. It is crucial for users to review any updated terms of service and platform guidelines that will be released as the new exchange launches. Q4: Will PredictIt now offer new types of markets? A4: The CFTC approval could potentially allow PredictIt to expand its market offerings, given the newfound regulatory clarity. However, any new markets would still need to comply with CFTC regulations and guidelines, which may influence the types of events available for prediction. Q5: Does this set a precedent for other prediction markets? A5: Yes, the CFTC’s decision for the PredictIt exchange launch is likely to set an important precedent. It provides a potential roadmap for other prediction market platforms seeking to operate legally and under regulation within the United States.

Social media marketing firm Asset Entities (ASST) has made a groundbreaking move, approving a merger with U.S. asset manager Strive. This isn’t just any corporate deal; it’s a strategic maneuver designed to facilitate a substantial Asset Entities Bitcoin buy , signaling a strong institutional embrace of digital assets and a bold step into the future of finance. What’s Behind the Asset Entities Bitcoin Buy Strategy? This pivotal approval, as reported by The Block, comes after Strive CEO Matt Cole’s previously stated plan. His vision was clear: conduct a reverse merger with Asset Entities to gain a coveted Nasdaq listing. This strategic move provides Strive with the public market access necessary to execute its ambitious financial goals. Once listed, the combined entity aims to acquire over $700 million in Bitcoin. This demonstrates a clear, forward-thinking strategy to integrate a significant digital asset into a traditional financial framework. The merger allows Strive to tap into public capital markets, which are crucial for funding such a large-scale acquisition. Following the merger, the new, combined company will operate under the name Strive. However, it will maintain continuity for investors by continuing to trade publicly under the familiar ticker symbol ASST. This ensures a smooth transition while leveraging the established market presence of Asset Entities. The Tremendous Impact of a $700 Million BTC Acquisition A $700 million Bitcoin buy by a newly formed entity like Strive carries considerable weight in the crypto market. It signifies a growing trend of institutional players recognizing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a core, long-term component of a diversified portfolio. This isn’t a small fund; it’s a major commitment. Consider these key implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem: Increased Market Confidence: Such large-scale purchases can significantly bolster overall market confidence, potentially attracting other institutional investors who might be on the fence. It acts as a strong signal of legitimacy. Demand Surge and Price Dynamics: A significant buy order of this magnitude can influence Bitcoin’s price dynamics by absorbing available supply, especially if executed over a concentrated period. This adds consistent buying pressure. Validation of Bitcoin’s Role: It further validates Bitcoin’s role as a digital gold, a store of value, and a potential hedge against traditional market inflation in the eyes of traditional finance. This narrative gains strength with each institutional adoption.

A public listing provides several advantages: Enhanced Capital Access: Public companies have greater access to capital markets, allowing them to raise funds more easily for significant investments like a $700 million Bitcoin purchase. Increased Transparency and Credibility: Operating as a publicly traded company on a major exchange like Nasdaq typically entails higher levels of regulatory scrutiny and reporting. This can enhance investor trust and provide greater transparency regarding the firm’s operations and asset holdings. Liquidity for Investors: A Nasdaq listing offers liquidity for shareholders, making it easier for them to buy and sell shares, which can attract a broader investor base. This strategic maneuver by Asset Entities and Strive highlights a sophisticated understanding of how to leverage traditional financial structures to participate in the burgeoning digital asset economy. What Does This Mean for Future Institutional Bitcoin Buys? The proactive approach taken by Asset Entities and Strive could be a blueprint for other companies looking to make substantial moves into the crypto space. It’s an actionable insight for investors to closely observe how traditional companies are adapting to and integrating digital assets. Challenges might include navigating regulatory landscapes that are still evolving, managing market volatility, and ensuring robust security for such significant Bitcoin holdings. However, the potential benefits, including diversification and exposure to a high-growth asset class, clearly outweigh these risks for Strive. This merger is not just a transaction; it’s a statement. It signals a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class within established financial circles. The groundbreaking merger between Asset Entities and Strive, culminating in plans for a colossal $700 million Asset Entities Bitcoin buy , marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrency. This strategic alliance underscores Bitcoin’s increasing appeal to institutional investors and sets a powerful example for future corporate adoption.

Imagine participating in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) meeting with members from across the globe, or attending an international blockchain conference, and understanding every word spoken, instantly. This is precisely the kind of transformative experience the new AirPods Pro 3 aim to deliver, making real-time communication more accessible and intuitive than ever before. For crypto enthusiasts and global citizens alike, this innovation promises to bridge divides and foster a more connected world. Experience the Future: How AirPods Pro 3 Revolutionize Live Translation Apple’s latest iteration of its popular wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro 3 , introduces a groundbreaking live translation feature that promises to change how we interact across linguistic divides. This isn’t just about translating text; it’s about delivering spoken language directly into your ears, in real-time. The core of this functionality lies in its seamless integration and intuitive control, allowing users to prompt translations through simple, natural gestures. This hands-free approach ensures that conversations remain fluid and engaging, without the need to constantly look at a screen or pass a device back and forth. The experience is designed to be as natural as possible. When you’re speaking with someone in a different language, you can activate the translation feature with a quick gesture, such as a squeeze on the AirPod stem. The device then intelligently processes the incoming speech, translates it, and delivers it to your ear. Simultaneously, your spoken words are translated for the other person, creating a two-way communication flow that feels remarkably organic. This advancement is particularly significant for the crypto community, where international partnerships and cross-border discussions are daily occurrences, often involving participants from diverse linguistic backgrounds. The Brain Behind the Breakthrough: Apple Intelligence Powers Real-Time Translation At the heart of this remarkable capability is Apple Intelligence , Apple’s advanced artificial intelligence framework. This sophisticated AI engine is responsible for the complex processing required to perform accurate and low-latency real-time translation . It goes beyond simple word-for-word substitution, leveraging deep learning models to understand context, nuances, and idiomatic expressions, thereby providing translations that are not only accurate but also natural-sounding. Apple Intelligence processes vast amounts of linguistic data, continuously learning and improving its translation capabilities. Here’s how Apple Intelligence contributes to the superior translation experience: Contextual Understanding: The AI analyzes the entire sentence and conversation flow to ensure translations are contextually appropriate, reducing misinterpretations. Accent and Dialect Recognition: It is trained on a wide variety of accents and dialects, enhancing its ability to accurately transcribe and translate diverse speech patterns. Low Latency Processing: Optimized algorithms minimize the delay between spoken word and translated output, making conversations feel more immediate. Privacy-Focused Design: Much of the processing for translation can occur on-device, enhancing user privacy by reducing reliance on cloud-based data transfers for sensitive conversations. For those in the crypto space, where precise communication about technical specifications, financial transactions, and regulatory frameworks is crucial, the reliability and accuracy offered by Apple Intelligence are invaluable. It ensures that critical details are not lost in translation, fostering trust and clarity in global interactions. Silencing the World for Clearer Communication: The Role of Noise Cancellation One of the most critical elements contributing to the efficacy of the AirPods Pro 3 ‘s live translation feature is its industry-leading noise cancellation . In any real-world scenario, background noise—whether it’s the hum of a coffee shop, the chatter of a busy market, or the general ambient sounds of a conference hall—can severely impede the clarity and accuracy of voice recognition and, consequently, translation. Apple has ingeniously leveraged its advanced noise cancellation technology to address this challenge head-on. Here’s how noise cancellation enhances the translation experience: Isolating the Speaker’s Voice: The AirPods Pro 3 actively reduce the volume of ambient noise, allowing the microphone to capture the speaker’s voice with exceptional clarity. This ensures that the audio input for translation is clean and free from interference. Elevating the Translated Output: For the user receiving the translation, noise cancellation mutes or significantly lowers external distractions, making the translated voice clear and prominent in their ear. This ensures that the user can focus solely on the translated message without competing sounds. Adaptive Audio: The system dynamically adjusts noise cancellation levels based on the environment, providing an optimal balance between immersion and situational awareness, while always prioritizing the clarity of the translated speech. Imagine negotiating a deal for a new decentralized finance (DeFi) project in a bustling international city. The ability of the AirPods Pro 3 to cut through the noise and deliver precise translations can be the difference between a successful partnership and a missed opportunity. This focus on clear audio input and output is what truly elevates the live translation feature from a mere novelty to a powerful communication tool. Benefits and Real-World Applications: Who Stands to Gain? The introduction of such advanced real-time translation capabilities in the AirPods Pro 3 offers a plethora of benefits across various sectors, particularly for a globally connected community like cryptocurrency users: Breaking Down Global Barriers for Crypto Enthusiasts International Conferences and Meetups: Attending events like EthDenver, Consensus, or Token2049, where speakers and attendees come from dozens of countries, becomes far more inclusive and productive. DAO Governance and Collaboration: Facilitating seamless communication among diverse members of decentralized autonomous organizations, ensuring every voice is heard and understood, regardless of native language. Cross-Border Business and Trading: Engaging with international partners, clients, or exchanges becomes straightforward, eliminating the need for human interpreters or cumbersome translation apps. Educational Content: Accessing foreign-language webinars, podcasts, or lectures on blockchain technology and crypto trends without a language impediment. Beyond Crypto: Broader Impact Travel and Tourism: Navigating foreign countries, interacting with locals, ordering food, or asking for directions becomes stress-free. International Business: Streamlining meetings, negotiations, and collaborations with global teams, improving efficiency and reducing miscommunication. Healthcare and Emergency Services: Bridging communication gaps between patients and medical professionals in critical situations. Education: Enabling students and educators to connect and learn across linguistic boundaries.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a vital tool for many investors, offering a snapshot of current market sentiment. Recently, this crucial indicator rose one point to 49, firmly placing it in the neutral zone. This subtle shift provides valuable insights into how participants are feeling about their crypto holdings. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and How Does it Work? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is designed to gauge the overall emotional state of the crypto market. It helps investors understand whether the market is leaning towards extreme fear or extreme greed. When the index approaches 0, it signals extreme fear, often indicating potential buying opportunities. Conversely, an index near 100 suggests extreme greed, which can sometimes precede a market correction. But how exactly is this fascinating metric calculated? It’s not just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key market factors. Each factor contributes to the overall score, providing a comprehensive view of sentiment: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them to average values over 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often signals fear. Market Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a positive market typically indicate greedy behavior, while low volumes can suggest fear or indecision. Social Media Mentions (15%): The volume and sentiment of cryptocurrency-related hashtags on social media platforms are analyzed. A surge in positive mentions can signal greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, these polls directly ask crypto investors about their market outlook, providing a direct sentiment reading. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market dominance can indicate fear, as investors might be shifting away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Search Trends (10%): Analyzing search queries related to cryptocurrencies helps identify retail investor interest. A spike in searches for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ might suggest fear. Why is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 49 Significant? The current reading of 49 places the Crypto Fear & Greed Index squarely in the neutral territory. This position is quite interesting because it suggests a balanced market, where neither extreme panic nor irrational exuberance is dominating. Unlike the volatile swings between ‘extreme fear’ and ‘extreme greed’ that often characterize crypto, a neutral stance can offer a period of consolidation and thoughtful consideration for investors. A neutral reading implies that market participants are not making decisions based purely on emotion. Instead, there might be a more rational assessment of market conditions, fundamental values, and technical indicators. This can be a healthier environment for sustained growth, as opposed to speculative bubbles or panic-driven sell-offs. For investors, this neutral zone can represent an opportunity to re-evaluate strategies without the pressure of extreme market sentiment. It’s a moment to observe, plan, and potentially make calculated moves rather than reactive ones. Understanding this balanced state is crucial for long-term success in the dynamic crypto landscape. How Can You Leverage the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Better Decisions? While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful indicator, it’s essential to use it as part of a broader investment strategy, not as a standalone signal. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Investing: Many successful investors use the index as a contrarian indicator. They consider buying when the index signals ‘extreme fear’ and selling or taking profits when it signals ‘extreme greed’. Risk Management: A high ‘greed’ score might prompt you to review your portfolio’s risk exposure, perhaps reducing positions in highly speculative assets. Conversely, ‘fear’ could be a time to consider dollar-cost averaging into promising projects. Market Confirmation: Use the index to confirm your own analysis. If your research suggests a bullish trend but the index shows extreme fear, it might indicate an undervalued opportunity. If your research points to a top and the index shows extreme greed, it reinforces your caution. Avoid Emotional Trading: The primary benefit of the index is to help investors detach from their own emotions. By providing an objective measure of market sentiment, it encourages more disciplined decision-making. However, remember that the crypto market is complex. The index is one piece of the puzzle. Always combine its insights with thorough fundamental and technical analysis, and consider your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Conclusion: Navigating the Neutral Zone with Confidence The Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 49 in the neutral zone offers a fascinating glimpse into the current state of the cryptocurrency market. It suggests a period where emotions are not running rampant, allowing for more rational and strategic decision-making. By understanding how this index is calculated and what its readings imply, investors can gain a significant edge in navigating the often-turbulent waters of crypto. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to the space, using tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can empower you to make more informed choices, reduce emotional trading, and ultimately, build a more resilient investment portfolio. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and always approach the market with a well-thought-out plan. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a ‘neutral’ reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A ‘neutral’ reading, like 49, indicates that the market is not dominated by extreme fear or extreme greed. Investors are likely making more rational decisions, and the market may be in a period of consolidation or balanced sentiment. Q2: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index only based on Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s market dominance is one factor, the index considers broader market data, including volatility, trading volume, social media, and Google trends across the cryptocurrency ecosystem, not just Bitcoin specifically. Q3: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to predict market tops and bottoms? Many investors use the index as a contrarian indicator, viewing ‘extreme fear’ as a potential buying opportunity and ‘extreme greed’ as a potential selling opportunity. However, it should be used in conjunction with other analytical tools, not as a sole predictor. Q4: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh perspective on market sentiment for the current day. Q5: What are the main factors that influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index is calculated based on volatility, trading volume, social media mentions, surveys, Bitcoin’s market dominance, and Google search trends, each weighted differently. Q6: Does the index consider news events? Indirectly, yes. Major news events can influence volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, and Google search trends, which are all components of the index’s calculation.

The finding raises intrigue within the crypto community, as questions swirl over whether the funds are lost, frozen, or simply being held in reserve. Why The Coins Remain Untouched In an X post, Elite KOL Crypto Patel, who is also associated with CoinMarketCap and Binance, has highlighted that Germany’s Bitcoin crackdown has encountered a major roadblock. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham has revealed a massive trove of untouched BTC connected to the now-defunct Movie2K piracy site, suggesting that German authorities’ seizure efforts may have hit a wall. Related Reading: El Salvador’s Bitcoin Journey Hits 4-Year Mark, Results Still Divisive According to the report, approximately 45,000 BTC, valued at around $5 billion, has been sitting dormant across over 100 wallets since 2019. These coins are believed to still be under the control of the site’s original operators. Earlier in 2024, German authorities successfully seized nearly 50,000 BTC, which were later liquidated for about $2.9 billion. However, despite that high-profile move, this new revelation highlights that a significant portion of the Movie2K fortune is still out of reach. Bitcoin continues to gain notable mainstream adoption among prominent figures, institutions, and countries. Crypto expert Hashley Giles explained that Bitcoin is an ideal balance sheet asset for a wide range of profitable businesses of all sizes and across all industries. In the United Kingdom, opening an e-money account is a straightforward way for companies to gain BTC exposure without straining existing banking relationships. Accounting is also simple when businesses focus on accumulating rather than trading, removing the complexity of constant mark-to-market volatility. Beyond ease of integration, Bitcoin offers unmatched liquidity. Companies can instantly convert BTC into pounds within seconds whenever business performance requires it, and even on weekends when banks are closed. Compared to the ultra-low interest rates on business bank deposit savings in the UK, those with slightly better yields often require 90-day or longer notice periods before funds can be accessed. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no notice period, making it both flexible and efficient. Maintaining Bitcoin’s Security While Unlocking Liquidity Bitcoin has long been the most trusted digital asset. However, to fulfill its potential and truly power real economies, it requires a stable unit of account. BSquaredNetwork emphasized that the missing piece is U2, a BTC-backed, USD-pegged stablecoin designed to preserve Bitcoin’s security while unlocking global liquidity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Purchases Down Amid Record Holdings – What Does This Mean? BSquaredNetwork’s vision extends beyond simple payments. With U2 as a stable unit of account, BTC can transform into the settlement engine for payment, decentralized finance (DeFi), and even AI-to-AI microtransactions.

An address linked to the prominent Chinese investment firm, Longling Capital, executed a substantial Longling Capital Binance Deposit , moving millions in various digital assets to the leading exchange. This move, totaling approximately $14.7 million, has naturally sparked considerable discussion about its potential implications for the market and the firm’s strategic outlook. What Exactly Was the Longling Capital Binance Deposit? Roughly three hours ago, according to on-chain analytics from Onchain Lens, an address associated with Longling Capital made a notable transfer to Binance. The assets involved were: 4.065 million WLD , valued at approximately $7.42 million. 1,000 ETH (Ethereum), worth around $4.31 million. 3 million USDT (Tether), maintaining its $3 million value. These combined transfers highlight a strategic repositioning or profit-taking maneuver by the investment firm. Such large-scale movements by institutional players often provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. Unpacking the Profit: A Successful Trading Strategy? The analysis from Onchain Lens suggests that this particular Longling Capital Binance Deposit resulted in a realized profit of approximately $3.84 million. This substantial gain underscores the firm’s adeptness in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency markets. For many, this figure represents more than just a number; it reflects successful asset accumulation and well-timed execution. Realized profits like these are a testament to strategic investment decisions, potentially involving long-term holdings or astute short-term trading. It’s a crucial aspect for understanding how large entities manage their digital asset portfolios. What Does This Longling Capital Binance Deposit Mean for WLD, ETH, and USDT? When an entity like Longling Capital moves such a large volume of assets, it inevitably raises questions about the future performance of those specific cryptocurrencies. While a deposit to an exchange doesn’t automatically mean an immediate sell-off, it often precedes increased liquidity or potential trading activity. WLD (Worldcoin): The largest portion of the deposit, 4.065 million WLD, could introduce significant selling pressure if the firm decides to offload these tokens. This might influence WLD’s short-term price dynamics. ETH (Ethereum): A deposit of 1,000 ETH, while substantial, represents a smaller fraction of Ethereum’s vast market capitalization compared to WLD. Its impact might be less pronounced but still warrants observation. USDT (Tether): As a stablecoin, USDT’s deposit typically signifies a move into a more liquid, less volatile asset, often used to facilitate further trading or simply to hold value after taking profits from other cryptocurrencies. How Do Institutional Moves Like This Influence the Broader Market? Institutional activities, such as this significant Longling Capital Binance Deposit , play a vital role in shaping market sentiment. When large investment firms make such moves, retail investors often pay close attention, seeking cues for their own strategies. These actions can be interpreted in several ways: Profit-Taking: The most straightforward interpretation is that Longling Capital is locking in profits from its holdings, especially given the reported $3.84 million gain. Strategic Rebalancing: The firm might be rebalancing its portfolio, moving out of certain assets to prepare for new investments or to reduce exposure to specific risks. Increased Liquidity: Deposits to exchanges enhance the available supply for trading, which can impact market depth and price stability. Understanding these potential motivations is key to interpreting the broader market implications of such large-scale transfers. Concluding Thoughts on Longling Capital’s Latest Move The recent Longling Capital Binance Deposit serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights the strategic maneuvers of institutional players and their capacity to realize substantial profits from their digital asset investments. While the immediate impact on WLD, ETH, and USDT prices remains to be fully seen, this event provides a clear snapshot of ongoing institutional activity and its potential to influence market sentiment and liquidity. Keeping an eye on these on-chain movements is essential for anyone looking to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Longling Capital?

Q3: What does ‘realized profit’ mean in this context? A3: Realized profit refers to the gain an investor makes when they sell an asset for more than its purchase price. In this case, the address associated with Longling Capital made an estimated $3.84 million profit from these transactions. Q4: How do large deposits to exchanges affect cryptocurrency prices? A4: Large deposits can increase the supply of an asset available for trading on an exchange. If these assets are then sold, it can create selling pressure and potentially lead to a price decrease. Conversely, if they are held or used for other purposes, the impact might be minimal. Q5: Why is it important to track institutional crypto movements?

The latest buzz is all about the Altcoin Season Index , which has just surged to 56! This significant move signals a potential shift in market dynamics, making it a crucial indicator for every crypto enthusiast and investor. Understanding this index can provide invaluable insights into where the market might be heading next. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index , meticulously compiled by CoinMarketCap, serves as a vital barometer for the cryptocurrency market. It helps us understand whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated metric designed to provide clarity in a complex market. It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Crucially, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to ensure a pure assessment of market sentiment and genuine growth. The performance of these altcoins is measured against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The recent rise of the Altcoin Season Index by four points from the previous day to 56 suggests growing momentum for altcoins. While not yet a full-blown altcoin season, this upward trend is certainly catching the attention of astute investors. Decoding the Index: When Does Altcoin Season Begin? Understanding the score of the Altcoin Season Index is key to grasping prevailing market trends. A score closer to 100 indicates a strong altcoin season, where a significant portion of the market’s capital flows into alternative cryptocurrencies. Specifically, an altcoin season is officially declared when a staggering 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90-day period. This threshold signifies a broad-based rally across the altcoin market. Conversely, if Bitcoin is the dominant performer, we find ourselves in a ‘Bitcoin season’. During such times, Bitcoin typically consolidates its position, often drawing capital away from altcoins. The current movement of the Altcoin Season Index at 56 shows a compelling shift towards altcoin strength, indicating that more altcoins are beginning to outshine Bitcoin. Why Does the Altcoin Season Index Matter for Your Portfolio? For investors, the Altcoin Season Index offers invaluable insights into potential market rotations. Recognizing the signs of an impending altcoin season can present significant opportunities for portfolio growth and strategic adjustments. During these periods, many altcoins can experience rapid price appreciation, often outpacing Bitcoin’s gains. Strategic Allocation: It helps investors decide whether to increase their exposure to altcoins or prioritize Bitcoin, optimizing their portfolio for current market conditions. Risk Management: Understanding the prevailing market sentiment can aid in managing risk, as different assets perform better in varying market conditions. Profit Potential: Identifying early signs of an altcoin season can lead to substantial profits from well-chosen altcoins that capitalize on the market’s momentum. Paying attention to the Altcoin Season Index can empower you to make more informed decisions rather than simply reacting to price movements. Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities with the Altcoin Season Index While an increasing Altcoin Season Index is exciting, it’s crucial to approach the market with a balanced perspective. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and altcoin rallies can be particularly intense, both upwards and downwards. This dynamic environment presents both significant challenges and immense opportunities. One challenge is the sheer number of altcoins available. Deciding which ones have genuine potential amidst the hype requires thorough research and a deep understanding of their underlying technology and use cases. Another is the risk of ‘altcoin busts,’ where speculative bubbles can form and burst quickly, leading to substantial losses for unprepared investors. Always do your diligent research before committing capital. However, the opportunities are immense for those who are well-informed. Emerging technologies, innovative use cases, and strong community support can drive certain altcoins to new heights. The current movement of the Altcoin Season Index might indicate that more capital is flowing into these alternative assets, seeking higher returns and innovative projects beyond Bitcoin. What’s Next for the Altcoin Season Index? Actionable Insights The current trajectory of the Altcoin Season Index at 56 indicates a cautious optimism. It’s not a full sprint into an altcoin season yet, but it’s certainly more than a jog. This suggests a period where selective altcoins could see significant gains. What should investors consider doing now to best position themselves? Monitor Closely: Keep a keen eye on the index’s movements and the individual performance of top altcoins. Daily changes can offer valuable clues. Diversify Smartly: Consider diversifying your portfolio with promising altcoins, but avoid over-concentration in highly speculative assets. A balanced approach is key. Research Diligently: Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear roadmaps, active development teams, and real-world utility. Stay Informed: Follow market news, expert analyses, and community sentiment to make well-informed decisions. The crypto landscape evolves rapidly. The recent surge of the Altcoin Season Index to 56 is a compelling indicator of shifting tides in the cryptocurrency landscape. While not a definitive altcoin season yet, this upward movement suggests that altcoins are gaining strength against Bitcoin. By understanding what the index signifies, its calculation, and how to interpret its movements, investors can better position themselves to capitalize on potential opportunities. Always remember to conduct your own research and manage risks wisely in this dynamic market. The stage is set for an exciting period; are you ready to navigate it? Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does the Altcoin Season Index measure? The Altcoin Season Index measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It indicates whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. 2. How is an altcoin season officially declared? An altcoin season is officially declared when 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. A score closer to 100 on the index signals a strong altcoin season. 3. Why did the Altcoin Season Index rise to 56? The Altcoin Season Index rose to 56 because a greater number of the top 100 altcoins have started to outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days, indicating a shift in market momentum and increased interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. 4. What’s the difference between an altcoin season and a Bitcoin season? An altcoin season occurs when altcoins broadly outperform Bitcoin, typically indicated by a high Altcoin Season Index score. A Bitcoin season, conversely, is when Bitcoin is the dominant performer, often attracting capital from altcoins and showing a lower index score. 5. How can I use the Altcoin Season Index in my investment strategy? You can use the Altcoin Season Index as a guide for portfolio allocation. A rising index might suggest increasing exposure to well-researched altcoins, while a falling index could indicate a preference for Bitcoin or more cautious investing. Always combine this with your own due diligence. 6. Is a score of 56 on the Altcoin Season Index a guarantee of an altcoin rally? No, a score of 56 on the Altcoin Season Index is not a guarantee of an immediate, full-blown altcoin rally. While it indicates growing momentum and a positive trend for altcoins, it is still below the 75% threshold for an official altcoin season. It suggests a potential shift, but market conditions can change rapidly. If you found this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful, don’t keep these crucial market insights to yourself!

51472819,577794,1757466040,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51472819.jpeg,Bettors Bet Big On Trump Pardoning Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao,https://bitcoinist.com/bettors-bet-big-on-trump-pardoning-binance-founder-changpeng-zhao/,"According to a Polymarket poll titled “Who will Trump pardon in 2025,” Changpeng Zhao is the favored candidate for a presidential pardon, drawing 36% of bets on the decentralized prediction site. Polymarket Puts CZ Ahead Polymarket’s numbers show strong speculative interest in Zhao’s fate. A 36% share of bettors is a large lead in a market where votes are driven by opinion and information, not official process. Based on reports, the poll reflects what some traders expect rather than any formal signal from the White House. Prediction markets can move fast when new facts appear, and their prices are watched because they capture a slice of public expectation. Congressman George Santos and entrepreneur Roger Ver also made the list, each drawing 10% support from bettors for a Trump pardon. Other names listed by participants include Steve Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, and Sean “Diddy” Combs. Source: Polymarket Legal Background And Public Comments Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering (AML) program at Binance. That conviction led to his resignation as CEO. Reports have disclosed that Zhao publicly hinted at the possibility of a pardon after US President Donald Trump’s controversial December 2024 pardon of Hunter Biden, He also confirmed on a podcast in May that he had formally filed a pardon application with the White House. Legal And Political Pressure Builds Key Democratic lawmakers responded quickly after news of Zhao’s pardon filing and related business moves. Senators led by Elizabeth Warren addressed a letter to White House Counsel David Warrington and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche asking for clarity on the status of any pardon. Reports cite concerns about a separate $2 billion deal announced by Binance, Emirati firm MGX, and World Liberty Financial (WLF) involving a stablecoin called USD1, which those senators said raises questions given the overlap of business ties and a pardon request. On Trump, Bettors, And The Limits Of Speculation Polymarket’s snapshot puts Zhao well ahead of other high-profile names, but a market position is not a legal verdict. Pardons are political acts made by the president; they can be influenced by many forces, and not all rumored candidates end up receiving one. Betting data shows where attention is focused, and it can affect perceptions, but it does not determine the White House’s choice.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. BTC is pinned near $111,000 with volatility compressed to multi-month lows, the kind of calm that tends to precede decisive moves. Traders know what could break the lull: September’s U.S. inflation data and the Fed’s rate decision a week later. Prediction markets are leaning heavily toward easing. Polymarket bettors are assigning an 82% chance of a 25-basis-point cut on Sept. 17, leaving only slim odds for a deeper move or no change. Beyond that, October expectations are fractured, with nearly even probabilities for another cut or a pause. That divergence explains why volatility, though absent now, is unlikely to stay that way. “Markets often look calm just before they move. Bitcoin is trading in one of its tightest ranges in months, and volatility across crypto has compressed to multi-month lows,” said Gracie Lin, OKX Singapore CEO. “With U.S. inflation data like Core CPI out on Sept. 11 and the Fed’s much-anticipated rate decision just ahead, this quiet period is setting the stage for the next decisive move. Whether the catalyst is an upside inflation surprise or a dovish signal from the Fed, what’s clear is that the absence of volatility is rarely permanent in digital assets; history shows the market will find its next direction soon enough.” If a cut pulls money-market returns lower, the opportunity cost of sitting in cash rises, which is the pivot market maker Enflux says could send flows toward crypto. “The real debate now is not if cuts come, but whether liquidity deployment shifts into BTC, ETH, and even riskier assets,” the firm told CoinDesk. In other words, the Fed’s cut may grab headlines, but the real trade is whether sidelined cash rotates into digital assets — a shift that could fuel the return of volatility. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin has dipped slightly intraday, trading between approximately $110,812 and $113,237, reflecting short-term volatility amid shifting investor sentiment and broader crypto market dynamics. ETH: ETH is modestly up intraday, with a range between roughly $4,279 and $4,379, signaling steady demand and some renewed investor interest. Range, however, is limited with modest ETF flows and traders awaiting the Fed's next move. Gold: Gold is rallying to record highs, fueled by mounting expectations of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, a weakening U.S. dollar, and renewed safe-haven demand. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks opened mostly higher Wednesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.2%, as investors awaited China’s August inflation data showing an expected 0.2% CPI drop and a smaller 2.9% PPI decline. S&P 500: U.S. stocks closed at record highs Tuesday, with the S&P 500 up 0.27% to 6,512.61, as investors looked past a record payroll revision that cut 911,000 jobs from prior figures.

This development is not just a footnote; it represents a crucial moment for the company and the broader digital asset landscape. The Gemini IPO is poised to make a substantial impact, reflecting growing investor confidence in the crypto sector’s potential. What’s Driving the Gemini IPO’s Soaring Ambitions? Initially, Gemini aimed to raise $317 million. However, Bloomberg has now reported a revised, much more ambitious goal of $430 million. This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it signifies a robust demand and optimistic outlook for the exchange’s public debut. Key details of this updated plan include: The offering price has been adjusted upwards to a range of $24 to $26 per share, a notable increase from the initial $17 to $19 range. Despite the higher fundraising target and share price, the number of shares to be offered remains consistent at 16.7 million. Nasdaq, a major stock exchange operator, previously announced its intention to purchase $50 million worth of Gemini stock at the offering price, further solidifying institutional interest. This increased target for the Gemini IPO suggests strong preliminary interest from institutional investors and a positive market sentiment surrounding well-established crypto entities. The Significance of a Successful Gemini IPO for the Market A successful Gemini IPO could have profound implications, not only for Gemini itself but for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It serves as a powerful validation of the crypto industry’s maturation and its increasing appeal to traditional financial markets. For Gemini, this capital infusion means accelerated growth, enhanced product development, and the ability to expand its global footprint. It also provides the exchange with greater legitimacy and a stronger competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market. From an investor’s perspective, this IPO offers an opportunity to gain exposure to the digital asset space through a regulated and established entity. This is particularly appealing for those who might be hesitant to directly invest in volatile cryptocurrencies but see value in the infrastructure supporting them. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Exchanges? The upward revision of Gemini’s fundraising target sets a compelling precedent. It indicates that investors are increasingly comfortable with, and actively seeking, opportunities within the crypto economy. This could pave the way for other major cryptocurrency exchanges and related businesses to consider public listings, fostering greater transparency and integration with mainstream finance. However, it is important to remember that the crypto market, while growing, still faces regulatory uncertainties and inherent volatility. The success of the Gemini IPO will be closely watched as a barometer for investor appetite in this innovative sector. It highlights a critical juncture where digital assets are moving from niche interest to significant financial instruments. Navigating the Landscape: Key Considerations for the Gemini IPO As the Gemini IPO approaches, several factors will be crucial for its reception and long-term success. Potential investors and market observers should consider: Market Sentiment: The broader cryptocurrency market’s performance can influence investor enthusiasm. Regulatory Environment: Ongoing developments in crypto regulation will play a significant role in shaping the future of exchanges. Company Performance: Gemini’s financial health, user growth, and technological advancements will be key indicators. Investor Demand: The final pricing and initial trading performance will reflect the market’s overall confidence in Gemini’s valuation. The increased fundraising target underscores a strong belief in Gemini’s vision and its capacity to thrive in the digital asset space. This move is a testament to the enduring potential of cryptocurrency exchanges to attract substantial capital and solidify their position in the global financial landscape. In conclusion, Gemini’s decision to raise its IPO fundraising target to $430 million is a powerful statement of intent and confidence. It reflects a growing institutional embrace of digital assets and positions Gemini for significant expansion. This development marks a pivotal moment, signaling a bullish outlook for both the exchange and the wider cryptocurrency market as it continues its journey towards mainstream adoption and integration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Gemini IPO Q1: What is an IPO and why is it significant for Gemini? A: An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is when a private company first offers its shares to the public. For Gemini, an IPO means raising substantial capital for growth, increasing its public profile, and providing liquidity for early investors and employees. It also signals a significant step towards mainstream financial integration for a crypto company. Q2: Why did Gemini increase its IPO fundraising target? A: Gemini increased its target from $317 million to $430 million likely due to strong investor demand and positive market sentiment. This suggests that initial feedback indicated a higher appetite for Gemini shares than originally anticipated, allowing them to seek more capital for expansion and development. Q3: Who are the key players mentioned in relation to the Gemini IPO? A: The primary player is Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange. Bloomberg reported the fundraising target increase. Nasdaq is also a key player, as it announced its intention to purchase $50 million worth of Gemini stock, highlighting institutional interest in the offering. Q4: What are the potential benefits of investing in a crypto exchange IPO like Gemini’s? A: Investing in a crypto exchange IPO offers exposure to the growing digital asset market without directly holding volatile cryptocurrencies. Benefits can include potential capital appreciation, investment in a regulated entity, and participation in the infrastructure that facilitates the crypto economy. Q5: How might the Gemini IPO impact the wider cryptocurrency market? A: A successful Gemini IPO can boost confidence across the entire crypto market, signaling to traditional investors that crypto-related businesses are viable and attractive.

51473614,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=804152,1757466893,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51473614.jpeg,Ursula von der Leyen sets EU agenda after Trump trade deal backlash,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/von-der-leyen-sets-eu-agenda/,"Ursula von der Leyen, the European Union’s chief executive, will give her annual State of the Union address today, laying out the European Union’s priorities for the coming year. She speaks amid intense political pressure following a summer filled with backlash to a trade deal U.S. President Donald Trump offered. Last year, she was re-elected for a second term, but the President of the European Commission now faces a tricky balancing act . Conversely, she doesn’t want to appear unrealistic in leadership and unity. On the other hand, she has to account for lawmakers, businesses, and voters who believe the U.S. deal shortchanged Europe. Von der Leyen will take the floor in Strasbourg at 9 a.m., delivering a speech whose tradition is to lay out the bloc’s political direction. She is set to emphasise Europe’s defence, demanding new investment and closer co-ordination in a growing global insecurity. Alongside security, she will concentrate on raising the continent’s economic competitiveness to confront the rising challenge from China and protect European jobs. She is championing a stepped-up approach to Ukraine, with continued financial and military support, while she pushes for stronger sanctions against Russia. In addition to these priorities, officials say, she wants to highlight progress on climate policy and the digital transition and project the EU as green and technologically advanced. Yet the most urgent question for business leaders will be whether she can deliver concrete steps to cut red tape and put into practice the competitiveness plan by former ECB chief Mario Draghi. Trade deal sparks EU backlash Casting a significant shadow over her speech is the tariff deal she made with Trump in July at his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland where EU tariffs were abolished on U.S. industrial goods and market barriers for U.S. farm produce were clamped down on. In retaliation, Trump imposed a 15 % tax on most EU products, doing away with low or zero duties that had existed before his second term. The response in Europe has been furious. It was an “act of submission” and “another form of slavery,” France’s former prime minister François Bayrou said. A poll published this week found that 77 % of people in the EU’s five biggest countries believe the deal is weighted in favor of the United States. Just 2% say that it’s good for Europe. Over half said they would support boycotting U.S. products, with the others desiring von der Leyen to make her exit. European officials have defended the deal as a necessary compromise that averted a destructive trade war. Businesses, it is said, wanted certainty, especially with U.S. security guarantees still vital to the defence of Europe. But a broad opposition exists inside Parliament. Socialists and Greens accuse Von der Leyen of bending to Washington pressure. Even some in the centre-right European People’s Party, her own political family, have voiced unease. Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at HEC Paris, said von der Leyen was being made a scapegoat. He argued that while she embodied the EU’s weaknesses, those failings were not hers. According to him, she could not single-handedly retaliate against the United States, respond decisively to the conflict in Gaza, or broker peace in Ukraine. Von der Leyen fights to restore trust The State of the Union address will be watched closely across Europe. For von der Leyen, it is an opportunity to reset the political agenda and drum up support when there are increasing signs of public unrest. She’ll highlight the EU’s global role, its role in defending Ukraine, and even its role in helping to shape trade and climate rules. However, with the Trump deal still leading the news, the question is whether her message can restore trust. A debate will follow her speech to Parliament. Markets, industry groups, and allies elsewhere will be seeking indications of how the EU plans to handle the wars, trade, and competition from others worldwide. This could be von der Leyen’s most challenging State of the Union yet. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

51474010,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=804155,1757467041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51474010.jpeg,Alphabet’s Google Cloud locks in $58B revenue pipeline,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/google-cloud-locks-in-58b-revenue-pipeline/,"Google Cloud by Alphabet said it had lined up a new revenue stream to generate $58 billion over the next two years. The disclosure was made at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference and highlighted the division’s growing importance to Alphabet’s overall plans. The cloud unit has been seeking to establish itself as one of the fastest-growing businesses within Alphabet as the company’s traditional search engine and advertising business faces growing scrutiny from regulators and competitors. Google Cloud currently holds a $106 billion backlog in contracts. CEO Thomas Kurian said about 55% of this, roughly $58 billion, will be converted into revenue within two years. That total includes only projects currently under contract, so any new deals have the potential to keep bumping up the pipeline. The backlog has resumed growing faster than revenue recognized, demonstrating strong momentum. Earlier this year, the cloud division had already crossed a $50 billion annual revenue run rate. This achievement also solidifies that Google Cloud is becoming a dependable and growing revenue stream for Alphabet, particularly as the company still scales its infrastructure. AI giants drive Cloud growth Customer momentum has become one of Google Cloud’s most powerful weapons. The unit saw a 28% increase in new customers in the latest quarter, indicating how much businesses rely on Google for their computing demands . Most importantly, we see more and more in the artificial intelligence community choosing Google Cloud. Nine of the world’s 10 biggest AI labs are now customers. That list includes OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and Anthropic, which has recently been valued at $183 billion. Both are direct rivals to Google’s AI platforms but rely heavily on Google Cloud to train and serve their models. The reason is clear. Training giant AI systems requires vast computing power, speedy networking, and secure infrastructure. Google Cloud has distinguished itself in these domains by providing dedicated chips, like Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and state-of-the-art GPU clusters for accelerating AI workloads. These are not just nice-to-have features for many AI labs; they are necessities. Kurian emphasised at the Goldman Sachs conference that the AI surge of clients wasn’t some fad. Instead, it represents a structural change in how the next generation of tech companies will scale. As businesses in sectors ranging from healthcare to financial services to media and logistics adopt generative AI en masse, the need for robust, high-performance infrastructure can only increase. With the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic, Google Cloud also sends a message to investors and customers: it is not only competing in AI but also strengthening the broader ecosystem. This two-part role strengthens Google’s business as a player in and provider to the growing AI sector. The extent to which AI leaders adopt such tools illustrates a deeper shift. Google Cloud is becoming a supporting business line and a foundation for some of the most resource-intensive projects on earth. That reinforces the company’s aspirations to be considered an advertising giant and a critical provider of 21st-century infrastructure for artificial intelligence. As reported by Cryptopolitan , Google Cloud recently revealed that its L1 blockchain project, Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL), is currently operating in a private testnet phase. Rich Widmann, head of Web3 strategy at Google, explained that GCUL is the culmination of years of research and development in distributed ledger technology. Widmann confirmed that GCUL supports Python-based smart contracts and emphasized that the blockchain is being designed as a neutral platform for multiple financial institutions. He also highlighted that, while similar in scope to companies like Stripe and Circle, GCUL offers unique features that set it apart. Cloud drives Alphabet’s future growth The cloud business is emerging as an important driver of growth for Alphabet. Cloud services represented only 14 percent of Alphabet’s total revenue in the latest quarter, but the unit is one of the company’s fastest-growing lines. By contrast, Google’s advertising business is still generating the majority of revenue, even as it has come under increasing scrutiny. Regulators in the United States and Europe are exploring Google’s dominance in search and ads, paving the way for more competitors. This makes diversification across Google Cloud even more critical. Alphabet’s use of capital is a good example of this; in July, the company’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, raised the company’s 2025 capital expenditure target to $85 billion from $75 billion. Growth is largely fueled by increased interest in cloud services and AI infrastructure. Google Cloud’s expansion comes as tech companies are pressured to prove that heavy investments in artificial intelligence will pay off. Wall Street has been eager to see if the billions invested in AI data centers and chips would turn into actual earnings. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

These documents include the S-1 and S-3, among other related documents. With this, the digital assets platform intends to convert its current closed-end trusts for these cryptocurrencies into ETFs that will mainly be listed on NYSE Arca or Nasdaq. According to reliable sources, this is not the first time Grayscale has initiated such an approach. In 2024, the digital assets platform changed its BTC and ETH trusts into exchange-traded products. Crypto firms seek SEC’s approval for ETFs connected to altcoins Concerning Grayscale’s filings with the SEC on its Litecoin ETF, its S-3 filing document states that this prospectus assumes that the commission has either had the 19b-4 application approved or has established general listing regulations that guarantee the Trust’s shares to be among those listed on NYSE Arca. This follows a growing trend among crypto companies seeking approval for ETFs connected to altcoins. This includes Dogecoin and XRP. Meanwhile, reports from reliable sources have pointed out that earlier on Tuesday, September 9, the SEC had postponed its decision on Bitwise’s spot Dogecoin ETF and Grayscale’s spot Hedera ETF. On the other hand, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Cash trust has demonstrated exemplary results. According to the filing , its net asset value recorded figures exceeding $202 million with its shares priced at $4.31 each on June 30. Notably, a high-performance difference exists between a closed-end trust and an ETF. A closed-end trust can conduct trades for more or less than its net asset value; however, an ETF purchases and sells assets depending on the demand in the market. Additionally, it has an open-end structure that develops and redeems shares to maintain prices close to the net asset value. Earlier, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC for rejecting its proposal to convert its trust. Concerning this, analysts have anticipated that this could be a significant reason behind the commission’s reaction to permit Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs later to carry out trade in the US. According to data from reliable sources, since they started operating in the US in January 2024, spot Bitcoin ETFs have reached their highest overall trading volume, recording figures exceeding 1.2 trillion. The US SEC delays Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF approval REX Shares and Osprey Funds were reportedly making arrangements to launch their Dogecoin ETF this week. However, on Tuesday, September 9, the SEC postponed their decision on Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF. In a filing, the commission mentioned that their abrupt delay was to gather more time to examine whether to approve or reject a proposed rule change that could permit Bitwise to list a meme coin as an ETF tracking. Apart from Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF facing delays recently, it is worth noting that its proposed DOGE fund was also subjected to delays back in June. On the contrary, REX Shares and Osprey Funds’ Dogecoin ETF will commence trading activities on Thursday, September 11, having adopted a completely different approach for its listing. In an X post, Analyst Eric Balchunas commented on the situation. According to him, the Thursday DOGE launch signifies an entry to an era of meme coin ETFs, despite being under the 40 Act. Balchunas further anticipated that this would be the first-ever US ETF to hold something that does not entail practical use. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

One such entity, the AI startup Mercor, is currently making waves across the tech landscape, reportedly eyeing a monumental valuation exceeding $10 billion. For those keenly observing the confluence of technology and finance, particularly within the cryptocurrency space where groundbreaking tech often finds fertile ground, Mercor’s trajectory offers a compelling narrative of rapid expansion and strategic foresight. AI Startup Mercor’s Astonishing Ascent Mercor, founded in 2022 by Thiel Fellows and Harvard dropouts Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, has swiftly positioned itself as a critical enabler for leading AI labs. The company specializes in connecting industry titans like OpenAI and Meta with highly specialized domain experts—from scientists and doctors to lawyers—who are essential for training and refining foundational AI models. This unique service model has propelled Mercor into a league of its own, attracting significant investor attention. Recent reports, citing marketing documents and sources familiar with deal talks, indicate that Mercor is in discussions for a Series C funding round. The target? A staggering valuation of $10 billion or more. This figure represents a significant jump from an $8 billion target discussed just months prior, underscoring the explosive growth and perceived potential of the company. Felicis, an existing investor, is reportedly considering a substantial re-investment, signaling strong confidence in Mercor’s future. Key Milestones and Financial Performance: Founding: 2022 by Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha. Previous Funding: $100 million Series B in February at a $2 billion valuation, led by Felicis. Current ARR: Approaching $450 million in annualized run-rate revenue, with CEO Brendan Foody stating it’s even higher. This is a significant leap from $75 million in February and $100 million in March. Profitability: Generated $6 million in profit in the first half of the year, a notable achievement for a rapidly scaling startup. Understanding Mercor ‘s Disruptive AI Training Model Mercor’s core business model is both innovative and essential for the advancement of complex AI. By providing companies with specialized domain experts for AI model training, Mercor addresses a critical bottleneck in AI development. These experts perform crucial tasks, such as data labeling and verification, ensuring that AI models are not only intelligent but also accurate and reliable. Mercor earns revenue by charging an hourly finder’s fee and a matching rate for these services. The company boasts an impressive client roster, claiming to supply data labeling contractors to five of the top AI labs: Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI, alongside Tesla and Nvidia. Sources suggest that a substantial portion of its revenue is derived from a subset of these high-profile clients, particularly OpenAI, highlighting Mercor’s strategic importance in the AI ecosystem. To further solidify its market position and diversify its offerings, Mercor is also expanding its technological infrastructure: Software Infrastructure for Reinforcement Learning (RL): Mercor is developing advanced software to support RL, a training method where AI models learn through feedback and iterative improvement. This move positions Mercor at the forefront of sophisticated AI development. AI-Powered Recruiting Marketplace: The company intends to leverage AI to build its own recruiting marketplace, potentially streamlining the process of connecting experts with AI projects and further enhancing its service delivery. The Race for Startup Valuation : Mercor’s Billions The rapid escalation of Mercor’s target startup valuation from $8 billion to over $10 billion in a matter of months is a testament to the fervent investor interest in the AI sector. This valuation places Mercor among an elite group of tech companies experiencing hyper-growth. The company has reportedly received multiple offers from venture capitalists, with some preemptive bids reaching the $10 billion mark. Mercor’s financial trajectory is particularly striking when compared to other fast-growing startups. The company claims it is on track to hit the $500 million ARR milestone faster than Anysphere, the creator of the AI coding assistant Cursor, which famously achieved this within a year of its product launch. What sets Mercor apart even further is its profitability; unlike Anysphere, which is still burning cash, Mercor generated $6 million in profit in the first half of the year, demonstrating a sustainable growth model. The appointment of Sundeep Jain, former chief product officer at Uber, as Mercor’s first president, further signals the company’s ambition to scale and professionalize its operations, preparing for its next phase of expansion and potentially a successful Series C round. Driving Innovation with Reinforcement Learning and Beyond Mercor’s strategic pivot into building software infrastructure for reinforcement learning (RL) signifies a proactive approach to evolving AI training methodologies. RL is crucial for developing highly autonomous and adaptive AI systems, and by providing tools for this, Mercor aims to become an indispensable partner for advanced AI development. This move is not without its challenges, as the competitive landscape is intense. Mercor faces formidable rivals in this space, including: Surge AI: Reportedly in talks to raise funding at a staggering $25 billion valuation. Turing Labs: Another significant player in the data labeling and AI services sector. Scale AI: A major competitor that is also expanding its offerings into RL services. Notably, Scale AI has sued Mercor for alleged misappropriation of trade secrets, highlighting the fierce competition for market dominance. Furthermore, OpenAI’s recent launch of its own hiring platform raises questions about the potential for AI giants to develop their human-expert-powered RL training services in-house, adding another layer of competitive pressure for Mercor. Navigating the Competitive AI Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities While Mercor’s growth is undeniable, the competitive landscape presents both challenges and opportunities. The lawsuit from Scale AI, alleging that a former employee stole confidential documents, underscores the high-stakes nature of the AI training market. Such legal battles can be costly and distracting, but Mercor’s leadership remains focused on its ambitious goals. CEO Brendan Foody has publicly downplayed the need for new funding, stating, “We haven’t been trying to raise at all,” and that the company “turn[s] down offers every month.” He also clarified that Mercor’s reported ARR includes the total amount customers pay for services before contractors receive their portion, a common and auditor-recommended accounting practice also used by competitors like Surge AI and Scale AI. This transparency aims to reinforce confidence in Mercor’s financial reporting amidst its rapid growth. The ongoing “Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025” event, attracting thousands of tech and VC leaders, further emphasizes the broader industry’s appetite for innovation. Companies like Mercor, even if not directly involved in cryptocurrency, represent the kind of disruptive technology that draws the attention of investors and innovators across the tech spectrum, including those deeply invested in the future of digital assets and decentralized solutions. A Future Forged in AI Excellence Mercor’s journey from a 2022 startup to a company potentially valued at over $10 billion in just a few years is a powerful narrative of ambition, strategic execution, and the immense demand for specialized AI services. By connecting the world’s leading AI labs with the human expertise needed to refine their models, Mercor has carved out a crucial niche. Its expansion into reinforcement learning infrastructure and an AI-powered recruiting marketplace positions it for continued innovation, even amidst intense competition and legal challenges. As the AI revolution accelerates, Mercor stands as a testament to the incredible opportunities that arise at the intersection of human intelligence and machine learning, driving forward the very frontier of artificial intelligence.

The app’s rollout begins early next year. A select group of customers will be the first to get invitations. After that, the feature will be rolled out to all users. Its arrival is another sign that the online brokerage has entered a new era. Robinhood is a place to invest, combined with community and conversation. Robinhood puts trading at the center of social Robinhood Social follows a simple rule: every post must be linked to a real trade. Whether users share insights on stocks, options, or crypto, it has to reflect an actual position they’ve taken, adding authenticity to the content. The position updates in real time once a trade is posted. Prices, gains, and losses change as markets move. Other traders can join the conversation by commenting directly on the post. This makes the platform more interactive than a static screenshot, for example, or a one-sentence Reddit message. By opting for a trade as the center of every post, Robinhood creates a stark contrast between itself and social platforms like Reddit and X, where users can put unverified claims, inflated claims, or edited screenshots for results. On the other hand, Robinhood Social is transparent because a transaction inside the brokerage underpins every post. The platform also provides additional transparency into investor performance. Users can share the one-day and one-year profit and loss statements. They can also disclose their total profit margins. This allows followers to learn from traders who always win and have the context when trading strategies go awry. The social part won’t be limited to everyday traders. The company expects to include profiles of luminaries like lawmakers and billionaire investors. For instance, trades by the former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which are closely tracked by retail traders online, will automatically appear, according to required public financial disclosures. The same goes for hedge-fund managers like Bill Ackman. This tool puts the information that big investors keep an eye on in the hands of regular people, although notably with a more human, and certainly less dull, form. Individually, they’re all basic, but collectively, they’re enough to turn Robinhood Social into more than just a chatroom. It turns into a live trading feed, and every discussion is based on fact, real positions, and measurable performance. Robinhood builds a financial super-app This is more than a hobby project. Robinhood views the platform as an investment in its plan to become a financial super-app over the long term. Along with the social launch, the company is introducing new trading tools. Active traders will receive AI-powered scanning tools on Robinhood’s desktop platform, Legend. Futures trading, short selling, and overnight index options will also be launched in 2025. The company says such upgrades will enable users to trade like professionals yet remain connected to a reliable social space. Executives said that every year, several verticals are reinvented on the internet, and they believe the new platform will change how money is discussed online. Abhishek Fatehpuria, Robinhood’s vice president of product management, added that the company had always wanted to combine social and investing and could now do so transparently and credibly. Robinhood naturally draws a social audience. Its traders played a central role in the 2021 meme stock frenzy. At the time, thousands of retail investors used the WallStreetBets Reddit forum to band together to run up stocks such as GameStop and AMC. Now Robinhood is chasing that energy inside its own ecosystem. The company sees in-house discussions as a way to help make investing more engaging while reducing misinformation risks on other platforms.

51477080,577511,1757469650,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51477080.jpeg,Bitcoin Supply Flows From Giants To Mid-Sized Holders – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-flows-from-giants-mid-sized-holders/,"Bitcoin is beginning to show signs of renewed bullish energy, with the price testing the $113,000 resistance level after weeks of mixed sentiment. The move comes as many altcoins are gaining strength, suggesting that the broader crypto market is preparing for decisive action. The next few days are set to be crucial, as investors eagerly await the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting, where speculation is building around a potential interest rate cut. Any monetary policy shift from the Fed could significantly impact liquidity flows into Bitcoin and risk assets. At the same time, the structure of Bitcoin’s investor base is changing. According to top analyst Maartunn, the number of addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC has been declining rapidly in this cycle. Meanwhile, addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC are on the rise. This shift highlights a redistribution of supply, where large entities appear to be reducing exposure while smaller but still significant players increase their holdings. Bitcoin Supply Shift: From Big Fish To Medium Players Maartunn explains that the current “Big Fish Down, Medium Players Up” dynamic highlights a fundamental shift in Bitcoin’s ownership structure. This transition reflects a supply redistribution, where massive concentrations of Bitcoin in the hands of a few whales are giving way to medium-sized players, many of whom are linked to ETF custody wallets and institutional investment structures. This development carries major implications for the market. When Bitcoin is concentrated in fewer hands, price action can be vulnerable to abrupt swings triggered by large single-entity decisions. By contrast, supply spread across more medium players tends to create a more resilient and liquid market structure, less prone to outsized shocks. ETF custody wallets, in particular, represent a more transparent, regulated, and demand-driven form of holding, aligning Bitcoin closer with traditional financial infrastructure. Unlike previous cycles, institutional involvement is now playing a decisive role. From ETFs in the US to treasury strategies in Japan, institutional adoption has reshaped how Bitcoin supply is absorbed after each rally. Instead of chaotic peaks followed by sharp drawdowns, the market now shows stretched-out tops and segmented distribution phases. This structural evolution could mark a turning point for Bitcoin, where long-term sustainability increasingly outweighs speculative frenzy, setting the stage for a more mature bull market cycle. Price Action Reveals Growing Momentum Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of recovery after weeks of volatility, currently trading around $112,902 on the 12-hour chart. The price has managed to reclaim momentum following a bounce from the $110K support, but it now faces a critical resistance test. The chart highlights BTC pressing against the 50-day moving average (blue line), which sits just above the current price. A clean break above this level would strengthen the bullish case and potentially open the door toward the $115K–$117K range. On the downside, the 200-day moving average (red line) remains intact near $112K, providing short-term support. This convergence of moving averages creates a narrow trading zone, meaning that the next decisive move could trigger a larger breakout. The ultimate resistance remains at $123,217, the local high marked in August. Failure to sustain above $112K could result in another pullback toward $110K. On the flip side, a breakout with strong momentum above $115K could confirm a renewed rally. The market remains highly sensitive to macroeconomic signals, particularly the upcoming Federal Reserve decision, which could drive volatility in the coming days.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-expert-xrp-to-moon-in-10-days-heres-why/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld has shared an assertive outlook on XRP in a recent post on social media, declaring, “#XRP TO MOON IN 10 DAYS!!!” The statement was accompanied by a video in which Rietveld discussed the Federal Reserve’s interest rate outlook and its potential influence on both traditional financial markets and digital assets. His remarks anticipated monetary policy decisions with the likelihood of significant price movement in cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP. #XRP TO MOON IN 10 DAYS!!! pic.twitter.com/GHInFBEPC2 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 8, 2025 Major Banks Expect Multiple Rate Cuts In the video, Rietveld explained that leading financial institutions are forecasting several interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve before the end of the year. He noted that the Bank of America projects two rate cuts, while JPMorgan Chase has suggested the possibility of two to three cuts. He emphasized that virtually all major banks have issued similar forecasts, reinforcing the idea that monetary easing is widely expected across the financial sector. According to Rietveld, this expectation has also been reflected in betting markets. He cited data suggesting a 94 percent probability of a rate cut being announced on September 17, leaving approximately ten days until a decision is made. He described this timeline as a critical window for investors, stating that it represents, in his view, the last real opportunity to benefit from the coming cycle of lower rates. Correlation Between M2 Growth and Asset Prices Rietveld went further by highlighting the historical relationship between rate cuts, M2 money supply expansion, and asset valuations. He explained that there is a correlation of approximately 95% between increases in M2, typically associated with rate cuts, and the performance of both digital assets and stocks. This, he argued, suggests that the upcoming monetary environment could be highly favorable for assets such as XRP. His comments indicate that he sees the rate cut cycle as directly supportive of higher valuations in the cryptocurrency sector. By tying together central bank policy shifts, liquidity measures, and historical price patterns, Rietveld outlined why he believes XRP may experience a substantial increase in value within the near term. Monetary Policy Signals and Market Reactions Rietveld’s forecast highlights a broader narrative within the digital asset space, suggesting that central bank monetary policy decisions have a significant impact on market performance. Rate cuts generally reduce borrowing costs, increase liquidity, and incentivize investment in both equities and cryptocurrencies. His remarks suggest that XRP, alongside other digital assets, could benefit considerably from these dynamics, with the September 17 meeting seen as a key turning point.

Market outcomes depend not only on rate decisions but also on investor sentiment, regulatory developments, and broader economic conditions. Nonetheless, the financial expert’s view is that XRP may be positioned for a notable upward move within ten days, driven by expectations of imminent U.S. interest rate cuts and their historical correlation with asset appreciation.

This large transfer, involving millions of dollars in Ethereum, sparks important questions about institutional activity and potential market shifts. Understanding such movements is crucial for anyone keen on the dynamics of the digital asset space. Unpacking the Significant Matrixport ETH Deposit Approximately ten hours ago, an address linked to Matrixport, a prominent cryptocurrency service provider, executed a substantial transfer. The transaction involved 10,000 ETH, valued at an impressive $43.77 million, which was moved to the Binance exchange. This data comes from on-chain analytics platform ai_9684xtpa, providing transparency into the transaction. Such a considerable Matrixport ETH deposit to a major exchange like Binance is often interpreted as a signal by market participants. It suggests a potential rebalancing of assets, preparation for future trading activities, or even a strategic shift in portfolio management by the institutional entity. What Does Matrixport’s Portfolio Look Like? To put this recent transfer into perspective, it is helpful to look at Matrixport’s overall asset holdings. The firm currently manages a substantial portfolio, totaling $461 million in various digital assets. Here’s a quick breakdown: Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance: A significant portion of Matrixport’s assets, specifically 81.6%, is held in Bitcoin. This highlights their strong conviction in the flagship cryptocurrency. Remaining Ethereum (ETH): Even after this large transfer, Matrixport still holds a considerable amount of Ethereum. Their current ETH reserves stand at an additional 4,272 ETH, which is valued at $18.33 million. This distribution indicates a diversified, yet BTC-heavy, investment strategy, with Ethereum playing a notable supporting role in their portfolio. Decoding the Market Signals: Why This Transfer Matters Large institutional transfers, such as this Matrixport ETH deposit , are closely monitored by traders and analysts for several reasons. They can offer insights into the strategies of major players and potentially hint at upcoming market trends. Increased Liquidity: Moving a large amount of ETH to an exchange increases the available supply on that platform, potentially impacting short-term price dynamics. Rebalancing or Sales Preparation: Institutions might deposit assets to exchanges to rebalance their portfolios, prepare for over-the-counter (OTC) deals, or get ready for potential selling if they anticipate market shifts. Market Sentiment Indicator: While not a definitive predictor, such moves contribute to the overall market sentiment. A large deposit could be perceived as a bearish signal if the intent is to sell, or simply a logistical move for treasury management. Understanding these potential implications helps investors make more informed decisions. The Broader Impact on Ethereum and Binance The movement of such a substantial amount of Ethereum to Binance naturally has implications for both the asset and the exchange. For Ethereum, increased supply on exchanges could, in theory, lead to selling pressure if the funds are liquidated. However, it could also be part of a larger, more complex strategy not immediately apparent. For Binance, receiving a significant Matrixport ETH deposit reinforces its position as a primary liquidity hub for institutional and retail traders alike. Exchanges thrive on liquidity, and such large inflows demonstrate continued confidence from major crypto service providers in their platforms. The recent Matrixport ETH deposit to Binance serves as a powerful reminder of the continuous, dynamic activity within the institutional cryptocurrency space. These large-scale movements are not just isolated transactions; they are critical data points that provide valuable insights into market liquidity, institutional strategies, and the broader health of the digital asset ecosystem. As the crypto market matures, tracking such transfers becomes increasingly vital for understanding the forces at play. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Matrixport? Matrixport is a leading cryptocurrency financial services platform. It offers a range of services including trading, lending, structured products, and asset management solutions for institutional and retail clients. Why did Matrixport deposit ETH to Binance? While the exact reason is not publicly disclosed, common motivations for such large institutional deposits include preparing for potential sales, rebalancing portfolio assets, managing liquidity, or facilitating specific trading strategies on the exchange. How does a large ETH deposit impact the market? A large deposit of Ethereum to an exchange can increase the available supply, which might lead to increased selling pressure in the short term. It can also be seen as an indicator of institutional sentiment, with market participants watching for subsequent trading activity. Does Matrixport hold other cryptocurrencies? Yes, Matrixport holds a diverse portfolio of digital assets. Their holdings are predominantly in Bitcoin (BTC), accounting for over 81% of their total assets, alongside their remaining Ethereum (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies. Is this Matrixport ETH deposit a bearish sign for Ethereum? Not necessarily. While a large deposit could precede selling, it could also be part of a more complex strategy, such as preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, moving funds for staking, or simply internal treasury management. Market participants often wait for further actions before drawing definitive conclusions. Did you find this analysis insightful?

KODA has become the first virtual asset service provider (VASP) in the nation to receive the coveted KODA venture company certification from the Ministry of SMEs and Startups. This pivotal moment signals a major shift in how blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses are recognized and supported within the country’s regulatory framework. What Does KODA’s Venture Company Certification Truly Mean? For years, virtual asset service providers in South Korea faced an uphill battle when seeking venture company status. Historically, many VASPs were denied or even had their certifications revoked, primarily due to their registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). This created a unique challenge for legitimate crypto businesses looking to expand and innovate within the traditional startup ecosystem. Regulatory Hurdle: Previously, the very act of being a regulated VASP was a barrier to venture status. Policy Evolution: A recent, crucial policy change has reshaped this landscape. This new policy now explicitly makes blockchain-based crypto asset trading and brokerage businesses eligible for the certification. KODA’s approval under these updated rules isn’t just a win for the company; it represents a broader acceptance and integration of digital asset businesses into South Korea’s innovation-driven economy. The Journey to KODA Venture Company Certification: A Regulatory Shift The path to achieving KODA venture company certification wasn’t straightforward for the industry. The initial reluctance to grant such status stemmed from regulatory caution surrounding the nascent and often volatile cryptocurrency market. The government aimed to prevent potential misuse or instability, leading to strict interpretations of existing venture company eligibility criteria. However, as the blockchain industry matured and more robust regulatory frameworks for VASPs were established, the need for a more progressive approach became evident. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups, recognizing the innovative potential of these firms, initiated a review of its policies. This led to the landmark decision to include blockchain-based crypto asset services in the eligibility criteria. KODA, a joint venture between Hashed and KB Kookmin Bank, stands out as a leader in digital asset custody. Its strong backing and commitment to regulatory compliance likely played a significant role in its successful application, setting a precedent for other VASPs. Why is This KODA Venture Company Certification a Game-Changer? The attainment of KODA venture company certification offers a multitude of benefits, not only for KODA itself but for the entire South Korean digital asset sector. Venture company status often comes with various government incentives, which can include: Tax Benefits: Reduced corporate taxes and other fiscal advantages. Funding Opportunities: Easier access to government grants, subsidies, and preferred lending rates. Talent Attraction: Enhanced credibility and attractiveness to skilled professionals. Increased Investor Confidence: A stamp of approval that can draw more private investment. Moreover, this certification provides legitimacy and recognition to the virtual asset industry as a whole. It signifies that digital asset businesses are now seen as genuine contributors to technological innovation and economic growth, rather than just speculative entities. Looking Ahead: The Future Impact of KODA Venture Company Certification What does this mean for the broader landscape of virtual asset service providers in South Korea? KODA’s achievement paves the way for other eligible VASPs to pursue similar certifications. This could foster a more competitive and innovative environment, encouraging more companies to adhere to high standards of operation and compliance. The policy change reflects a growing understanding and acceptance of blockchain technology’s role in the future economy. It suggests a progressive regulatory stance that seeks to balance innovation with necessary oversight. As more VASPs potentially gain this status, it could lead to a surge in investment, job creation, and the development of new, cutting-edge digital asset services. This move positions South Korea as a more welcoming jurisdiction for blockchain innovation, potentially attracting international attention and investment in its burgeoning crypto sector. The ripple effect of KODA’s pioneering KODA venture company certification is likely to be felt for years to come. KODA’s historic achievement of becoming the first South Korean VASP to secure venture company certification is more than just a corporate success story. It represents a significant policy evolution, validating the digital asset industry’s role in the national economy. This milestone not only empowers KODA with new opportunities but also sets a crucial precedent, fostering a more inclusive and innovative environment for blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses across South Korea. It’s a clear signal that the future of finance is increasingly intertwined with digital assets, recognized and supported at the highest levels. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is KODA? KODA, or Korea Digital Asset, is a digital asset custody firm jointly established by prominent entities Hashed and KB Kookmin Bank. It provides secure storage and management services for digital assets. 2. What is a VASP? VASP stands for Virtual Asset Service Provider. It refers to any business that conducts activities involving virtual assets for or on behalf of another natural or legal person, such as exchanges, custodians, and transfer services. 3. Why is KODA’s venture company certification significant? It’s significant because KODA is the first VASP in South Korea to receive this certification. Historically, VASPs were often denied due to regulatory complexities. This marks a major policy shift, recognizing digital asset businesses as legitimate innovators and opening doors to government incentives and greater industry legitimacy. 4.

These investment vehicles, which allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the digital asset, have shown a renewed surge of interest. This latest development provides a fascinating glimpse into current market sentiment and the evolving landscape of digital asset adoption. What’s Driving the Recent Inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Recently, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a notable net inflow of $23.28 million. This marks the second consecutive day of positive flows, signaling a potential shift in investor confidence. Such movements are closely watched by market participants as they often indicate broader trends in institutional and retail interest. The lion’s share of this positive movement came from BlackRock’s IBIT, which alone attracted a substantial $169.53 million. This impressive performance by IBIT highlights its growing prominence in the market. However, it wasn’t a universal win across all offerings: Fidelity’s FBTC experienced net outflows of $55.81 million. Bitwise’s BITB saw $18.15 million exit. Ark Invest’s ARKB recorded significant outflows of $72.29 million. Interestingly, other ETFs in the sector reported no net change in flows, suggesting a concentrated movement towards specific products rather than a broad market rally. This divergence in performance among different U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs prompts a closer look at investor preferences and underlying strategies. Navigating the Competitive Landscape of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs The competitive nature of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs market is becoming increasingly apparent. While BlackRock’s IBIT continues to demonstrate strong leadership, the outflows from other prominent funds like Fidelity and Ark Invest indicate that investors are being selective. Several factors could contribute to this selectivity: Brand Recognition and Trust: Established financial institutions often inspire greater confidence. Fee Structures: Minor differences in management fees can influence large capital allocations. Marketing and Outreach: Effective communication about the ETF’s benefits can attract more capital. Market Sentiment: Broader market trends and news cycles can temporarily sway investor decisions. These dynamics underscore the importance of ongoing due diligence for both ETF providers and potential investors. Understanding why certain funds attract capital while others see outflows is crucial for assessing the health and direction of the spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. What’s Next for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Investors? The consistent, albeit sometimes uneven, flow of capital into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs suggests a maturing market. For investors, these trends offer valuable insights. While a single day’s inflow doesn’t dictate long-term performance, consecutive positive days can indicate building momentum. It’s essential to consider: Long-Term Trends: Look beyond daily fluctuations to identify sustained interest. Diversification: Consider how these ETFs fit into a broader investment portfolio. Regulatory Environment: Changes in regulations can significantly impact the market. The ability of BlackRock’s IBIT to consistently attract significant inflows, even when competitors face outflows, highlights its strong position. This could be due to its competitive offerings, robust marketing, or simply the sheer scale of BlackRock’s institutional reach. As the market for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continues to evolve, we anticipate more detailed analyses of these flow patterns to emerge. In conclusion, the recent $23.2 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , predominantly led by BlackRock’s IBIT, paints a picture of selective yet persistent investor interest. While some funds experienced outflows, the overall positive trend for two consecutive days indicates a growing, albeit competitive, landscape for Bitcoin investment products. Keeping an eye on these flow dynamics will be key to understanding the future trajectory of digital asset adoption in traditional finance.

It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a regulated investment vehicle without needing to buy and store Bitcoin themselves. Q2: Why is BlackRock’s IBIT seeing such strong inflows? BlackRock’s IBIT has seen strong inflows due to several factors, including BlackRock’s significant institutional presence, competitive fee structures, effective marketing, and potentially strong investor confidence in the firm’s overall financial management capabilities. Q3: Do all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs perform similarly? No, as seen in the recent data, not all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs perform similarly. They can experience varying inflows and outflows based on factors like brand reputation, fees, liquidity, and investor preferences, leading to diverse performance outcomes. Q4: What do net inflows and outflows signify for Bitcoin ETFs? Net inflows generally indicate increasing investor interest and demand for the ETF, suggesting a positive sentiment towards Bitcoin.

Analysts point to buybacks and Binance’s USDe listing as catalysts for Ethena’s bullish momentum. Targets range from $1.25 to $5.00 if ENA holds above $0.68 and momentum continues. ENA Shows Strong Weekly Performance Ethena (ENA) has posted a sharp rise in the past week, gaining over 20%. The token is now priced at $0.84, with a 24-hour trading volume of $1.44 billion. Daily gains stand at 9%. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa said the asset shows strong momentum, noting that while profit-taking may be considered near current levels, the mid-term trend remains positive. “I still am holding my position and it’s probably ok to take some profit around here. With that said, I do think that this trades higher in the mid term,” he said. Chart data shows ENA testing resistance near $0.85, which aligns with the 0 Fibonacci level. This has become an important short-term barrier , where some selling activity could appear. Support is currently seen around $0.70 (0.236 Fib), with deeper levels at $0.61 and $0.53. These levels could act as potential areas for buyers if the market retraces. $ENA : Great coin, everyone shilling it and it’s still going higher. announcement after announcement, beauty.

This suggests that demand is still present, even as ENA approaches near-term resistance. Analysts Eye Higher Targets Rand pointed to buyback programs as a key factor in recent price strength, writing, “No chill for $ENA, the buybacks program on full effect. Triggered the bullish breakout on the local downtrend, wants new ATH.” The weekly chart also reflects a bullish structure, with ENA holding above the support range of $0.48–$0.55, which flipped from resistance into support earlier this year. Finish echoed this sentiment, stating, “Everything under $1.1 is cheap, it’s time we set a new ATH.” Meanwhile, the comment comes as Binance recently listed USDe, with total value locked (TVL) surpassing $13 billion, boosting sentiment around the Ethena ecosystem. The next major resistance levels are at $1.32 and $1.52, both marking previous swing highs. If these are broken, ENA could enter price discovery. Long-Term Outlook Crypto Patel noted that ENA is already up 270% from his initial entry, but still has room to grow. “$ENA is still up 270% from our first entry but I believe it still has room to run, $5 potential on the horizon,” he stated. Patel’s chart points to multiple upside targets: $1.25, $2.60, $4.00, and $5.00+. As long as ENA holds above $0.68, the structure suggests continuation toward higher levels. The pattern of higher lows and higher highs after long consolidation phases supports the bullish case. Overall, ENA remains in a strong uptrend, with analysts identifying key resistance points ahead and projecting higher price ranges if momentum continues.

After a challenging period, US spot ETH ETFs have experienced a significant turnaround, recording a substantial net inflow that signals renewed investor confidence. This shift marks a crucial moment for Ethereum’s presence in traditional finance. What’s Behind the Remarkable Inflow for US Spot ETH ETFs? On September 9, a remarkable $44.09 million (equivalent to 61.2 billion won) flowed into US spot ETH ETFs . This positive movement effectively broke a six-day streak of net outflows, according to data from TraderT. It’s a clear indicator that institutional interest in Ethereum-backed products is far from waning, and perhaps, even strengthening. Interestingly, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) was the sole contributor to this impressive inflow. The other existing ETH ETFs did not report any net changes during this period. This highlights BlackRock’s significant influence and the trust investors place in their offerings, often seen as a bellwether for broader market sentiment. This concentrated inflow into a single ETF product suggests a strategic move by certain investors, possibly indicating a belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its growing utility within the digital economy. The breaking of the outflow streak is a psychological boost for the market, suggesting that the selling pressure might be easing. Why Do These Inflows Matter for Ethereum and the Broader Market? The influx of capital into US spot ETH ETFs carries significant weight for several reasons. Firstly, it demonstrates increasing institutional acceptance and demand for exposure to Ethereum. As more traditional financial players gain access to crypto assets through regulated products like ETFs, it legitimizes the space further. Moreover, these inflows can positively impact Ethereum’s price dynamics. Increased demand from large institutional investors can create upward price pressure, contributing to market stability and growth. It also signals a potential shift in narrative, moving away from short-term volatility concerns towards long-term investment strategies. Consider these key implications: Enhanced Liquidity: More capital flowing in means better liquidity for the ETF market, making it easier for large investors to enter and exit positions without significant price impact. Market Validation: The consistent interest, especially after a period of outflows, validates Ethereum as a serious asset class for diversified portfolios. Future Growth: Continued inflows could pave the way for more innovative financial products built around Ethereum, expanding its reach even further. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Challenges for US Spot ETH ETFs While the recent inflow is certainly a cause for optimism, the journey for US spot ETH ETFs is still evolving. The market remains dynamic, with various factors influencing investor behavior. Understanding both the opportunities and potential challenges is crucial for a comprehensive perspective. Opportunities Ahead: Broader Adoption: As more financial advisors become comfortable with crypto ETFs, they can recommend these products to a wider client base, driving further adoption. Regulatory Clarity: Continued regulatory progress in the U.S. could foster greater confidence and encourage more institutions to participate. Product Innovation: The success of spot ETH ETFs might lead to the development of other Ethereum-based investment vehicles. Potential Challenges: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and ETH ETFs are not immune to price fluctuations. Economic Headwinds: Broader economic conditions, such as inflation or interest rate changes, can influence investor appetite for risk assets like crypto. Competition: The emergence of new crypto investment products or alternative ways to gain ETH exposure could create competition. This latest inflow serves as a powerful reminder of the resilience and growing appeal of Ethereum within the institutional investment landscape. It underscores a crucial moment where confidence appears to be returning, suggesting a potentially brighter outlook for these innovative financial products. The recent $44.1 million net inflow into US spot ETH ETFs is a significant positive development, effectively ending a streak of outflows and highlighting renewed institutional interest, primarily driven by BlackRock. This moment signals a potential turning point, reinforcing Ethereum’s position as a vital asset in the evolving digital economy and encouraging a more optimistic outlook for its market trajectory.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Withdrawal Wave Points To Another Major Leg Up In The Bull Cycle, Analyst Says However, this surge was quickly followed by a decline in the metric, as the BTC: Exchange Whale Ratio tumbled to 0.28, on September 8. However, the price remained stable around $112,500, suggesting that whale movements were short-lived and did not lead to a sell-off in BTC. The CryptoQuant analyst remarked that the fall in whale pressure toward the end of the period is a positive short-term signal. In essence, the likelihood of a sharp price correction driven by whale sell-offs on Binance is now significantly reduced. Arab Chain added: The frequent whale fluctuations in late August and early September highlight that major players are still moving large volumes – meaning risks remain, and the market could be caught off guard by a sudden move if substantial exchange inflows are converted into market orders. However, the analyst cautioned that the relationship is not always absolute. Although the rise in the metric has often been associated with a fall in the price of BTC, not every spike has led to a clear decline in price. As seen in the above chart, there have been instances of whale activity surging beyond 0.5 for multiple days – accompanied by positive net inflows to exchanges. Arab Chain noted that such dynamics may lead to a failure to maintain the $112,000 level, and possibly trigger a drop to $108,000. Historical data for September shows that the beginning of the month is typically quiet in terms of whale pressure on Binance, except for the occasional quick jump. While this offers a safer environment for a gradual rise, it also gives whales a chance to exert pressure on the market, especially if the overall demand is weak. Is BTC Yet To Hit Its Peak? While BTC is currently trading roughly 10% below its latest all-time high (ATH) of $124,128, some crypto experts opine that the flagship cryptocurrency is yet to hit its peak for this market cycle.

The transaction would see CoinShares shift from Stockholm to Wall Street, signaling a major step in its bid for global dominance. Ranked as the fourth-largest digital asset exchange-traded product (ETP) manager globally, behind BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, CoinShares currently holds a commanding 34% market share in Europe. Over the past two years, its assets under management have tripled, fueled by strong inflows and the rapid expansion of its product lineup, which has grown from just four offerings in 2021 to 32 across multiple platforms. A Unique Approach Into the U.S. Market CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti described the move as “far more than a venue change,” framing the Nasdaq listing as a gateway to global leadership. He highlighted the U.S. as the hub of digital asset innovation, where institutional demand and improving regulatory clarity are creating fertile ground for expansion. CoinShares operates with industry-leading margins, 76% adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2025, and has built a diversified business model based on recurring fee revenues supplemented by trading activities. With its proven European strategy, the company now seeks to capture U.S. investors by introducing a broader suite of digital asset products, including tokenized real-world assets. What the CoinShares Nasdaq Debut Means for Crypto The $1.2 billion deal, priced at a discount compared to peer valuations, includes a $50 million institutional anchor investment. Both company boards have approved the merger, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. Upon completion, the combined entity will trade under Odysseus Holdings Limited . The timing of CoinShares’ U.S. expansion coincides with a wave of favorable regulatory developments, including the rollback of restrictive SEC policies and the drafting of new legislation aimed at fostering a clearer market structure for crypto. If successful, CoinShares’ Nasdaq debut could not only strengthen its foothold in the world’s largest asset management market but also set a precedent for how European crypto firms scale globally.

However, the prices of the leading cryptocurrencies are now bouncing back and could be set to rally higher in the near term. Bitcoin dropped to the $110k region but is now trading above $111,300, while Ether has reclaimed its value above $4,300. Ripple’s XRP also dropped below $3 and could be gearing up for another rally above that psychological level. Ripple and Spain’s BBVA extend their partnership XRP is gearing up to surge above $3 once again, and one of the major catalysts could be Ripple’s partnership with the Spanish banking giant BBVA. Ripple announced on Tuesday that it is expanding its partnership with BBVA to provide its digital asset custody technology to the Spanish bank. With this arrangement, BBVA will leverage Ripple Custody, Ripple’s institutional-grade digital asset self-custody technology to deliver a scalable and secure custody service for tokenized assets, including crypto-assets. Cassie Craddock, Managing Director, Europe, at Ripple, stated that this partnership is possible thanks to the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA). Craddock added that MiCA allows banks in the EU to launch the digital asset offerings that their customers are asking for. $3.66 high remains a target for XRP The XRP/USD 4-hour chart remains bullish and efficient despite yesterday’s flash dump. XRP is now trading at $2.96 and could reclaim the $3 psychological mark over the next few hours. The momentum indicators are also bullish, with the RSI of 57 showing that buyers are regaining control of the XRP market following weeks of volatile price action. The MACD lines are also within the bullish zone. XRP established a low at $2.93 on Tuesday afternoon following the Middle East crisis. The low is now serving as an Inducement Liquidity (ILQ) on the 4H chart, allowing XRP to prepare for another leg up. If the bullish trend continues, XRP could surpass Tuesday’s high of $3.035 before heading to the major resistance level at $3.3. The recent high of $3.66 remains XRP’s medium-term target, as hitting it could allow the cryptocurrency to set a new all-time high above $4.0. Analysts are still optimistic about XRP hitting the $6 mark over the next few weeks or months. While the ILQ at $2.93 currently holds, it is not a strong support, and XRP could dip lower if the broader market undergoes a correction. The support level at $2.70 formed earlier this month should hold in case the market decides to extend its correction. Regardless, the XRP/USD chart is bullish at the moment, and buyers could push XRP’s price higher over the next few hours and days.

Up 11% in the last seven days, DOGE has outperformed other major cryptocurrencies and could rally higher in the near term. DOJE ETF to debut on Thursday DOGE was rallying on Tuesday, in line with the broader cryptocurrency market, before abruptly dumping to the $0.233 level. The flash dump occurred following another crisis in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Qatar. The dump saw Bitcoin briefly drop to the $110k level, with other major cryptocurrencies also experiencing a dip. However, DOGE is slowly recovering and could be gearing up for a breakout ahead of a crucial day for the memecoin community in the United States. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revealed on Tuesday that the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF ($DOJE) is expected to debut in U.S. markets on Thursday, under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

DOGE could top $0.25 as market momentum remains bullish The DOGE/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient as the coin has been rallying in recent days. The momentum indicators have also switched bullish, suggesting that buyers are currently in control of the market. The MACD lines are deep within the bullish territory, while the RSI of 66 shows that DOGE could soon enter the overbought region if the current market trend persists. After sweeping the low at $0.233 following Israel’s strike in Qatar, DOGE has resumed its upward movement and is now trading at $0.24065. If the bullish trend continues, DOGE could surge past the $0.25 mark for the first time since August 13. An extended bullish run would allow DOGE to hit the $0.30 mark for the first time this year. However, it would need the support of the broader crypto market to surpass the July high of $0.288. On the flip side, DOGE could undergo a correction following days of bullish movements. If that happens, DOGE could retest the TLQ at $0.233. Failure to defend this level could see DOGE drop to the $0.210 support region in the near term.

This initiative highlights China’s proactive approach to understanding and regulating the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space. Why is China Diving Deep into Stablecoin Policy? The NSFC has officially started accepting research proposals specifically focused on stablecoins and their associated cross-border monitoring systems. This isn’t just a casual inquiry; the foundation plans to provide substantial grants, ranging from 200,000 to 300,000 yuan (approximately $27,400 to $41,100), to successful projects. According to the NSFC, proposals must include actionable stablecoin policy suggestions. These suggestions are crucial for China to effectively address the inherent risks posed by stablecoins and to contribute meaningfully to the broader framework of digital financial governance. It’s a clear signal that China is not just observing but actively seeking to define its role in this new financial frontier. Understanding the Risks and Rewards of Stablecoins Stablecoins, by design, aim to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency or other assets. While they offer benefits like efficient cross-border payments and increased liquidity in the crypto market, they also present unique challenges for regulators worldwide. Potential Risks: These include concerns over financial stability, money laundering, consumer protection, and the potential for regulatory arbitrage if not properly monitored. Opportunities: On the other hand, a well-regulated stablecoin policy could foster innovation, enhance payment systems, and provide a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy. China’s research initiative is a testament to its understanding of this dual nature. By funding these studies, the nation is preparing to navigate the complexities and harness the potential of stablecoins in a controlled manner. What Does This Mean for Global Digital Finance? China has been a frontrunner in central bank digital currency (CBDC) development with its digital yuan (e-CNY). The expansion into stablecoin policy research suggests a more comprehensive strategy for digital assets. This research could have significant international implications: It may influence global regulatory standards for stablecoins, especially concerning cross-border transactions. Other nations might look to China’s findings as they develop their own digital asset frameworks. It reinforces China’s ambition to play a leading role in shaping the future of digital financial governance, not just domestically but on the world stage. The insights generated from these studies could provide a blueprint for how a major economy integrates stablecoins into its financial system while mitigating systemic risks. Charting the Future: China’s Vision for Digital Governance The NSFC’s funding for stablecoin policy research underscores China’s commitment to robust digital financial governance. This isn’t merely about control; it’s about establishing a resilient and secure digital economy that can withstand future challenges. The proactive engagement in academic research on such a critical topic indicates a long-term vision. It suggests that China aims to: Develop sophisticated monitoring systems for digital assets. Craft innovative regulatory solutions for a rapidly evolving market. Position itself as a thought leader in the global discourse on digital currency and financial technology. This strategic move is set to generate invaluable insights that will inform China’s future digital asset regulations and potentially influence global standards for years to come. The decision by China’s largest research fund to finance extensive stablecoin policy studies marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of global digital finance. By focusing on both the risks and the opportunities, China is actively shaping its approach to stablecoins, aiming to establish a robust framework for digital financial governance. This initiative not only highlights the nation’s strategic foresight but also signals its intent to be a key player in defining the future of digital currencies worldwide.

Over the past 24 hours, the crypto landscape witnessed significant turbulence, particularly in the realm of crypto perpetual futures liquidations . These events are not just numbers; they represent substantial shifts in market sentiment and real financial consequences for traders. What Are Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations? Before diving into the recent figures, let’s quickly clarify what crypto perpetual futures liquidations entail. In essence, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin (collateral) falls below a certain threshold, often due to adverse price movements. Perpetual futures contracts are unique because they don’t have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as they maintain sufficient margin. When the market moves against a highly leveraged position, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses for both the trader and the platform. This forced closure is what we call a liquidation, and it can be a painful experience for those caught on the wrong side of the trade. Recent 24-Hour Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations: A Snapshot The past day has shown a vivid picture of this market mechanism in action. Here’s a breakdown of the significant crypto perpetual futures liquidations across major assets: Bitcoin (BTC): A staggering $46.48 million in BTC positions were liquidated. A substantial 71.07% of these liquidations came from long positions, indicating a sharp downward movement that caught bullish traders off guard. Ethereum (ETH): Similarly, Ethereum saw significant activity with $40.55 million in liquidations. Long positions accounted for 67.28% of this total, mirroring the sentiment observed in Bitcoin and suggesting a broader market correction. MYX: Interestingly, MYX experienced $31.30 million in liquidations, but with a crucial difference: 71.8% of these were from short positions. This indicates a sharp upward price movement that liquidated traders betting on a decline for MYX. These figures underscore the inherent volatility of the crypto market and the amplified risks associated with leveraged trading. While BTC and ETH traders primarily suffered from unexpected price drops, MYX traders faced losses due to a sudden rally. Why Do These Liquidations Happen? Understanding Market Dynamics Crypto perpetual futures liquidations are a direct consequence of several interconnected factors: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notorious for their rapid price swings. Even small percentage changes can have a magnified effect on leveraged positions. High Leverage: Many traders use high leverage (e.g., 10x, 50x, or even 100x) to amplify potential profits. While this can be lucrative, it also means a small adverse price movement can quickly deplete margin and trigger liquidation. Unexpected News or Events: Geopolitical events, regulatory announcements, major hacks, or even influential tweets can trigger sudden market shifts, leading to cascades of liquidations. Liquidation Cascades: Sometimes, one wave of liquidations can trigger another. As positions are closed, market sell orders (for long liquidations) or buy orders (for short liquidations) can add to the price pressure, leading to further liquidations in a domino effect. Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for anyone participating in the futures market. The allure of high returns must always be balanced against the significant risks involved. Navigating the Risks: Actionable Insights for Traders While crypto perpetual futures liquidations are a constant feature of the market, traders can adopt strategies to mitigate their exposure: Prudent Leverage: Avoid excessive leverage. Using lower leverage significantly increases the buffer against adverse price movements. Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close a position if it reaches a predetermined loss level. This helps cap potential losses and prevents total liquidation. Risk Management: Allocate only a small percentage of your total portfolio to highly leveraged trades. Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Market Analysis: Stay informed about market trends, news, and technical indicators. A deeper understanding can help anticipate potential shifts. Diversification: While not directly preventing liquidation on a single trade, diversifying your overall crypto portfolio can help manage broader market risk. These insights are not guarantees against losses, but they provide a framework for more responsible and sustainable trading practices in the volatile futures market. Conclusion: The Ever-Present Reality of Crypto Futures Trading The recent 24-hour figures for crypto perpetual futures liquidations serve as a stark reminder of the high stakes involved in leveraged cryptocurrency trading. Whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins, the market’s capacity for sudden, impactful movements remains ever-present. For both seasoned traders and newcomers, understanding the mechanisms behind liquidations, the factors that drive them, and implementing robust risk management strategies are paramount to navigating this exciting yet challenging financial frontier. Always trade with caution and informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Liquidations Q1: What exactly is a crypto perpetual future? A: A crypto perpetual future is a type of derivatives contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, they can be held indefinitely, as long as margin requirements are met. Q2: Why do most liquidations often come from long positions? A: When a significant portion of liquidations comes from long positions, it indicates a sharp downward price movement. Traders who bet on prices going up (long positions) are caught off guard, and their leveraged positions are closed out as the market drops. Q3: Can liquidations impact the overall market price? A: Yes, liquidations can certainly impact market prices. When large leveraged positions are liquidated, exchanges often execute market orders to close them. For long liquidations, this means selling the underlying asset, which can add downward pressure on prices, potentially triggering further liquidations in a cascade effect. Q4: How can I avoid being liquidated in crypto futures trading? A: To avoid liquidation, traders should use prudent leverage, always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, practice strong risk management by not over-allocating capital, and stay informed about market conditions. Maintaining sufficient margin is also key. Q5: Is perpetual futures trading suitable for beginners? A: Perpetual futures trading, especially with leverage, carries significant risk and is generally not recommended for beginners. It requires a deep understanding of market dynamics, risk management, and technical analysis. It’s advisable for newcomers to start with spot trading and thoroughly educate themselves before venturing into derivatives.

This move marks an important transition for the project and its holders, ensuring a smooth process facilitated by a major industry player. What Does the OMNI to NOM Token Swap Entail? This rebranding and token swap will bring notable changes for users. Binance will manage the entire process, making it straightforward for those holding OMNI tokens on the platform. The transition involves specific dates for delisting old pairs and listing new ones, along with a clear conversion rate. Here are the key details you need to know: Delisting of OMNI Spot Trading Pairs: All existing OMNI spot trading pairs will be delisted by Binance on September 29 at 3:00 a.m. UTC . It’s important for traders to close any open OMNI positions before this time. Launch of NOM Spot Trading Pairs: Trading for the new NOM spot pairs is scheduled to commence shortly after, on October 1 at 8:00 a.m. UTC . This provides a brief window between the delisting and the new listing. Conversion Ratio: OMNI tokens will be swapped for NOM at a fixed ratio of 1 OMNI to 75 NOM . This generous conversion rate aims to facilitate the transition smoothly for existing holders. Why is the Omni Network Undergoing a Rebranding? Rebranding in the crypto space often signifies a strategic pivot, an expansion of vision, or a complete overhaul of the project’s identity and goals. While the official announcement from Binance focuses on the logistical support, the underlying reasons for the Omni Network’s transformation into Nomina (NOM) likely involve enhancing its ecosystem, refining its core offerings, or aligning with a new market strategy. Such changes are common as projects mature and adapt to the dynamic blockchain landscape. The rebranding often aims to: Better reflect the project’s updated mission and technological advancements. Improve market perception and attract a broader user base. Differentiate itself more effectively within a competitive environment. How Will This OMNI to NOM Token Swap Affect Your Holdings? For users holding OMNI tokens on Binance, the process of the OMNI to NOM token swap is designed to be seamless. Binance will handle all technical aspects of the conversion automatically. This means you generally won’t need to take specific actions to convert your tokens if they are held on the exchange. However, it is always wise to: Monitor Official Announcements: Stay updated with Binance’s official news channels for any further instructions or clarifications regarding the swap. Review Your Portfolio: After the swap date, verify that your OMNI holdings have been correctly converted to NOM in your Binance wallet. Understand the New Token: Familiarize yourself with Nomina (NOM), its utility, and any new features or developments associated with the rebranded project. Navigating the Transition: What Should Traders Expect? The period around a token swap can sometimes bring increased volatility. Traders should be mindful of the delisting and listing dates. The temporary absence of trading pairs for OMNI, followed by the introduction of NOM, could lead to price discovery phases for the new token. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed trading decisions during this transition. The support from Binance is a significant endorsement, offering reliability and accessibility for the Nomina project. This facilitates a smoother transition for a large number of users, bolstering confidence in the new token. The OMNI to NOM token swap represents not just a name change, but a new chapter for the project, potentially opening up new opportunities and functionalities within the blockchain ecosystem. In conclusion, Binance’s support for the OMNI to NOM token swap and rebranding is a critical event for the Omni Network community. Users can anticipate a well-managed transition, with clear timelines for delisting and new trading pair introductions. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, such strategic moves are essential for projects aiming to maintain relevance and foster growth.

Avalon Labs (AVL), a prominent Bitcoin on-chain financial services platform, recently made headlines with a significant AVL token burn , incinerating nearly $1.9 million worth of its native tokens. This substantial event, entirely funded by the platform’s monthly protocol revenue, has sent ripples through the market, signaling a strong commitment to value and sustainability. Understanding the Power of an AVL Token Burn What exactly does it mean when a cryptocurrency project executes an AVL token burn ? In simple terms, it involves permanently removing tokens from circulation. This action effectively reduces the total supply, similar to a company buying back its own shares to increase their value. For Avalon Labs, this recent event saw $1.88 million worth of AVL tokens permanently destroyed. This isn’t a one-off occurrence. Over the past several months, Avalon Labs has systematically reduced AVL’s total circulating supply by an impressive 37%. This consistent effort demonstrates a clear strategy to enhance the scarcity and, consequently, the potential value of the AVL token. How Does Protocol Revenue Fuel These AVL Token Burns? One of the most compelling aspects of Avalon Labs’ strategy is that these massive AVL token burns are entirely funded by the platform’s monthly protocol revenue. But how does this mechanism work? Revenue Generation: As a Bitcoin on-chain financial services platform, Avalon Labs generates revenue through various services, transactions, and fees within its ecosystem. Buyback Program: A portion of this generated revenue is then allocated to a buyback program. This means the platform actively purchases AVL tokens from the open market. Permanent Removal: Once bought back, these tokens are sent to an inaccessible wallet address, effectively removing them from circulation forever. This process ensures transparency and irreversibility. This self-sustaining model creates a direct link between the platform’s success and the value proposition for AVL token holders. It signifies a healthy, growing ecosystem that can fund its own deflationary measures. What Benefits Can We Expect from the Continuous AVL Token Burn? The consistent execution of the AVL token burn strategy brings several potential benefits for the Avalon Labs ecosystem and its community. Increased Scarcity: By reducing the total supply, each remaining AVL token theoretically becomes more valuable, assuming demand remains constant or increases. Investor Confidence: A clear, transparent, and self-funded buyback and burn program can significantly boost investor confidence, signaling long-term commitment from the development team. Deflationary Pressure: In an often inflationary crypto landscape, a deflationary mechanism like this helps counteract selling pressure and can lead to more stable or appreciating token prices over time. Ecosystem Health: The ability to fund such substantial burns from protocol revenue underscores the robustness and utility of the Avalon Labs platform itself. It shows real-world adoption and transaction volume. Navigating the Future: The Impact of Avalon Labs’ AVL Token Burn While the AVL token burn strategy presents numerous advantages, it’s also important to consider the broader market context. The success of such a strategy is always intertwined with the platform’s continued innovation, user adoption, and the overall health of the crypto market. Avalon Labs is positioning itself as a leader in Bitcoin on-chain financial services. The commitment to a transparent and revenue-funded token burn mechanism could serve as a powerful differentiator. As the platform expands its offerings and attracts more users, the sustained reduction in AVL supply could play a pivotal role in its long-term valuation. This strategic move could indeed be a blueprint for other projects seeking to create sustainable token economies. Avalon Labs’ decision to consistently execute a significant AVL token burn , entirely funded by its protocol revenue, is a bold statement. It highlights a commitment to creating a sustainable and value-driven ecosystem for its native AVL token. With 37% of the total circulating supply already removed, the platform is actively working to enhance scarcity and reward its community. This ongoing strategy positions Avalon Labs as a forward-thinking player in the Bitcoin DeFi space, dedicated to long-term growth and investor value. Frequently Asked Questions about the AVL Token Burn Here are some common questions regarding Avalon Labs’ token burning strategy: What is an AVL token burn? An AVL token burn is the process of permanently removing AVL tokens from circulation by sending them to an inaccessible wallet address. This reduces the total supply of tokens. Why does Avalon Labs burn AVL tokens? Avalon Labs burns AVL tokens to reduce their total circulating supply, aiming to increase scarcity and potentially enhance the value of the remaining tokens. It also demonstrates a commitment to the long-term health of the ecosystem. How often does Avalon Labs conduct an AVL token burn? The article mentions that Avalon Labs has burned 37% of AVL’s total circulating supply over the past several months, indicating a consistent and ongoing strategy rather than infrequent, large events. Where does the money for the AVL token burn come from? The funds for the AVL token buyback and subsequent burn come entirely from Avalon Labs’ monthly protocol revenue, which is generated through its Bitcoin on-chain financial services. What is the total amount of AVL tokens burned so far? Avalon Labs has burned approximately $1.88 million worth of AVL tokens in its most recent event, contributing to a total of 37% of AVL’s circulating supply being removed over time.

This move, involving 6.7 million ENA worth approximately $5.54 million, has naturally sparked discussions among investors and market watchers. Understanding the implications of such large transactions is key to navigating the dynamic digital asset landscape, especially for those closely following Ethena ENA . What Does Flowdesk’s Ethena ENA Deposit Mean for the Market? About six hours ago, on-chain analyst The Data Nerd highlighted Flowdesk’s transfer of 6.7 million Ethena ENA tokens to Binance. Flowdesk isn’t just any participant; they are a critical market maker for Ethena, ensuring liquidity for the project’s token. This deposit isn’t a sudden sale; these tokens were originally received from the Ethena project three weeks prior, suggesting a planned operational move rather than an immediate reaction to market conditions. Market makers play a vital role in maintaining healthy trading environments. They provide continuous buy and sell quotes, which helps to: Improve Liquidity: Making it easier for traders to buy or sell Ethena ENA without causing significant price swings. Reduce Volatility: By absorbing large orders, they help stabilize prices. Tighten Spreads: The difference between the highest bid and lowest ask price becomes smaller. This deposit to Binance, a leading global exchange, indicates Flowdesk’s intention to continue supporting the trading of Ethena ENA , potentially increasing its availability and facilitating smoother transactions for a wider audience. The Crucial Role of Market Makers in Ethena ENA’s Liquidity The relationship between Ethena and Flowdesk is symbiotic. Ethena, as a synthetic dollar protocol, benefits immensely from robust liquidity for its governance token, ENA. Flowdesk’s ongoing commitment as a market maker ensures that there’s always a counterparty for traders looking to engage with Ethena ENA . This stability is particularly important for newer or less liquid assets. When a market maker like Flowdesk deposits a large sum of tokens to an exchange, it typically signals a readiness to facilitate more trading volume. This could mean they anticipate increased demand or are preparing to manage existing trading flows more efficiently. For holders and potential investors of Ethena ENA , this is generally a positive sign, indicating sustained support for the token’s market health. However, it’s also important for investors to observe market maker activities closely. While their primary goal is to provide liquidity, large deposits can sometimes be followed by increased selling pressure if the market maker is rebalancing their inventory. In this specific case, given the tokens were received weeks ago, it suggests a strategic deployment rather than a reactive one, reinforcing confidence in Ethena ENA . Navigating the Impact of Large Ethena ENA Movements Any substantial movement of tokens, especially by key players like market makers, can capture market attention. While this particular deposit of Ethena ENA appears to be part of normal market making operations, it’s a reminder for investors to stay informed and understand the underlying mechanics. Here are some actionable insights for those following Ethena ENA : Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools used by analysts like The Data Nerd provide valuable transparency into large transactions. Understand Market Maker Dynamics: Recognize that their role is to provide liquidity, not necessarily to signal price direction. Consider Broader Market Context: Always evaluate individual token movements within the larger cryptocurrency market trends. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying on a single asset, even one with strong market maker support, carries inherent risks. This deposit by Flowdesk underscores the professional infrastructure supporting projects like Ethena. It highlights the continuous efforts behind the scenes to ensure that digital assets are tradable and accessible, which is vital for the long-term success of Ethena ENA . In conclusion, Flowdesk’s deposit of 6.7 million Ethena ENA to Binance is a testament to the ongoing operational support for the token’s market. As a crucial market maker, Flowdesk’s actions reinforce liquidity and trading efficiency for ENA, providing a smoother experience for participants. While large transactions always warrant attention, this move appears to be a standard part of maintaining a healthy trading environment for Ethena ENA , reflecting strategic planning rather than immediate market reaction. It’s a powerful reminder of the sophisticated mechanisms that underpin the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethena ENA? A1: Ethena ENA is the governance token for Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. Ethena aims to provide a crypto-native, censorship-resistant, and scalable stablecoin solution. Q2: Who is Flowdesk and what is their role? A2: Flowdesk is a cryptocurrency market maker and ETF liquidity provider. Their role is to facilitate trading by providing liquidity for various digital assets, including Ethena ENA , ensuring smooth transactions and price stability.

This move likely aims to increase liquidity for Ethena ENA on the exchange, preparing for potential trading volume or rebalancing their inventory to support efficient trading. Q4: Does this deposit indicate ENA’s price will go up or down? A4: Not directly. Market maker deposits primarily aim to ensure liquidity and efficient trading, not to signal immediate price direction. While increased liquidity can attract more traders, price movements depend on a multitude of factors, including overall market sentiment and demand for Ethena ENA . Q5: How can I monitor such large token movements?

For South Korea, the potential of South Korean stablecoins is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible opportunity, as highlighted by a leading fintech expert. What Makes South Korean Stablecoins a Viable Option? According to Kim Hyoung-joong, president of the Korea Fintech Society, domestically issued stablecoins possess significant viability. Speaking at the Onchain Symposium in Seoul, Kim emphasized that these digital assets have successfully navigated critical hurdles that once questioned their legitimacy. Overcoming Volatility: Traditional cryptocurrencies are known for their price swings. However, stablecoins mitigate this by maintaining a guaranteed 1:1 peg, often backed by 100% fiat reserves. Enhanced Legal Frameworks: Institutional measures are increasingly providing the legal protections necessary for stablecoins to operate securely and reliably. Intrinsic Value Concerns Addressed: While initial skepticism questioned their intrinsic value, robust backing and regulatory oversight now lend them credibility. Despite lingering negative perceptions, the proof-of-concept demonstrated by global players like Tether and Circle is undeniable. These assets are already gaining significant traction, particularly for their transaction efficiency in regions like South America, and are seeing renewed interest due to policy shifts in North America. Why is a Unified Approach Crucial for South Korean Stablecoins ? To truly secure a competitive edge in the global market, a unified national strategy for South Korean stablecoins is essential. Kim Hyoung-joong stressed that the discussion must now move beyond merely considering issuance to actively building the foundational distribution infrastructure. This shift in focus is critical for several reasons: Global Competitiveness: A fragmented approach could hinder South Korea’s ability to compete with other nations and regions that are rapidly developing their stablecoin ecosystems. Market Adoption: Robust infrastructure ensures that stablecoins can be easily integrated into daily transactions, fostering wider adoption among businesses and consumers. Innovation Hub: By prioritizing infrastructure, South Korea can position itself as a leader in stablecoin innovation, attracting talent and investment. The Onchain Symposium, co-organized by Tokenpost, Coinreaders, Tether, and Crypto.com, served as a platform to underscore these urgent needs, highlighting the collaborative effort required to propel the domestic stablecoin market forward. What’s Next for South Korean Stablecoins and the Digital Economy? The message from the Korea Fintech Society is clear: the time for debate on the viability of South Korean stablecoins is over. The focus must now be on tangible action. Building a robust distribution infrastructure means: Developing user-friendly platforms: Making it easy for individuals and businesses to use stablecoins for payments, remittances, and other financial services. Ensuring regulatory clarity: Providing a stable and predictable legal environment that encourages innovation while protecting users. Fostering industry collaboration: Bringing together financial institutions, tech companies, and regulators to create a cohesive ecosystem. Embracing this proactive approach will not only unlock new economic opportunities but also cement South Korea’s position as a forward-thinking leader in the global digital asset space. The journey from concept to widespread adoption requires vision, collaboration, and a steadfast commitment to building the future of finance. In conclusion, the path forward for South Korean stablecoins is bright, provided there is a concerted effort to establish a strong, unified infrastructure. As Kim Hyoung-joong rightly points out, these assets have proven their resilience and utility. By focusing on practical implementation and distribution, South Korea can capitalize on this promising technology, enhancing transaction efficiency and securing a significant stake in the evolving global digital economy. The potential for growth and innovation is immense, making this a pivotal moment for the nation’s financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility. It typically achieves this by being pegged to a “stable” asset, such as a fiat currency (like the US dollar), a commodity (like gold), or another cryptocurrency, often maintaining a 1:1 ratio through reserves. Q2: Why are South Korean stablecoins considered viable by experts? According to Kim Hyoung-joong, president of the Korea Fintech Society, South Korean stablecoins have overcome key limitations like price volatility and lack of legal protection through institutional measures such as 100% fiat reserves and a guaranteed 1:1 peg, proving their reliability and potential for widespread use. Q3: What challenges have stablecoins faced, and how are they being addressed? Stablecoins initially faced skepticism regarding intrinsic value, price volatility, and absent legal protections. These are being addressed through robust institutional measures like full reserve backing, regulatory oversight, and proven operational models by major players like Tether and Circle, which demonstrate their efficiency and security. Q4: Why is building distribution infrastructure crucial for South Korean stablecoins? Building robust distribution infrastructure is crucial because it moves the focus beyond just issuance to practical implementation. It ensures that South Korean stablecoins can be easily used for transactions, fosters wider market adoption, enhances global competitiveness, and positions South Korea as an innovation hub in the digital asset space. Q5: Who is Kim Hyoung-joong? Kim Hyoung-joong is the president of the Korea Fintech Society, a prominent organization focused on financial technology. He is a recognized expert in the field and frequently speaks on the future of digital finance, including the potential and strategic direction for stablecoins in South Korea.

In response to growing investor interest in digital assets, this new product suite is set to debut on November 10. This marks a significant development for the US crypto market under the new regulatory regime envisioned by President Donald Trump, who aims to make America the “crypto capital of the world.” Cboe’s Shift To Meet Market Demand According to a press release issued on Tuesday, these continuous futures will provide a more “streamlined and efficient way” for traders to engage with cryptocurrencies, execute trading strategies, and manage risk. Unlike traditional futures contracts, which often necessitate periodic rolling, Cboe’s continuous futures will be designed as single, long-dated contracts with a ten-year expiration. The contracts will be cash-settled and linked to real-time spot market prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum, incorporating daily cash adjustments, utilizing a funding rate methodology, ensuring that the pricing remains closely aligned with the underlying assets. At the recent HOOD Summit in Las Vegas, Catherine Clay, Cboe’s Global Head of Derivatives, emphasized the significance of this potential launch. She noted that perpetual-style futures have seen robust adoption in offshore markets, and Cboe aims to replicate that success within the US regulatory framework. Under Trump’s second administration in the White House, regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have united to provide a more eased stance toward crypto. The agencies have dropped crypto enforcement cases against exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Uniswap that began under the leadership of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, the passage of key crypto bills in Congress and the House seems to signal a new dawn for digital assets in the US. This has prompted major institutions in the traditional finance sector to adopt cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as treasury reserve assets , being one of the most important trends that has emerged this year under the new administration. By introducing these products, Cboe expects to cater not only to institutional market participants and existing customers of its Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) but also to a growing segment of retail traders eager to access crypto derivatives. Bitcoin Slips, Ethereum Follows Suit This initiative is part of Cboe’s broader strategy to diversify and enhance its Cboe Futures Exchange product offerings. In addition to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures, the exchange aims to further expand its services with products related to equity volatility, digital assets , and global fixed income. The new continuous futures for Bitcoin and Ethereum will be cleared through Cboe Clear US, a derivatives clearing organization regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As of press time, the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, trades at $111,400, recording a 1.2% drop in the 24-hour time frame. During the same period, Ethereum has dropped 1.5%, trading at $4,292.

He anchors the call to a cluster of liquidity sitting above the $3.40 area and an improving relative-strength backdrop versus Bitcoin, Ethereum and even gold, while cautioning that the US CPI print due tomorrow could inject short-term volatility in either direction. Be aware that tomorrow there is CPI news coming from the US and it probably, most likely at this point in the market, brings with it some sort of volatility,” he said, adding that while the move “could be to the upside,” there is still “liquidity sitting below us” that could be swept before continuation. The analyst frames the recent grind higher as constructive but “choppy,” with a pattern of slightly higher lows that would invalidate quickly if one of those pivots is lost. $4.20–$4.50 Is The Target Zone As XRP Liquidity Builds XRP remains his top altcoin setup. “XRP is the base case of something that I think is looking pretty strong right now,” he said. The pair has “formed a nice bottoming pattern” and broken out, but is now “fighting against these previous swing highs.” In his view, the immediate task is a sequence of closes through successive resistance shelves—including the zone just under $3.40—after which the path to the former peak opens. “As soon as we start to get that level broken then… we could argue that all-time highs [are] back on the table,” he said, noting that from the recent local bottom XRP is “up 11%,” and that another ~10% burst through resistance “probably comes pretty quickly.” Related Reading: XRP Set to Lead Altcoin Boom With Explosive $9.69 Target, Says Analyst On higher time frames, he highlights a stacked band of resting interest overhead. “On the daily [for XRP, there is] significant liquidity above us and over the last 2–3 days more has been building in here. When we start to break that $3.40 level… this is the all-time high and we probably resume this march back towards $4.20, $4.30 and then realistically $4.50 is where all this liquidity is sitting right now.” While he characterizes that as the base case, he keeps risk balanced: “It’s not time to get 100% definite [that we’re] going to the upside… We could argue that [liquidity below] could be taken before we go higher especially if Bitcoin and ETH come down.” The cross-asset context matters for his XRP view. He sees Bitcoin at an inflection defined by structural waypoints—“a break above the $111,003 and then… $114,300… and then… above this high here about $117k”—with the daily map still showing “significant liquidity above.” Ethereum, he says, has a “dense” pocket of bids just below, but has been “losing strength against other alts,” creating a window in which ETH might wick lower to clean up liquidity while alts with stronger relative momentum hold up better. That relative momentum is where he places XRP. On XRP/ETH, he notes a sequence of “lows, highs, higher lows and higher highs,” arguing the pair is “back in an uptrend.” He draws attention to the four-hour RSI repeatedly tagging overbought during prior upside phases: “When we start to hit this four hour overbought area… momentum looks like it is pushing back to the upside… it has led to quite significant price action.” He flags 0.000071 on XRP/ETH as a confirmation pivot that would “give us more confirmation back to the upside.” A similar story appears on XRP/BTC, where he wants to see “a real good green day” to break the downtrend after a “bullish cross on the daily RSI.” Related Reading: XRP RSI Remains Bullish As Support Levels Hold, Price Eyes Break Above $3.6 He extends the relative framework beyond crypto. On XRP/gold, the analyst says the weekly structure “actually bounced pretty well off the 702 Fibonacci retracement,” with a clean back-test of prior range highs and “bullish cross” momentum. Projecting from current consolidation, he cites a potential 4.236 extension that, mechanically, implies substantial outperformance: “For a 4.236 extension from where we are now it would be about a 700% outperformance from gold… so if we just say five to six hundred percent that would be bloody nice for XRP.” He is careful to note that gold could also move, which would affect the nominal translation. Despite the urgency of the title levels, he repeatedly frames the next 24–48 hours as path-dependent. Bitcoin dominance sits at a decision point in his model; a breakdown from its “ascending wedge” would, in his view, validate the altcoin-outperformance regime he has been anticipating. “It could get very exciting very soon,” he said. “Or we could just have a few more days of chop.” Still, the directional bias is clear: “I think that I’ve said that XRP I think is leading the market. I still believe that.” His bottom line for XRP is conditional but pointed: reclaim and hold above ~$3.40, convert that resistance into support, and the liquidity magnets at ~$4.20–$4.50 come into play quickly. Fail the near-term tests, especially into a volatile macro print, and a final dip to harvest downside liquidity remains on the table before any renewed advance. At press time, XRP traded at $2.96.

This cool-off period comes as ether (ETH) hovers about 15% from its recent all-time high (ATH), and BTC remains range-bound between $108,000 and $113,000. Analysts at the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex revealed that Ethereum ETFs have just recorded their second-largest single-day outflow since their launch. Ethereum ETF Inflows Cool Off According to this week’s Bitfinex Alpha report, the 14-day average of net flows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs highlights the significant role these products have played in recent price action. Between May and August, daily allocations of 55,000 to 85,000 ETH to Ethereum ETFs drove the cryptocurrency to new highs. However, the slowing demand over the last two weeks has contributed to a slowdown in momentum. Flows into these Ethereum products fell to 16,600 daily in the last week of August. They declined even further to an average of -41,400 ETH last week. On Friday, 104,100 ETH, worth approximately $447 million, left Ethereum ETFs, marking the second-highest outflow day since inception. Bitfinex noted that the price action of both BTC and ETH has become increasingly dependent on ETFs and treasury companies. Although ETH shows a relatively higher dependency, the ETFs for both assets currently reflect a pullback in traditional finance (TradFi) buying power. “This slowdown highlights the sensitivity of institutional demand to both price and macroeconomic conditions, and reinforces the role of ETF flows as a decisive determinant of whether digital assets can regain upward momentum or remain range-bound in the near term,” the report stated. BTC to Mark Cyclical Low This Month Furthermore, the structure of TradFi demand between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has deviated significantly. This is seen by comparing cumulative ETF flows with bi-weekly changes in futures open interest for both assets. Data accessed by analysts show that investors have primarily expressed demand for BTC through direct spot exposure rather than futures positioning. ETH, on the other hand, combines spot allocations with “cash-and-carry strategies.” “The result is a distinct profile of institutional engagement while BTC flows reflect clearer directional conviction, ETH flows highlight a balance between speculative demand and structured arbitrage-driven participation,” analysts added. Meanwhile, Bitfinex insists that while BTC still faces the risk of deeper correction in the near term, the asset could mark a cyclical low in September ahead of a rally next quarter.

The price is now correcting some gains and might find bids near $2.920. XRP price is facing hurdles and struggling to clear the $3.00 resistance. The price is now trading above $2.920 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $2.9650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $2.920 zone. XRP Price Remains Supported for Gains XRP price managed to stay above the $2.8320 level and started a fresh increase, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price climbed above the $2.920 and $2.950 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped the price above the $3.00 level. A high was formed at $3.0365 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.794 swing low to the $3.036 high. Besides, there was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $2.9650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.920 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls protect the $2.920 support, the price could attempt another increase. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.980 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.00 level. A clear move above the $3.00 resistance might send the price toward the $3.0350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.150. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $3.00 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.9350 level. The next major support is near the $2.920 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.794 swing low to the $3.036 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.920 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.860. The next major support sits near the $2.850 zone, below which the price could gain bearish momentum. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.

For those invested in cryptocurrencies, understanding these macro-financial shifts is paramount, as they frequently dictate the broader sentiment towards risk assets. Currently, a confluence of factors – primarily the looming prospect of US Interest Rate Cuts and the persistent challenge of weak China Inflation Data – is casting a long shadow over Asian currencies, leading to a period of pronounced uncertainty and muted activity. Understanding the Muted Asian Forex Market: Why the Silence? The Asian Forex Market , a vibrant hub of global trade and finance, is currently experiencing a period of unusual quietude. This subdued activity is not merely a pause but a reflection of deep-seated concerns and cautious optimism surrounding major economic shifts. Asian currencies, from the Korean Won to the Indonesian Rupiah, are known for their sensitivity to external economic forces, particularly those emanating from the United States and China. When these two economic giants face their own challenges or policy shifts, the impact reverberates swiftly across Asia. Several key factors contribute to this muted environment: Global Economic Headwinds: A general slowdown in global trade and manufacturing activity dampens demand for Asian exports, subsequently affecting currency strength. Policy Divergence: While some Asian central banks might consider easing their monetary policies, the uncertainty surrounding the US Federal Reserve’s actions creates a hesitant stance. Capital Flows: Investor sentiment, influenced by interest rate differentials and risk appetite, dictates the flow of capital into or out of Asian economies, directly impacting currency valuations. This cautious atmosphere means that while there isn’t a dramatic downturn, there’s also little impetus for significant upward movement, leaving many currencies trading within tight ranges. Investors are keenly watching for definitive signals before committing to major positions. The Shadow of US Interest Rate Cuts: What’s the Impact on Asia? The anticipation surrounding potential US Interest Rate Cuts by the Federal Reserve is arguably the most significant external factor influencing the Asian Forex Market today. For months, market participants have been speculating on the timing and magnitude of these cuts, and any deviation from expectations can send ripples across global financial markets. Historically, lower US interest rates tend to weaken the US Dollar, making higher-yielding Asian currencies more attractive for what is known as the ‘carry trade’ – borrowing in a low-interest currency and investing in a high-interest one. However, the current situation is complex. While the prospect of rate cuts might eventually bolster Asian currencies, the delay or uncertainty surrounding these cuts is causing hesitation. Here’s why: Delayed Cuts, Stronger Dollar: If the Fed holds rates higher for longer than anticipated, the US Dollar retains its strength, putting downward pressure on Asian currencies. This makes US assets more appealing relative to their Asian counterparts. Reduced Risk Appetite: Uncertainty about the global economic outlook, which might prompt the Fed to cut rates, can also lead to a ‘flight to safety,’ where investors prefer the perceived stability of the US Dollar, even if rates are lower. Policy Space: A dovish Fed provides more policy space for Asian central banks to potentially ease their own rates to support domestic growth without risking significant capital outflows. Conversely, a hawkish Fed limits this flexibility. Market analysts are constantly recalibrating their expectations for Fed policy. A table illustrating the shift in market expectations over time might look something like this: Period Market Expectation for Fed Cuts (by year-end) Impact on Asian Currencies (General Trend) Late 2023 5-6 cuts (aggressive easing) Potential for appreciation Early 2024 3-4 cuts (moderated easing) Mixed, slight appreciation Mid 2024 1-2 cuts (cautious easing) Subdued, potential for depreciation The ongoing tug-of-war between inflation data and growth concerns in the US will continue to dictate the Fed’s trajectory, and consequently, the fortunes of the Asian Forex Market . Decoding the Chinese Yuan’s Stagnation: A Crucial Puzzle Piece At the heart of Asia’s current economic narrative is the performance of the Chinese Yuan . Despite China’s status as a global economic powerhouse, its currency has been notably subdued, stalling against the US Dollar and other major currencies. This stagnation is not a simple market fluctuation but a symptom of deeper structural challenges within the Chinese economy, primarily linked to persistent deflationary pressures and a struggling property sector. Why is the Chinese Yuan facing such headwinds? Weak Domestic Demand: A lack of consumer confidence and spending, partly due to the property market downturn and employment concerns, reduces inflationary pressures and limits economic growth. Property Sector Woes: The ongoing crisis in China’s vast property sector, marked by developer defaults and falling home prices, has a significant ripple effect across the economy, impacting financial stability and consumer wealth. Capital Outflows: Lower domestic interest rates compared to other major economies, coupled with economic uncertainty, can incentivize capital to flow out of China, putting downward pressure on the yuan. Monetary Policy Stance: The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) faces a dilemma. While easing monetary policy (cutting rates, injecting liquidity) could stimulate growth, it might further weaken the yuan, potentially leading to capital flight. The PBOC’s approach to managing the yuan’s exchange rate is often a tightrope walk, balancing domestic economic stability with external competitiveness. A weaker yuan can make Chinese exports more attractive, but too much depreciation can trigger capital outflows and undermine financial confidence. This delicate balance is a key reason why the Chinese Yuan remains a critical, yet challenging, currency to predict in the current environment. The Alarming Truth: China Inflation Data and Its Ripple Effects The latest China Inflation Data has revealed an alarming trend: persistent deflationary pressures. While many parts of the world grapple with high inflation, China is facing the opposite problem – falling consumer prices (Consumer Price Index, CPI) and producer prices (Producer Price Index, PPI). This situation is a significant concern for global markets because of China’s immense role in the global supply chain and its demand for commodities. What does weak China Inflation Data signify, and what are its broader implications? Lack of Consumer Demand: Falling CPI suggests that consumers are either unwilling or unable to spend, leading to a surplus of goods and services. This indicates weak domestic demand, a critical component of a healthy economy. Producer Price Deflation: Persistent declines in PPI mean that factories are selling goods at lower prices, which squeezes corporate profits, discourages investment, and can lead to job losses. This can create a vicious cycle of reduced spending and further price drops. Debt Burden: Deflation increases the real value of debt, making it harder for companies and households to repay their loans, exacerbating financial risks, especially in the property sector. Global Spillovers: As a major exporter, China’s deflation can export lower prices to the rest of the world, potentially complicating other central banks’ efforts to manage their own inflation targets. It also reduces China’s demand for global commodities, impacting resource-exporting nations. The struggle with deflation makes it challenging for Beijing to stimulate economic growth effectively. While the government has implemented various measures, their impact has been limited so far. The ongoing battle against deflation in China is a major theme that investors in the Asian Forex Market and beyond must closely monitor, as its resolution or exacerbation will have profound consequences. Navigating Global Forex Trends: A Broader Perspective for Asian Currencies While the focus is often on regional dynamics and bilateral influences, understanding Global Forex Trends is essential for a complete picture of the Asian Forex Market . Currencies do not exist in isolation; they are part of a complex, interconnected web where the performance of one major currency can significantly influence others. The US Dollar, Euro, and Japanese Yen, in particular, play pivotal roles in shaping the global currency landscape. How do broader Global Forex Trends impact Asia? US Dollar Strength/Weakness: As the world’s primary reserve currency and a safe-haven asset, the US Dollar’s movements are paramount. A strong dollar typically pressures Asian currencies, while a weaker dollar can provide them with breathing room. Eurozone Economic Health: Europe is a major trading partner for many Asian economies. The health of the Eurozone economy and the European Central Bank’s (ECB) monetary policy decisions can influence trade flows and investor sentiment towards Asia. Japan’s Monetary Policy: Japan’s long-standing ultra-loose monetary policy has made the Japanese Yen a popular funding currency for carry trades. Any shift in the Bank of Japan’s stance can have significant repercussions for global liquidity and, by extension, Asian currencies. Risk Appetite: Periods of high global risk appetite (e.g., strong equity markets, positive economic outlooks) often lead to capital flowing into emerging markets, including Asia, boosting their currencies. Conversely, ‘risk-off’ environments typically favor safe havens like the USD. The current environment is characterized by a cautious risk appetite, largely due to geopolitical uncertainties and mixed economic signals from major economies. This means that while some currencies might find temporary support, a sustained rally in the Asian Forex Market requires a more robust and clear global economic outlook. Monitoring these broader trends provides critical context for making informed decisions in the intricate world of currency trading. Challenges and Opportunities for Investors in the Asian Forex Market The current climate presents both significant challenges and intriguing opportunities for investors. The volatility stemming from uncertain US Interest Rate Cuts and the ongoing struggles with China Inflation Data creates a complex trading environment. However, for those with a keen eye and strategic approach, this complexity can yield rewards. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Sudden shifts in sentiment or economic data can lead to rapid currency movements, making risk management crucial. Policy Divergence: Central banks in Asia may not move in lockstep, creating varied responses to external pressures and making it difficult to predict uniform currency behavior. Geopolitical Risks: Regional tensions and global political events can introduce unforeseen risks, affecting investor confidence and capital flows. Opportunities: Diversification: Strategic allocation across different Asian currencies can mitigate risks associated with single-currency exposure. Carry Trade Potential: If the Fed does cut rates significantly, the appeal of higher-yielding Asian currencies could return, offering carry trade opportunities. Undervalued Assets: Periods of market stress can uncover currencies that are fundamentally undervalued, offering long-term growth potential. Understanding the interplay between Asian Forex Market dynamics, US Interest Rate Cuts , the resilience of the Chinese Yuan , and the impact of China Inflation Data is key to navigating these waters successfully. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Forex Landscape In a market characterized by such intricate dependencies, what steps can investors take to position themselves advantageously? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications Closely: Pay close attention to statements and minutes from the Federal Reserve, the People’s Bank of China, and other key Asian central banks. Their forward guidance on monetary policy will be a primary driver of currency movements. Track Economic Data: Keep a close watch on inflation reports (CPI, PPI), GDP growth figures, and employment data from the US, China, and major Asian economies. These provide real-time indicators of economic health and policy direction. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying your currency exposure across different Asian economies that exhibit varying degrees of resilience or sensitivity to global factors. Utilize Technical Analysis: Beyond fundamental data, technical analysis can help identify key support and resistance levels, trend reversals, and potential entry/exit points for trades in the Asian Forex Market . Consider Hedging Strategies: For businesses or investors with significant exposure to Asian currencies, hedging strategies (e.g., using options or forward contracts) can help mitigate adverse currency movements. Stay Informed on Geopolitics: Geopolitical developments, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, can quickly alter market sentiment. Staying updated can help anticipate potential market reactions. By combining fundamental understanding with strategic execution, investors can better navigate the complexities of the current forex environment and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities. Concluding Thoughts: The Interconnected Future of Asian Currencies The current muted state of the Asian Forex Market is a clear testament to the profound interconnectedness of the global financial system. The shadow of potential US Interest Rate Cuts continues to loom large, shaping expectations and influencing capital flows, while the persistent challenges posed by weak China Inflation Data and the subdued Chinese Yuan add layers of complexity. These regional dynamics, when viewed through the lens of broader Global Forex Trends , paint a picture of cautious optimism mixed with significant uncertainty. For investors, particularly those attuned to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, understanding these macro-financial undercurrents is not just beneficial but essential. The direction of Asian currencies will depend heavily on how these key factors evolve: the Fed’s eventual policy path, China’s success in stimulating its economy and tackling deflation, and the overall global appetite for risk. As these narratives unfold, the Asian Forex Market will undoubtedly continue to offer both formidable challenges and compelling opportunities for those prepared to analyze its intricate dance.

The Resolution takes effect on September 9, 2025, and will run for five years. According to the text of the measure, the program tightly limits who may issue tokens, who may run trading markets, and how both foreign and domestic investors may take part. Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc has signed the resolution that sets out a framework for the issuance and trading of crypto assets, the Government Electronic Newspaper of Vietnam reported Tuesday. High Capital And Institutional Rules Organizations that want to run crypto trading markets must meet steep capital and ownership tests. The Resolution sets a minimum contributed charter capital of 10,000 billion Vietnamese Dong. At least 65% of that charter capital must be held by organizations, and over 35% must be held by at least two institutions such as commercial banks, securities companies, fund managers, insurance firms or tech firms. Foreign ownership in licensed providers is capped at 49%. Leadership and staff rules are also strict: the General Director must have two years of relevant experience and the Chief Technology Officer must have five years, the resolution states. Firms must employ at least 10 staff in technology roles with certified network security training, and at least 10 staff with securities practice certificates. The infotech system must meet Level 4 information security standards before it goes live. Asset Backing And Investor Access Based on reports , tokens issued in the pilot must be backed by real underlying assets. Securities and fiat currencies are not allowed as underlying assets. Offerings may be directed to foreign investors, and trading among foreign investors must occur through service providers licensed by the Ministry of Finance. Issuers are required to publish a prospectus and related documents at least 15 days before an offering. Participants are responsible for making sure public information is accurate and timely. Services Allowed And Risk Controls Licensed crypto-asset service providers will be allowed to organize trading markets, offer custody, operate issuance platforms and self-trade within the rules. Providers must have clear processes for risk management, deposit and asset handling, transaction and payment flows, AML/CFT checks and monitoring for financing of weapons of mass destruction. Internal control and transaction monitoring systems must be in place, along with procedures for handling conflicts of interest, customer complaints and compensation, according to the resolution. Trading Controls And Penalties Domestic investors may open accounts with licensed providers to deposit, buy and sell crypto assets. But six months after the first crypto-asset service provider is licensed, any domestic trading that bypasses licensed platforms will face administrative sanctions or criminal prosecution depending on the violation’s severity.

Hilton explained that XRP was trading about 5% higher at the time of his recording, with a broader upward momentum reflected across the digital asset market. The analyst noted that while the total crypto market capitalization was moving closer to the $4 trillion mark, XRP was among the leading gainers in the top fifteen cryptocurrencies. Alongside XRP’s increase, Solana was also up 5%, and Dogecoin had risen by 8%, while Bitcoin and Ethereum remained relatively flat. Hilton emphasized that the capital flow into alternative assets signaled positive liquidity dynamics in the market. He pointed out that XRP had risen about 9% from recent lows over the past six days, showing what he considered to be a clear bounce back. In his view, this performance aligned with his earlier projections that XRP would begin to regain momentum after its recent declines. This impacts YOUR XRP! pic.twitter.com/Ej1lF8gF7O — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 8, 2025 The Influence of Macroeconomic Conditions Beyond cryptocurrency-specific developments, Hilton attributed part of the recent gains to broader economic factors. He observed that traditional stock indexes, such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, had recently posted gains, partly driven by growing speculation about monetary policy adjustments. In particular, investors were focusing on the possibility of a larger-than-expected interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Hilton referred to labor market data as a factor influencing these expectations. The most recent jobs report for August showed that only 22,000 jobs were added, a figure that came in significantly below the projected 75,000. This weaker-than-expected jobs growth was interpreted as an indicator of economic slowdown, reinforcing arguments for lowering interest rates. With inflation data expected later in the week, Hilton noted that further evidence of easing price pressures could strengthen the case for a substantial rate cut. Expectations Ahead of the Federal Reserve’s Decision According to Hilton, the next major event that could impact crypto markets is the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision on September 17 . He suggested that the market’s upward movement, including XRP’s positive performance, was partly driven by the anticipation that the central bank may deliver a more aggressive rate cut than initially expected. Hilton stated that this speculation was providing fuel for gains across the cryptocurrency sector, which had climbed about 1.3% overall on the day of his recording. Hilton described the outlook as encouraging, with XRP benefitting from both technical recovery and broader macroeconomic developments. He underscored that the combination of improving market sentiment, stronger liquidity flows into altcoins, and potential monetary policy shifts was shaping the current momentum for XRP.

With the Federal Reserve decision just over a week away, he indicated that the outcome of monetary policy discussions could play a decisive role in sustaining or expanding the current positive trajectory for XRP and other cryptocurrencies.

JPMorgan announced that it expects the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting, despite uncertainties surrounding inflation data. The bank forecasts the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) to remain at 2.9% year-over-year, and the core CPI at 3.1%. However, it noted that higher-than-expected inflation data could lead to a rate cut being postponed until October or December. JPMorgan also highlighted the potential market impact of inflation data. According to the bank, a core CPI reading above 0.40% could lead to a 1.5–2% decline in the S&P 500, while a reading between 0.35% and 0.40% could lead to a 0.5–1% loss. A reading below 0.25% could lead to a 1.25–1.75% gain in the index. Related News: Billion-Dollar Altcoin Nearly Doubles in Value Over the Past Two Days - Here's Why JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also pointed out the weakening economy, saying, “I think the Fed will probably cut interest rates, but I don't think it will be a direct result of developments in the economy.” Meanwhile, Fitch Ratings argued that the slowdown in the US economy is becoming increasingly evident. The agency noted that the weakening labor market could force the Fed to cut interest rates more rapidly. Fitch expects 25 basis point cuts in the US in September and December, and projects three additional cuts in 2026. Fitch also noted that the probability of a new interest rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) is low, and therefore the dollar's chances of recovery remain limited. *This is not investment advice.

The former performed much better, likely fueled by additional backing from Coinbase and Upbit. Green Candles After the Updates The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange expanded the list of trading choices on its futures program to enhance users’ experience. Specifically, it launched the FLOCK/USDT and SKY/USDT perpetual contracts with up to 75x leverage. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts have no expiry date and offer the potential for substantial gains. At the same time, they carry a high risk of liquidation if the market moves against the trader’s position. Both products will support the multi-assets mode, meaning that traders can use other cryptocurrencies like BTC as margin when dealing with the contracts. Somewhat expected, the prices of the involved coins headed north after the disclosure. FLOCK (FLOCK) skyrocketed to a new all-time high of $0.66 before retracing to the current $0.41 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 55% increase on a daily scale. FLOCK Price, Source: CoinGecko Sky (SKY) posted a more modest increase of around 7% and as of this writing trades at approximately $0.07. The latest gains solidified its position among the top 100 cryptocurrencies as its current market capitalization stands at over $1.7 billion. The Perfect Setup for FLOCK It is important to note that Binance isn’t the only crypto exchange showing the thumbs up for FLOCK аs of late, which may explain why the token has posted more substantial gains than SKY. Earlier this week, Coinbase added support for the asset on the Base network. It explained that trading will begin today “if liquidity conditions are met .” For its part, Upbit – South Korea’s biggest crypto exchange – announced the listing of the FLOCK/KRW pair. It will allow only deposits via the Base network, warning that large transactions from unclear sources may require proof of funds. Backing from Binance and the other behemoths increases the asset’s liquidity, boosts its global availability and visibility, and has a positive effect on its reputation.

The exchange operator, which is part of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said on Tuesday that the contracts are scheduled to begin trading on November 10, pending regulatory review. Unlike standard futures that require traders to roll their positions into new contracts as they expire, continuous futures will provide long-dated exposure with a 10-year expiration period. This structure is designed to reduce the need for constant position management, a challenge that often deters traditional investors from crypto markets. Perpetual-Style Contracts for Regulated Markets Cboe explained that the product will function similarly to perpetual contracts, which have become a dominant form of crypto trading in offshore and DeFi markets due to their lack of expiry dates. The contracts will be cash-settled and aligned to spot prices through transparent funding mechanisms. “Perpetual-style futures have gained strong adoption in offshore markets. Now, Cboe is bringing that same utility to our US-regulated futures exchange,” said Catherine Clay, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. Growing Appetite for Perpetuals Perpetual contracts currently dominate Bitcoin derivatives markets. Research from Kaiko indicates they account for 68% of Bitcoin’s total trading volume in 2025, reflecting widespread trader preference for this format. CoinMarketCap data shows open interest in perpetual futures has reached $876 billion this year, underscoring their role in driving liquidity and leverage. By introducing continuous futures, Cboe hopes to attract US traders who have previously turned to offshore exchanges for these products. A Return to Crypto Expansion This launch marks a significant step for Cboe, which first introduced Bitcoin futures in 2017 but later scaled back its crypto derivatives efforts. The renewed push follows a friendlier regulatory environment under the Trump administration, with US agencies showing greater openness to new crypto products. Other US platforms have already made moves. Bitnomial launched perpetual futures in April, becoming the first exchange to do so under US oversight. Coinbase followed in July with nano Bitcoin and Ether perpetual futures, expanding its offerings to retail-focused traders. Cboe’s entry into the space suggests growing competition and regulatory acceptance for products that bridge traditional finance with digital assets.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-10 05:16:54

This figure is very small compared to previous inflow days, but it reverses the trend of outflows last week, since Monday also saw an inflow of $364.3 million. It was a short last week, but the total inflow for the four trading days was just $250 million, less than the inflow on Monday this week. BlackRock’s IBIT had the lion’s share of the inflows with $169.5 million on Tuesday, which countered the outflows from Fidelity, Bitwise, and ARK 21Shares. Meanwhile, spot markets have been muted, with Bitcoin bouncing between $111,000 and $113,000 over the past few days. The asset topped $113,200 in Tuesday trading before falling back to $111,500 again during the Wednesday morning Asian session. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index was smack in the middle at 49, neutral, as traders remain undecided. Retail traders have “changed their tunes,” swinging more and more negative with expectations of Bitcoin falling back below $100,000, Ethereum back below $3,500,” observed Santiment. “As markets move opposite to the crowd’s expectations, these couple of weeks of FUD are an encouraging sign that this feared large retrace will never actually happen.” Dogecoin ETF Imminent Investors could see a new product launched this week as analysts anticipate the new Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF hitting the exchanges. “Meme coin ETF era about to kick off, it looks like, with DOJE slated for a Thursday launch,” said Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas, who added: “Pretty sure this is the first-ever US ETF to hold something that has no utility on purpose.” The Doge people (what do you call them, Doge-rs?) are objecting to my “no utility” comment.

The recent Onchain Symposium in Seoul brought together leading experts who delivered a powerful message: robust digital asset regulation is not just important, it’s absolutely crucial for the nation’s future economic competitiveness. This isn’t merely about compliance; it’s about seizing significant opportunities in the rapidly expanding Web3 space. Why is Crucial Digital Asset Regulation Essential for South Korea? During a compelling panel discussion at the Josun Palace Hotel, industry leaders highlighted the urgent need for a clear and comprehensive framework. Patrick Yoon, General Manager of Crypto.com Korea, underscored how global regulations have accelerated since the Trump administration, setting a benchmark for nations worldwide. He firmly believes South Korea is uniquely positioned to respond swiftly and decisively to these shifts. The stakes are high. Without clear guidelines, the nation risks falling behind in the global race for financial innovation. Establishing a stable environment will: Boost Investor Confidence: A well-regulated market attracts both domestic and international capital. Foster Innovation: Clear rules provide certainty, allowing businesses to innovate without fear of sudden policy changes. Enhance Global Standing: Positioning South Korea as a leader in the responsible development of digital finance. Unlocking Web3 Potential: Payments, Remittances, and Beyond with Digital Asset Regulation Yoon pointed to substantial opportunities emerging in critical areas like payments and remittances. Imagine a world where transactions are faster, cheaper, and more transparent thanks to Web3 technologies. However, realizing this vision requires a concerted effort from key players. Exchanges, custody firms, and risk management companies must embrace the Web3 transition. This transition isn’t just about adopting new tech; it’s about adapting to a new paradigm of finance. Stablecoins, in particular, hold immense promise for these applications, offering a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized world. Effective digital asset regulation will provide the necessary guardrails for this exciting evolution. What specific opportunities could South Korea unlock? Reduced Transaction Costs: Especially for cross-border payments. Increased Financial Inclusion: Reaching underserved populations. New Business Models: Driving economic growth through innovative services. The Stablecoin Conundrum: Crafting Smart Digital Asset Regulation The path to effective regulation is complex, especially when it comes to stablecoins. Han Suh-hee, a partner attorney at Barun Law LLC, revealed that while dedicated legislation for stablecoins is still under discussion, significant progress is being made. These discussions are meticulously focused on three core pillars: Issuing Entities: Who can issue stablecoins, and what are their responsibilities? Reserve Assets: What assets back stablecoins, and how are they managed to ensure stability? Supervisory Bodies: Which authorities will oversee stablecoin operations and enforce compliance? Suh-hee emphasized that the goal is to create a regulatory system that is not only stable and robust but also business-friendly and globally applicable. This balance is crucial for fostering innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. Crafting this delicate balance in digital asset regulation will define South Korea’s success. What are the Challenges in Implementing Digital Asset Regulation? While the benefits are clear, the journey is not without its hurdles. Regulators face the challenge of understanding rapidly evolving technology, preventing illicit activities, and ensuring consumer protection without stifling innovation. The industry, in turn, must adapt to new compliance requirements and invest in robust security measures. Striking the right balance requires ongoing dialogue and collaboration between policymakers, industry experts, and the public. The collective effort to develop thoughtful digital asset regulation will pave the way for a more secure, efficient, and innovative financial future for South Korea. The insights from the Onchain Symposium serve as a vital call to action, emphasizing that the time for decisive regulatory action is now.

Grayscale made history in 2024 by converting its Bitcoin Trust into the first US spot Bitcoin ETF, and is now seeking to replicate that model with Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. However, the SEC continues to take the maximum time allowed under statutory review periods. SEC Extends Dogecoin and Hedera Reviews The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed decisions on two more cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals. The regulator extended its review of the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF and the Grayscale Hedera ETF until Nov. 12. On Tuesday, the SEC postponed NYSE Arca’s request to list the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF, which was originally filed in March and entered into the Federal Register on March 17. The same day, it also pushed back its review of Grayscale’s Hedera ETF application. Grayscale has been making moves to expand its ETF lineup, and updated filings to convert its long-standing Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash trusts into ETFs. Converting these products to trade on national exchanges will enable daily share creations and redemptions, reducing the premiums and discounts that often plague over-the-counter (OTC) products. Grayscale set an important precedent in 2024 when it successfully converted its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into the first US spot Bitcoin ETF after a lengthy legal battle with the SEC. The company is now trying to replicate that success with Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. However, the regulator’s decision to extend review timelines means that there is still some uncertainty surrounding the approval path for altcoin ETFs. The SEC is currently managing a wave of applications thanks to a surge in institutional demand for altcoin exposure. By July 31, at least 31 spot altcoin ETF proposals were filed in 2025, with filings covering assets like XRP, Dogecoin, Solana, Litecoin, Avalanche and BNB. In late August, 92 crypto-related ETF products were still awaiting SEC rulings. Interest has been particularly strong for Solana, with eight active filings, and XRP, with seven. So far, the SEC has generally taken the maximum time allowed under its statutory review process by repeatedly opting for deadline extensions rather than issuing early approvals or denials. In August alone, it postponed multiple ETF applications, including the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF to Oct. 8, the 21Shares and Bitwise Solana ETFs to Oct. 16, and the 21Shares Core XRP Trust to Oct. 19. On August 25, the agency also extended its review of Cboe BZX’s proposal to list the WisdomTree XRP Fund, setting Oct, 24 as the deadline.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BCH|DOGE|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-10 05:30:00

Insiders see DeFi coin beating XRP’s pace,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/10/which-crypto-for-next-100x-insiders-see-defi-coin-beating-xrps-pace/,"When XRP went from being worth pennies to dollars, it made a lot of people rich and became a model for how to get a lot of money back in crypto. But people who know XRP well say it was missing one important thing: DeFi mechanics that create actual, ongoing demand. That’s why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is only $0.035 in its presale, is already getting a lot of attention. The project is being marketed as the next big run since it has a lending and borrowing base and a token buyback strategy. Analysts are openly wondering if it will make 100x more money faster than XRP ever did. From $0.035 to triple digits It’s easy to do the math when a token costs $0.035. If the price goes to $3.50, it will be worth 100X as much, and insiders say that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has the tools to make it happen. This ecosystem is built around stablecoin supply and lending, which creates constant demand. This is different from prior tokens that relied primarily on speculative excitement. The token is an important aspect of every transaction since users borrow against collateral, pay back loans with interest, and stake. This structure changes MUTM from a passive asset into an active utility that increases in value over time. Just like XRP had a story about cross-border payments, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a DeFi center where lending, staking, and stablecoin use will all come together. And since insiders are already buying up crypto, the next spike in value seems less like a question of whether crypto is a solid investment and more like a question of when to get in. Borrowing and lending mechanics The main idea behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a borrowing and lending model that fixes problems with older DeFi platforms. All loans will be overcollateralized, which means that borrowers will have to put down more value than they get. If the market changes and the value of collateral lowers, liquidation triggers will keep the system fully supported and maintain solvency. Liquidation thresholds will depend on how volatile the assets are. Stable assets like ETH or stablecoins will have higher loan-to-value ratios, around 75%, while more volatile assets will be in the 35–40% range. This method keeps the platform stable even when there are big drops, like during a crypto meltdown. Liquidators will also get bonuses for closing distressed loans quickly, even if they don’t have enough collateral. This will make sure that liquidity isn’t put at risk. Reserve factors will be between 10% and 35%, depending on how risky each asset is. This will strike a balance between rewarding people for participating and keeping the protocol healthy in the long run. When investors ask why crypto goes down every time the markets quake, the explanation is frequently that poor systems can’t handle the stress. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designing its structure to keep it from happening. Presale evidence of insider demand How insiders act is the best sign of confidence. During its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) raised $15.51 million and has more than 16,200 holders. Phase 6 is now 35% sold out. When it is finished, the price of the token will go up from $0.035 to $0.040, which is a 15% increase overnight. Insiders are buying a lot during Phase 6 because they know what will happen next: once exchanges start trading, price discovery will start at much higher levels. Those who wait to buy will only do so at higher prices, while those who obtain their allotment now are getting the final reduced entrance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also knows that no real investor will put money into something unless the security is locked down. The project has been checked by CertiK, which included both manual review and static analysis. It got a score of 95 on Token Scan and 78 on Skynet. The firm has also set up a $50,000 Bug Bounty program, which invites independent testers to find flaws in the system. This level of openness shows that the institution is ready. For whales and funds that are thinking about allocating, knowing that there are risk controls and audits in place makes it easier for them to do so. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trying to make itself a place where institutional investors can someday feel safe putting their money. Beta launch and $100K giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its beta platform at the same time as its debut. This is different from XRP, which depended significantly on speculation in its early days. This means that new investors will be able to use the ecosystem’s borrowing, lending, and stablecoin features right away, instead of having to wait years for them to be useful. The group has also announced a $100,000 giveaway where ten winners would each get $10,000 in MUTM. This makes things even more exciting. This two-pronged approach of making the platform useful and rewarding the community will make sure that XRP gets the traction it never had at launch. It’s already evident what the difference is between buyers in Phase 1 and Phase 6. People who joined at $0.01 have unrealized returns on paper, and Phase 6 investors are still getting in at a lower price until it goes up to $0.040. Both groups are ahead, but those who wait risk joining at levels that are 15% to 20% higher right away. People who move quickly in the early stages of crypto history have made a lot of money. Investors who missed XRP’s first swings saw it rise to the top of the charts and wished they had acted sooner. The time to get in on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at a discount is running out soon. This is the time to move in before the next phase raises prices.

According to him, after several weeks of price compression, the asset had moved above the descending trendline that had acted as resistance. He marked the point of breakout with a circle on the chart he shared and explained that he was watching closely for the daily candle closure to confirm the move. In his words, the trendline resistance had flipped, suggesting a technical shift in the chart structure. $XRP BREAKOUT ALERT After weeks of compression, XRP is breaking the downtrend line on the daily chart (see circle, waiting for candle closure). Trendline RESISTANCE flipped Macro: FED cut incoming Fundamentals: ETF deadlines in October First target: $3.4 –… pic.twitter.com/iYFgzkCVhX — Arthur (@XrpArthur) September 8, 2025 Analyst’s Technical Outlook Arthur described the technical setup as clear, noting that XRP’s recent candlestick movement placed the price above the established descending trendline. The attached chart shows the series of lower highs that had kept the price contained since its July peak, followed by the breakout attempt. He remarked that the setup was decisive, provided the daily candle confirmed the move, and suggested that this marked a transition from a compression phase to a potential trending move. Macro and Fundamental Elements Noted In his tweet, Arthur linked the breakout with broader factors beyond technicals. He pointed out that the macro environment included an expected Federal Reserve rate cut , which he indicated could be favorable for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. He also referred to upcoming ETF deadlines in October, suggesting that these events could influence momentum and market activity. By tying the breakout to both macroeconomic and fundamental drivers, he framed the move as supported by more than just the chart structure. Price Levels Identified Arthur shared specific price levels he was monitoring. He listed a first target range of $3.40 to $3.50 if the breakout sustained, and noted that if momentum continued, XRP could move to levels above $4.00 . These targets were presented as sequential objectives based on continued price strength. His commentary made clear that the path toward these levels would depend on sustained confirmation and market follow-through, rather than being immediate outcomes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Independent perspective It is important to note that breakouts above long-standing resistance lines often require confirmation through both candle closures and consistent volume. Retests of the breakout area are common, and false breakouts can occur if momentum weakens. While Arthur emphasized the alignment of technical , macro, and fundamental factors in favor of an upward scenario, the outcome remains conditional on sustained buying pressure and external market developments.

Per Yahoo Finance data , QMMM shares soared 2,300% on Tuesday before closing 1,736% higher at $207 on Nasdaq. However, the stock fell in extended trading, and the shares are down 61% at the time of publication. The shares have reported an 8,147% increase in the past month. QMMM Launches ‘Crypto-Autonomous Ecosystem’ – Plans $100M Digital Asset Treasury QMMM, on Tuesday, announced that it is building a massive $100 million crypto treasury targeting Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana . Calling it a “crypto-autonomous ecosystem,” the company, also known for its virtual apparel services, said it would combine artificial intelligence with blockchain to advance innovative tools for crypto analysis. “QMMM’s entry into this space reflects our commitment to technological innovation and our vision to bridge the digital economy with real-world applications, ”said Bun Kwai, CEO of QMMM. Further, the firm is seeking to connect data providers with consumers through a blockchain-based, decentralized marketplace. Meanwhile, it plans to leverage AI-powered analytics to process “large volumes of data.” “Our cryptocurrency initiatives, combined with our expertise in AI and digital platforms, are designed to create sustainable value for our stakeholders while reinforcing our role as a forward-looking technology company,” Kwai added. Growing Wave of Asian Players Adopting Crypto QMMM’s crypto treasury debut comes amid a growing number of Asia-based companies eyeing to include the asset class in their stash. As reported by Cryptonews last week, VC firm Sora Ventures revealed the launch of its dedicated Bitcoin treasury fund, backed by an initial $200 million commitment from Asian investors. It aims to accumulate $1 billion worth of BTC within the next six months. Besides, Japanese Bitcoin aggressive accumulator Metaplanet is seeking to issue 385 million new shares through an overseas offering for additional BTC purchases. The 6 th largest Bitcoin corporate investor aims to raise ¥212.9 billion ($1.44 billion) in its latest equity offering.

But for new investors coming in in 2025, ETH’s growth rate seems too modest. They don’t want a small 2x or 3x; they want the next 60x chance. Insiders now say that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which costs only $0.035, could be the token that offers that kind of potential by combining DeFi dynamics with institutional-grade safety. Why ETH investors are diversifying into MUTM Ethereum (ETH) is still a key part of decentralized finance, but its market value and popularity have already made it too expensive for new investors to get the huge returns they want. Traders who have been around for a long time are now looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because it has the same reputation and growth potential that ETH used to have. The project has already passed a CertiK audit, getting a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78. These scores provide institutions with the confidence they need to invest. To build trust, Mutuum has also started a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program that rewards security testers for making the platform stronger before it goes live. The entry point is significantly better for retail investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, which means this is one of the last times you can buy at a bargain before the price goes up. Ethereum (ETH) never provided retail investors such a clear early entry, but MUTM makes sure that both whales and smaller buyers can see what’s going on before large listings happen. Stable interest rate model and DeFi risk controls The creative way that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) approaches lending markets is what makes it work. Unlike platforms with variable interest rates that can change at any time, Mutuum has a steady interest rate model. People who borrow money will know exactly when they have to pay it back, which is something that traditional banks often don’t offer. The reserve factor, which is used on a per-asset basis, adds another layer of protection. Tokens that are safer will have lower reserves, about 10%, while tokens that are riskier will have up to 35%. This keeps both liquidity suppliers and borrowers safe when the market is having a hard time. By putting these procedures in place, Mutuum makes one of the most efficient and fair loan systems since Compound (COMP) and Aave (AAVE) came out, while also fixing the problems that both platforms had throughout time. Interest models are just one part of risk controls. To protect against overexposure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will impose limits on how much money may be borrowed, enforce rigorous loan-to-value ratios that change with the volatility of the assets, and add a restricted collateralization option to keep systemic risk under check when things are unstable. This means that the protocol will keep running properly even when the market is going crazy, such as when the price of the digital currency suddenly drops. Presale momentum and community hype Numbers already show significant belief. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $15.51 million, gotten more than 16,200 holders, and 35% of Phase 6 is already set aside. The next automatic price rise will raise the token’s price from $0.035 to $0.040, which makes people feel more urgent. Every phase that is finished means that investors who wait will have to pay more, while early buyers will get a discount before the listings on exchanges. To get more people involved in the community, the project is giving away $100,000 to token holders, with ten people getting $10,000 in MUTM apiece. These programs, together with the security-focused Bug Bounty Program, mix excitement with responsibility, encouraging both grassroots development and institutional acceptance. Analyst projection: why 60x is on the table Analysts who think Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be worth 60x its current value are not making guesses; they are looking at concrete facts. SHIB went up 1000x because of memes, while Ethereum (ETH) went up much more by constructing important infrastructure. Mutuum combines the best of both worlds: the community momentum of SHIB and the financial usefulness of ETH. When MUTM goes up 60x, it will be worth $2.10. This is a reasonable goal given the presale interest, predicted future listings, and demand from its stablecoin and staking systems. More significantly, every buyback paid for by platform income will create steady buying pressure, which will lock in long-term growth instead of short-term excitement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tells a different story for investors who want to know why crypto goes down when the market goes down. Its design makes sure that usefulness drives demand, even when people aren’t feeling good about it. People who have owned MUTM for a long time can be sure that the company is not just following trends but changing how DeFi works to make it expand over time. Ethereum (ETH) has already had its crazy decade. Investors who want to know if crypto is a solid investment right now should know that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is just starting out. Phase 6 pricing is the last chance to get in at a discount before the next 15% hike. People who buy at $0.035 aren’t trying to get back to the past; they’re getting ready for the next 60x tale of this cycle.

Get ready for a significant event in the crypto world! Binance, the leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has officially announced the upcoming Binance HOLO listing . This highly anticipated move marks HOLO as the 38th project selected for Binance’s exclusive HODLer Airdrop program, creating immense buzz among investors and enthusiasts alike. This article delves into what this listing means for the future of decentralized applications and the broader crypto ecosystem. What Does the Binance HOLO Listing Entail? Binance’s decision to list HOLO (HOT) on its platform is a major development for the project. The exchange will officially list HOLO on September 11 at 12:00 p.m. UTC. This means users will soon be able to trade HOLO against various cryptocurrencies, significantly increasing its accessibility and liquidity. Increased Visibility: A listing on Binance provides unparalleled exposure to millions of global traders. Enhanced Liquidity: Expect higher trading volumes and easier execution of buy and sell orders. Broader Adoption: The listing legitimizes HOLO further, potentially attracting new investors and developers to the Holochain ecosystem. The Significance of the HODLer Airdrop Program HOLO’s selection as the 38th HODLer Airdrop project is a testament to its growing community and innovative technology. This program rewards users who hold specific cryptocurrencies on Binance by distributing new tokens. For HOLO, this means existing holders are directly benefiting from its integration into Binance’s ecosystem even before the full trading begins. The HODLer Airdrop initiative by Binance aims to foster long-term holding and engagement within the crypto community. By distributing tokens to loyal holders, Binance encourages stability and rewards commitment, aligning with the core principles of many decentralized projects. Why is Holochain Gaining Traction? Holochain offers a truly unique approach to decentralized applications (dApps) that significantly differs from traditional blockchain technology. Instead of a global, ever-growing ledger that every participant must validate, Holochain uses a distributed hash table (DHT) where each agent runs their own chain. This architectural choice promises several compelling advantages for developers and users: Unprecedented Scalability: Holochain is designed to scale more efficiently as more users join the network, avoiding the common bottlenecks and performance issues often seen in monolithic blockchains. Resource Efficiency: By minimizing global consensus requirements, it can dramatically reduce computational overhead, leading to faster, more sustainable, and highly resource-efficient applications. True User Sovereignty: Users retain greater control over their data and applications, fostering genuine decentralization and empowering individuals with digital autonomy. This innovative framework is poised to support a new generation of peer-to-peer applications, ranging from secure social media platforms to transparent supply chain management systems. The Binance HOLO listing is therefore a pivotal moment, not just for the token, but for increasing the visibility and adoption of this groundbreaking technology. What Should HOLO HODLers and Traders Consider? For current HOLO holders, the upcoming listing on Binance could introduce increased market volatility. While a listing on a top-tier exchange often leads to initial price appreciation due to heightened demand and exposure, cryptocurrency markets are inherently unpredictable. New traders, especially, should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions. To navigate this exciting period, consider these actionable insights: Stay Critically Informed: Consistently monitor official announcements from both Binance and the Holochain development team. Reliable information is key to making informed choices. Implement Robust Risk Management: Understand that crypto markets are subject to rapid price swings. Never invest capital that you cannot comfortably afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders. Adopt a Long-Term Vision: Beyond short-term price fluctuations, evaluate Holochain’s fundamental technology, its development roadmap, and its potential for long-term impact on the decentralized web. This perspective often provides a clearer view of its intrinsic value. The Binance HOLO listing is undoubtedly a landmark event for the Holochain project and its vibrant community. By bringing HOLO to one of the world’s largest exchanges, Binance is not only providing enhanced accessibility but also signaling confidence in Holochain’s innovative approach to decentralized computing. This development could pave the way for broader adoption and further advancements in the dApp space, solidifying HOLO’s position as a project to watch. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When will HOLO be listed on Binance? A1: HOLO will be officially listed on Binance on September 11, 2024, at 12:00 p.m. UTC. Q2: What is the Binance HODLer Airdrop program?

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are still the most important coins in the market, but their prices make it hard for new people to buy them in large amounts. That’s why more and more people are looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently on sale for $0.035. It offers real DeFi use cases that are meant to give returns that are much higher than what established market leaders can offer, all at a low price. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) balances utility and risk Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi lending protocol that has features that connect usage to token demand. It offers structured financing through both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer settings, which is different from a lot of speculative crypto coins. In one peer-to-contract case, an investor who puts in $30,000 worth of BNB will be able to borrow $19,500 in USDC at a 65% loan-to-value ratio. If the pool is used 75% of the time and has a 10% annual rate, the lenders in that pool will get about $3,000 every year. That kind of predictable success makes it stand out for professional crypto investors. The peer-to-peer system will take care of tokens that are more unstable, like SHIB and TRUMP. Lenders and borrowers talk to each other directly here, which is riskier but also has more potential for reward. These assets are kept separate from the main pools so that changes in value don’t affect the whole system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more flexible and stronger than many other projects that just use one type of structure, since it uses a hybrid model. One of the best things about it is how it deals with market volatility. Tokens that are already well-known, like ETH, BTC, or stablecoins, can allow loan-to-value ratios of up to 75%, with liquidation criteria set at 80%. This gives consumers a lot of borrowing power without putting the system at risk. On the other hand, more volatile assets, like PEPE, would have a maximum LTV of 35–40% and liquidation triggers at 65%. This will lower the chances of undercollateralization during rapid decreases. A reserve factor system takes a little amount of interest income, about 10% for safer assets and up to 35% for riskier ones, to help keep the protocol healthy. This balance makes sure that the platform will be able to handle shocks without putting its solvency at risk in the event of a downturn. Presale traction and the path ahead The presale data show why investors see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the cheapest cryptocurrencies with potential upside, even though its architecture sets it apart. In Phase 6, the initiative has now raised almost $15.51 million, and 35% of the 170 million tokens set up for this stage have been sold. Before the formal launch, more than 16,200 people had already joined, which is a lot. The price is currently $0.035, and investors only have this time frame before Phase 7, which guarantees a 15% rise in price, bringing the price up to $0.040. Before the launch, trust and safety are also being strengthened. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has passed a CertiK audit with a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. The initiative has also started active efforts, such as a $100,000 giveaway and a $50,000 bug bounty program that awards testers at four levels of severity. More than 12,000 people who follow the company on Twitter are already interacting with updates, which shows that interest is building even before the beta release. The upside is evident when you look at examples of investments. A Phase 1 buyer who traded $4,000 worth of BTC for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.01 now possesses $14,000 at the current price of $0.035. When the token goes up to $0.06, that holding will be worth $24,000. The beta launch will happen at the same time as the exchange launch, which should speed up acceptance and increase future returns as usage drives demand. This development demonstrates why a lot of people think that $0.035 is like buying Bitcoin for $200 today. The roadmap is just as ambitious and well-thought-out as it is now. Integrating Layer-2 will save expenses by a huge amount and speed up transactions, making the platform more competitive than earlier Layer-1 frameworks. There is also a native stablecoin in the works, which will make liquidity even more stable and useful. Lastly, the project wants to get listed on big exchanges, including Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, Kraken, and MEXC. Visibility on each of these listings will bring millions of new users to the platform, which will then drive up demand for its token. Affordable entry with big potential If you’re looking for the cheapest cryptocurrency with the most growth potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out. It’s not just another cheap token; it’s a utility-backed initiative with safety features, goals for adoption, and ways to drive demand that will make it worth millions of dollars in the next cycle. Phase 6 is now 35% sold, and the price will go up for Phase 7. This means that the time to get in is running out. At $0.035, this is a good price to get in at, and tiny investments might result in big profits. If you want to invest in crypto, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a good way to get in on the ground floor before the protocol goes live in beta, gets listed on exchanges, and sees a surge in demand due to its usefulness.

ADA is still a renowned network, but its token performance has leveled off, leaving many people wondering where the next big wave of profits will come from. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is doing very well in its presale, having already raised $15.51 million. The target price of $1 is 28.6x the current price of the token, which means it may go up by 2760%. For investors looking at today’s crypto values, this kind of trend shows where the true energy lies in the market. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has clear traction toward $1 Not only has Mutuum Finance (MUTM) been able to raise money, but its platform is also well-designed. This DeFi protocol was made to blend safety with innovation, unlike older players that have trouble with scalability and demand saturation. Its stablecoin lending system will use a predictable interest rate model that makes borrowing less risky and lending more certain. On top of that, the platform will soon add a buy-and-distribute feature that will use protocol earnings to buy tokens from the open market regularly. These tokens will subsequently be given to people who stake mtTokens, which will keep purchase pressure on the market and tie incentives directly to the growth of the ecosystem. Investor math shows how different the chances are. A person who took part in Phase 1 and put down $5,000 at $0.01 got 500,000 tokens. This stake will be worth $500,000 at the $1 objective. Even if the price for Phase 6 is now $0.035, a $3,500 entrance gets you 100,000 tokens, which is the same as $100,000 at the same milestone. Experts are now including Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in their projections for the future of crypto as one of the most asymmetric trades of 2025. This math backs up their claims. The presale itself is another proof that it is getting a lot of attention. Of the 170 million tokens set up for Phase 6, customers have already bought 35% of them. The group is growing and presently has more than 16,200 members. CertiK has confirmed Security diligence, giving it a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. The project has also been reviewed by auditors from February to May 2025 to make sure it meets high standards before going live. The presale creates a sense of urgency because the token price will go up 15% to $0.040 once Phase 7 starts, which will lower the discount that is currently available. Scalability is another thing that makes people feel good about themselves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on a Layer-2 solution that will make transactions cheaper and faster for both borrowers and lenders. This means that when the beta goes live with the token listing, users will be able to make transactions swiftly and cheaply, which is a must for DeFi to become widely used. Community strength will drive the next wave Community support and technology both help crypto gain momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is backing this up with plans that make sure everyone stays safe and has fun. To get more people to know about and take part in the project, there is a $100,000 giveaway . There is also a $50,000 Bug Bounty program with tiered payouts that will make sure that outside engineers thoroughly test the system before and after it goes live. These combined initiatives strike a compromise between community involvement and institutional-level security. This blend appeals to both early adopters and larger funds looking into DeFi allocations. Timing is very important for investors who want to put money into crypto with a good chance of making money. ADA isn’t moving much in the short term, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised $15.51 million and is getting set to debut with features that drive utilization into token demand. The presale price of $0.035 won’t be open for long because Phase 6 is already one-third of the way done, and the next price tier is coming up soon. As crypto values keep changing and news stories guess where the next bull run will come from, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting ready with a mix of stablecoin mechanics that are easy to understand, constant buying pressure, and Layer-2 scalability. The arithmetic is easy, the plan is simple, and the presale is quickly picking up speed. The $1 aim for MUTM becomes more and more achievable as ADA stabilizes. Those who act before the Phase 7 increase will get the last cheap entry before demand picks up when the market becomes more widely known.

Fraud Scandal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-atm-athena-indicted/,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Warning: Crypto ATM Operator Athena Bitcoin Indicted in D.C. Fraud Scandal The world of digital assets often brings exciting innovations, but it also carries its share of risks. Recently, a significant development has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community: Washington D.C. prosecutors have indicted Athena Bitcoin, a prominent crypto ATM operator. This case underscores the crucial need for vigilance and robust regulation within the digital finance landscape. What Exactly Happened with This Crypto ATM Operator? According to a report by Cointelegraph, Athena Bitcoin faces serious allegations. Prosecutors claim that the company knowingly collected substantial fee revenue, even though a staggering 93% of deposits made through its machines were linked to fraud during its initial five months of operation. This isn’t just a minor oversight; it points to a potentially systemic issue within the company’s operations. The indictment suggests that the company was aware of the fraudulent activities yet continued to profit from them. This situation raises critical questions about the responsibilities of operators in the rapidly evolving crypto space. When a crypto ATM facilitates such a high volume of suspicious transactions, it impacts not only individual users but also the broader perception of digital currencies. Why Are Crypto ATMs a Target for Illicit Activities? Crypto ATMs offer a convenient way to convert cash into cryptocurrency and vice-versa, often appealing to users seeking quick transactions. However, this ease of access can also make them attractive to fraudsters. With approximately 26,850 crypto ATMs currently operating across the U.S., and Athena Bitcoin reportedly running 13% of them, their reach is considerable. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, combined with the relative anonymity that some ATM transactions can offer, creates a challenging environment for law enforcement. Scammers frequently exploit these machines by directing victims to deposit funds, often under false pretenses such as romance scams, imposter scams, or fake investment opportunities. The ability to quickly move funds across borders further complicates recovery efforts for victims. Moreover, the regulatory framework surrounding crypto ATM operations is still maturing. While some jurisdictions have implemented strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, others may have loopholes that bad actors can exploit. This uneven regulatory landscape contributes to the vulnerability of these systems. How Can Users Safely Navigate the Crypto ATM Landscape? Given the challenges, it is essential for users to exercise extreme caution when interacting with crypto ATMs . Protecting your assets and personal information should always be a top priority. Here are some actionable insights to help you stay safe: Verify the Operator: Always research the legitimacy and reputation of the crypto ATM operator before making any transactions. Check for reviews and official registrations. Be Skeptical of Unsolicited Advice: Never send money to someone you’ve only met online, especially if they pressure you to use a crypto ATM. Government agencies or reputable companies will never ask you to pay with cryptocurrency. Understand Transaction Limits and Fees: Be aware of the fees associated with crypto ATM transactions, as they can sometimes be higher than online exchanges. Understand any daily or per-transaction limits. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a suspicious machine or believe you have been targeted by a scam, report it immediately to the authorities and the ATM operator. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common cryptocurrency scams and security best practices. Knowledge is your best defense against fraud. By taking these proactive steps, users can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to fraudulent schemes and contribute to a safer environment for digital asset transactions. The indictment of Athena Bitcoin serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing battle against financial crime in the digital age. It highlights the critical need for stricter oversight, enhanced security measures, and greater transparency from crypto ATM operators. For the cryptocurrency industry to thrive and gain mainstream trust, all participants must commit to upholding the highest standards of integrity and consumer protection. This case will undoubtedly influence future regulatory discussions and could pave the way for a more secure and accountable crypto ATM ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto ATM Fraud Q1: What is Athena Bitcoin accused of? A1: Athena Bitcoin is accused by Washington D.C. prosecutors of knowingly collecting substantial fee revenue despite 93% of its deposits being linked to fraud during its first five months of operation. Q2: How common is fraud with crypto ATMs? A2: While not all transactions are fraudulent, crypto ATMs have unfortunately become a common tool for scammers due to their ease of access and the perceived anonymity. Cases like Athena Bitcoin’s highlight the significant risks involved. Q3: Are all crypto ATMs unsafe? A3: No, not all crypto ATMs are unsafe. Many legitimate operators adhere to strict regulatory guidelines. However, users must always exercise caution, verify the operator’s credibility, and be aware of common scam tactics. Q4: What should I do if I suspect fraud at a crypto ATM? A4: If you suspect fraud, immediately stop the transaction, collect any transaction details or receipts, and report it to the ATM operator, local law enforcement, and relevant consumer protection agencies. Q5: How do regulators address crypto ATM fraud? A5: Regulators are increasingly implementing and enforcing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations for crypto ATM operators. They also work with law enforcement to investigate and prosecute fraudulent activities, aiming to create a more secure environment. The fight against fraud in the crypto space requires a collective effort.

This usually happens for two reasons: either they need cash (which isn't the case today), or they're profitable and anticipating a decline. But every time this has happened in the past, the price has been higher a month later,” Edwards said. Related News: List of Altcoins That Crypto Developers Focused On Most in the Last Week Published Meanwhile, analyst Joao Wedson highlighted a critical support level for Bitcoin. “If BTC falls below $110,400, we could see fear and wild swings in the crypto market next week,” Wedson said. Wedson also painted a positive picture for Dogecoin (DOGE). According to on-chain data, short-term investor demand is trending upward. Wedson stated, “In the past, Dogecoin has experienced strong bull rallies whenever this metric has risen. This indicator has been rising again in recent weeks, and if the trend continues, it could present a promising picture for memecoins.” *This is not investment advice.

The deal is projected to create one of the world’s largest publicly traded Bitcoin treasury businesses and will seek to raise as much as $1.5 billion to acquire Bitcoin assets. Shares of Asset Entities closed on Tuesday at 17% at $6.28, but soared to 35% after hours on the back of the shareholder approval news. The strong vote of confidence puts Asset Entities one step closer to its plan of becoming a leading Bitcoin treasury company. However, final approval, including Nasdaq’s sign-off on the listing application, is still pending. Asset Entities aims to raise $750 million via a private placement After the merger, which received strong support from Asset Entities’ shareholders, is complete, the company will rebrand as Strive, Inc. , but keep trading under the ASST ticker on Nasdaq. Matt Cole will step in as CEO and Chairman of the Board, while Arshia Sarkhani, who currently serves as President and CEO of Asset Entities, will be Chief Marketing Officer. Cole commented on the shareholders’ approval, “This shareholder approval is a defining moment in our mission to build a world-class Bitcoin Treasury Company. Our focus is on disciplined, long-term strategies designed to outperform Bitcoin itself over time and create perpetual shareholder value.” Sarkhani also shared that the company is excited about the approval, which he sees as a big step toward building one of the most successful Bitcoin treasury businesses and taking care of existing shareholders. Supported by the strong vote in favour of the merger from the shareholders of Asset Entities, the move is a strategic decision to make the company a leader in the cryptocurrency industry. The proposed $1.5 billion transaction consists of $750 million in public equity ( PIPE) financing alongside $750 million in potential warrant exercise. Strive, Inc. seeks to build sustainable shareholder value over the long term while building positions in businesses and ecosystems that can drive growth across the digital asset economy. Its zero-debt status also allows the company to compete favourably against peers in the fast-growth digital asset space. Strive targets distressed Bitcoin and tax-free swaps The companies first unveiled the merger in May, calling the reverse merger structure groundbreaking for enabling a tax-free Bitcoin-to-equity exchange under Section 351. At the time, Strive explained that it planned to use multiple strategies to build a large Bitcoin position while protecting shareholder value, using Bitcoin’s performance as the benchmark for deploying capital. It claimed the reverse merger will give it a competitive edge by allowing the company to raise capital through an unprecedented equity-for-bitcoin exchange. CEO Cole even stated that the deal would create a new way for early Bitcoin investors to put their gains to work. Instead of selling and paying taxes, they can swap Bitcoin for equity in a tax-free transaction after the merger. At the same time, the company revealed it would be looking at claims involving distressed Bitcoin, such as 75,000 BTC linked to the collapsed Mt. Gox exchange. The Bitcoin holdings of the now-defunct Japanese exchange have been a focal point in the crypto industry since 2014, when they were stolen and the exchange subsequently declared bankruptcy . According to a recent filing with the SEC, Strive said this would allow it to gain BTC exposure at a discount. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , the Ohio-based firm is teaming up with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to identify and acquire such claims. The filing highlighted the Mt. Gox bankruptcy estate, which holds around 75,000 Bitcoin, noting that these distressed and confirmed claims may come at a lower cost. It said, “This strategy is intended to allow Strive the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin exposure at a discount to market price, enhancing Bitcoin per share and supporting its goal of outperforming Bitcoin over the long run.” The firm, which launched its first ETF in 2022, oversees over $2 billion in assets. The company’s co-founder, biotech billionaire and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, is now a leading contender for Ohio’s 2026 gubernatorial race.

In the post , the analyst emphasized that Ripple had not yet taken the stage at Swell 2025, but that leaked information was already circulating regarding potential partnerships. According to the analyst, the historical pattern of XRP price movements around Swell events indicates that this year could be one of the most important in recent memory. The analyst’s message highlighted that in previous years, XRP had shown notable gains leading up to Swell 2025. The post recalled 2017, when XRP gained more than 200 percent ahead of the event, and 2018, when the asset doubled before Bill Clinton was announced as a keynote speaker. Ripple Van Winkle also pointed to the years 2023 and 2024, which showed price movements in advance of major announcements. The analyst suggested that this recurring trend makes 2025 a year where expectations are heightened, with the possibility of even larger gains if history repeats.

The analyst stated that XRP holders were reacting strongly to the spread of leaked details, noting that these leaks were gaining traction quickly. The remarks stressed that Swell is not just about promotion but has historically been the venue where Ripple introduces new corridors, partnerships, and integrations. According to the analyst, “every single year, it is the same story,” with XRP often moving in advance of the official announcements. The analyst revisited past examples, such as the 200 percent rally in 2017 and the pre-event doubling of XRP in 2018, framing these as evidence of a consistent pattern. Ripple Van Winkle then linked this history to the present, explaining that XRP often reacts to the anticipation of announcements in the weeks leading up to Swell. Speculation on Upcoming Developments Ripple Van Winkle pointed to leaks that hint at potentially significant announcements. Among the possibilities mentioned were U.S. corridors, ETF integrations, and even government partnerships. The analyst acknowledged that such claims might appear ambitious but stated that Ripple has a track record of turning speculation into tangible results. The remarks concluded with the view that if Ripple delivers on the rumors circulating ahead of Swell 2025, the implications could extend beyond short-term market movement. The analyst suggested that such announcements could play a role in reshaping narratives about the role of XRP in the global financial system . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple Van Winkle’s analysis underscored that anticipation surrounding Swell 2025 is building before the event has even begun. By linking the potential for new partnerships and integrations with XRP’s historical performance around previous Swell conferences, the analyst positioned this year’s event as a potentially defining moment. With leaks suggesting major developments, the expectation is that Ripple may once again use Swell as the platform to deliver announcements that influence both XRP’s price trajectory and broader discussions about its place in international finance.

Nasdaq To Back Gemini With Strategic Investment On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Nasdaq is set to invest $50 million in the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini Space Station Inc. in a private placement during the crypto exchange’s IPO, scheduled for September 12, 2025. The crypto exchange recently announced its plan to offer 16.7 million shares priced between $17 and $19 under the ticker name “GEMI,” with a potential raise of approximately $317 million. According to anonymous sources close to the matter, the strategic partnership will give Nasdaq’s clients access to Gemini’s custody and staking services. Meanwhile, the crypto exchange’s institutional clients will have access to the stock exchange’s Calypso platform for collateral management and tracking trading activity. The partnership is reportedly non-exclusive, and the company’s plans “are subject to market conditions and could change,” Reuters sources cautioned. According to the S-1 filing reviewed by Bloomberg, Gemini said it had entered into an agreement with Nasdaq for the purchase of its Class A common stock. The deal will close immediately after its offering and was “agreed at a per-share price equal to Gemini’s IPO price less underwriting discounts and commissions,” but will be subject to certain closing conditions. “We continue to expand our capabilities to serve our institutional clients and the broader investor universe as the regulatory landscape around crypto assets evolves,” a Nasdaq spokesperson told the news media outlet. Nasdaq’s Push For Tokenization The partnership with Gemini follows the American stock exchange’s push for tokenized securities. As reported by Bitcoinist, Nasdaq recently submitted a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enable the trading of tokenized versions of traditional stocks on its platform. Nasdaq President Tal Cohen highlighted the potential of integrating tokenization and blockchain technology with traditional market infrastructure, affirming that the fusion could offer significant advantages to both issuers and investors. Similarly, Kraken met with the SEC’s Crypto Task Force last month to discuss the tokenization of traditional assets, the possibility of a tokenized trading system in the US, the regulation of crypto assets, and the legal and regulatory framework for operating said system. Amid the industry’s momentum and favorable regulatory changes in the US, Coinbase has reportedly sought the SEC’s approval to offer tokenized stocks to its customers. Notably, the emerging sector is a “huge priority” for the exchange, Coinbase’s CLO Paul Grewal told Reuters in June. Nonetheless, some traditional players have shared their doubts about the sector. Recently, the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) called on securities regulators to crack down on tokenized equities, claiming that the blockchain-based tokens “create new risks for investors and could harm market integrity.” In a letter sent to multiple global regulators, the coalition expressed its concerns that these tokens “mimic” stocks without providing the same rights or trading safeguards. They also urged the watchdogs to apply securities rules to tokenized assets, clarify legal frameworks for ownership and custody, and prevent the tokens from being marketed as equivalent to stocks.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|gemini|gemini exchange|Gemini IPO|Nasdaq|Nasdaq CEO|tokenized equities|Tokenized stocks|US SEC,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-10 06:00:10

Analyst Says This Level Will Determine BTC’s Fate,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-breakdown-averted-analyst-says-this-level-will-determine-btcs-fate/,"After retesting the range lows, Bitcoin (BTC) has closed the week above a key area, momentarily preventing a breakdown to lower levels. Some market watchers suggested that reclaiming the local range highs this week will set the stage for another leg up, but an analyst warned of potential volatility in the coming days. Related Reading: Worldcoin Jumps 42% Following Eightco’s Announcement Of First WLD Treasury Strategy Bitcoin Holds Crucial Weekly Support As the market moves sideways, Bitcoin has continued to trade within its local range between the $108,250-$111,140 levels since the start of the month. The cryptocurrency has shown mixed signals since the second half of August, failing to hold the crucial $109,000 level during the previous week. Analyst Rekt Capital asserted that BTC was showing “early signs of weakness,” and could see a bearish confirmation if it failed to hold this key level in the weekly timeframe. However, the flagship crypto surged to the range’s high over the past few days and closed the week at around $111,137, averting the potential breakdown in the short-term timeframe. “Bitcoin indeed didn’t fully confirm the breakdown; instead, price has reclaimed the $109k level as support and is now trying to rally higher in an effort to check if $114k has turned into new resistance after being lost as support a few weeks ago,” the analyst noted. According to Rekt Capital, BTC’s retest of this level as resistance will be down to an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern forming on the daily timeframe, which has the $113,000 area as the pattern’s neckline. A daily close above this level could set Bitcoin up for a potential post-breakout retest of this zone, fueling a rally toward the key weekly resistance level. Ali Martinez also affirmed that breaking pass $113,000 would set the cryptocurrency “on track for $116,000 and possibly $119,000.” The New Key Pivot Point For BTC Rekt Capital highlighted that a daily close above this level would “also confirm that the price is going to occupy the upper half of the Daily Bollinger Bands,” as the middle band sits around the $112,000 level. “Turning the mid-point (orange) of the BBands into support tends to set price up for a move to the very top of the Upper Band, which happens to be around the $116k level,” he explained, noting that the upper band coincides with the Monthly Range High resistance level. The market watcher detailed that BTC has been consolidating within the Macro Monthly Range at $107,200-$115,711, recently bouncing from the range lows. As a result, its price “is now ready to try and challenge the Range High over time.” Bitcoin must close the week above $114,000 to retest the macro range high and build a base for a potential third Price Discovery Uptrend. “It’s all about $114k going forward as a key pivot point for price,” he concluded.

Expert Shares How Crypto ETFs, Treasuries Could Change The Market Notably, BTC attempted to break out of a key area on Tuesday morning, hitting the $113,000 mark before retracing to $110,000. Nonetheless, Ted Pillows warned that the cryptocurrency could face some volatility in the coming days as US CPI data is coming on September 11. He underscored that the last 3 CPI data resulted in a 9%-11% price drop for BTC, with August seeing the largest dip in the past few months. A similar correction could drive Bitcoin’s price to the $100,000 barrier, not seen since June. As of this writing, BTC trades at $111,276, a 1% decline in the daily timeframe.

Protocol Guild, a collective that funds around 190 Ethereum core contributors, released compensation data this week, revealing that salaries for these developers sit 50% to 60% below what they could earn elsewhere. The survey drew responses from 111 members across 11 organizations, making it the most comprehensive snapshot of pay in Ethereum’s core ecosystem to date. Only 37% Of Contributors Receive Tokens Or Equity Grants Median base pay landed at $140,000, while market offers hovered at $300,000 and averaged an eye-catching $359,000, laying bare the gulf in earnings. 1/ We are releasing the first-ever comp report for Ethereum core devs. Two striking takeaways: they pass up at least 50% of their market value to maintain existential industry software PG funding helps reduce this gap & retain talent long term ↓ Report & thread ↓ pic.twitter.com/FDZ5qYOfHH — Protocol Guild (@ProtocolGuild) September 9, 2025 One developer even reported turning down a jaw-dropping $700,000 package, choosing instead to stick with Ethereum’s core work despite the steep pay cut. The findings reflect a long-standing challenge. Unlike commercial crypto ventures that can issue tokens or equity, most client teams and research groups working on Ethereum core software cannot offer lucrative upside packages. Only 37% of contributors surveyed received any form of equity or token grants from their employers. For the majority, the answer was zero. Image Source: Protocol Guild That absence of upside stands in sharp contrast to the broader industry, where engineers at start-ups or exchanges often receive significant equity stakes or token allocations. Community Funding Offers Predictability Lacking In Traditional Employers In Ethereum’s case, the entities employing core developers are usually non-profits, academic institutions or foundations, and they lack the structure or business model to offer such incentives. Protocol Guild said it helps bridge part of the pay gap. Since its start in May 2022, it said it has distributed more than $33m, with much of the funding coming from projects that pledged 1% of their token supply, including EigenLayer, Ether.fi, Taiko and Puffer. The support vests onchain over four years, making the process visible and predictable. In the past year, the median contributor received $67,121 through this channel, which brought overall median compensation to $207,121. While still below market, it has eased some of the pressure. Client Developers And Coordinators Earn Well Below Research Roles The survey also revealed differences across roles. Researchers reported the highest median cash compensation at $215,000, while client developers and coordinators earned around $130,000. By experience, those with seven to eight years in the space had a median of $212,000, but the figure dropped to $150,000 for those with nine or more years. This pay structure places Ethereum in a difficult position as competition for blockchain engineering talent intensifies. Almost 40% of respondents said they had received final job offers from external employers in the past year. Many came from rival Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks that can afford higher packages. Devs Keep Building Even As Pay Trails Market The stakes are evident. Persistent underpayment could lead to higher churn, weaker institutional memory and slower progress on Ethereum’s upgrade roadmap. It could also make independent teams more vulnerable to acquisition or, in worst cases, undue external influence. Despite these challenges, many contributors remain motivated by values rather than financial upside. Several respondents said they chose to continue because they believed in Ethereum’s mission of decentralization, censorship resistance and credible neutrality, even if it meant earning less. Protocol Guild framed the report as a call to action. It said ecosystem funders should recognize undercompensation as a serious issue and work toward scalable solutions. Without stronger support, Ethereum risks losing the very people responsible for maintaining its infrastructure.

51483546,303454,1757484608,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/68/51483546.jpeg,MemeCore Launches Layer 1 Blockchain to Structure the Meme Coin Economy,https://chainwire.org/2025/09/09/memecore-launches-layer-1-blockchain-to-structure-the-meme-coin-economy/,"Panama City, Panama, September 9th, 2025, Chainwire MemeCore has officially launched its EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, introducing a structured framework to address persistent volatility and short-term speculation in the meme coin market. The project aims to reposition meme coins as digital assets that derive value from cultural contribution and on-chain activity. According to a study by Chainplay, 97% of meme coin projects fail within a year, with most created on automated platforms like Pump.fun disappearing within days. Despite these risks, meme coins have demonstrated outsized short-term performance. From January to May 2025, meme coins delivered an average return of 33.08%, the highest across major crypto categories. Against this backdrop, MemeCore’s mainnet launch proposes an alternative model to improve longevity and value creation in the meme coin space through its proprietary “Proof of Meme” (PoM) consensus mechanism and multi-layered incentive system. On-Chain Incentives and Cultural Value MemeCore’s network architecture is designed to quantify and reward the creation, remixing, and distribution of meme content. Each new meme coin minted on the platform generates a “Meme Vault”—a smart contract that acts as a reward pool to support the coin’s continued development and engagement. Participants earn $M tokens and MRC-20 meme tokens based on measurable contributions, moving beyond speculation toward sustained cultural involvement. The PoM consensus mechanism combines elements of Proof-of-Authority and delegated Proof-of-Stake, with validator roles rotated every 10 blocks. Validators are required to self-stake 7 million $M tokens, while delegators may stake either $M or whitelisted meme coins. Rewards are distributed across $M stakers (75%), meme token delegators (24%), and block proposers (1%). Tokenomics and Supply MemeCore’s native token, $M, has a capped supply of 10 billion, with 5 billion tokens currently issued. As of September 1, 2025, circulating supply stands at approximately 1.03 billion $M, with a market capitalization of $706 million and a fully diluted value of $6.79 billion. Token allocation emphasizes community alignment: 58% is allocated to community incentives, 15% to the foundation, 13% to core contributors, 12% to investors, and 2% to the Meme Treasury. Each new meme coin mints 5% of its supply into a vault with linear distribution over 1,000 days. Deflationary mechanisms include permanent burns from transaction fees and staking locks that reduce the liquid supply. Ecosystem Applications MemeCore supports a range of dApps and infrastructure services. MemeX allows no-code MRC-20 token creation with leaderboard features; PUPA enables rapid token and NFT generation; and Everyswap integrates Uniswap v3-based AMM functionality on the network. Additional infrastructure includes MemeCore Stake (multi-token delegation UI), MemeCoreScan (on-chain analytics), and developer tools like MemeCore Faucet and OKLink explorer services. Gaming integration is led by Memes. War, a Telegram-based play-to-airdrop platform. MemeCore also supports external dApp onboarding through its LIFT Ecofund, offering up to $100,000 in grants. Strategic Partnerships and Market Access MemeCore has secured strategic investments from Waterdrip Capital, AC Capital, IBC Ventures, and others. A partnership with the NEO blockchain enables joint development of cross-chain functionality for the PoM framework. PrestoLabs provides capital and regulatory support, while Meson Free Bridge facilitates native $M token bridging to BNB Chain. MemeCore’s token, $M, was simultaneously listed on several centralized exchanges on July 3, 2025, including Binance Alpha, Kraken, Bitget, BingX, HTX, MEXC, and Hashkey. On Bitget, 24-hour M/USDT trading volume reached $10.2 million; MEXC posted $3.2 million. $M is also traded on Uniswap v3 and PancakeSwap, with DEX liquidity concentrated in a $155,000 M/USDT pool. Derivatives trading is active across Binance, Bybit, KuCoin, Gate.io, and others, with daily futures volume exceeding $4 million. $M reached an all-time high of $1.15 on August 30, 2025—representing a 2,400% increase from its listing price. Community Engagement and Campaigns MemeCore’s marketing approach emphasizes community engagement through both online and offline initiatives. The “Trump Dinner” leaderboard campaign placed second in a $TRUMP token-based competition, involving a $17.5 million token purchase and over 3 million campaign participants. From June to July 2025, MemeX ran the “Proof-of-Shit” social campaign in collaboration with Kaito. The campaign topped Kaito’s mindshare leaderboard and distributed $700,000 to participating communities. Offline presence has included Token2049 in Dubai, KBW 2024 in Hong Kong, and participation in the upcoming KBW 2025 at Lotte World. About MemeCore MemeCore is a Layer 1 EVM-compatible blockchain purpose-built to support a structured, incentivized meme coin economy. The network introduces the Proof of Meme (PoM) consensus algorithm and features a multi-layered reward system that quantifies cultural and economic contributions. With tools for token creation, DeFi integration, and gaming, MemeCore aims to standardize and elevate meme coins as verifiable digital assets.

The company clearly stated its purpose: to acquire more BTC and fund its expanding Bitcoin-related business operations. Nakamoto Holdings’ participation directly supports this ambitious vision. Why Are Companies Like Metaplanet Embracing Bitcoin? The decision by companies to hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset is not just a passing trend; it reflects a strategic shift in how businesses perceive value and manage risk. For Metaplanet, integrating Bitcoin into its treasury offers several potential advantages: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against traditional fiat currency inflation. Growth Potential: Many believe Bitcoin offers significant long-term growth potential compared to other asset classes. Innovation & Brand Positioning: Adopting Bitcoin can position a company as forward-thinking and innovative, attracting a new demographic of investors and customers. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a company’s financial holdings. This strategic pivot by Metaplanet, bolstered by Nakamoto Holdings’ Bitcoin investment , signals a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream corporate finance, particularly in forward-looking markets like Japan. The Broader Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Investment Nakamoto Holdings’ decision to back Metaplanet underscores a larger narrative unfolding globally: institutional and corporate adoption of Bitcoin. This trend began with pioneers like MicroStrategy and Tesla and continues to expand as more companies recognize the digital asset’s potential. What does this mean for the wider market? Increased Legitimacy: Each new corporate Bitcoin investment adds legitimacy to the asset class, potentially encouraging more traditional investors. Market Stability: Large corporate holdings can contribute to greater market stability by reducing available supply and demonstrating long-term conviction. Regulatory Scrutiny: As more regulated entities engage with Bitcoin, it often leads to clearer regulatory frameworks, which can further de-risk the asset for others.

It’s a powerful example of cross-sector collaboration driving innovation. What Challenges Might Metaplanet Face? While the prospects are exciting, embracing a Bitcoin-first treasury strategy also comes with its own set of challenges. Volatility remains a primary concern for any company holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency. Market fluctuations can impact financial statements and require robust risk management strategies. Furthermore, regulatory environments can evolve rapidly, particularly in the crypto space. Companies like Metaplanet must remain agile and adaptable to ensure compliance. Despite these hurdles, the long-term strategic benefits often outweigh the risks for those committed to a bold vision for the future of finance.

For a blockchain explorer like Lineascan, this translates to: Enhanced Speed: Faster loading times and quicker data retrieval post-maintenance. Improved Reliability: Fewer outages and more consistent service in the future. New Features: Potential for new tools or functionalities that improve the user experience. Blockchain explorers are the backbone for developers, traders, and everyday users who need to verify transactions, track wallet balances, and monitor network activity. Ensuring Lineascan operates at its peak is vital for the entire Linea ecosystem. Navigating the Temporary Disruption: What Users Can Do While the Lineascan maintenance is in progress, it’s natural to seek information. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate this period: Stay Informed: Always check Lineascan’s official social media channels (e.g., Twitter, Discord) or their announcements page for the latest updates on the maintenance status. Official sources are your best bet for accurate information. Exercise Patience: Remember that these delays are temporary and part of a process to improve the service. Avoid making critical decisions based on potentially outdated data during this time. Consider Alternatives (if applicable): While Lineascan is the primary explorer, if you urgently need to verify a transaction, you might explore if there are any other community-driven or third-party explorers for the Linea network, though their data may also be impacted or less comprehensive. Always proceed with caution when using unofficial tools. Plan Ahead: If you have time-sensitive transactions or data needs, consider these potential delays in your planning for the next few hours or days. This proactive approach ensures you remain calm and informed throughout the maintenance period. The Bigger Picture: Importance of Reliable Blockchain Data The temporary disruption caused by Lineascan maintenance highlights the critical role that blockchain explorers play in the decentralized world. For developers, accurate and real-time data is essential for debugging smart contracts and monitoring dApp performance. For users, it’s about transparency and trust – knowing that their transactions are confirmed and visible on the immutable ledger. While an outage or delay can be inconvenient, it also serves as a reminder that even the most robust systems require occasional upgrades. The Linea network continues to process transactions, and this maintenance is merely enhancing the visibility of those operations. We can anticipate a smoother, more efficient Lineascan experience once the upgrades are complete. In conclusion, the ongoing Lineascan maintenance is a necessary step towards a more resilient and performant blockchain explorer.

Chainlink (LINK) was down 2% to $22.30 as selling pressure weighed on the token. The move comes at a time when derivatives activity in the asset has jumped sharply, raising both expectations of a rebound and the risk of further losses. Related Reading: Tighter Premiums Put Crypto Treasuries On Risky Road, According To NYDIG Institutional Pathway Through 21X The network’s importance was reinforced after the launch of 21X, Europe’s first regulated tokenized securities platform. Approved under European rules, 21X connects financial institutions to blockchain infrastructure using Chainlink’s technology. CEO Max Heinzle described Chainlink as a vital backbone for tokenized markets, stressing that global institutions are lining up behind tokenization projects. By building on a regulated platform, Chainlink gains credibility in bridging traditional finance with decentralized networks. Europe’s first regulated tokenized securities platform 21X: “The work that Chainlink is doing … with the involvement of the largest financial institutions in the world … could not be more at the forefront.” Discover how tokenization is reshaping capital markets and why… pic.twitter.com/3SlmcNaWsA — Chainlink (@chainlink) September 5, 2025 This development has been seen as a step toward establishing Chainlink as a core platform for tokenized assets. Its data feeds and interoperability features make it a practical link between standard securities and blockchain applications, adding momentum to its institutional appeal. Support And Resistance Levels In Focus Market watchers say LINK is testing major support at $22.10, with deeper support zones at $20.55 and $19. In a worst-case scenario, the coin could even revisit $17. On the upside, clearing the volume-weighted average price of $22.10 may open a path back to $24, and possibly $26, which marked the highs reached in August. At the time of writing, LINK was trading at $23.17, up 0.3% and 1.9% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. Derivatives Market Points To Heavy Speculation According to CoinGlass, LINK futures volume jumped 51% to over $2 billion. The increase in futures volume is in sync with open interest, whose numbers likewise soared over 2% to $1.5 billion. These increases show a sharp rise in speculative bets at current levels. Traders seem to be sitting tight, indicating anticipation of a decisive action over a pullback. Related Reading: Altcoins Feel The Pinch As Crypto Market Sentiment Sours There are warnings that the levels of leverage are so high that they will encourage volatility. If support is maintained, the bulls could be in charge to drive LINK to $26. But if it fails to hold present levels, liquidations and deeper losses could follow. The coming sessions will be crucial. Chainlink, viewed as both a token and a critical piece of market infrastructure, now faces a battle around $22. How the price reacts here could determine whether optimism around institutional adoption translates into a sustained recovery, or if traders brace for another correction.

Ripple To Provide Bitcoin, Ethereum Custody Services To BBVA Ripple, the blockchain firm behind the XRP token, today said it had partnered with BBVA to provide its digital asset custody solution to the bank. To recall, in July 2025, BBVA announced the launch of its Bitcoin and ETH trading and custody services for all retail customers in Spain. According to today’s announcement, Ripple will offer Ripple Custody – its institutional-grade digital asset self-custody technology – to BBVA to help it benefit from a scalable and secure custody service for tokenized assets, including digital assets. Cassie Craddock, Managing Director of Europe at Ripple, said that with the implementation of the European Union’s (EU) Market’s in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA) across the continent, it has become easier for the region’s banks to offer digital asset services to their customers . For the uninitiated, Europe’s MiCA is the EU’s comprehensive legal framework designed to regulate digital assets, stablecoins, and other related service providers across all member states. Ripple Custody will enable BBVA to meet rapidly increasing customer demand for access to digital assets such as BTC and ETH. At the same time, it will also ensure that the bank fulfills the strict regulatory, security, and operational requirements. Francisco Maroto, Head of Digital Assets at BBVA said: Ripple’s custody solution allows us to leverage proven and trusted technology that meets the highest security and operational standards, allowing BBVA to directly provide an end-to-end custody service to its customers. Through this agreement we can deliver on our goal of supporting our customers to explore digital assets, backed by the strength and security of a bank like BBVA. It is worth highlighting that the agreement between BBVA and Ripple is just the latest chapter in the relationship between the two entities. Ripple already provides crypto custody solutions to Turkey-based Garanti BBVA and BBVA Switzerland. Crypto Custody Solutions In Focus Over the past month, several developments have occurred in the industry pertaining to crypto custody solutions. For instance, recently Ripple joined forces with UAE-based Ctrl Alt to expand its crypto custody services. A favorable stance toward digital assets in the US is a key factor encouraging banks to offer crypto custody solutions to their clients. For example, US Bancorp recently resumed its Bitcoin custody services after a hiatus of three years. In similar news, the “big three” banking regulators in the US – namely the OCC, Federal Reserve, and FDIC – recently jointly issued guidance on how banks should approach the custody of digital assets. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $111,040, down 1.2% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto News|BBVA|bitcoin|blockchain|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Custody|crypto custody solutions|Cryptocurrency|ETH|Ethereum|ripple|Spain,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-10 07:00:52

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.8812 Market cap $880.28M Trading volume $275.12M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.9028 24-hour low $0.8559 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.66% 50-day SMA $0.9220 14-Day RSI 51.22 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 48 (Neutral) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.7754 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF shows signs of recovery but is capped by the $0.90-$0.92 resistance level. The coin’s daily support lies at $0.83. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart WIF has shifted to higher lows as of September 10 and is now trading at $0.884 after reclaiming the Bollinger mid-band at $0.831, which now acts as key support. The upper Bollinger Band near $0.920 is the next resistance; a daily close through it would mark a clean breakout. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview Volume picked up on the green candles, and MACD shows a fresh bullish cross below zero with a positive histogram; early but improving momentum. If buyers yield $0.831, WIF might charge downwards towards $0.742. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview On the 4-hour chart, WIF is consolidating just below $0.90 after an impulsive leg up, holding above the Alligator lines. OBV is rising and RSI sits around 62–65, supporting the current momentum, but without overbought conditions yet. A close above $0.90 would likely push for a test of $0.92. However, if WIF falls back under $0.852, it might just retest $0.83. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.8328 BUY SMA 5 $0.8295 BUY SMA 10 $0.8265 BUY SMA 21 $0.8421 BUY SMA 50 $0.9220 SELL SMA 100 $0.9123 SELL SMA 200 $0.7754 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7997 BUY EMA 5 $0.8040 BUY EMA 10 $0.8199 BUY EMA 21 $0.8544 BUY EMA 50 $0.8972 SELL EMA 100 $0.9035 SELL EMA 200 $1.0018 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? As long as WIF stays above $0.865–0.852, it looks like the market is just catching its breath before trying to break $0.90 again. If buyers can push through $0.92, the rally has room to run. But if support gives way, the price will likely cool off back toward $0.83 before making another attempt upward. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

The chart, set on a one-month timeframe, displays three major ranges. According to the analyst, XRP currently remains within what he describes as the undervalued red zone. Above this, the chart shows a dark green zone representing a price range of $4 to $45, and a light green zone suggesting a further extended target range of $45 to $250. In his accompanying post, CryptoBull wrote, “XRP is still within the undervalued red zone. Dark green price is $4-$45 and light green is $45-$250.” The chart visually emphasizes how XRP has traded within a lower accumulation range while also outlining possible future upside channels. These highlighted ranges are presented as potential long-term valuation zones if market momentum shifts decisively in favor of the asset. #XRP is still within the undervalued red zone.

Should this policy adjustment occur, it could support risk-on assets by reducing borrowing costs and increasing liquidity across financial markets. Lower interest rates often encourage capital to move into more speculative investments, including cryptocurrencies. For XRP, this macroeconomic backdrop could counteract what is typically regarded as a quieter trading period in September. While some traders anticipate muted activity in the short term, a rate cut could create conditions for earlier-than-expected upward movement. XRP Community’s Perspectives The post also drew attention from market participants, commenting on the potential effects of monetary policy. One user, KING XRP, remarked , “Hoping that it breaks to the upside, once fed cuts rates.” This reflects the sentiment among some holders who are closely watching how macroeconomic shifts might intersect with the technical picture presented by CryptoBull. In a previous report by Times Tabloid, CryptoBull was cited as having suggested that September may not deliver significant developments for XRP holders. However, he added that October could bring what he described as “fireworks,” pointing to the possibility of more pronounced volatility and upward price action later in the year. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Taken together, the chart shared by CryptoBull and the current macroeconomic environment underline the dual drivers influencing XRP’s potential path. On one side are technical projections suggesting long-term upside ranges as high as $250 if momentum continues building. On the other side is the influence of broader financial conditions, including Federal Reserve policy decisions that may accelerate or delay such moves. While September is being viewed with tempered expectations, both CryptoBull’s remarks and broader market analysis indicate that October could mark a more decisive period for XRP’s trajectory.

Posting on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump described Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “very good friend” and said they expect to talk in the “upcoming weeks.” India and the US are close friends and natural partners. I am confident that our trade negotiations will pave the way for unlocking the limitless potential of the India-US partnership. Our teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest. I am also looking forward… pic.twitter.com/3K9hlJxWcl — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) September 10, 2025 “I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations. I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post. “I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!” Trump walks back comment on losing India and Russia to China Earlier in the week, Xi convened more than 20 leaders from non-Western nations, including Modi and Putin, for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin, a Chinese port city. The trip was Modi’s first to China in seven years and suggested a possible easing of tensions between the two Asian neighbors. “Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!” Trump wrote on social media, sharing a photograph showing Modi alongside Xi and Putin. Later on Friday, pressed by reporters about the remark, Trump moderated his tone and said he did not believe the US had lost India to China. “I don’t think we have,” he said. “I’ve been very disappointed that India would be buying so much oil, as you know, from Russia. And I let them know that.” Trump also highlighted his personal bond with the Indian leader. He said he “will always be friends with Modi” and said “India and the United States have a special relationship.” He added, “There is nothing to worry about.” Trump wants EU to impose 100% tariffs on India and China over Russia ties The US president has voiced frustration at not being able to broker an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, now more than three years after Russian forces crossed the border. Continued fighting and strikes have made prospects for talks harder. In an effort to increase pressure on Moscow, Trump has asked the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on India and China, according to the Financial Times citing officials familiar with the discussion. He made the request after joining by phone a Tuesday meeting in Washington where senior US and EU officials weighed steps to raise the war’s economic cost for Russia. “We’re ready to go, ready to go right now, but we’re only going to do this if our European partners step up with us,” one US official said, describing the tariff plan. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, Trump has already promised to punish India “substantially” for its relations with Russia. A second US official said Washington would be prepared to “mirror” any EU tariffs on China and India, a move that could push US duties on imports from both countries even higher. “The president came on this morning and his view is that the obvious approach here is, let’s all put on dramatic tariffs and keep the tariffs on until the Chinese agree to stop buying the oil. There really aren’t many other places that oil can go,” the first US official said. Later on Tuesday, Trump told reporters he expected to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin “this week or early next week.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Economy|CNY|INR|RUB|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|MACROECONOMICS|COMMODITY|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-10 07:17:52

Then you’ll want to pay close attention to a recent, urgent announcement. Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has confirmed an upcoming Binance delisting event that could impact your portfolio. What’s Happening with the Binance Delisting? Binance recently shared crucial news regarding specific spot trading pairs. Specifically, the exchange will be delisting the SOPH/BNB and 1000CAT/BNB spot trading pairs. This action is scheduled to take place at 3:00 a.m. UTC on September 12th . For traders holding these assets or actively involved in these pairs, this announcement signals a critical deadline. It’s essential to understand that once a pair is delisted, you will no longer be able to trade it on Binance’s spot market. What does this mean for your assets? While the trading pairs are removed, your underlying assets (SOPH, 1000CAT, and BNB) remain in your wallet. However, their liquidity and ease of exchange on Binance will be significantly affected. Why Do Binance Delisting Events Occur? It’s natural to wonder why an exchange like Binance decides to delist certain trading pairs. The decision behind a Binance delisting is often a multi-faceted process, driven by various factors designed to protect users and maintain a healthy trading environment. Here are some common reasons: Poor Liquidity: If a trading pair consistently experiences low trading volume, it can lead to poor liquidity. This makes it difficult for users to buy or sell at fair prices, causing significant price slippage. Project Performance & Health: Binance continuously reviews projects listed on its platform. Factors like a lack of development activity, an unresponsive team, or failure to meet regulatory requirements can trigger a review. User Safety & Security: If a project is deemed to pose a security risk, has been involved in illicit activities, or shows signs of market manipulation, Binance will act swiftly to protect its users. Regulatory Compliance: The crypto landscape is constantly evolving, with new regulations emerging globally. Exchanges must comply with these rules, which can sometimes necessitate the removal of certain assets or pairs. While Binance has not provided specific reasons for the SOPH/BNB and 1000CAT/BNB delisting, these general criteria offer insight into such decisions. What Should Traders Do After a Binance Delisting? When faced with a Binance delisting , taking immediate and informed action is crucial. Here’s a breakdown of steps you should consider: Evaluate Your Holdings: Check your Binance wallet for any SOPH or 1000CAT tokens. Determine if you have open orders for these pairs. Cancel Open Orders: Any open spot orders for SOPH/BNB and 1000CAT/BNB will be automatically canceled once the delisting occurs. However, it’s a good practice to cancel them manually beforehand to retain control. Consider Your Options: Sell Before Delisting: If you wish to exit your position, you can sell your SOPH or 1000CAT tokens against BNB before the September 12th deadline. Withdraw to Another Exchange/Wallet: If you believe in the long-term potential of these projects, you might consider withdrawing your tokens to a personal wallet or another exchange where they are still traded. Research other exchanges to confirm their listing status. Convert (if available): In some cases, Binance might offer a conversion option for delisted assets, though this is not always guaranteed and specific to the asset. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Binance and the respective project teams for any further updates or recommendations. Acting promptly will help you minimize potential losses and manage your assets effectively. Navigating Future Binance Delisting Announcements The crypto market is dynamic, and delistings are a part of its evolution. To navigate future announcements effectively, consider these proactive strategies: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across various assets and even exchanges can mitigate the impact of a single asset’s delisting. Stay Updated: Regularly check official Binance announcements and reliable crypto news sources. Timely information is your best defense. Understand Project Fundamentals: Before investing, research a project’s whitepaper, development roadmap, community engagement, and team. Strong fundamentals often indicate greater resilience. Set Alerts: Use portfolio trackers or news aggregators to receive alerts on your holdings. By adopting a vigilant and informed approach, you can better prepare for and react to market changes, including any future Binance delisting decisions. Conclusion The upcoming Binance delisting of SOPH/BNB and 1000CAT/BNB spot trading pairs on September 12th is a significant event for affected traders. While such actions can seem disruptive, they are often part of an exchange’s commitment to maintaining a robust and secure trading environment.

Among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making a name for itself with its pioneering mechanism and expanding ecosystem designed to revolutionize DeFi lending. Mutuum Finance presale is already in Phase 6 with tokens going at $0.035. MUTM has exceeded 15,500,000 in raised funds while investors with a stake in the project surpass 16,150. While incumbents like Ethereum (ETH) continue to provide a strong basis for blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts, the hype surrounding MUTM speaks to growing demand for disruptive, yield-generating platforms that may thrive in the next market cycle. Ethereum Trades Around $4,306 Amid October Market Expectations Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced at $4,306.56. ETH has lately consolidated with no major price swings since peaking at $4.9k. Analysts say a push above the $4,450–$4,500 area could indicate further bullish momentum, while the current network upgrades and increasing institutional interest in it continue to support its long-term outlook. Meanwhile, new decentralized finance projects like Mutuum Finance are starting to attract more market notice. Mutuum Finance: Risk Controls and Protocol Protection Mutuum Finance employs robust risk parameters for every underlying asset. These include overcollateralization measures, deposit and borrowing limits, and established collateral thresholds. Liquidators are incentivized to liquidate undercollateralized positions to maintain stability. For correlated assets, increased collateral efficiency facilitates increased borrowing power, while Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios cap borrowing against collateral. Liquidation thresholds and penalties safeguard the protocol and incentivize timely action. Reserve factors serve as a buffer for defaults and tail market events, with higher reserves being allocated to riskier assets. Stage 6 Token Presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance already has over 16,150 investors and has raised over $15.5 million in its presale. To enhance the security of the platform and promote community participation, the project is running a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, where spotting bugs is being awarded in four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low. Adaptive Interest Rate Mechanism Mutuum Finance has a variable interest rate style. When there is high liquidity, borrowing rates are low; when there is low liquidity, the rates are high to discourage excessive borrowing. The system operates to either encourage borrowers to repay loans or encourage new deposits to re-balance the system. Increased Security Through Strict Lending Policies There are strict controls over all the assets in Mutuum Finance. Some of them are supply caps, borrowing caps, and collateral caps. The protocol is made resistant to market volatility through overcollateralization, and incentivized liquidators stabilize undercollateralized loans. Exposure to risky or illiquid assets is reduced through lending and borrowing caps, which lowers the risk of insolvency. Correlated assets are given elevated collateral efficiency, while riskier tokens have reduced collateral availability. Before the end of the presale, 10 participants will be awarded an extra $10k MUTM each as part of an ongoing $100,000 giveaway . Market Volatility and Asset Liquidity There must be sufficient on-chain liquidity such that stressed positions are liquidated with minimal slippage. Liquidation levels and parameters moderate exposure, with more incentive paid to liquidators the less liquidity there is. Asset volatility dictates Loan-to-Value ratios and liquidation levels: less volatile assets can collateralize more LTVs and more levels, and volatile assets more conservative ones. Risk ratings also dictate reserve factors, security protocol safety for mass participation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining traction as the market gets ready for an October 2025 breakout, making itself known even among more prominent names like Ethereum (ETH). Stage 6 tokens are still $0.035, with over $15.5M raised and 16,150+ holders already secured. The next stage will increase the price, giving earlier buyers even more upside. Secure your Stage 6 allocation today before the price is raised.

From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,654.04 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data.

As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. Heading into September, BNB is trading at approximately $854.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-10 07:35:13

Key Takeaways: DC Attorney General sues Athena Bitcoin for enabling scams and hiding fees as high as 26%. 93% of Athena’s DC ATM deposits were linked to fraud, targeting mostly elderly victims. The firm is accused of deceptive practices and failing to prevent exploitation through its crypto kiosks. In a lawsuit filed Monday , DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb claimed that 93% of Athena’s deposits during its first five months of operation in DC were the direct result of scams. Athena Bitcoin Charged Fees of Up to 26% The company allegedly charged victims undisclosed fees of up to 26% per transaction, while failing to implement proper safeguards against fraud. “Athena knows that its machines are being used primarily by scammers yet chooses to look the other way so that it can continue to pocket sizable hidden transaction fees,” Schwalb said in a statement. The lawsuit comes amid a growing national crackdown on crypto ATM fraud. The FBI logged nearly 11,000 complaints in 2024, amounting to over $246 million in losses. Multiple states, including Arizona, Colorado, and Michigan, have enacted transaction caps in an attempt to curb abuse. Schwalb’s filing alleges Athena misled customers by referring to a “Transaction Service Margin” in its Terms of Service, without clearly disclosing it was a fee. The firm is being charged with deceptive and unfair trade practices, and violating laws designed to protect elderly and vulnerable adults from financial exploitation. Between May and September 2024, Athena allegedly collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in hidden fees from scam victims in DC. NEW: We are suing Athena — a Bitcoin ATM company. DC seniors are being scammed out of life-changing amounts of cash. Athena is facilitating the scams, charging massive hidden fees, and refusing refunds. We're fighting to get victims their money back and hold Athena accountable. — AG Brian Schwalb (@DCAttorneyGen) September 8, 2025 The median victim age was 71, and the average loss per transaction was $8,000. One elderly resident reportedly lost $98,000 through a single scam conducted via an Athena kiosk. The attorney general’s office described Athena’s compliance measures as “ineffective,” accusing the firm of enabling an “unchecked pipeline for illicit international fraud transactions.” Schwalb urged the public to avoid sending funds via crypto ATMs to people they haven’t met, particularly those reached through unsolicited messages. Scammers often pose as tech support, investment advisors, or bank representatives to pressure victims into transferring funds. Athena currently operates 13% of crypto ATMs in the U.S., making it one of the industry’s largest players, behind Bitcoin Depot and CoinFlip, according to CoinATMRadar. More Countries Clamp Down on Crypto ATMs In Australia, AUSTRAC recently introduced stricter rules for crypto ATM operators, including tighter cash limits and monitoring. The regulator refused to renew the registration of a local crypto ATM operator , Harro’s Empires. The agency placed operating conditions, including transaction limits, on them. In the US, Spokane, Washington, has banned crypto ATMs entirely , citing their use in scams targeting vulnerable residents. Lawmakers in the US Senate are also attempting to tighten laws on a state and local level, with one attempt led by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin. He has introduced the Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act, which would bring in legislative measures designed to protect the public — while attempting to limit inconvenience for law-abiding users. New users would be prevented from spending more than $2,000 a day at one of these machines, rising to $10,000 in a 14-day period. Operators would also need to have a detailed conversation whenever a new user is trying to complete a transaction with a value of over $500.

XRP Eyes Explosive Move After Triangle Breakout,https://cryptopotato.com/major-ripple-rally-ahead-xrp-eyes-explosive-move-after-triangle-breakout/,"TL;DR XRP approaches triangle resistance at $2.95, with $3.60 as the next technical target. Futures open interest hits $7.94B, reflecting high trader positioning ahead of key move. 280-day consolidation may end soon as the price compresses and the volume setup builds. XRP Price Nears Key Technical Level XRP is trading around $2.95, positioned near the top of a descending triangle that has formed on the 12-hour chart. The setup shows horizontal support at $2.75 and a downward trendline from late July to early September. The current structure signals a potential breakout as the price presses against resistance. According to analyst Ali Martinez, If $XRP breaks out of this descending triangle, the next target is $3.60. pic.twitter.com/KdRlXLbog0 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 9, 2025 Fibonacci levels between $3.10 and $3.40 show possible checkpoints before the price reaches that level. These areas could act as temporary resistance if the breakout continues . A brief retest near $3.00 could follow, based on historical chart behavior. Meanwhile, failure to break above the triangle could send the ассет back toward $2.75. A move below $2.65 would cancel the bullish setup. Market Still Lacks Strong Confirmation Technical analyst CRYPTOWZRD reported that XRP’s daily candle closed without a clear direction. “We will have to wait for the next healthy price action to get the next mature chart formation,” he noted. The daily chart shows XRP trading just above the lower-high trendline, but the move lacks volume confirmation. They would monitor the chart for entries above $3.13, with an earlier possibility near $3.05 if the market shows signs of stability. The analyst also confirmed that his current position is already secured. Lower time frames showed inconsistent momentum during the day, and further moves depend on clean structure and volume. Without it, new positions remain on hold. Futures Traders Position for Movement Data from Coinglass shows that XRP Futures Open Interest stands at $7.94 billion. This is a sharp increase compared to earlier months, where figures stayed below $2 billion. The rise reflects strong participation from derivatives traders. Source: Coinglass A spike in open interest shows many contracts remain active, but it does not indicate direction. It does show that traders are preparing for volatility after an extended quiet period in price action. Trader Galaxy commented , “Pure consolidation for over 280 days in the $2-3 range, and running out of space to compress.” The chart shows XRP has moved mostly sideways within this zone since late last year. Notably, this compression near resistance and rising open interest are signals that traders are watching for a breakout. The next few sessions will be critical as price tests the upper edge of the triangle. The post Major Ripple Rally Ahead?

The outburst followed last week’s report from the SEC’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) on a year’s worth of missing texts from Gensler’s government-issued smartphone. Gary Gensler might go down as the worst SEC chair in history. The loss of nearly a year’s worth of text messages during his tenure is just another example of the less-than-honest behavior that marked the Biden administration. https://t.co/B1JF2mpAtV — Tom Emmer (@GOPMajorityWhip) September 9, 2025 Missing Message Scandal The SEC watchdog revealed that the IT department mistakenly wiped Gensler’s messages, erasing records tied to crypto enforcement actions and transparency. The data loss was exacerbated by poor change management, inadequate backups, ignored system alerts, and unaddressed vendor software flaws, it stated. Around 1,500 messages from colleagues and other records were recovered, and around 38% of them concerned critical SEC action and conversations about suing digital asset platforms during the Biden administration’s war on crypto . Emmer said it was “just more fuel for the fire that he was running his own show.” “I would argue that he was less than honest all the way through and this, this just smells. It smells when they talked about wanting to have a transparent, open-door policy. There’s nothing transparent about what that guy was doing.” Emmer concluded that the Trump administration is undoing “all of this garbage that we dealt with for the last four years.” This is just another example of less-than-honest behavior by the Biden administration, and in this particular case, “one of the worst bureaucrats that I’ve ever dealt with,” he said. Double Standards at the SEC At the same time the messages went missing – between October 2022 and September 2023 – the SEC cracked down on the use of messaging apps by banks and financial institutions. Several prominent investment banking and financial institutions, including Barclays, Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UBS Securities, and Cantor Fitzgerald, were charged with violating record-keeping and books-and-records laws under the Securities and Exchange Act. “Finance, ultimately, depends on trust. By failing to honor their recordkeeping and books-and-records obligations, the market participants we have charged today have failed to maintain that trust,” Gensler said at the time.

Recent market shifts suggest a critical period ahead for many ETH traders. A sharp decline in Ethereum’s trading volume is creating significant pressure, potentially forcing many to re-evaluate their leveraged bets. What’s Behind the Alarming Drop in ETH Volume? According to a recent analysis by cryptocurrency services provider Matrixport, the Ethereum market is facing a peculiar challenge. We’ve seen a dramatic decrease in ETH spot trading volume, plummeting from an astounding $122 billion to just $41 billion in a single week. This drastic reduction signals a notable cooling of trading activity. However, despite this significant drop in spot volume, futures open interest for Ethereum has remained relatively high. This creates a critical imbalance. When volume decreases but open interest stays elevated, it often means that fewer new participants are entering the market, while existing leveraged positions are still open. Why Are Your Ethereum Long Positions Under Strain? The combination of dwindling volume and sustained open interest places considerable strain on those holding leveraged ETH. Matrixport’s analysis suggests that this situation could compel some traders to abandon their Ethereum long positions . Essentially, with less liquidity and fewer buyers, it becomes harder for these positions to maintain profitability or even remain open without facing margin calls. This dynamic creates a challenging environment for those who have bet on Ethereum’s price increasing. Traders often rely on consistent market activity to manage their risk and execute their strategies. A lack of volume can lead to: Increased volatility and wider bid-ask spreads. Difficulty in exiting positions at desired prices. Higher risk of forced liquidations due to price swings against their leveraged bets. Understanding Investor Sentiment: The NAV Clue for ETH Holders Beyond the immediate trading dynamics, Matrixport also highlighted an interesting aspect of investor sentiment. The net asset value (NAV) of companies that strategically invest in ETH is currently hovering close to one. This metric offers a window into how investors perceive these specialized crypto investment vehicles. What does a NAV close to one signify? It indicates that investors are largely unwilling to pay a premium for the shares of these companies. In simpler terms, the market isn’t assigning extra value to the management or strategic holdings of these ETH-focused firms. This could reflect a broader cautious sentiment among investors regarding the short-term prospects of Ethereum and, by extension, the broader market for Ethereum long positions . This reluctance to pay a premium suggests that the market might be expecting a period of consolidation or even downward pressure for ETH. It’s a subtle but important signal that active traders and long-term holders should consider. Actionable Insights for Managing Ethereum Long Positions Given these market signals, what steps can traders holding Ethereum long positions take? Prudent risk management becomes paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Volume Closely: Keep a keen eye on ETH trading volume trends. A sustained lack of volume could signal continued pressure. Re-evaluate Leverage: Consider reducing leverage on existing long positions to mitigate liquidation risk. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Implement strict stop-loss orders to protect capital in case of adverse price movements. Diversify Portfolios: Avoid over-exposure to a single asset, even one as prominent as Ethereum. Stay Informed: Regularly review market analyses from reputable sources like Matrixport to understand evolving dynamics. The current market conditions, characterized by plunging ETH volume and stable futures open interest, present a challenging outlook for Ethereum long positions . While not a definitive prediction of price, these metrics strongly suggest a period of increased scrutiny and potential volatility. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the market effectively and protecting your investments. Staying informed and proactive will be key for any trader with exposure to Ethereum. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “plunging ETH volume” mean for the market? A1: Plunging ETH volume means significantly less trading activity. This can lead to lower liquidity, making it harder to buy or sell large amounts of ETH without impacting its price, and can increase volatility. Q2: How does stable futures open interest with low volume affect leveraged ETH positions? A2: When futures open interest remains high while spot volume drops, it suggests many leveraged positions are still open without new money flowing in. This creates an imbalance, increasing pressure on Ethereum long positions and potentially leading to forced liquidations if prices move unfavorably. Q3: What is NAV, and why is its value close to one significant? A3: NAV (Net Asset Value) represents the value of a company’s assets minus its liabilities. If the NAV of ETH-investing companies is close to one, it means investors aren’t willing to pay a premium for their shares, indicating cautious sentiment and potentially a lack of strong bullish conviction for Ethereum. Q4: What are the main risks for leveraged Ethereum long positions in this scenario? A4: The main risks include increased likelihood of margin calls and forced liquidations due to potential price drops, difficulty in exiting positions profitably due to low liquidity, and higher transaction costs from wider bid-ask spreads.

Just recently, BTC made headlines by soaring past the significant $112,000 mark, igniting optimism across the global financial landscape. This remarkable ascent is more than just a number; it represents a powerful shift in market dynamics and investor confidence. What’s Driving This Incredible Bitcoin Price Surge? According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC officially crossed the $112,000 threshold, trading at $112,002.61 on the Binance USDT market. This immediate jump has sparked widespread speculation about the underlying factors fueling such rapid growth. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet rewarding crypto space. Several key elements are often attributed to significant movements in the Bitcoin price surge : Increased Institutional Adoption: More large financial institutions are allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, seeing it as a legitimate store of value and a hedge against inflation. Growing Retail Investor Interest: A renewed wave of individual investors is entering the market, drawn by Bitcoin’s potential for high returns and its increasing mainstream acceptance. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties, coupled with inflationary pressures, often push investors towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin, which are perceived as safe havens. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments within the Bitcoin network and the broader crypto ecosystem, such as improved scalability solutions and regulatory clarity, contribute to positive market sentiment. Navigating the Volatility: What Does This Bitcoin Price Surge Mean for Investors? While the recent Bitcoin price surge is certainly exhilarating, it’s important for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. Such rapid movements often come with increased volatility, which can present both opportunities and risks. For those already holding BTC, this rally is a testament to their long-term conviction. However, new entrants or those considering increasing their positions should: Conduct Thorough Research: Understand the market trends, technical indicators, and fundamental analysis before making any investment decisions. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin is a dominant asset, a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with single-asset exposure. Practice Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose and set clear entry and exit strategies. The crypto market can be unpredictable. The current momentum suggests a strong bullish sentiment, but market corrections are a natural part of any asset’s growth cycle. Staying informed and making rational decisions, rather than emotional ones, is paramount. Looking Ahead: Sustaining the Bitcoin Price Surge and Market Outlook The question on everyone’s mind is whether this Bitcoin price surge is sustainable. Many analysts point to a combination of factors that could support continued upward movement. The increasing utility of Bitcoin, its finite supply, and its growing recognition as “digital gold” provide strong fundamental backing. Moreover, the global shift towards digital economies continues to strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. We are witnessing a pivotal moment where digital assets are no longer fringe investments but are becoming integral to the global financial system. The recent price action serves as a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s enduring potential and its capacity to surprise even the most seasoned market observers. In conclusion, the climb of BTC above $112,000 is a significant milestone, reflecting robust demand and a maturing market. While the path ahead may involve its share of ups and downs, the underlying trend points towards a future where Bitcoin plays an even more prominent role. Investors are encouraged to remain vigilant, stay informed, and celebrate this exciting phase in cryptocurrency history.

The proposal includes tariffs on countries that do not have trade agreements with the North American country. The tariffs target countries mainly from Asia. Although China was not directly mentioned, the budget plan tariffs will primarily affect countries with no trade agreements with Mexico, most of which are from Asia. The Mexican Treasury Secretary Edgar Amador said the tariffs will follow World Trade Organization (WTO) guidelines. He added that the government would carefully evaluate potential impacts on production and consumer prices to avoid market disruptions. Mexico’s tariffs target Asian countries President Claudia Sheinbaum’s administration continues to face challenges in trade negotiations with the U.S. Trump administration amid the announcement. Washington threatened earlier this year to expand the 25% tariffs on some of Mexico’s products not covered by the free trade agreement between them and Canada. Edgar Amador, Treasury Secretary, acknowledged that the new proposal unfolds amid the discussion and future commercial conversations with the U.S. He, however, insisted that the primary aim of the policy is to strengthen domestic consumption, protect Mexican industries, and reduce trade deficits. #Ahora La Secretaría de Hacienda entrega el Paquete Económico 2026; prevé aumento de impuestos a bebidas azucaradas y aranceles para países con los que no hay acuerdos de libre comercio. 📹: @AlexisOrBal pic.twitter.com/FEDjGKfBSz — Animal Político (@Pajaropolitico) September 9, 2025 Mexico had already incorporated such measures in December last year. The government imposed tariffs on specific imports, such as textiles, and increased operations to seize counterfeit and pirated goods, many of which originated from Asia. Some officials described the measure as a way to safeguard national industries from unfair competition. China strongly opposed the new proposal, which had been rumoured for months and prompted a formal response from the Asian country. Beijing responded in August before the official announcement of the proposal, when Guo Jiakun, a Chinese government spokesman, said the idea unfairly targeted Chinese products. “Mexico is China’s second largest trading partner in Latin America, and China is Mexico’s third-largest export destination. China firmly opposes restrictions imposed on China under various pretexts and under coercion from others, which harm China’s legitimate rights and interests.” – Guo Jiakun , Chinese government spokesman Sheinbaum’s administration tariffs represent a domestic and international balancing act. They present the local industries with a pledge to reduce dependency on imports and promote national self-sufficiency. The decision coincides with the U.S. demands to present a united front against Beijing. The proposal is widely supported in the country and is expected to pass, with Mexico’s governing party holding a majority in both chambers. The popularity virtually guarantees approval of the 2026 budget and import tax provisions. Amador urges local industries to prioritize self-reliance Amador reiterated that his country cannot ignore the need to reinforce its internal market. He added that the tariff will enhance domestic production and consumption while balancing Mexico’s international obligations. Cryptopolitan reported previously that the United States is preparing to reopen the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which could lead to a confrontation with its neighbors. Trump has already reimposed tariffs on the two countries, citing drug trafficking concerns. According to the report, the automotive industry is the most affected despite exemptions from USMCA-compliant goods. Trump granted the North American country another 90-day extension on some tariffs, with demands directed at the Sheinbaum administration for more vigorous drug enforcement tied to trade relief. This follows Mexico’s threats to take strong measures if a fair agreement is not reached, following the U.S. threats to impose a 30% tariff on Mexican imports. The U.S. also planned to impose a 17% tariff on fresh tomatoes, which Mexico supplies to approximately two-thirds of U.S. consumption. The Mexican President insisted that no other country could substitute Mexican tomatoes in the American market and announced measures to support farmers in mitigating tariff risks. Sheinbaum’s administration appears determined to pursue measures it views as necessary to protect its national economy.

Details Here,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cryptocurrency-giant-grayscale-requests-sec-etf-approval-for-three-altcoins-details-here/,"Crypto asset management company Grayscale has filed new applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), requesting approval for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC). Grayscale Submits Bitcoin Cash, Hedera, and Litecoin ETF Applications to the SEC The company's S-1, S-3, and related documents provide for the conversion of existing closed-end trusts into ETFs. These ETFs are planned to be listed on NYSE Arca or Nasdaq. Grayscale used the same process to convert its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts into ETFs in 2024. Grayscale's Litecoin ETF application states, “This prospectus has been prepared assuming that the 19b-4 filing has been approved by the SEC or that general standards permitting listing on NYSE Arca have been adopted.” The filing comes amid growing interest in altcoin ETFs. Similar filings have been filed for assets ranging from Dogecoin to XRP, while the SEC this week postponed its decision on Grayscale’s spot Hedera ETF and Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF. According to filings, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Cash trust had over $202 million in net assets as of June 30. Closed-end trusts typically trade at a premium or discount to net asset value, while ETFs, with their open-ended structure, create and destroy shares based on supply and demand, keeping the price closer to NAV. Grayscale's previous lawsuit against the SEC played a crucial role in the agency's eventual approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading in January 2024, have reached over $1.2 trillion in trading volume to date. *This is not investment advice.

The “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) lender reported 34.3 million shares sale valued at $40 each, above its marketed $35-$37 range. Per a Reuters report , the sale equates Klarna to a $15 billion valuation. The firm’s valuation slumped to $6.7 billion in 2022, at a time when interest rates and inflation were soaring. Klarna made its crypto foray in February, with CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski seeking suggestions from the crypto community on how it should integrate crypto into its ecosystem. The company, which provides a range of payment solutions for online shopping apart from BNPL, filed for an IPO with the US SEC in November 2024. The IPO debut on Tuesday positions Klarna as a major player in the evolving digital payments sector. The company will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KLAR” from Wednesday.

As mining hardware evolved from CPUs to GPUs, then to ASICs, mining pools simultaneously adapted to these technological advances. This article explores how mining machines and mining pools grew alongside each other and the evolution of the mainstream mining pool models that define today’s mining industry. From CPU Mining to the Birth of Pools At Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, mining was done solo using conventional CPUs on personal computers. Mining difficulty was low, enabling individuals to find blocks and earn Bitcoin independently. However, as more miners joined the network and difficulty increased, solo mining became impractical for most. The solution came in late 2010 with the formation of the first mining pools, such as Slush Pool. Pools allowed miners to combine computational power, reducing income variance by distributing rewards proportionally to contributed work. This innovation transformed mining from a lottery-like endeavor into a more predictable, steady income stream for participants. Hardware Evolution and Industrial Mining By 2010, GPUs replaced CPUs due to superior parallel processing power, leading to increased mining competitiveness and complexity. Mining pools expanded quickly, enabling more miners to join forces. FPGAs briefly enhanced mining efficiency before being outpaced by ASICs. The ASIC era, starting around 2013, dramatically increased mining speed and power efficiency. ASIC miners made individual mining with less specialized equipment nearly impossible. Mining pools scaled up their infrastructure, introducing sophisticated reward distribution mechanisms to accommodate a growing and diverse membership, thus becoming essential to mining operations worldwide. The Formation of Mainstream Pool Models Mining pools developed various reward systems over time to balance risk, fairness, and income stability: Proportional Model: The earliest system paying miners proportionally based on shares within a mining round. Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares (PPLNS): Rewards miners based on their most recent shares contributing to block discovery, introduced circa 2011 to reduce pool-hopping. Pay-Per-Share (PPS): A payout model pioneered by ViaBTC, introduced and launched in August 2016. It added transaction fees on top of PPS rewards, and was later adopted by many other mining pools. Full Pay-Per-Share (FPPS): Came later than PPS+, only appearing around 2018. It evolved from PPS to include both block rewards and transaction fees, providing miners with more stable income. These models aimed to reduce payment variance and risks, offering miners choices suited to their preferences for reward frequency and stability. Modern Mining Pools and Their Services Today, mining pools manage millions of miners globally using advanced software that coordinates mining tasks and manages proportional payouts efficiently. They charge competitive fees and provide transparency and security. Leading pools like ViaBTC offer flexible mining services and competitive reward systems, supporting miners from individuals to large-scale operations. Conclusion Mining pools have evolved from simple collaborations in Bitcoin’s early CPU mining days to sophisticated global operations alongside ASIC miners. The continuous development of mining hardware spurred innovation in pool reward models, enhancing fairness, reducing income volatility, and promoting large-scale mining participation. Together, the evolution of mining machines and pools underpins the robust and dynamic cryptocurrency mining ecosystem today.",Press Release,EN,0,0,MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-10 07:54:06

The expansion enables eligible European investors to trade tokenized versions of popular U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) directly through the Kraken app. ""Expanding xStocks to the European Union was a natural next step for Kraken, given our dedicated growth strategy and market presence here. For too long, it's been unnecessarily challenging to gain exposure to U.S. markets, and with xStocks we’re removing many of the barriers,” Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s global head of consumer, said in the announcement shared with CoinDesk. Tokenized stocks, also known as xStocks, developed in partnership with the Swiss Fintech firm Backed, are blockchain-based representations of real-world stocks or ETFs. These tokens mirror the value of the underlying stock and can be traded or held just like any other cryptocurrency in your wallet. These instruments address the longstanding challenges faced by global investors trying to access the U.S. stock market, which has traditionally been difficult and fraught with friction. With xStocks, EU-based investors can trade tokenized certificates that track the prices of popular U.S. equities, eliminating the need for traditional brokerages or intermediaries. Investors will maintain complete control over their assets, allowing seamless movement across compatible platforms and self-custody. Additionally, xStocks can be integrated into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, serving as composable financial building blocks that enhance users' flexibility and participation in modern digital markets. Kraken’s rollout of 24/5 xStocks trading in the EU is consistent with the growing interest in blockchain-based financial infrastructure and reflects broader industry trends toward decentralization, transparency, and democratization of global financial markets. According to Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and McKinsey & Company, the global tokenized asset market is expected to be worth trillions of dollars by the 2030s.

51488211,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=804412,1757491205,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51488211.jpeg,Court blocks Trump’s attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/judge-blocks-trump-from-firing-lisa-cook/,"A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has temporarily stopped President Trump from firing Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board after Trump tried to remove her over claims of mortgage fraud. This legal standoff is the first of its kind, as no president has ever attempted to fire a Fed governor “for cause” before. The ruling was issued late Tuesday night by Judge Jia Cobb, who granted a preliminary injunction that prevents the termination while the case plays out in court. The case exploded after Trump publicly announced Lisa’s removal on August 25, pointing to tweets and claims from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who accused Lisa of mortgage fraud tied to two properties she owns. Lisa signed those real estate documents before joining the Fed. Trump called that fraud and said it made her unfit to oversee the nation’s financial system. Lisa says she did nothing wrong. Her lawyers say this is a political hit job disguised as a legal action. Judge blocks Powell from enforcing Trump’s order In her ruling, Cobb said Lisa made a “strong showing” that her firing violated the Federal Reserve Act, which only allows governors to be removed for behavior while in office. She wrote that the “best reading” of the law means you can’t just drag up someone’s past actions and call it grounds for firing. “For cause,” she ruled, “does not contemplate removing an individual purely for conduct that occurred before they began in office.” That’s not stopping the Trump administration from trying. White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that Trump “lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud from her highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.” He added, “This ruling will not be the last say on the matter, and the Trump Administration will continue to work to restore accountability and confidence in the Fed.” Cobb’s order also blocks Jerome Powell and the rest of the Fed Board from doing anything to help enforce Trump’s decision. The ruling stops them from “effectuating in any manner” Lisa’s removal. That means she stays on the job, and will participate in the Fed’s next meeting starting September 16, where interest rate cuts are expected to be on the table. Lisa stays, Trump pushes ahead with new nominee Lisa is the first Black woman to ever serve as a governor on the Federal Reserve Board . If Trump had succeeded in removing her, he would’ve gained even more influence over the seven-member board by filling her seat with another ally. He’s already planning new appointments. On Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee will vote on Trump’s pick, Stephen Miran, who chairs the Council of Economic Advisers. He’s lined up to replace Adriana Kugler, who resigned unexpectedly in August. Lisa’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, called the ruling a win for the Fed’s independence. “Today’s ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference,” Lowell said. He warned that removing Lisa “on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law.” He said Lisa “will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.” The case is far from over. The Supreme Court is expected to make the final call on whether Trump’s removal attempt has legal grounds. Until then, Lisa keeps her seat at the table. At the last court hearing on August 29, Lowell didn’t hold back when challenging the White House’s case. “You can’t have Director Pulte’s crazy midnight tweets be the cause,” he told Cobb during the hearing.

51488048,578060,1757491253,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51488048.jpeg,Bipartisan Push For Crypto: Democrats Present Key Principles For Market Structure Bill,https://bitcoinist.com/democrats-principles-crypto-market-structure-bill/,"On Tuesday, a group of Senate Democrats unveiled a set of key principles aimed at shaping future legislation to regulate the cryptocurrency space under the anticipated market structure bill. Spearheaded by Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Cory Booker, this framework seeks to address the pressing issues surrounding market structure and regulatory clarity. New Regulatory Roadmap The senators described their proposal as a “substantive road map” designed to facilitate effective bipartisan negotiations . They emphasized that achieving a new regulatory framework would require time and collaboration with their Republican counterparts. This initiative comes in the wake of Senate Republicans releasing their own discussion draft in July, which was updated just last week. However, that proposal has yet to gain any traction with Democratic senators. Central to the Democrats’ framework is that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) can be granted exclusive jurisdiction over non-security cryptocurrency markets. Additionally, the senators suggest that regulatory bodies provide clear guidance on how existing securities laws apply to digital assets. The senators pointed out that uncertainty regarding digital assets’ regulatory status has created obstacles for new businesses attempting to navigate the existing financial rulebook. They noted that the rapid growth of digital assets has exposed significant gaps in current regulations, leaving investors vulnerable to scams and fraud due to insufficient safeguards. Democratic Push For Crypto Restrictions To address these concerns, the framework advocates for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to incorporate digital assets and their platforms into the current regulatory framework. It calls for the establishment of an effective oversight regime for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and platforms. Furthermore, the proposal suggests that digital asset platforms should be registered as financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act, which would impose rigorous record-keeping and reporting requirements aimed at combating money laundering. While many of the principles outlined by the Democrats align with those previously suggested by Republicans, certain aspects of the proposal, particularly those concerning President Trump and his family’s involvement in the crypto industry, may encounter resistance. Throughout the year, the Trump family has significantly increased its exposure to cryptocurrency through the launch of the official TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins , the DeFi platform World Liberty (WLFI), and the mining venture American Bitcoin (ABTC). As a result, the Democrats seek to prohibit elected officials and their family members from issuing, endorsing, or profiting from digital assets, as well as establish reporting requirements for crypto holdings. Moreover, the framework emphasizes the need for bipartisan cooperation at the SEC and CFTC, advocating that commissioners from both parties must participate in digital asset rulemakings to ensure balanced governance. The senators asserted that a bipartisan regulatory process is essential for creating enduring and effective rules that will foster stability and legitimacy in the digital asset markets.

The competition for Hyperliquid stablecoin issuance rights is heating up, with industry giants PayPal and Paxos throwing their hats into the ring. This isn’t just another partnership; it’s a strategic move that could redefine how stablecoins integrate into mainstream finance. What’s Driving the Hyperliquid Stablecoin Issuance Race? Hyperliquid, a decentralized exchange, announced plans to grant a partner the authority to issue its native stablecoin, USDH. This move has sparked intense interest from several prominent firms. Why is this so significant? Issuing a stablecoin offers considerable influence and potential revenue within the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. For Hyperliquid, securing a reputable and well-resourced partner is crucial for the long-term stability and adoption of USDH. PayPal, a global leader in online payments, has teamed up with Paxos, a regulated blockchain infrastructure platform and stablecoin issuer. Together, they are making a compelling bid for the rights to issue USDH. This collaboration brings together PayPal’s massive user base and regulatory compliance experience with Paxos’s proven expertise in stablecoin technology and regulatory adherence. The Block initially reported on this high-stakes competition, highlighting the strategic implications for the broader crypto market. The decision for the Hyperliquid stablecoin partner will be closely watched. PayPal and Paxos: A Powerful Alliance for USDH The joint proposal from PayPal and Paxos isn’t just about issuing the Hyperliquid stablecoin ; it’s about ecosystem integration and growth. Their plan outlines several key initiatives designed to boost USDH adoption and support the Hyperliquid platform: Venmo Listing: PayPal has proposed listing HYPE, Hyperliquid’s native token, on its popular subsidiary payment platform, Venmo. This could expose HYPE to millions of users, significantly increasing its accessibility and liquidity. Ecosystem Incentives: A substantial $20 million in incentives is earmarked for the Hyperliquid ecosystem. These funds are intended to foster development, encourage user participation, and drive innovation within the Hyperliquid network. Revenue-Sharing Model: The proposal includes a reward system where revenue generated from USDH activities would be channeled into a dedicated support fund for Hyperliquid. This creates a sustainable model for the stablecoin and ensures ongoing support for the underlying platform. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a clear understanding of what it takes to launch and sustain a successful stablecoin in a competitive market. The integration with Venmo, in particular, could be a game-changer for mainstream adoption of the Hyperliquid stablecoin . Who Else is Vying for Hyperliquid Stablecoin Rights? The competition for USDH issuance is fierce, with several other notable players presenting their own bids. This diverse field underscores the perceived value and potential of the Hyperliquid stablecoin . Key contenders include: Frax Finance: Known for its algorithmic stablecoin, Frax brings innovative stablecoin mechanisms to the table. Agora: Another strong contender, likely offering its own unique approach to stablecoin issuance and management. Sky: Details on Sky’s proposal are less public, but their involvement indicates significant interest. Ethena: A project gaining traction for its synthetic dollar protocol, Ethena could offer a distinct model for USDH. Each of these firms brings different strengths and strategies, making the selection process a critical decision for Hyperliquid. The chosen partner will not only issue USDH but also play a pivotal role in its market positioning and growth trajectory. What Does This Mean for the Stablecoin Landscape? The outcome of this bid for Hyperliquid stablecoin issuance rights could have far-reaching implications. If PayPal and Paxos succeed, it could: Legitimize DeFi: Further bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance by bringing a regulated, mainstream entity like PayPal directly into stablecoin issuance. Boost Adoption: The Venmo integration alone could introduce millions to stablecoins, potentially accelerating their mainstream acceptance and use for everyday transactions. Set New Standards: The rigorous proposals and competition could lead to higher standards for stablecoin transparency, stability, and regulatory compliance across the industry. This strategic maneuver highlights the increasing interest of established financial players in the crypto space, particularly in areas like stablecoins that offer a blend of stability and digital innovation. The future of the Hyperliquid stablecoin looks incredibly promising, regardless of who ultimately wins the bid. Concluding Thoughts: A New Era for Stablecoins? The race for Hyperliquid’s USDH issuance rights represents a pivotal moment in the stablecoin market. The partnership between PayPal and Paxos, with its ambitious incentives and integration plans, sets a high bar for the competition. This development not only underscores the growing importance of stablecoins in the broader financial ecosystem but also signals a potential shift towards greater institutional involvement and regulatory clarity. As Hyperliquid evaluates these proposals, the crypto community watches eagerly. The chosen partner will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of USDH and, by extension, influence the evolution of stablecoins as a whole. This is a testament to the dynamic and rapidly maturing world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDH?

While digital assets often carve their own path, they remain inextricably linked to the broader global financial system. Right now, all eyes are on the traditional Forex market , where the Dollar steadies its position, poised for a potentially significant move. This calm before the storm is driven by the impending release of crucial inflation data , a factor that could send ripples not just through currency pairs like the euro and dollar, but also directly into your crypto portfolio. How will a potential Euro slips scenario or a surging dollar impact Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets? Let’s dive deep into these intricate currency trends and uncover their far-reaching implications. Why is Upcoming Inflation Data So Crucial for Global Markets? The anticipation surrounding the upcoming inflation data is palpable, and for good reason. Inflation figures, particularly the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, serve as vital barometers for the health of an economy. Central banks, especially the U.S. Federal Reserve, closely monitor these metrics to guide their monetary policy decisions, most notably on interest rates. When inflation is high and persistent, central banks tend to raise interest rates to cool down the economy and bring prices under control. Conversely, low inflation might prompt a more dovish stance, potentially leading to rate cuts or quantitative easing. But why does this matter so much for the Forex market and, by extension, cryptocurrencies? Higher interest rates make a country’s currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking better returns on their bond holdings. This increased demand can strengthen the currency. Therefore, if the upcoming inflation data comes in hotter than expected, it could signal a more aggressive Fed, potentially bolstering the dollar. Conversely, a weaker-than-expected reading might suggest the Fed has more room to ease, which could weaken the dollar. Historically, periods of high inflation have often seen investors seek refuge in assets perceived as inflation hedges. While gold has traditionally filled this role, Bitcoin has increasingly been pitched as ‘digital gold’ due to its finite supply. However, the initial reaction to hawkish monetary policy, often triggered by strong inflation data , can sometimes be negative for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, as higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and reduce speculative appetite. Key Inflation Indicators and Their Market Relevance: Understanding the nuances of inflation reporting is essential. Here are the primary indicators market participants watch: Consumer Price Index (CPI): Measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. It’s often the most widely reported and can cause immediate market reactions. Producer Price Index (PPI): Measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. It’s a leading indicator for consumer inflation. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index: The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation. It tends to be broader and more flexible than CPI, accounting for shifts in consumer behavior. Core Inflation: Both CPI and PCE are often reported with ‘core’ readings, which exclude volatile food and energy prices to provide a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends. How Does the Dollar Steadies Trend Impact Your Investment Portfolio? The current state where the Dollar steadies itself ahead of critical economic releases is a reflection of several underlying factors. The U.S. dollar, often considered the world’s primary reserve currency, benefits from its safe-haven status during times of global uncertainty. When geopolitical tensions rise or economic outlooks become murky, investors often flock to the dollar, driving up its value. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve’s relatively hawkish stance compared to other major central banks has created attractive interest rate differentials, drawing capital into dollar-denominated assets. This stability, or even strength, in the dollar has significant implications across various asset classes: Commodities: A stronger dollar typically makes dollar-denominated commodities, like oil and gold, more expensive for international buyers using other currencies. This can dampen demand and put downward pressure on commodity prices. Emerging Markets: Many emerging market economies hold dollar-denominated debt. A stronger dollar increases the cost of servicing this debt, potentially leading to financial instability and capital outflows from these regions. Corporate Earnings: U.S. multinational corporations that generate significant revenue abroad may see their overseas earnings diminish when converted back into a stronger dollar, impacting their bottom line. For cryptocurrency investors, the relationship with a strengthening dollar is often inverse. When the Dollar steadies or rises, particularly due to higher interest rate expectations, the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin increases. Investors might reallocate funds from speculative assets to safer, interest-bearing dollar assets. This phenomenon has been observed repeatedly, where periods of dollar strength coincide with corrections or sideways movement in the crypto market. While not a perfect correlation, it’s a macro trend that informed crypto investors cannot afford to ignore. What’s Behind the Euro Slips Narrative and Its Broader Economic Consequences? While the Dollar steadies , the euro has been on a more precarious footing, with the Euro slips narrative gaining traction. Several factors contribute to the European single currency’s vulnerability. One primary driver is the divergence in monetary policy between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the U.S. Federal Reserve. The ECB has generally maintained a more dovish stance, keeping interest rates lower for longer to support the Eurozone’s often-fragile economic recovery. This interest rate differential makes euro-denominated assets less attractive compared to dollar assets, leading to capital outflows. Beyond monetary policy, the Eurozone faces structural challenges that weigh on its currency. Europe’s significant reliance on imported energy, particularly from regions affected by geopolitical tensions, makes it vulnerable to energy price shocks. High energy costs translate into higher inflation and slower economic growth, a challenging combination for any central bank to navigate. Furthermore, lingering sovereign debt concerns in some member states and the complexities of political cohesion within the bloc can create uncertainty, prompting investors to shy away from the euro. The consequences of a Euro slips scenario are multifaceted: Inflationary Pressures: A weaker euro makes imports more expensive, contributing to domestic inflation within the Eurozone, which can further erode consumer purchasing power. Export Competitiveness: While a weaker currency can make exports cheaper and more competitive on the global market, this benefit can be offset by higher import costs for raw materials and energy. Investment Flows: Sustained euro weakness can deter foreign direct investment into the Eurozone, as investors seek more stable or higher-yielding alternatives. Dollar vs. Euro: Economic Divergence The current state of the Forex market highlights a clear divergence between the economic fortunes and policy paths of the United States and the Eurozone. This table illustrates some key differences: Factor United States (USD) Eurozone (EUR) Monetary Policy Stance Generally more hawkish (aggressive rate hikes) Generally more dovish (slower, more cautious rate hikes) Energy Dependency Energy independent/exporter High dependency on energy imports Inflation Drivers Strong demand, tight labor market Energy costs, supply chain disruptions Economic Growth Outlook More resilient, robust labor market Slower growth, recession fears Safe-Haven Status Primary global safe haven Less pronounced, vulnerable to regional risks Navigating the Volatile Forex Market : Strategies for Informed Investors The Forex market is the largest and most liquid financial market globally, with trillions of dollars exchanged daily. Its constant movement, driven by economic data, central bank policies, and geopolitical events, presents both challenges and opportunities. For investors, particularly those with exposure to cryptocurrencies, understanding how to navigate this volatility is paramount. The interplay between traditional currencies and digital assets is becoming increasingly evident, making a holistic view essential. One key strategy is to monitor key economic indicators and central bank communications closely. As we’ve discussed, inflation data is a prime example. Unexpected readings can trigger sharp currency movements. Staying informed about upcoming data releases and understanding their potential impact on interest rate expectations can provide valuable insights into future currency trends . This proactive approach allows investors to anticipate shifts rather than merely reacting to them. Another crucial aspect is recognizing the interconnectedness of global markets. A strengthening Dollar steadies its position against other currencies, which can influence capital flows across the globe. When capital seeks higher yields in the U.S., it can drain liquidity from other markets, including the crypto space. Conversely, a weaker dollar might make riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, more appealing. Similarly, a Euro slips scenario, driven by regional economic woes, could have localized impacts but also contribute to broader dollar strength if capital flees Europe for safer havens. Key Strategies for Integrating Forex Insights into Crypto Investing: Macroeconomic Awareness: Keep abreast of global economic calendars, central bank meetings, and geopolitical developments. Understand how these events can influence major currency pairs. Correlation Analysis: Observe how Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies react to significant movements in the DXY (U.S. Dollar Index) or major currency pairs like EUR/USD. While not always perfect, patterns often emerge. Risk Management: If you anticipate significant dollar strength, consider reducing exposure to highly speculative crypto assets or hedging positions. Conversely, during periods of dollar weakness, risk assets may perform better. Diversification: While not directly a forex strategy, a diversified crypto portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with specific macro trends affecting certain types of digital assets. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term market noise and long-term structural currency trends . Short-term volatility can create trading opportunities, while long-term trends inform strategic asset allocation. Predicting Future Currency Trends : What Lies Ahead for the Dollar and Euro? Predicting future currency trends is an exercise fraught with uncertainty, yet it’s vital for strategic planning. The immediate outlook for the dollar and euro hinges significantly on the upcoming inflation data and the subsequent reactions from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. If inflation proves stubbornly high in the U.S., the Fed may be compelled to maintain a hawkish stance, potentially leading to further dollar strength. Conversely, if inflation cools more rapidly than expected, it could temper rate hike expectations, causing the Dollar steadies narrative to shift towards a more bearish outlook. For the euro, the path forward is equally complex. The ECB faces a delicate balancing act: fighting inflation without plunging the Eurozone into a deep recession. Geopolitical developments, particularly those affecting energy supplies, will continue to play a crucial role. A resolution or escalation of conflicts could dramatically alter the economic landscape and, by extension, the value of the euro. Any positive surprises in Eurozone economic data or a more aggressive shift from the ECB could help reverse the Euro slips trend. Beyond immediate data points, several long-term structural factors will influence currency trends . These include: Demographics: Aging populations in many developed economies, including parts of the Eurozone, can impact productivity and economic growth, potentially weakening their currencies over time. Technological Innovation: Countries at the forefront of technological innovation may attract more foreign investment, strengthening their currencies. Fiscal Health: Government debt levels and fiscal policies play a significant role. Unsustainable debt can erode confidence in a currency. Global Trade Dynamics: Shifts in global trade patterns and the emergence of new economic blocs can alter demand for various currencies. For the Forex market as a whole, the trend towards multipolarity, with rising economic powers challenging the traditional dominance of the dollar, is a long-term theme. However, in the near to medium term, the dollar’s safe-haven status and the Fed’s proactive monetary policy are likely to keep it as a dominant force, even if its trajectory isn’t always upward. The euro, on the other hand, will likely remain sensitive to regional economic performance and geopolitical stability. Challenges and Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors The challenges in navigating these intertwined markets are clear: volatility, uncertainty, and the sheer volume of information. Unexpected shifts in inflation data or central bank rhetoric can trigger rapid market movements. Geopolitical events, often unpredictable, can quickly alter currency trends and impact investor sentiment towards risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, with these challenges come opportunities for informed investors. By understanding how the Dollar steadies or weakens, and why the Euro slips or gains, crypto investors can make more strategic decisions. For example, if you foresee a period of sustained dollar strength due to hawkish Fed policy, it might be prudent to hold a larger portion of your portfolio in stablecoins or dollar-denominated assets, or even consider short-term hedging strategies for your crypto holdings. Conversely, a weakening dollar could signal a more favorable environment for risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. The key is to integrate macroeconomic analysis into your crypto investment framework. Don’t view cryptocurrencies in isolation. Recognize that they are part of a larger global financial ecosystem, and their performance is often influenced by the tides of traditional markets. Paying attention to currency trends provides a crucial layer of insight, helping you to anticipate market shifts and manage risk more effectively. Compelling Summary: The Interconnected Dance of Global Finance The current global financial landscape is a complex tapestry where every thread, from the stability of the dollar to the dip of the euro, is interconnected. As the Dollar steadies in anticipation of pivotal inflation data , and the Euro slips under various pressures, the Forex market stands at a critical juncture. These movements are not confined to currency traders; they send powerful signals across all asset classes, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Understanding these intricate currency trends provides investors with a powerful lens through which to view potential market shifts, enabling more informed decisions and proactive risk management. In an era where macroeconomics increasingly dictates market sentiment, staying ahead means staying informed about the forces shaping global finance.

His post emphasized the development of an ascending triangle, a bullish pattern that he tied to past market behavior that preceded a sharp move. XRP has continued to remain a focal point for technical traders as the cryptocurrency spent early September consolidating within a defined range . The broader market has shown mixed momentum, but XRP’s long-term chart formations are being closely evaluated for possible breakout opportunities. $XRP – Pay attention to the orange squares Once this breaks, I expect a BIBILCAL MOVE that will MAKE YOU or BREAK YOU! I'll make sure to use DUMB MONEY who ""knows what they hold"" as my EXIT LIQUIDITY! Remember my $3.37 measured target ? 500RTs I'll post next target on X!… pic.twitter.com/UaOkDCVuRo — JD (@jaydee_757) September 9, 2025 The Setup for a Breakout The chart JD shared illustrates multiple long-term trendlines, with a key emphasis placed on the consolidation within an ascending triangle . In his assessment, JD predicted a “biblical move” once XRP can break out from this technical formation. He emphasized that traders should pay close attention to the orange squares marked on the chart, which indicate critical levels within the current formation. He believes the upcoming surge will either make or break investors. JD also referred to dumb money participants who often claim to “know what they hold,” and fail to take profits at the right time, stating that he intends to use this group as exit liquidity. According to the analyst, 95% of these dumb money investors who claim to be knowledgeable will lose money in the current cycle. XRP Price Targets and Strategy In addition to chart observations, JD mentioned a specific target level. He reminded his audience of a “$3.37 measured target” that he previously identified, tying it to the breakout potential of the ascending triangle. While this target is below XRP’s all-time high of $3.65 , it could set the stage for another rally to much higher levels. JD noted that he would release his next price target if his post received 500 retweets, while also pointing to Patreon and Discord channels for further details. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While JD did not provide a specific timeline, he joked that the asset would hit its peak, hence Edoardo Farina, who was suspended from X, gets his account back, or when Vincent Scott tries to sell his tokens to everyone. The ascending triangle pattern, historically considered a bullish continuation setup, provides a structured framework for analyzing XRP’s next move. If confirmed, the breakout above resistance could align with JD’s measured target projection, pushing XRP toward new heights.

One of them is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which already enjoys a rather big hype, and which has a potential in early accumulation due to its standout approach to DeFi. Meanwhile, reputable players like Cardano (ADA) continue to sail on, targeting a gradual evolution and the development of the ecosystem. As investors sweep the horizon with strategic entries, the interest is shifting to assets with good fundamentals and more relevant in the market and Mutuum finance is taking the centre stage of this story. Cardano Stands Tall in the Market ADA is at a flat trading position of approximately $0.84 and investors are observing the market to see whether there are catalysts to drive some momentum. The recent updates to increase the scalability of its network and the efficiency in the transaction are yet to shape its future yet analysts are still watching. This steady move keeps Cardano on the list of interest as traders want to see more evident breakout patterns. While this transpires, other new projects like Mutuum Finance are gaining momentum in the DeFi market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Stage 6 In Process Mutuum Finance is currently in its sixth presale round and in this round the tokens have increased in price to $0.035 thus marking an increase of 16.17 percent compared to the previous round. The market interest is immense since the project has already attracted more than 16,150 investors and has almost reached $15.5 million. In partnership with CertiK, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also designed a Bug Bounty Program on USDT on the platform that offers rewards up to 50,000 USDT in an effort to make the platform more secure. Vulnerabilities are classified into four levels namely critical, major, minor, and low. Risk parameters / Collateralization Controls Mutuum Finance has asset-specific limits of collateralization that reflect the form of risk that an asset takes. They are supply limits, borrowing limits and collateral limits. The protocol reduces the exposure to the market by overcollateralizing positions. It also motivates the liquidators to liquidate the trades, which are under collateralized and therefore risky positions are cleared in real-time. The limits that are put in place on borrowing and deposit are also used in minimising risks because of volatile or illiquid assets. Collateral usage is restricted in case of higher risk tokens but the assets with a stronger correlation can be used more effectively to use their collateral. Such mechanisms are played in the minimization of insolvency risk without disrupting the lending and borrowing balance in the protocol. Creation of Community and User Base Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is promoting the development of an active user base by a $100,000 giveaway program. Within the framework of this program, ten winners will be rewarded with $10,000 MUTM tokens each on the basis of the recommendation of new participants and investment in the project. Security Infrastructure and Back-up Strategy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) employs a Loan-to-Value (LTV) model, coupled with subjective collateral, lending and transfer liquidation limits but adjusted according to the risk of assets. A reserve factor is used to act as a buffer in the face of possible defaults and very extreme market situations. More risky assets are put under a larger reserve to offer more protection to the protocol and its users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the best altcoins to hold before the next market boom, surpassing the other market giants such as Cardano (ADA). Stage 6 tokens have a price of 0.035, which increased 16.17 percent over the last stage, and raised more than $15.5M with 16,150+ investors onboard. MUTM has a $50K CertiK bug bounty, a $100K giveaway, and a powerful risk control system of overcollateralization and lending limits to provide growth opportunity and a well-developed risk infrastructure. Enter Stage 6 today to ensure that you position early before the next price rise.

The statistics bureau reported that China’s consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.4% in August from a year earlier, a bigger drop than the 0.2% analysts had predicted. Beijing faces weaker prices as exports and demand slow New data shows China’s consumer prices dropped in August after remaining flat in July. Economists blame the cheaper food prices that were unusually high the previous year. At the same time, the producer price index fell by 2.9% compared to last year. The margins may look small when compared to the 3.6% drop in July, but it still indicates that China’s industrial sector is struggling with weak demand both locally and internationally. These factors cut into their profits and limit their ability to invest in growing their operations for the future. Foreign countries are reducing their imports, and the trade tensions with the United States are also to blame for China’s low export rates. The country’s situation has left many producers struggling with lower sales and dropping prices. August was the 35th month in a row that producer prices dropped, which means factories have been receiving less money for their produce for nearly three years. China is trying to counter these challenges by promoting heavy investment in manufacturing. It believes that with more production and high industrial activity, the overall economy will grow close to the official target of 5%. However, these efforts are becoming less effective because overseas buyers aren’t raising their importation rates while local consumers are spending less. In the end, companies have no choice but to cut prices to move their products, limiting their ability to hire more workers. Officials push new policies to lift spending and stabilize growth The Chinese government is now offering subsidies for households to replace their old appliances with new ones at more affordable costs. It also supports consumer loans by paying part of the interest to allow them to borrow more. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan, central bank data indicates short-term consumer loans, often utilized for purchases, fell once more in July, down to Rmb 9.8 trillion, about $1.4 trillion. Still, with stronger borrowers pulling back, banks face riskier clients, according to Zhu. ICBC’s bad consumer loans topped Rmb 10 billion in March, double last year’s, with its NPL ratio at a record almost 2.4%% Finally, regulators have tightened rules on industries that continue to produce more goods than the market can absorb. The government calls this set of laws the “anti-involution campaign.” They aim to reduce wasteful competition where companies keep producing even when demand is at an all-time low. Experts still have their doubts about how effective these measures can be. Research firm Gaveka warned that there is little to no evidence that these policies have succeeded in raising prices higher. It also raises concerns about the anti-involution campaign, saying the policy might force companies to reduce investments and new projects, dragging the growth down further. However, even with these warnings, Chinese officials are confident in their policies and the results they bring. Chief statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics, Dong Lijuan, said the core consumer price index rose for the fourth month, increasing by 0.9% in August compared to last year. He also said consumer prices had been falling for eight months on a month-to-month basis, but they finally went flat in August. This could mean the worst factory price cuts could finally be slowing down. Dong said this proves the policies work, even though it may take longer for the effects to be felt across the country. Officials believe these measures will improve demand in China and give businesses more time to recover.

This pivotal development signals a new era for cryptocurrency investments, making digital assets more accessible to a wider audience than ever before. For investors keen on diversifying their portfolios with exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency, this move could be a game-changer. What is a Bitcoin ETP and Why is it Important for UK Investors? An Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) is a type of security that tracks an underlying asset, index, or financial instrument. In this context, a Bitcoin ETP would track the price of Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to the digital currency through traditional brokerage accounts. This removes the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as setting up digital wallets or managing private keys, making the process significantly simpler and more familiar for many. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recently paved the way for this by permitting broader investor access to crypto Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs) starting in October. This regulatory shift is crucial, as it provides a clearer framework for institutional players like BlackRock to offer such products. BlackRock’s iShares BTC ETP, expected to list on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption. For UK investors, especially retail investors who will be able to purchase BTC ETNs from October 8, this means: Increased Accessibility: Easier entry into the Bitcoin market through regulated financial products. Regulatory Comfort: Investing through a product overseen by the FCA, potentially reducing perceived risks. Portfolio Diversification: A straightforward way to add digital asset exposure to traditional investment portfolios. Unlocking New Opportunities: The Impact of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETP BlackRock’s entry into the UK crypto market with a Bitcoin ETP is more than just another product launch; it’s a powerful statement of institutional confidence in digital assets. This move by one of the world’s largest asset managers lends significant credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate investment class. It signals a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within established financial ecosystems. The introduction of a BlackRock-backed Bitcoin ETP could lead to several positive ripple effects: Enhanced Liquidity: Increased trading volume on the LSE could improve market liquidity for Bitcoin. Broader Investor Base: Attracting both institutional and retail investors who previously shied away from direct crypto investments due to perceived complexity or risk. Market Maturation: Further integrating cryptocurrency into the traditional financial system, fostering greater stability and regulatory clarity across the sector. Moreover, the competition among ETP providers could drive innovation and potentially lower fees for investors, making Bitcoin exposure even more attractive. This increased competition benefits everyone in the market. Navigating the Future: Challenges and What’s Next for Bitcoin ETPs While the enthusiasm for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETP is high, it’s also important to consider the broader landscape. Investors should remember that while an ETP simplifies access, it still tracks an inherently volatile asset. The price of Bitcoin can fluctuate significantly, and an ETP’s value will reflect these movements. Therefore, due diligence and understanding market dynamics remain crucial. However, the long-term outlook remains promising. The trend towards institutional adoption of digital assets is undeniable. BlackRock’s move in the UK follows similar successful launches in other jurisdictions, indicating a global shift. This pioneering step by BlackRock could encourage other major financial institutions to explore similar offerings, further legitimizing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies within established financial markets. The upcoming launch is not just about BlackRock; it’s about the evolving relationship between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. It underscores a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and an investable asset, marking a pivotal moment in its journey towards widespread acceptance. In Conclusion: A New Dawn for UK Crypto Investors The reported launch of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETP in the UK next month marks a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market. It represents a convergence of traditional finance and digital innovation, offering UK investors a regulated, accessible, and efficient pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This development is set to reshape investment strategies and accelerate the mainstream adoption of digital assets, promising an exciting future for the UK’s financial landscape. As the October 8th date approaches for retail access, the anticipation for this groundbreaking product continues to build. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin ETP?

51490964,577178,1757496631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51490964.jpeg,Is The Bitcoin Bull Market Over? Pundit Warns Investors Of 30-Day Window To Take Profit,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-over-profit/,"The Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high in July, but has since slowed down. While the Ethereum price had also hit a new all-time high back in August, the broader altcoin market remains weak, leading to speculations that there will not be an altcoin season. With no expectations of an altcoin season happening soon, some have started calling for the cycle top, meaning that a bear market could be on the horizon. Bitcoin Halving Trend Says Bull Market Is Over Crypto investor and trader Philakone took to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to update his over 170,000 followers on what part of the cycle the market is in. To do this, Philakone looks back on the past two bull cycles, using the duration of each one from the Bitcoin halving to predict when the current cycle will end. The Bitcoin halving has always been a way to predict when bull and bear markets could begin, and in the last few cycles, it has been quite accurate, and the trend has remained similar. One of the major things is how many days after the Bitcoin halving was completed it took for the Bitcoin price and the crypto market to reach the top. As the crypto trader explains, back in 2017, after the 2016 Bitcoin halving, it took a total of 545 days for the bull market to be completed. Similarly, after the 2020 Bitcoin halving, it took another 525 days for the bull market to be over. This shows a tight timeframe for each one. Currently, the crypto market has already been in 506 days of bull market at the time of the post, with the Bitcoin price already hitting multiple new all-time highs. As a result, the crypto analyst believes that it is time to take profit as there are fewer than 30 days left for this bull market. He also believes that the bull market is now “100% over”. 4-Year Cycle Theory Getting Tossed Out The Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Theory has historically been one of the most accurate measures for when the bull market begins and ends . However, this current cycle has deviated heavily from the 4-year cycle, and this has been attributed to the change in macro headwinds. The advent of things like Spot Bitcoin ETFs had triggered ‘premature’ liquidity into the market, pushing the BTC price to early highs and leaving the altcoin market behind. However, others such antiprosynthesis.eth believe that the 4-year cycle never existed in the first place. Instead, it was just the macro liquidity aligning every four years.

Crypto Analyst Unveils Top XRP Rival Based Eggman Presale and New Ripple XRP Price Prediction,https://timestabloid.com/can-xrp-hit-1000-crypto-analyst-unveils-top-xrp-rival-based/,"Ripple (XRP) has surged back into investor discussions after whales accumulated nearly $1 billion worth of tokens in just two weeks. Institutional players like Japanese gaming giant Gumi and Hyperscale Data have added Ripple (XRP) to their treasuries, while futures volumes on CME surpassed $1 billion, signaling deeper liquidity. With Spot ETF applications still pending, some analysts are floating bold predictions that Ripple (XRP) could eventually hit $1000. But others caution that while XRP has long-term adoption potential, its growth ceiling is capped compared to new viral presales like Based Eggman ($GGs), which is being called the top rival to XRP’s dominance in 2025. XRP Price Prediction and Whale Activity Currently trading around $2.83, Ripple (XRP) is consolidating between $2.77 and $2.95. Analysts note that breaking above the $3.00 resistance could trigger a move toward $3.20 or $3.35, with a possible extension to $3.60 if cycle patterns repeat. Whale accumulation supports this outlook, as nearly 340 million XRP shifted into long-term wallets. Still, skeptics argue that even with ETF approvals and institutional inflows, reaching $1000 would require market dynamics on par with Bitcoin’s trajectory, which may be unrealistic for a payments-focused token. Based Eggman ($GGs): The Viral Rival in Presale While XRP debates rage, Based Eggman ($GGs) has gone viral as the most exciting meme coin presale of 2025. Its formula blends humor with innovation, including scarcity-driven tokenomics, staking rewards, and planned streaming integrations. Early adopters are flocking to $GGs because presale stages historically deliver the largest returns. Traders who once enjoyed exponential upside with Shiba Inu or Dogecoin see Based Eggman ($GGs) as their next chance to replicate those gains. By entering now, investors are positioning ahead of exchange listings, when valuations typically multiply. Analyst View: Stability vs. Explosive Growth Crypto analysts emphasize that Ripple (XRP) and Based Eggman ($GGs) serve different roles. XRP offers stability, institutional interest, and gradual growth tied to adoption in payments and banking. Based Eggman ($GGs), by contrast, offers explosive, short-term potential as a top presale. With whales chasing narrative-driven momentum, $GGs provides the volatility and upside XRP can no longer deliver. For investors asking whether XRP can hit $1000, the better question may be whether $GGs can provide 100x returns in the near term. Conclusion: XRP’s Ambition vs. $GGs Reality Ripple (XRP) may eventually climb higher as ETFs unlock institutional flows, but the dream of $1000 remains speculative. Based Eggman ($GGs), still in presale, offers a concrete path to exponential profits through viral adoption and early-stage entry. For investors seeking the top crypto rival to Ripple (XRP) in 2025, Based Eggman ($GGs) stands out as the smarter move.

MSTY is best viewed as a pure income play, not for capital appreciation; upside is capped, and NAV erosion is a persistent risk. Future re-entry depends on share price stabilization and signs of rising distributions, ideally after a further drop and MSTR price rebound. Long-term holders can break even or profit via distributions, especially if they allocate income wisely into other high-yield or growth assets. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) is an ETF that uses synthetic covered calls on the underlying stock Strategy ( MSTR ), meaning it doesn't directly hold any of Strategy's stock. Its primary purpose is to generate income for investors. Some of the potential downsides to the holding are NAV erosion and the capping of the upside in contrast to the probability of significant upside over the long term for Strategy. In this article we'll look at why I sold my entire position in MSTY and what I am looking for if I decide to take a new position in the future. We'll also look at how long-term holders could look at whether or not to continue to hold in light of significant NAV erosion. Why I sold I initially took a small position in MSTY on February 10, 2025, and gradually engaged in dollar-cost averaging until the total number of shares reached my goal. When the share price started dropping quickly, I sold a small amount of shares to mitigate the NAV erosion. The reason I didn't sell more was because I thought we might be close to a bottom and held onto the bulk of them to see if I was correct. While I ended up selling the remaining shares because of no signs of upward momentum, it remains to be seen if I made the right decision in regard to being close to a bottom. That said, even if the share price recovers some, I won't regret selling them off. The reason why is I was still in the green even after the plunge in NAV because of the distributions paid out and total return, so I didn't want to wait until I was in the red, which would have forced a decision for me to hold onto the shares until they returned to the green. Since the distributions have been falling along with the share price, I didn't want to commit to that potential length of time. Also, note on the chart below that in early April the share price of MSTY didn't move up in conjunction with MSTR as it had in the past; instead, it widened, which suggested to me the market thinks MSTR is going to continue to fall. Seeking Alpha I sold my position primarily because I saw better opportunities to invest in relationship to income-producing ETFs, not because I thought I wouldn't recoup my capital or be, over time, significantly in the green in regard to total returns. The other reason is I think MSTY could fall further, and if it does while MSTR starts to climb in price, I see distributions rising to nice levels once again, even if NAV remains subdued. The scenario I would take another position Taking into account total returns, I made a nice amount of money with MSTY, even after the recent drop in share price. After selling, I thought about whether or not I would take another position in MSTY in the future, and after thinking about it, I would do so without hesitation under the right circumstances. I understand it's difficult to think in terms of finding a bottom with a covered call ETF, but I think we can come close. Because the fund is built for high distributions, I don't think in terms of whether or not the NAV holds, only that it doesn't totally erode at a pace that makes it difficult for distributions to offset that erosion. What I appreciate about MSTY is that even after erosion, I still made some nice gains and believe I can repeat that in the future. With that in mind, what I'm looking for now is for the share price to, in general, stabilize some. There is no doubt in my mind that MSTR is going to resume its upward trajectory in the months and years ahead, based upon my belief that bitcoin is going to continue to increase in price for many years ahead. That means that eventually the distributions of MSTY are going to increase along with that upward price movement. That's true even if the share price doesn't enjoy the same upside as the underlying stock. This is why I'm looking for a lower price point. That not only protects my downside and NAV erosion but also offers an opportunity for distributions to easily overcome whatever erosion comes after taking a new position. I'm not necessarily looking for a specific price point for an entry, but rather a pattern that points to a resumption of and increase in distributions. Why this is important is if the share price of MSTY becomes very cheap, and at that time MSTR starts to sustainably rebound in price, the distributions are going to be disproportionate to the share price and probably generate stronger income than in the past when measured against the cost basis. For those that got in early I know some investors got in early with MSTY and have a high-cost basis and concerning NAV erosion since then. While true, at the same time those that have been holding for a long time in relationship to the time the fund started trading have also experienced extraordinary distributions that those recently taking a position haven't. Let's now look at distributions using $43.00 per share as a starting point. I took that number from the day the share price reached its highest of $46.99 per share on March 24, 2024. The reason for doing so is that after it hit that, there was a huge, very short-term spike that produced its all-time high. The chance of most investors entering a position at that level is very small. There will be a few, but not enough to justify using the all-time high as a reference point for NAV erosion vs. distributions. Based upon the total distributions from March 24, 2024, onward to September 2025, the total number of distributions, assuming taking a position of 1,000 shares, would be $41,770. With the $43.00 per share number, a thousand shares would be $43,000 total. That means at this time, at almost the worst-case scenario for long-term holders of the ETF, they would only be approximately $1,330 from breaking even. Even if MSTY lowers its distribution to under $1.00 per share, it would take under two months to be playing with house money for as long as the ETF is held. Dividend history (Seeking Alpha) Again, that's assuming a higher entry point. On that same day, the share price dropped to under $40.00 per share, so that would give shareholders a solid cost basis. Even for the relative few that may have jumped in at a higher price point, it's easy to see they will break even in the near future. I'm bringing this up because there are many naysayers out there that long-term holders may be tempted to sell. My thought is that considerations of playing with house money for as long as the fund pays out decent distributions are a no-brainer. Let's say the distributions fall to even as low as $0.50 per share. Where else are you going to get that type of return with literally no more risk to your capital? Bear in mind I'm referring to those that got in early at a high price point. Conclusion MSTY is a pure income play. If for any reason it were to trade above cost basis, it would be either temporal or the result of getting in at a bottom. Either way, if the share price rises above the cost basis, it should be considered an anomaly that, over time, is more than likely to correct to the downside. I don't see that happening, especially as the current performance of the ETF has the share price of MSTY widening against the underlying MSTR. The only thing I see changing that over the long term is when the share price of MSTR recovers and the distribution of MSTY increases quicker than the price of MSTR. Even under those conditions, I don't see it ever recovering to the prior lag it had in the past. That doesn't mean it isn't a good vehicle to generate income, only that investors need to take the things into account mentioned above in order to mitigate NAV and enter the trade when MSTR appears ready to run again. Under that scenario, there isn't likely to be a lot of NAV recapture, but there will be a surge in distributions, which should more than offset erosion. Finally, one element not considered seriously enough is how the income is allocated once it is received. I have reinvested in other high-income ETFs, as well as more stable growth holdings that should do well for the long term. In other words, one can't simply take a high-yielding ETF alone and measure its performance. The total picture must be included, and for those that allocate income wisely, the performance is even better than the performance of the standalone ETF.",MSTY,EN,0,0,TRADING|BUSINESS|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-10 09:33:03

According to the Bloomberg report , the Winklevoss twins’ crypto exchange achieved a $3.1 billion valuation at the top of the elevated range. Nasdaq committed $50 million in a private placement at the IPO price, contingent on successful closing. The investment adds credibility while establishing partnership terms for Gemini’s custody and staking services to reach Nasdaq’s client base. JUST IN: Nasdaq to invest $50 million in Bitcoin and crypto exchange Gemini – Reuters pic.twitter.com/MJFSy77YsV — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 9, 2025 From Modest Beginnings to Wall Street Darling The company maintains its 16.7 million share offering despite the significant price increase. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup lead the offering as bookrunners, with trading expected on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker GEMI. Gemini allocates 20% of IPO shares for long-standing users, management, employees, and retail investors through platforms including Robinhood, SoFi, and Webull. The allocation strategy aims to broaden ownership beyond institutional investors. Founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini now manages over $18 billion in platform assets. The exchange offers crypto trading, USD-backed stablecoin, digital asset custody, staking services, and crypto rewards credit cards. The IPO follows Circle Internet Group’s successful $1.2 billion public debut in June, which raised $583 million in net proceeds. In fact, Circle’s strong first quarterly earnings as a public company sent shares up 11% in pre-market trading. Financial Losses Persist Despite Strong Market Demand Gemini reported $282.5 million net loss on $68.6 million total revenue in the six months ending June 30. The losses increased from $41.4 million on $74.3 million in revenue during the same period last year. Contrary to the revenue report, the deteriorating financial performance did not affect strong investor demand for the IPO. The exchange now even competes with larger global rivals, like Coinbase, Binance, and traditional financial institutions entering crypto services. However, Gemini positioned itself as an institutionally friendly platform through strict security protocols and regulatory partnerships. Revenue streams include trading fees, custody services, stablecoin operations, and staking commissions. The business model relies heavily on crypto market activity and trading volumes, which fluctuate significantly with market conditions. Operating expenses continue to exceed revenue as the company invests in technology infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and geographic expansion. Crypto exchange Gemini has unveiled a new product suite for investors across the European Union and European Economic Area, adding Gemini Staking for Ethereum and Solana alongside Gemini Perpetuals, the exchange’s regulated derivatives … https://t.co/148UX6LYMf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 5, 2025 For instance, the recently announced European launch required substantial regulatory approval processes and operational setup costs. Gemini’s credit card offering crypto rewards and stablecoin services also provides diversification beyond pure trading revenue. However, these products remain relatively small contributors to overall revenue generation compared to core exchange operations. Nasdaq Partnership Opens Institutional Gateway The Nasdaq investment establishes a strategic partnership beyond pure financial commitment. Gemini will provide custody and staking services on a non-exclusive basis to Nasdaq clients seeking crypto infrastructure. Nasdaq clients gain access to Gemini’s institutional-grade security protocols, including segregated cold storage and operational controls. The partnership allows traditional finance institutions to access crypto services through established relationships. Vice versa, Gemini’s institutional users also receive access to Nasdaq’s Calypso collateral management platform for traditional and digital assets. The partnership structure follows Nasdaq’s typical investment approach through Nasdaq Ventures for strategic market infrastructure relationships. For both parties, the arrangement allows flexibility for institutional clients requiring diverse service providers. Regarding the European expansion, Gemini Perpetuals launched there under MiFID II permissions, offering up to 100x leverage on perpetual futures contracts. The derivatives platform allows investors to hedge crypto positions and implement complex trading strategies. It also offers cross-collateralization capabilities, which allow clients to use spot balances and staking rewards within integrated strategies. The unified platform approach aims to simplify operations for institutional clients managing diverse crypto exposures.

Strong first-day performances for new listings have encouraged private companies to test public market receptivity. As analysts anticipate, Gemini’s debut could be among the most notable crypto-related offerings since Coinbase’s 2021 public listing, or exhibit a similar Circle’s IPO success.

The ascending trendline provides critical support around $210-212, maintaining the bullish channel structure.

Weekly charts confirm SOL’s position well above the 200-day moving average at $158.43, validating long-term uptrend integrity. Notably, some analysts have discovered a”slow grind higher” pattern that shows consistent respect for ascending trendline support, indicating institutional accumulation providing floors during weakness. This steady advance with minimal volatility often precedes explosive moves as resistance levels are overcome. Based on technical evidence across multiple timeframes, SOL appears positioned for continued bullish momentum toward the $245 target. The immediate focus centers on breaking decisively above $218.60 resistance, which would likely trigger momentum-based buying toward measured move objectives with support maintained around the $210 – $212 ascending trendline.

While DOGE and PENGU continue to capture headlines, analysts suggest LBRETT may be the real star, combining meme appeal with genuine utility. With experts tipping it for 25x gains in Q4, investors are closely rethinking where the biggest upside lies. Dogecoin struggles despite market optimism Dogecoin rose to fame in 2021 when it reached an ATH of $0.73, turning small bets into fortunes. Over the years, DOGE has benefited from viral meme culture, Elon Musk’s sporadic endorsements, and speculations of potential integrations into platforms like X to become the largest meme coin. Recently, DOGE saw spikes in on-chain activity tied to payment testing rumors, but broader adoption has stalled. Its inflationary 150B supply and lack of core upgrades limit upside potential. While DOGE has stability as a brand, investors searching for exponential returns recognize its growth ceiling. That’s where projects like Layer Brett come in—meme-driven yet backed by utility, avoiding the stagnation holding DOGE back. PENGU’s viral appeal faces market realities PENGU has made tremendous progress since April, rising 10x from lows of $0.0037 to above $0.035. Its community-driven buzz has propelled it to become the top meme coin on Solana, dethroning BONK. But despite this spectacular progress, the PENGU price is still down over 38% in the past year, underlining its struggles in translating hype into sustainable price growth. Like many meme coins, it faces liquidity challenges and lacks the deeper utility that keeps investors locked in long-term. PENGU’s ecosystem has energy, but analysts remain skeptical about durability. By contrast, Layer Brett builds on Ethereum’s Layer-2 infrastructure, marrying meme culture with real scalability, giving it a more resilient foundation than PENGU’s hype-driven run. Layer Brett could be the best crypto to buy now Layer Brett (LBRETT) is rapidly separating itself from traditional meme plays. Unlike DOGE and Pengu, LBRETT doesn’t rely solely on community hype—it leverages Ethereum Layer-2 technology to solve network congestion and reduce gas fees while creating a thriving investor ecosystem. Its presale has already raised over $3.2 million, with token value climbing by more than 37%! Key investor incentives lie within the ecosystem. Staking rewards exceeding 750% APY create a stable passive income stream for token holders, with LBRETT’s scarce 10B supply mechanics fueling long-term massive appreciation as demand rises. Presale participants also benefit from a $1M giveaway, which has sparked viral community engagement and insane social buzz as the project’s supporter base grows by the day. More importantly, LBRETT is positioning itself to benefit from the Ethereum Layer-2 ecosystem, which is forecasted to process $10 trillion annually by 2027. Capturing even a tiny share of this massive capital inflow suffices to send the Layer Brett market cap to hobnob with PENGU’s $2.2B, triggering a 100x moonshot for LBRETT. It’s not hard to see why analysts say LBRETT’s combination of utility, scarcity, and meme culture makes it the best crypto to buy now , ahead of DOGE and PENGU. Conclusion DOGE has legacy appeal, and Pengu carries viral charm, but both remain limited by structural weaknesses.

Although the cases that started during the old SEC era have been concluded one by one, a new case has been added. Accordingly, Washington Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency ATM operator Athena Bitcoin. The D.C. attorney general has filed a lawsuit against crypto ATM operator Athena Bitcoin, alleging the company charged hidden fees for deposits it knew were linked to scams and failed to implement adequate fraud prevention measures. Schwalb alleged that the company knowingly collected substantial commission revenue despite 93% of deposits being linked to fraud in its first five months of operation. The DC attorney general also said Athena Bitcoin prevented victims from recovering losses from hidden fees and fraud, and criticized the company's policy of not refunding victims. “Athena’s Bitcoin ATMs have become a tool for criminals seeking to exploit elderly and vulnerable District residents. Athena knows its machines are primarily used by scammers, but chooses to turn a blind eye so it can continue pocketing hidden transaction fees. Today, we are filing a lawsuit to recover District residents' hard-earned money and put an end to this illegal, exploitative behavior before it harms anyone else.” The average amount lost per fraudulent transaction was reportedly $8,000, with one victim reportedly losing a total of $98,000 across nineteen transactions over a period of several days. There are currently 26,850 crypto ATMs in the US, with Athena Bitcoin operating 13% of them. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bad News from Washington Attorney General Brian Schwalb!

While Chainlink (LINK) and Solana (SOL) continue to attract attention with steady upgrades and bullish forecasts, experts are increasingly pointing to Layer Brett ($LBRETT) as the best crypto to buy now. With its presale underway and staking rewards already turning heads, Layer Brett is quickly becoming the talk of the market. Chainlink and Solana price outlook sets the stage Both Chainlink and Solana have made their mark in the current market cycle. Chainlink has become the go-to oracle solution, linking blockchains with real-world data. Predictions suggest LINK could climb further as acceptance grows across DeFi platforms. Solana on the other hand, continues to impress traders with strong network activity, coupled with low fees and fast transactions. Analysts note Solana price could see new highs, especially as interest in blockchain scalability increases. Yet despite positive Chainlink and Solana price predictions, the sheer size of these networks makes dramatic 50x or 100x moves unlikely in the near term. Their growth is more incremental, rewarding patient holders but limiting exponential ROI. Why experts are tipping Layer Brett Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is different. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, it addresses some of crypto’s biggest pain points: high fees, slow throughput, and limited scalability. Instead of being just another meme token, it combines community-driven energy with genuine blockchain utility. This is why analysts are calling it a low-cap gem with enormous upside. Some standout features include: High staking rewards available during presale Lightning-fast Layer 2 transactions with minimal gas fees Fixed supply of 10 billion tokens, driving scarcity Community-first approach blending meme culture with real adoption By solving Ethereum congestion issues while keeping a fun, viral identity, $LBRETT is positioned as more than hype—it’s a project with staying power. How $LBRETT outshines the competition Compared to Chainlink and Solana, Layer Brett offers something unique: early-stage entry. Chainlink already commands billions in market cap, and Solana has grown into a top 10 crypto asset. That leaves less room for the kind of explosive returns smaller projects can offer. With Layer Brett still in its presale, early buyers are positioning themselves before broader market awareness kicks in. Its staking system alone is a powerful draw. Investors can earn rewards immediately while helping secure the ecosystem, something neither Chainlink nor Solana offers at the same scale. Add to that a meme-powered community push, and Layer Brett could easily become one of the top altcoins to watch in the next bull run. Conclusion: the best crypto to buy now While Chainlink and Solana remain solid long-term picks, the potential for exponential growth lies with Layer Brett ($LBRETT). Experts agree that its mix of meme appeal, Layer 2 speed, and staking incentives make it one of the best crypto presales available today. With its early pricing and limited supply, getting in now could feel like buying Solana or Chainlink before they broke into the mainstream. Don’t miss the chance to secure a spot in what could be the next big name in crypto.

Presale period with attractive staking rewards. Enhanced transaction speeds with reduced costs thanks to its Layer 2 foundation. A fixed token supply that promotes scarcity and value appreciation. A strong community focus that merges popular meme culture with practical usability. These features not only set Layer Brett apart but also enhance its appeal as a potential leader in the next wave of cryptocurrency innovations. Comparative Analysis: Why Layer Brett Stands Out While Chainlink and Solana offer reliable investment paths, Layer Brett introduces the excitement of a new venture with substantial growth potential. For those looking for early investment opportunities, this could mirror the early days of other successful cryptos. Layer Brett's strategy includes immediate staking benefits, which are not commonly offered by Chainlink or Solana at the onset. This, along with a vibrant, meme-friendly community, makes it a unique contender in the market. Conclusion With Chainlink and Solana as consistent choices for seasoned investors, Layer Brett represents the thrill of a new and potentially lucrative journey in the cryptocurrency space.

The recent rollercoaster ride of the British Pound, or Sterling , and the UK debt market offers a prime example of how central bank actions and government policies can ripple through global finance, impacting everything from bond yields to investor sentiment, which eventually touches digital asset markets. As we witness a remarkable turnaround in the UK’s financial landscape, let’s delve into the forces driving this newfound Sterling stability and what it means for the broader economic outlook. The latter half of 2022 was a period of intense turbulence for the United Kingdom’s financial markets. A controversial ‘mini-budget’ unveiled by the then-government triggered a dramatic sell-off in UK government bonds, known as gilts, sending their yields soaring and causing the British Pound to plummet against major currencies. Fears of a sovereign debt crisis loomed, threatening the stability of pension funds and raising concerns about the UK’s economic credibility on the global stage. However, swift policy reversals and decisive actions by the Bank of England have since helped to calm the storm, allowing Sterling to regain its footing and the debt market to stabilize. This article explores the journey from crisis to cautious recovery, highlighting the key players and factors involved. Understanding Sterling Stability : A Deep Dive into the UK’s Financial Resilience When we talk about Sterling stability , we are referring to the British Pound’s ability to maintain a relatively steady value against other major currencies, avoiding sharp, unpredictable fluctuations. For a global economy, currency stability is vital for trade, investment, and overall economic confidence. The events of late 2022 severely tested this stability. The Mini-Budget Fallout: A Test of Resilience The mini-budget, announced in September 2022, proposed significant unfunded tax cuts, leading investors to question the sustainability of the UK’s public finances. The market’s immediate reaction was brutal: Rapid Depreciation: Sterling fell to historic lows against the US Dollar, nearing parity. Soaring Gilt Yields: The cost of government borrowing skyrocketed, indicating a loss of investor confidence. Inflationary Fears: The market anticipated that these policies would fuel inflation, forcing the Bank of England to hike interest rates even more aggressively. This period of intense volatility created a challenging environment for businesses and consumers alike, making imports more expensive and eroding purchasing power. The subsequent change in government and the reversal of most of the mini-budget’s proposals were crucial in restoring a semblance of order and beginning the long road back to Sterling stability . The market responded positively to the new government’s commitment to fiscal discipline and transparency, signaling a return of confidence in the UK’s economic management. Navigating the UK Debt Market : From Turmoil to Tranquility? The UK debt market , primarily comprising gilts, is where the government borrows money to fund its spending. Its smooth functioning is paramount for economic health. The crisis highlighted a critical vulnerability related to pension funds. The Gilt Market Crisis Explained The rapid rise in gilt yields triggered a specific problem for UK pension funds, many of which use Liability-Driven Investment (LDI) strategies. LDI strategies involve using derivatives to match long-term liabilities (pension payouts) with assets. When gilt yields surged, these funds faced significant margin calls on their derivatives. To meet these calls, they were forced to sell gilts, further driving down prices and exacerbating the yield spike – a dangerous feedback loop. The situation was dire, threatening the solvency of numerous pension schemes. Here’s a brief overview of the crisis and its resolution: Date/Period Event Impact on UK Debt Market September 23, 2022 Mini-Budget Announcement Gilt yields spike dramatically, Pound plummets. September 28, 2022 BoE Emergency Intervention BoE announces temporary bond-buying program to stabilize market. October 14, 2022 Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng Sacked Political uncertainty, but signals policy shift. October 17, 2022 New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt Reverses Mini-Budget Gilt yields fall, Pound recovers, market confidence improves. Ongoing BoE Phased Withdrawal & QT Gradual return to normal market functioning, quantitative tightening continues. Today, the UK debt market has largely stabilized. Gilt yields have retreated from their peaks, and the immediate threat to pension funds has receded. This stabilization is a testament to the combined efforts of the government and the central bank. The Gilt Market Recovery : What’s Driving the Turnaround? The path to the Gilt market recovery has been multifaceted, driven by a combination of domestic policy shifts and broader market dynamics. The government’s pivot was undoubtedly the most critical domestic factor. Key Drivers of Recovery: Fiscal Credibility Restored: The new government, under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, quickly reversed the controversial tax cuts and committed to a more fiscally responsible path. This included outlining plans to reduce the national debt in the medium term. Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) Re-engagement: The government committed to publishing independent forecasts from the OBR alongside fiscal statements, enhancing transparency and reassuring investors about the realism of economic plans. Improved Investor Confidence: With a clear commitment to sound public finances, both domestic and international investors began to return to the UK gilt market, increasing demand and helping to lower yields. Global Factors: While domestic policy was key, a slight easing in global energy prices and a more measured outlook on global interest rate hikes also contributed to a calmer environment, reducing some of the external pressures on the UK economy and its bond market. The turnaround demonstrates the market’s strong preference for predictability and fiscal prudence. The Gilt market recovery is not just about numbers; it’s about the return of trust in the UK’s economic governance. The Role of Bank of England Intervention : A Lifeline for the Economy Amidst the chaos, the Bank of England intervention was the immediate and decisive force that prevented a systemic financial crisis. Its actions were swift, targeted, and unprecedented in their nature. Emergency Bond-Buying Program On September 28, 2022, the BoE announced a temporary and targeted program to buy long-dated UK government bonds. The objective was clear: to restore orderly market functioning and prevent the forced selling by pension funds from spiraling into a wider financial meltdown. This was not a monetary policy intervention aimed at stimulating the economy, but rather a financial stability operation. Key aspects of the BoE’s intervention: Targeted Purchases: The BoE focused on long-dated gilts, where the selling pressure from LDI funds was most acute. Temporary Nature: The program had a defined end date, signaling to markets that it was an emergency measure, not a permanent return to quantitative easing. Scale: The BoE was prepared to buy up to £65 billion worth of gilts, providing significant liquidity to the market. While the intervention was successful in averting an immediate crisis, it also sparked debate about moral hazard and the blurred lines between monetary and fiscal policy. However, most analysts agree that the Bank of England intervention was a necessary and effective measure to safeguard financial stability. Going forward, the BoE continues its program of quantitative tightening (QT), gradually selling off the bonds it acquired during previous periods of quantitative easing, reflecting its ongoing commitment to fighting inflation. How Global Macroeconomic Trends Intersect with Sterling and Crypto No economy operates in isolation, and the UK’s financial health, including Sterling stability and the Gilt market recovery , is intrinsically linked to broader global macroeconomic trends . For those in the crypto space, understanding these connections is not just academic; it’s crucial for navigating market volatility. Interconnected Markets: From London to the Blockchain Several global trends have influenced and continue to influence the UK’s economic landscape: Global Inflationary Pressures: The surge in energy prices following geopolitical events and lingering supply chain disruptions have fueled inflation worldwide. This forces central banks, including the BoE, to raise interest rates, impacting borrowing costs and economic growth. Aggressive Central Bank Tightening: Major central banks like the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have embarked on aggressive rate-hiking cycles. This creates a challenging environment for other currencies, as higher rates in the US, for example, tend to strengthen the US Dollar (DXY), putting downward pressure on Sterling. Risk Appetite and Flight to Safety: During periods of global uncertainty or financial stress, investors often seek ‘safe-haven’ assets, predominantly the US Dollar. This ‘flight to safety’ can weaken other currencies and also lead to a de-risking in more speculative assets, including cryptocurrencies. For crypto investors, understanding these traditional market dynamics is key. When traditional financial markets, like the UK debt market, experience significant stress, the ripple effects can be felt across all asset classes. Investor confidence wanes, liquidity tightens, and capital often flows out of riskier assets, including digital currencies. Conversely, a return to stability in major economies can create a more favorable environment for risk assets, potentially signaling a renewed appetite for cryptocurrencies. Monitoring indicators like the DXY, global bond yields, and central bank statements can provide valuable foresight for crypto market movements. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead Despite the remarkable turnaround, the UK economy faces significant headwinds. Persistent inflation, a cost-of-living crisis, and the potential for a recession remain key concerns. Public sector strikes and long-term productivity issues also present challenges. However, the restoration of financial credibility offers opportunities for renewed foreign investment and a more stable environment for businesses to plan and grow. The UK’s innovation economy and its role as a global financial hub could benefit from this renewed stability. Actionable Insights for Investors and Crypto Enthusiasts For traditional investors, the current environment demands continued vigilance. Monitoring the Bank of England’s monetary policy decisions, government fiscal announcements, and key inflation data will be crucial for navigating the fixed income and forex markets. For crypto enthusiasts, the lesson is clear: macro matters. The stability of traditional financial systems provides a crucial backdrop for the growth and adoption of digital assets. While crypto aims to be a decentralized alternative, its value and sentiment are often influenced by the ebb and flow of global capital, which is still heavily anchored in traditional finance. Therefore, understanding the nuances of Sterling stability , the health of the UK debt market , the impact of Bank of England intervention , the trajectory of Gilt market recovery , and broader global macroeconomic trends is not just for forex traders. It provides a holistic view of global liquidity, risk appetite, and capital flows – all of which are fundamental drivers for the cryptocurrency market. The journey from crisis to cautious optimism in the UK’s financial markets serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of global finance. The resilience of Sterling and the stabilization of the UK debt market underscore the importance of credible policymaking and decisive central bank action. While challenges remain, the UK has demonstrated its capacity to navigate severe economic turbulence. For participants in the fast-evolving world of digital assets, this saga highlights the critical need to stay informed about traditional financial market developments, as they often provide the foundational context for the broader investment landscape.

While Dogecoin battles to maintain momentum, many DOGE holders are shifting toward Rollblock (RBLK), a rising player in blockchain gaming. With an extensive gaming library and full Ethereum integration, Rollblock has already raised over $11.6 million in its presale, fueling expectations of a 25x outcome that could overshadow DOGE's gradual climb. Why Rollblock Is Backed for a 25x Surge Rollblock is establishing itself as one of the most notable projects in the blockchain industry, boasting a functioning gaming platform with high adoption rates. Within a little more than a year of operation, Rollblock has drawn in over 55,000 players and has processed over $15 million in wagers. The site features an impressive gaming library of over 12,000 titles, including favorites like poker, blackjack, popular slots, and a live sportsbook. New players enjoy an inviting welcome bonus of up to $1,100, and this has fueled its increasing adoption as thousands join the platform daily. A significant reason analysts are backing Rollblock for outsized gains is its tokenomics. The system allocates 30% of the platform's revenue to repurchase tokens every week. Sixty percent of the tokens are burnt completely, which decreases the supply in circulation, and the remaining forty percent goes to stakers. This deflationary theory progressively raises scarcity and also provides concrete benefits to long-term holders. Here are Rollblock's unique offerings: 12,000+ live games and an integrated sportsbook Over 55,000 active players onboarded $15M+ in wagers processed in the first year Weekly buybacks funded by 30% of revenue At its current presale price of $0.068, Rollblock has already raised more than $11.6 million, generating over 500% returns for early participants. With momentum continuing to build, the project is increasingly viewed as a top candidate for a 25x outcome. Dogecoin Surges on Musk-Backed Treasury Move Dogecoin has once again captured market attention as its capitalization surged to $35 billion, fueled by a $200 million treasury initiative connected to Elon Musk's counsel. The treasury, combined with growing optimism around a potential ETF launch, positions DOGE for significant volatility. Currently holding above the $0.209 support level, analysts are closely watching its next move. Source Short-term Dogecoin price prediction models point to the $0.25 test in case bullish momentum continues. Provided that the enthusiasm for the ETFs market remains, Dogecoin could hit $0.30, which is a psychological limit that can attract profit-taking. The latest Dogecoin news points to breakout potential, and recovering to the $0.25 mark could trigger further rallies in the short and long-term, making the meme coin one to watch. RBLK vs. DOGE: Why Rollblock Is Poised to Dominate Rollblock (RBLK) is rapidly attracting investor attention thanks to its live and revenue-generating Web3 gaming platform that blends iGaming, DeFi, and GameFi. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a classic meme coin supported by culture and sentiment. The table below breaks down how these two compare, showing why Rollblock is increasingly seen as the one with real staying power: Feature Rollblock (RBLK) Dogecoin (DOGE) Platform Status Live platform with 12,000+ games, sportsbook, $15M in wagers processed Established blockchain, originally launched as a joke; no active revenue-generating platform User Base / Activity Over 55,000 active players, early presale raised $11.5M+ Strong community following and cultural power, but usage tied to tipping and hype Tokenomics Weekly 30% revenue buybacks, where 60% burned / 40% to stakers; capped supply; deflationary Unlimited supply, inflationary model Performance Raised $11.5M+, 500% price rally; Market behavior is highly influenced by cultural sentiment and social media buzz Growth Potential Utility-driven growth, backed by real revenue and adoption. 20 to 100x price forecast . Growth is sentiment-driven, mainly volatile, and lacking structural scarcity that drives value. While Dogecoin continues to benefit from widespread recognition and cultural momentum, its fundamentals remain speculative and inflationary. In contrast, Rollblock offers a grounded value proposition—with a functioning platform, real user engagement, deflationary tokenomics, and proven revenue flow.

The new feature runs on xStocks, a blockchain platform created by Backed Finance, and is part of Kraken’s global rollout that first began in May. Users in Europe can now trade these assets on-chain, around the clock, no matter when traditional markets are closed. Kraken Co-CEO Arjun Sethi said: “‘Why xStocks? Why tokenized assets?’ Because if you own a share, you should own it. If someone is going to make money off of it, from staking or otherwise, then it should be passed on to the person who owns it, versus the institution, which is how traditional finance works today.” Kraken follows Robinhood’s earlier launch in Europe These blockchain-based shares are designed to track actual stock prices without needing to go through traditional brokers or exchanges. Each token represents a digital version of a stock, but they’re not issued by the actual companies themselves. Instead, they’re created by third parties, giving users the chance to access major U.S. equities without touching the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. Unlike regular shares, the tokenized version can also be used as collateral in other blockchain systems, making them more flexible in crypto-native platforms. The total size of this market is still relatively small, with the tokenized stock market valued at around $421 million. But the trend has already seen competition. Earlier this year, Robinhood launched a similar product for European users. That platform added access to tokenized shares of private companies like OpenAI, a move that later triggered backlash when OpenAI warned investors not to buy them. Kraken’s approach stays closer to traditional names, avoiding private firms and instead sticking to public stocks only. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

51491811,https://bitzo.com/2025/09/exploring-the-future-of-crypto-gaming-with-rollblock-and-dogecoins-market-movements,1757497561,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/51491811.jpeg,Exploring the Future of Crypto Gaming with Rollblock and Dogecoin's Market Movements,https://bitzo.com/2025/09/exploring-the-future-of-crypto-gaming-with-rollblock-and-dogecoins-market-movements,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, two coins have captured the public's attention for different reasons. Dogecoin, the well-known meme coin, continues to show resilient market stability, while Rollblock, a newcomer in the blockchain gaming realm, is making headlines with its impressive presale figures and potential for substantial financial returns. Understanding Dogecoin's Current Market Stance The meme-based cryptocurrency Dogecoin, despite its whimsical origins, has maintained a strong presence in the crypto market. With a market capitalization that recently surged to $35 billion, the coin continues to enjoy the support of high-profile endorsements and speculative interest. Currently, it hovers above the $0.209 support level, with potential sights set on reaching higher valuations, as indicated in a recent analysis . The Rising Star: Rollblock's Entry into Blockchain Gaming While Dogecoin deals with market fluctuations, Rollblock (RBLK) is carving out a niche in the lucrative blockchain gaming industry. In just over a year, Rollblock has attracted over 55,000 players and handled more than $15 million in wagers. The platform offers an extensive array of over 12,000 games, ranging from poker to live sports betting, making it a versatile hub for online gaming enthusiasts. The project's innovative approach to tokenomics, where 30% of the platform's revenue is used for token buybacks and a significant portion is burnt to reduce supply, enhances its appeal. This strategy not only ensures a deflationary model but also rewards long-term stakeholders, setting the stage for potential exponential growth. With an initial offering price of $0.068 and over $11.6 million already raised in its presale phase, Rollblock is poised for significant upscaling, potentially reaching a 25x increase in value as forecasted by several analysts. The excitement around its financial trajectory is palpable, with many seeing it as a clear contender in the crypto space, overshadowing slower gains by more established coins like Dogecoin.

Now compare that to the sharp, seamless world of crypto. Suddenly, betting doesn’t feel stuck in the past. Instead, it feels like you’re holding the reins where transactions are faster, your identity stays guarded, and the whole system feels built for people who value independence. That’s why so many bettors are moving toward online crypto sports betting . It’s not just a trend, but a shift in how the industry defines trust and control. When you dive into the pros of sports betting with cryptocurrency, you realize it’s not just about convenience. It’s about choice. You’re no longer bound by the restrictions of banks, middlemen, or outdated systems. Instead, you get to play on your terms, whether you’re betting on Sunday football, NBA playoffs, or even international soccer under the lights. The Speed Factor Time matters. In regular betting, payouts can feel painfully slow. With crypto, transfers are often near-instant, letting you use your winnings almost as fast as you earn them. One of the biggest benefits of sports betting with digital currency is that you’re never stuck waiting for someone else’s approval. For many players, this is where crypto stops being a curiosity and starts being a necessity. Privacy and Anonymity Another powerful reason bettors are embracing crypto is privacy. Nobody wants to feel like their hobby is being tracked or questioned. Betting with cryptocurrency adds a layer of anonymity that banks and card companies can’t match. It’s not about hiding, but it’s about having the option to keep your financial activities separate. This point is often overlooked in the discussion of sports betting pros and cons, but for everyday users, it’s significant. Control Over Your Wagering When you’re betting in crypto, you control the wallet. That means no third-party freezes, no surprise fees, and no middleman telling you how to use your money. You’re making direct transactions, peer-to-peer, which is a massive part of the pros of sports betting in today’s digital landscape. For many bettors, that level of control isn’t just a perk, but it’s the reason they stick with crypto over traditional banking. Global Access Another overlooked upside? Borders mean a lot less in the crypto world. For international bettors, this is one of the benefits of online sports betting. You don’t have to worry about regional banking restrictions, declined cards, or conversion headaches. As long as the sportsbook accepts crypto, you’re good to go, no matter where you’re betting from. Balancing the Equation: Sports Betting Pros and Cons Of course, no system is flawless. Just like traditional betting, crypto wagering comes with risks. Volatility in coin value, learning curves for new wallets, and navigating which platforms are trustworthy all matter. That’s why, when people discuss the pros and cons of sports betting, it’s essential to consider the whole picture. However, for many bettors, the benefits—speed, privacy, and control—far outweigh the drawbacks, especially as platforms become more user-friendly. Got it — here’s a rougher, more conversational take on the last two sections. I loosened the polish, added some natural phrasing, and gave it more of that blog-style punch you like. Why People Bet with Crypto At the end of the day, people don’t switch to crypto because it sounds fancy—they do it because it just works better. No waiting around for payouts, no awkward calls with your bank, and no big brother watching every move. Ask a regular bettor why they’re making the jump, and you’ll usually hear the same thing: “I want my money fast, I want it private, and I don’t want headaches.” That’s the heart of the pros of sports betting with crypto. And if you’re into advantage play? Crypto gives you a few sneaky edges. You can scoop up bonuses quicker, shift funds between books without a hitch, and keep your bankroll moving instead of letting it sit stuck in limbo. It’s not some magic system—just a smoother, more innovative way to handle the game. Final Thoughts Here’s the bottom line: the pros of sports betting with crypto aren’t hype, but they’re legit fixes to the stuff that’s always annoyed bettors. Faster cashouts, more privacy, and way more control over your own money. That’s it. No frills, no gimmicks, just betting that feels like it finally caught up to the times. Sure, crypto can be a little wild (prices jump, wallets take a minute to figure out, not every site is trustworthy). But compared to sitting around waiting for a payout from a traditional book? Most players will take their chances. Because once you’ve had that first instant withdrawal hit your wallet, going back feels like dialing up the internet on a landline. Crypto isn’t just tweaking sports betting—it’s flipping the switch. And for bettors tired of the old way, that switch feels pretty damn good.

Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has announced a significant expansion to its offerings. The platform is set to list UB perpetual futures , providing traders with fresh avenues to engage with the market. This move could open up considerable opportunities for those looking to capitalize on price movements. What Are UB Perpetual Futures and Why Are They Important? Binance confirmed it will introduce UB perpetual futures with the UB/USDT trading pair. This new listing is scheduled for September 12 at 10:30 a.m. UTC. For many traders, perpetual futures are a popular way to speculate on the future price of an asset without needing to own the underlying asset directly. They are unique because, unlike traditional futures contracts, they don’t have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. This particular listing is noteworthy because it offers up to 50x leverage . Leverage allows traders to open larger positions with a relatively small amount of capital. While this can amplify potential profits, it’s crucial to understand that it also significantly increases the risk of substantial losses. Therefore, a cautious and informed approach is always recommended when engaging with high leverage. Binance Alpha: Early Access to UB In a related and equally interesting development, Binance Alpha will also be adding UB on the same day, but at an earlier time: 8:00 a.m. UTC. Binance Alpha is an on-chain trading platform integrated within the Binance Wallet. It specifically focuses on early-stage coins, aiming to give users access to promising new projects before they gain wider market traction. This dual listing strategy means: Early Exposure: Binance Alpha users get a head start, potentially allowing them to engage with UB at an earlier stage. Broader Access: The subsequent listing of UB perpetual futures on the main Binance platform ensures that a wider audience of derivatives traders can participate. For those keen on discovering emerging assets, Binance Alpha’s inclusion of UB provides a valuable opportunity to explore its potential. How Does 50x Leverage Impact Your UB Perpetual Futures Trading? The offering of up to 50x leverage for UB perpetual futures is a powerful tool. In simple terms, for every $1 you put into a trade, you can control a position worth $50. This can be incredibly appealing for traders who believe they have a strong conviction about UB’s price direction. Imagine a small price movement in your favor – with 50x leverage, your profit could be multiplied significantly. However, the reverse is also true. A small price movement against your position can lead to rapid liquidation of your funds. It’s like driving a high-performance sports car; it can get you to your destination much faster, but it also requires exceptional skill and caution. Therefore, managing risk through stop-loss orders and understanding margin requirements becomes paramount when trading with such high leverage. Navigating the Risks and Rewards of UB Perpetual Futures Engaging with UB perpetual futures , especially with high leverage, requires a balanced perspective on both the potential rewards and inherent risks. On the reward side, traders can: Amplify Gains: Small price changes can lead to significant profits. Hedge Portfolios: Use short positions to protect existing holdings against potential downturns. Capital Efficiency: Control a large position with a smaller initial investment. On the flip side, the risks are equally pronounced: Increased Volatility: Price swings are magnified, leading to quicker liquidations. Margin Calls: The need to deposit more funds to maintain your position if the market moves against you. Market Manipulation: Early-stage coins can sometimes be more susceptible to price manipulation. Always conduct thorough research on UB’s fundamentals and market sentiment before committing capital. Understanding your risk tolerance is key to a sustainable trading strategy. What Does This Mean for the Cryptocurrency Market? Binance’s decision to list UB perpetual futures reflects the ongoing demand for diverse trading instruments in the crypto space. It also highlights the exchange’s commitment to expanding its offerings and providing liquidity for a wide range of assets, including newer ones like UB. For the broader market, this can signal growing interest in UB and potentially increase its trading volume and visibility. The introduction of new derivatives products often leads to increased market activity and can contribute to price discovery. Traders and investors will be closely watching how UB performs following these listings, both on Binance Alpha and the main futures platform. It’s an exciting time for those who thrive on market dynamics and seek out new trading opportunities. In conclusion, the upcoming listing of UB perpetual futures on Binance, coupled with its earlier addition to Binance Alpha, marks a significant event for traders. While the allure of 50x leverage offers considerable upside, it also necessitates a disciplined approach to risk management. As the crypto market continues to evolve, staying informed and trading responsibly remains paramount. This development provides yet another fascinating avenue for participants to explore within the dynamic world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a perpetual future? A perpetual future is a type of derivatives contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, you can hold perpetual futures positions indefinitely, as long as you meet margin requirements. Q2: When will UB perpetual futures be listed on Binance? Binance will list UB/USDT perpetual futures on September 12 at 10:30 a.m. UTC. Q3: What does 50x leverage mean for UB perpetual futures? 50x leverage means you can control a position worth 50 times your initial investment. For example, with $100, you can open a position worth $5,000. While this can amplify profits, it also significantly increases the risk of losses and potential liquidation. Q4: What is Binance Alpha and how does it relate to UB? Binance Alpha is an on-chain trading platform within the Binance Wallet that focuses on early-stage coins. It will add UB on September 12 at 8:00 a.m. UTC, offering users earlier access to the asset before its perpetual futures listing. Q5: What are the main risks associated with trading UB perpetual futures with high leverage? The main risks include rapid liquidation of your capital due to small adverse price movements, margin calls requiring additional funds, and the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, especially for newer assets.

Cryptocurrencies are reshaping the betting landscape, offering a host of advantages that are hard to ignore. The Liberation of Choice in Betting Traditional betting often traps you within the confines of slow financial systems and intrusive data handling practices. In stark contrast, cryptocurrency in sports betting empowers users with more control over their activities without the cumbersome processes associated with conventional bookmaking. The rapid adoption of online crypto sports betting platforms is not merely a trend but a significant shift towards enhanced security and user autonomy in betting. The choice to use cryptocurrency means escaping the clutches of bank-imposed limitations and enjoying an uncompromised betting experience. Enhanced Transaction Speed One of the most compelling advantages of using cryptocurrency for betting is the speed of transactions. Cryptocurrency transactions often complete almost instantly, a stark contrast to the sluggish pace of traditional betting payouts. This rapid transaction speed is not just a convenience but a necessity for many bettors who prefer to have immediate access to their winnings. Privacy and Anonymity in Betting Privacy concerns are paramount in the digital age. Cryptocurrency addresses these concerns by providing a layer of anonymity that traditional banks and credit card companies cannot offer. With cryptocurrency, sports bettors can keep their financial dealings private, ensuring that their betting habits are not subjected to external scrutiny or tracking. Autonomy Over Funds Betting with cryptocurrency puts you in direct control of your funds with no intermediaries to freeze your account or impose hidden charges. This direct peer-to-peer transaction model is what many bettors find appealing, providing them with the freedom to manage their money on their own terms. Global Betting Without Boundaries Cryptocurrency makes international betting effortless. It eliminates common issues such as bank restrictions, card declines, and currency conversion problems. This global accessibility ensures that bettors can participate from anywhere in the world, provided that the sportsbook accepts cryptocurrency. Considering Both Sides: The Pros and Cons of Crypto Betting While the advantages of crypto betting are significant, it is crucial to acknowledge potential drawbacks. These include the volatility of cryptocurrency values, the learning curve associated with new technology, and the diligence needed to choose reliable betting platforms. However, for many, the benefits such as swift transactions, enhanced privacy, and control over personal funds significantly outweigh these challenges, making crypto betting an increasingly preferred option. Why Bettors Choose Cryptocurrency The core reasons bettors are switching to cryptocurrency include quicker access to funds, enhanced privacy, and fewer administrative headaches. Moreover, crypto betting can provide tactical advantages like faster bonus acquisition and smoother fund transfers between accounts. Concluding Insights Cryptocurrency is not merely adjusting the mechanics of sports betting—it's revolutionizing them. For many bettors, the transition to crypto betting is a welcome change, offering speed, privacy, and control that traditional betting methods cannot match. While the cryptocurrency market may have its complexities, the benefits for sports betting are clear, making it an appealing option for those looking to modernize their betting practices.

Among hundreds of altcoins competing for attention, three projects stand out as potential breakout winners: Ozak AI (OZ) , Solana (SOL), and Pepe (PEPE). While Solana has already established itself as a leading blockchain, and Pepe continues to ride meme coin momentum, Ozak AI is quickly emerging as one of the most exciting presale opportunities of 2025, with analysts predicting a possible 100x ROI. Ozak AI: The Rising AI-Driven Presale Ozak AI is capturing investor interest by blending artificial intelligence with blockchain innovation. Designed to provide predictive analytics, AI-powered trading models, and real-time market insights, the project brings a strong utility-focused approach to a market often dominated by hype. Its infrastructure leverages Arbitrum Orbit for scalability, EigenLayer AVS for decentralized validation, and the Ozak Stream Network for data processing, making it highly attractive for both retail and institutional use. Currently in Stage 5 of the Ozak AI presale at $0.01, Ozak AI has already raised over $2.8 million and sold more than 860 million tokens. The project has completed both internal and CertiK audits and is already listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, adding transparency and credibility. Partnerships with platforms like Dex3 and Hive Intel further reinforce its ecosystem strength. With analysts predicting a $1 target price post-launch, Ozak AI could deliver a 100x return, making it one of the most explosive altcoin opportunities of 2025. Solana (SOL) Solana has set itself up as one of the leading layer-1 blockchains, regarded for its high-speed transactions and low charges. At its current rate of $214, Solana keeps drawing builders in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 gaming, making it a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem. From a technical perspective, Solana faces resistance at $225, $240, and $260, at the same time as maintaining robust help at $200, $185, and $170. Analysts consider SOL may want to climb closer to $500 in the next bull run, supplying traders a capability of a 2x–3x return. While its upside might not rival that of Ozak AI, Solana’s mounted role and developing ecosystem make it a reliable play for portfolio diversification. Pepecoin (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) has quickly ended up as one of the most recognizable meme coins in the market, with its network-based increase and viral presence fueling demand. Trading at $0.00001023, Pepe flourishes on retail speculation and social media hype. Its technicals show resistance at $0.00001150, $0.00001300, and $0.00001500, at the same time as support holds at $0.00000900, $0.00000850, and $0.00000780. If market sentiment for meme coins keeps into 2025, analysts endorse Pepe to submit a 20x–25x rally, worthwhile for high-threat traders who thrive on volatility. However, unlike Ozak AI and Solana, Pepe’s upside is predicated more on hype cycles than on long-term utility. Ozak AI, Solana, and Pepe represent three very different opportunities for investors in 2025. Solana provides stability and consistent growth as a leading blockchain, Pepe offers speculative meme coin gains, and Ozak AI delivers the promise of 100x ROI with real-world AI-driven use cases. For those seeking life-changing upside, Ozak AI’s presale may be the most explosive of the three, while Solana and Pepe remain solid complementary plays. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

The issuer said both funds now hold the largest AUM in their respective categories among Canadian peers, underscoring a sharp acceleration in institutional and retail demand for regulated exposure to Solana and XRP. Investor Demand Surges For 3iQ’s SOL And XRP ETFs SOLQ, a Toronto Stock Exchange–listed Solana staking ETF that debuted in April, benefited from marquee early allocations. The firm disclosed a lead investment from SkyBridge Capital and additional commitments from ARK Invest, which bought SOLQ through its ARKW and ARKF ETFs—moves it touted as the first US-listed ETFs to gain exposure to Solana and its staking rewards via a Canadian vehicle. Management fees on SOLQ remain waived until April 2026, the issuer added.

The issuer said Ripple participated as an early investor. “The momentum behind SOLQ and XRPQ demonstrates that Canadian investors and global leaders in the digital asset space are embracing secure, transparent, and regulated access to digital assets,” said Pascal St-Jean, the issuer’s president and CEO. “As the market leaders, these ETFs exemplify [our] commitment to meeting investor demand while setting a benchmark for innovation in the global market.” Related Reading: XRP Set to Lead Altcoin Boom With Explosive $9.69 Target, Says Analyst The rise of these funds comes amid a broader wave of Canadian altcoin ETF launches this year. Multiple issuers have introduced spot Solana products—some with staking features and introductory fee waivers—while the domestic XRP lineup has also expanded, creating a competitive field against which SOLQ and XRPQ now claim the AUM crown. Institutional signaling has been a secondary driver. ARK’s purchase framed SOLQ as a vehicle for capturing both SOL price performance and on-chain staking economics in a regulated wrapper. “Solana represents a high-performance blockchain infrastructure with significant potential for decentralized applications and finance,” ARK’s Cathie Wood said when confirming the investment earlier this year. Contextually, Canada remains a first mover on listed crypto exposures beyond bitcoin and ether. In the United States, investors only recently gained a Solana ETF with staking economics via the REX-Osprey SSK product, while several US spot XRP ETF filings await regulatory decisions later in 2025—developments that help explain the cross-border interest in Canadian listings in the interim. A SSK-style Dogecoin ETF by REX-Osprey is set to launch this Thursday. At press time, XRP traded at $2.955.

Whales Eye a $0.035 Token With Real Utility and 50x Upside,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-to-buy-today-for-long-term-roi-whales-eye-a-0-035/,"Market veterans have seen it all: hype tokens that pump and collapse, and blue chips like BTC and ETH becoming overbought to the point where new investors struggle to find meaningful upside. Today, whales are quietly shifting focus away from these crowded assets and turning their attention to early-stage projects with real utility. Among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.035, is emerging as a standout. Analysts describe it as a long-term ROI play that combines strong fundamentals with a token model designed to scale, making it one of the most talked-about entries of 2025. Why $0.035 Today Sets Up a 50x Future At a presale price of $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) still offers what traders call ground-floor entry. Phase 1 buyers who entered at $0.01 already sit on threefold paper returns, while Phase 6 investors are locking in the last discounted tickets before the price rises to $0.040. Whales have long thrived on asymmetric opportunities like this — where the risk is defined by early exposure, and the upside stretches exponentially once exchange listings begin. When comparing is crypto a good investment, the deciding factor is usually long-term growth backed by real-world mechanics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building toward a model that insiders believe could deliver up to 50x gains after its full launch. By embedding revenue-backed token buybacks into its structure and releasing a stablecoin pegged to $1 through overcollateralized loans, the token creates consistent demand pressure. Investors aren’t just buying a narrative; they are positioning into an ecosystem that will generate its own value loop as adoption increases. Real Utility Driving Long-Term Value Unlike hype-driven projects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being designed with usability at its core. The protocol integrates borrowing, lending, and stablecoin issuance under a structure where predictable interest rates keep repayment terms stable. Borrowers will know exactly what they owe, and lenders will receive fair yields determined by utilization levels in each pool. This predictability contrasts sharply with traditional banks, where shifting rates and hidden costs create uncertainty for both sides of the transaction. In Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s system, liquidity is always protected by loan-to-value thresholds — 75% for assets like ETH or stablecoins and 35–40% for highly volatile tokens. Reserve factors from 10% to 35% ensure fees are aligned with risk levels, safeguarding solvency across all market conditions. For investors asking why is crypto down after each major market dip, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a direct answer: sustainable DeFi projects with built-in risk controls are the ones that will hold value while others collapse. Presale Progress as a FOMO Driver Momentum in the presale has been undeniable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised $15.51 million with over 16,200 holders secured. Phase 6 is 35% sold out, and once the current price of $0.035 closes, the token will step up to $0.040. That represents an automatic 15% increase for those who wait too long. For whales and retail alike, timing is everything. Those who accumulate now will capture the last discounted allocation before listings ignite open-market price discovery. For those waiting, the opportunity will already have slipped away. Before committing millions, whales always scrutinize one thing: security. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has cleared that barrier with a CertiK audit that scored 95 on Token Scan and 78 on Skynet monitoring. To further reinforce trust, the team has launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty program, rewarding white-hat testers for uncovering any vulnerabilities. This focus on protection addresses the single largest concern that institutions and whales raise before allocating capital — the risk of exploit or failure. A major catalyst will come as soon as the token lists, when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its beta platform. This timing ensures investors will not wait long before the ecosystem becomes fully interactive. To generate excitement, the team is running a $100,000 giveaway campaign that will reward ten winners with $10,000 each in MUTM. These initiatives highlight the project’s strategy of blending retail enthusiasm with whale-grade fundamentals to create a balanced and engaged investor base. Why ROI Is About Holding Whales know that the true returns in crypto don’t come from short flips but from conviction. Investors who entered BTC at $300 or ETH at $20 didn’t question daily moves or worry during each crypto crash — they held until the market validated their foresight. Today, the same conviction applies to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.035. Analysts already project a listing price of $0.06, and as adoption scales through lending, stablecoin activity, and staking, long-term multiples are expected to unfold naturally. The last discounted presale phase is already 35% sold, and whales are accumulating. Retail investors who hesitate risk paying more at the very next step.

Introduction to the Future Stars of Cryptocurrency With hundreds of options available, certain altcoins like Ozak AI, Solana, and Pepe are grabbing the spotlight due to their unique offerings and potential for high returns. The Emergence of Ozak AI in the Crypto Scene The Ozak AI project is carving a niche in the blockchain world by merging cutting-edge artificial intelligence with cryptocurrency, focusing on predictive analytics and AI-driven trading strategies. This makes Ozak AI not just a technological innovation but a potential financial boon for early investors. As Ozak AI advances through its presale stages, currently priced at $0.01 in Stage 5, it has raised significant capital and attracted a large number of token buyers. The project aims for a future valuation of $1 per token, suggesting a dramatic return on investment. Why Solana Remains a Top Pick Long known for its fast transaction speeds and low fees, Solana continues to be a cornerstone in the DeFi, NFT, and Web3 sectors. Despite facing stiff price resistances, Solana's established role and ongoing development make it a reliable option for diversifying investment portfolios. Pepe: Riding the Wave of Meme Coin Popularity Pepe, the meme coin that has built a substantial following through community engagement and social media influence, presents a high-risk, high-reward option for investors. With its price subject to the whims of market sentiment around meme coins, Pepe could see an explosive increase in value if the current interest persists into 2025. Comparative Insights While all three coins differ vastly in their foundations—Ozak AI's tech-driven platform, Solana's robust infrastructure, and Pepe's community-driven appeal—they each offer unique opportunities for investors. For those seeking explosive growth, Ozak AI's presale might be the most intriguing due to its high potential ROI driven by real-world applications of AI in crypto.

The footage described the current market positioning of XRP, pointing to an upcoming decision window in October tied to spot ETF applications. JackTheRippler framed the discussion as a sign that the asset could soon see price increases tied to institutional demand, as multiple spot XRP ETF applications are pending with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BREAKING: The Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Germany says that #XRP will experience a price increase due to the launch of Spot XRP ETFs on October! pic.twitter.com/QOLOSsHba9 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) September 9, 2025 ETF Deadlines Approaching in October The video explained that XRP was trading around $3.01, following a sharp rebound during the weekend , and that the market appeared to be waiting for a clear breakout. The speaker noted that this move would not occur in isolation, emphasizing that XRP tends to react along with other major digital assets. He highlights the importance of a news or market trigger that could trigger momentum, later amplified by the potential approval of spot XRP ETFs. The speaker pointed to the mid-October timeframe, highlighting multiple spot XRP ETF applications that require approval , and suggesting that the SEC would likely not push the decision further. Between October 18 and October 25, the SEC is expected to announce whether the pending applications will be granted, with the possibility that multiple approvals could be released simultaneously, mirroring the approach taken with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Potential Effects of Institutional Access The speaker also referenced futures trading activity, noting that CME Group’s XRP futures have traded successfully over the past few months. He presented this development as a positive sign of market maturity and demand, strengthening the case for substantial inflows once a spot ETF becomes available. Institutional products typically attract capital that might not otherwise enter the market, and a regulated vehicle for XRP could accelerate participation. While the video avoided specific predictions, the suggestion that demand for spot XRP ETFs would be large resonates with experts who have predicted inflows of up to $5 billion in the first month after approval. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If approval comes in October, it could mark the most significant regulatory development for XRP since the resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC . Institutional-grade investment products would expand access, potentially increasing liquidity and deepening the market base. The Frankfurt discussion suggested that the groundwork for such a shift is already visible in derivatives trading, providing an early indication of how demand might scale once ETFs launch.

Even for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the broader economic landscape dictates sentiment and liquidity, making expert analysis invaluable. Today, we delve into Bank of America’s (BofA) recently refreshed AUD/NZD forecast , a development that offers significant forex trading insights for anyone looking to navigate the complex interplay of currency valuations and global economic forces. This detailed examination will not only shed light on a key cross-currency pair but also provide a lens through which to view broader currency market trends impacting your overall investment strategy. Decoding the AUD/NZD Forecast: Why This Pair Matters The Australian Dollar (AUD) and the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) are often referred to as “commodity currencies” due to their strong correlation with global commodity prices, particularly those of agricultural products and raw materials. Both economies are heavily reliant on exports, making them sensitive to shifts in global demand and trade relations. Understanding the AUD/NZD forecast is paramount for traders and investors for several reasons: Economic Bellwethers: These currencies act as proxies for global growth sentiment, especially concerning China, a major trading partner for both Australia and New Zealand. Interest Rate Differentials: Monetary policy decisions by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) create significant interest rate differentials, which are a primary driver for carry trades and currency valuation. Diversification: For those heavily invested in other asset classes, including digital assets, monitoring these traditional currency pairs can offer diversification benefits and insights into broader macroeconomic shifts. Bank of America’s updated perspective on this pair provides a timely opportunity to re-evaluate existing positions and consider new forex trading insights based on expert projections. BofA’s Latest AUD/NZD Forecast: What Are the Key Revisions? Bank of America Global Research has provided a significant update to its AUD/NZD forecast , reflecting evolving economic conditions and central bank postures. The previous expectation for the pair had been adjusted, signaling a nuanced shift in their outlook. While specific figures are proprietary, the essence of BofA’s revision typically revolves around several core drivers: Monetary Policy Divergence: BofA’s analysis often scrutinizes the relative hawkishness or dovishness of the RBA versus the RBNZ. A stronger conviction on one central bank raising or holding rates more aggressively than the other can significantly alter the pair’s trajectory. For instance, if the RBNZ is perceived to maintain higher rates for longer compared to the RBA, it could lend support to the NZD against the AUD. Commodity Price Movements: Given their commodity currency status, changes in the outlook for key exports like iron ore (for Australia) and dairy products (for New Zealand) directly influence the terms of trade and, consequently, the respective currencies. BofA’s refreshed view would incorporate the latest commodity price projections. Global Growth Trajectory: The health of the global economy, particularly growth in major trading partners like China, plays a pivotal role. A slowdown or acceleration in global growth can disproportionately affect export-oriented economies. These revisions are not mere academic exercises; they provide concrete forex trading insights that can inform strategic decisions for the coming quarters. Strategic Forex Trading Insights: Navigating the New Landscape For traders, understanding the implications of BofA’s refreshed AUD/NZD forecast is paramount. This isn’t just about knowing a number; it’s about interpreting the underlying economic rationale and translating it into actionable forex trading insights . Here’s how you might approach the new landscape: Identify Key Support and Resistance Levels: Based on the revised forecast, traders should look for new technical levels where the market might find floors or ceilings. These levels become crucial for entry and exit points. Assess Interest Rate Differentials: If BofA’s analysis points to a widening or narrowing of the interest rate gap between Australia and New Zealand, this can be a strong signal for carry trades. A higher yield in one currency makes it more attractive to hold. Monitor Economic Data Releases: While BofA provides a forecast, real-time economic data (inflation, employment, GDP) from both countries will continuously test and potentially validate or invalidate the projections. Staying updated is key. Risk Management: Any forecast, no matter how robust, comes with inherent risks. Traders should always employ sound risk management techniques, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes appropriate to their risk tolerance. The confluence of fundamental analysis (like BofA’s report) and technical analysis forms the bedrock of successful forex trading strategies . What Are the Dominant Currency Market Trends Shaping AUD/NZD? Beyond the immediate forecast, it’s essential to place BofA’s analysis within the broader context of prevailing currency market trends . Several macro forces are currently influencing the AUD/NZD pair and could either amplify or counteract BofA’s projections: Global Inflationary Pressures: While central banks globally are fighting inflation, the pace and success of these efforts vary. Persistent inflation in one economy over the other could force different monetary policy paths, creating divergence. Geopolitical Developments: Events such as trade disputes, conflicts, or shifts in major power dynamics can impact global supply chains and commodity flows, directly affecting commodity-sensitive currencies. China’s Economic Performance: As mentioned, China is a critical factor. Any significant policy changes, stimulus measures, or economic slowdowns in China will send ripples through the Australian and New Zealand economies, influencing their respective currencies. Risk Sentiment: In periods of global uncertainty, investors often flock to safe-haven currencies (like the USD, JPY, CHF). The AUD and NZD, being higher-beta currencies, tend to suffer in such environments, while a “risk-on” sentiment can boost them. Understanding these overarching currency market trends allows traders to develop a more holistic perspective and adapt their strategies dynamically. BofA Analysis: How Does Institutional Insight Impact Your Global Economic Outlook? The significance of a detailed BofA analysis extends far beyond just one currency pair. Institutional reports like these are integral to shaping the global economic outlook for a vast array of market participants, from individual retail traders to large hedge funds and multinational corporations. Here’s why such analysis holds considerable weight: Comprehensive Research: Major banks like BofA dedicate extensive resources to economic research, employing teams of economists, strategists, and analysts who gather and process vast amounts of data. This depth of analysis is hard for individual traders to replicate. Market Influence: When a prominent institution like BofA revises its forecast, it can influence market sentiment and even trigger initial market movements as other participants react to the new information. Benchmark for Comparison: For many traders, institutional forecasts serve as a benchmark against which they can compare their own analysis. Disagreements with institutional views can sometimes present unique trading opportunities, but only after careful consideration. Risk Assessment: These reports often highlight potential risks and opportunities, helping investors fine-tune their overall portfolio risk assessment. Integrating insights from a robust BofA analysis into your own decision-making process can significantly enhance your understanding of the broader financial landscape and refine your global economic outlook . What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for AUD/NZD Traders? While BofA’s refreshed forecast provides a roadmap, the journey for AUD/NZD traders is rarely without bumps. Understanding both the potential pitfalls and lucrative prospects is key. Challenges: Volatility: Both the AUD and NZD can be highly volatile, especially in response to commodity price swings, Chinese economic data, or unexpected central bank announcements. This requires careful risk management. Correlation Risks: The high correlation between AUD and NZD means that broad market shocks affecting one often impact the other, sometimes limiting diversification benefits within the pair itself. Unexpected Policy Shifts: Central banks can surprise markets with unexpected rate decisions or forward guidance, quickly invalidating prior forecasts. Opportunities: Carry Trade Potential: If interest rate differentials are expected to widen in a favorable direction, the AUD/NZD pair can offer attractive carry trade opportunities. Relative Value Plays: Discrepancies in economic performance or central bank rhetoric between Australia and New Zealand, even if minor, can create relative value trading opportunities. Leveraging BofA’s Insights: By carefully dissecting the BofA analysis , traders can identify high-conviction scenarios and position themselves accordingly, potentially gaining an edge from institutional perspectives. Staying agile and informed about the latest currency market trends will be paramount for capitalizing on these opportunities. Seizing the Moment: Actionable Takeaways from the AUD/NZD Forecast The refreshed AUD/NZD forecast from Bank of America offers a pivotal moment for traders to re-evaluate their strategies and capitalize on emerging currency market trends . Here are the key actionable insights: Stay Informed on Central Bank Policies: Closely monitor RBA and RBNZ statements, inflation data, and employment figures. Divergence in monetary policy will likely be the primary driver of the AUD/NZD pair. Track Commodity Prices: Keep an eye on global commodity markets, particularly iron ore, coal, and dairy, as these significantly influence the Australian and New Zealand economies. Watch China’s Economic Health: China’s economic performance and policy decisions will continue to exert a powerful influence on both the AUD and NZD. Integrate BofA’s Analysis: Use the detailed BofA analysis as a cornerstone for your fundamental understanding, but always cross-reference with other sources and your own technical analysis. Practice Prudent Risk Management: Given the inherent volatility of Forex markets, always employ stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes effectively to protect your capital. In conclusion, BofA’s refreshed AUD/NZD forecast is more than just a prediction; it’s a valuable compass for navigating the intricate waters of the Forex market. By diligently integrating these expert forex trading insights into your strategy and maintaining a keen awareness of the broader global economic outlook and currency market trends , you can position yourself for success in this dynamic financial landscape. The interplay of monetary policy, commodity prices, and geopolitical factors will continue to shape this pair, demanding continuous vigilance and adaptability from astute traders.

But zooming out, experts suggest that the crypto asset’s overall upward trend remains clear. Ether’s Multi-Front Surge Against Bitcoin Since early August, ETH has overtaken Bitcoin in spot market dominance, capturing 32.9% of total share against BTC’s 32.6%. During the week of August 18-25, Ethereum’s share peaked at 41%, which coincided with the total ETH spot volume reaching $480 billion compared to Bitcoin’s $400 billion, according to the latest stats shared by CryptoRank. Futures markets further validate this momentum, as ETH futures volume surpassed Bitcoin’s since mid-July and reached an all-time high of $3.08 trillion in August. Open interest currently stands at $59 billion, about 15% off its peak, showing some cooling but still reflecting substantial positioning. A critical driver has been Ethereum ETFs, which attracted roughly $10 billion in net inflows in 2025. Cumulative ETF spot volume is approaching $200 billion, now making up 16% of ETH’s total spot volume, which is a record high. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s ETHA dominates this segment, as it handles 74% of ETF trading volume, while ETH ETF assets under management have reached $25 billion, amidst strong institutional interest. Still, Ethereum ETFs are on their longest outflow streak since April, six consecutive days, which hints at short-term momentum loss. On-chain, Ethereum continues to set records with total value locked at $258 billion, monthly active addresses at 51.7 million, and decentralized exchange volume at $140 billion. Furthermore, exchange balances are at a three-year low, which means that demand remains resilient. While a pause is evident, Ethereum’s broader trajectory suggests further upside potential remains intact. Silent Compression Altcoin Vector also echoed a similar sentiment in its latest observation and explained that the market phase has shifted away from Ethereum and toward low-cap tokens. This trend has previously signaled waning altcoin focus and often leads capital rotation back into Bitcoin. However, the picture isn’t entirely bearish for ETH. The analysis highlights that Ethereum may be undergoing an accumulation phase, with compression building beneath the surface. This could potentially set the stage for its next upward leg once momentum returns.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis It has admittedly been a while since Bitcoin made a decisive move, and while crypto degens might not be too impressed, seasoned pros are more than happy to sit back and let this broader accumulation phase play out. So far today, $BTC is up 0.76% and is holding strong above last week’s breakout, when it surged past a falling wedge pattern with solid momentum. Zooming into the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is now facing strong resistance around the $113K level (highlighted by the blue box). The good news? A clean upward-sloping trendline is providing strong support, pushing Bitcoin into a triangle pattern. And given the broader bullish trend, a breakout above this consolidation zone looks likely. If $BTC clears this resistance, the next immediate target would be $117,400 – a neat 4.5% move from current levels. BLS Revision Cuts 911,000 Jobs, Wobbling Bitcoin But Hyping Up Bitcoin Hyper’s $14.8M Presale September 10, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) just cut 911,000 jobs from payroll data, with 880,000 of them coming from the private sector. The news hindered Bitcoin’s progress, causing it to fall from $113K to little over $110K in less than a day. The Kobeissi Letter broke down the news and the long-term implications, suggesting that ‘asset owners will reap the rewards’, hinting that Bitcoin will bounce back once investor confidence recovers and following the coming Fed rate cuts. The prediction came to fruition faster than expected, as Bitcoin is already nearing $113K . A $115K breakout could catapult $BTC close to $129K. If that happens, Bitcoin’s coming Layer 2, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could see a massive surge in Q4. The presale is already at $14.8M thanks to the growing community support and the investors’ confidence in the project’s long-term viability. You can read our price prediction for $HYPER right here. Analyst Predicts Altcoins to Outperform BTC in Q4 – Bitcoin Hyper Nears $15M September 10, 2025 • 10:00 UTC According to crypto analyst Michael Van De Poppe, altcoins could upstage Bitcoin in Q4 as weakening macro conditions point to a Fed rate cut. I think that we’ll be at the end of the correction relatively soon, which would likely signal that altcoins are going to outperform Bitcoin, and I think that we’ll see a bullish Q4. —Michaen Van de Poppe, X Post But which altcoins will lead the surge? Beyond heavyweights like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, the best altcoin to buy now is Bitcoin Hyper. The upcoming layer-2 solution for Bitcoin is built using Solana’s Virtual Machine, and brings speed and programmability to the network. It could open up the doors for DeFi, meme coins, NFT, and broader Web3 innovation on Bitcoin. But investors have only a short window to buy the native crypto $HYPER for discounted prices, as the presale is about to break $15M.

The approval closes months of uncertainty caused by a hidden flaw in the original LEASH code that undermined its fixed-supply design, as the team had earlier noted . LEASH was initially marketed as a scarce asset. However, the contract included a rebase mechanism that could alter supply under certain conditions, even after developers claimed the keys were burned. The contract retained a “hidden-in-plain-sight” control path, with pre-authorized proxies still able to trigger supply changes. The flaw dated back to 2020 and was eventually exploited, eroding confidence in what was supposed to be a hard-capped token - causing a 20% jump in token supply earlier this year. The new version is intended to close that loophole permanently. Hexens, known for audits of Polygon zkEVM and LayerZero, examined both the LEASH v2 token and its migration system. Developers said the contract cannot mint new tokens under any circumstances following the new fixes, and that the full supply of v2 has already been minted into a multisignature wallet. During migration, v1 tokens will be locked or burned while v2 tokens are released from the multisig in proportion to each holder’s entitlement. The redesign is based on OpenZeppelin ERC-20 libraries to keep the token simple and auditable. Any advanced features, such as privacy layers, would be added later through wrappers rather than changes to the base token.

Analysts are eyeing a stunning launch splash that may transform a modest $200 investment into a potential $10,000 profit. Mutuum Finance presale currently stands at Stage 6 at $0.035. The platform has already secured more than $15.5 million in capital and boasts more than 16,150 token holders. With growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building momentum for its innovative model of borrowing, lending, and liquidity management, sparking speculation over a breakout listing. With its soon-to-be-listed token already causing tongues to start wagging in the marketplace, investors and traders are watching MUTM for indications of early strength. Presale Mutuum Finance has already gone into presale stage 6 where the token can be purchased at $0.035. The project already has more than 16,150 token holders, and already raised more than $15.5 million. FOMO is moving at lightning speed. Early buyers are on track for life-changing returns. Shaping the Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance is tipped to be a key player as DeFi extends its reach globally. The platform is built with institutional and retail investors in mind. Mutuum Finance is making massive jumps with its revolutionary smart contract paradigm and emphasis on security and scalability. Mutuum finance also launched a $100,000 giveaway where 10 users are to be given $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The campaign is an example of the project’s focus towards establishing a long-term and loyal group of users. DeFi Lending Based on a Strong Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance’s way of DeFi ensures that as the platform user you’re always in control of your assets. Through lending, users are rewarded with passive income from borrowers and lenders, and access to funds is instant by borrowing multiple assets across loan value. The project abandons the old ways with a solution that merges Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) styles of borrowing and lending. With the P2C mechanism, lending pools are managed by smart contracts which vary interest rates in synchronization with market fluctuation. The P2P mechanism, in contrast, removes intermediaries through direct conversations between lenders and borrowers. Any volatile asset demands such a fully-decentralized approach, which offers consumers utmost flexibility. Official Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance also introduced an official bug bounty program in collaboration with CertiK for bug hunters and has a maximum reward cap of $50,000. Rewards will be rated as critical, major, minor and low and paid out in a decreasing order so that the platform and make the system stable. Anyone who wants to join can do it. Sturdy oracle infrastructure supports price discovery. Chainlink data feeds need also to provide stable USD and local asset prices like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feeds, and on-chain DEX stats provide accuracy in the form of timely and accurate valuations for collateral management and liquidation protocol. This new decentralized finance titan uses Loan-to-Value assumption on collateral ratio limits and transferring liquidation risk to risky work and compensating liquidators. Reserve factor is then used as a proxy to keep the content of interest in effect for what is effectively the same as a default and adverse market condition buffer to place additional reserve at risk on riskier assets. Mutuum listing (MUTM) is hot on the heels as experts forecast explosive expansion, with a $200 investment reaching $10,000 when listed. Stage 6 presale tokens are at $0.035, with over $15.5M raised and 16,150+ holders already signed up. The project guarantees state-of-the-art lending and liquidity solutions, a $50K CertiK bug bounty, and a $100K giveaway to encourage early adoption. With better oracle infrastructure and robust risk management, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a next-generation DeFi pioneer. Join Stage 6 today and secure low entry before the price increase next time.

As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, so too do the tactics of malicious actors. For crypto enthusiasts and businesses, protecting digital assets and sensitive information from cunning email attacks like phishing, malware, and business email compromise is paramount. This escalating arms race has prompted a crucial innovation: AI Email Security . Former Google security pioneers are now stepping up, launching AegisAI with a substantial $13 million in seed funding to create autonomous AI agents designed to neutralize these threats before they even reach your inbox. This groundbreaking approach promises a new era of digital defense, vital for anyone navigating the complexities of the online financial world. Confronting the Escalating Cybersecurity Threats in the AI Era In an age where AI tools are readily available, hackers are leveraging them to launch mass-scale, highly convincing email attacks. This surge in sophisticated cyber threats poses a significant challenge for individuals and organizations alike, making robust defense mechanisms more critical than ever. The statistics are stark: according to the U.S. federal cybersecurity agency CISA, over 90% of successful cyberattacks originate from a phishing email. What’s even more alarming is a recent CrowdStrike study, which revealed that phishing messages generated by large language models (LLMs) achieved an astonishing 54% click-through rate in 2024. This figure dramatically overshadows the mere 12% rate for human-written emails, underscoring the formidable power of AI in crafting deceptive communications. These cybersecurity threats are not just an inconvenience; they represent a direct pipeline to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. The traditional defenses are struggling to keep pace, necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach email security. AegisAI’s Breakthrough: Autonomous AI Agents for Unrivaled Phishing Protection Enter AegisAI, a new email security startup emerging from stealth with a clear mission: to stop phishing, malware, and business email compromise threats proactively. Co-led by Accel and Foundation Capital, their $13 million seed funding underscores the industry’s belief in their innovative solution. At the heart of AegisAI’s strategy are its autonomous AI agents . These agents are designed to inspect, analyze, and neutralize email threats in real-time, operating without reliance on static rules or extensive user training. This is a stark contrast to typical email security platforms that often depend on predefined rulesets, which can quickly become outdated as threat actors evolve their methods. AegisAI aims to provide unparalleled phishing protection by dynamically adapting to new attack vectors, ensuring a more resilient and effective defense. Cy Khormaee, co-founder of AegisAI, emphasizes the core problem they are solving: “The sum of all evil is a PDF attachment in an email. That’s always where all the attacks started, and so I really wanted to solve this problem.” This targeted approach signifies a deep understanding of the adversaries’ favored tactics. From Google’s Front Lines to Pioneering AI Email Security The vision behind AegisAI is forged from extensive experience at the forefront of digital defense. Co-founders Cy Khormaee and Ryan Luo bring a wealth of knowledge from their tenure at Google, where they were instrumental in building some of the internet’s most robust security systems. Khormaee, who served as head of product and director of product management at Google for over five years, led the security team responsible for safeguarding Google, its four billion users, and four million websites from phishing, malware, and fraud. His work encompassed critical products like Safe Browsing, reCAPTCHA, and Web Risk. It was during this time that he collaborated with Luo, who dedicated almost a decade to Google and was a key member of the Safe Browsing team. This firsthand experience provided Khormaee with invaluable insights into developing sophisticated phishing detection technologies, understanding security from an enterprise perspective, and rapidly scaling security businesses. Their combined expertise is now channeled into AegisAI, establishing a formidable foundation for their advanced AI Email Security solutions. Before co-founding AegisAI, Khormaee also founded Contastic, a sales intelligence platform acquired by SugarCRM, and served as VP of product management at Attentive, further honing his leadership and product development skills. How AegisAI’s Autonomous AI Agents Work: A Deep Dive into Proactive Defense AegisAI’s innovative approach to security lies in its orchestrated network of autonomous AI agents . Unlike traditional systems that rely on static rules, each of AegisAI’s reasoning agents is a custom-built large language model (LLM), meticulously tuned to identify and neutralize specific types of threats. When the orchestrating agent detects a potential threat, it intelligently calls upon other specialized agents in the network—referred to as “buddies”—to conduct a thorough analysis. These agents then reason with each other, sharing insights and ultimately delivering a collective verdict to the orchestrating agent. This collaborative, real-time analysis scrutinizes every component of an incoming message, including: Links: Deep analysis for malicious URLs and redirects. Attachments: Scrutiny of files for embedded malware or deceptive content. Metadata: Examination of sender information and email headers for anomalies. QR Codes: Detection of malicious QR codes designed for phishing. Behavioral Patterns: Identification of unusual sender behavior or communication styles. Khormaee explains the depth of their knowledge: “What we know from building these tools at Google is what all the things are about an email you need to analyze? What are all the data sources? What are all the techniques for spotting invasion, and all the nasty stuff adversaries do that we’ve seen over 10 years of playing chess with these adversaries?” While AegisAI currently employs over 10 agents, Khormaee anticipates this number growing to 50 to 100 as adversaries become more sophisticated. “I fully believe that in two years, adversaries will understand what we’re doing. They’ll retool and attack what we’re doing, and then we’ll need to build more agents to stay ahead of them,” he states, highlighting the dynamic and adaptive nature of their defense strategy. These self-tuning AI models not only spot a broad spectrum of attacks but also adapt to every possible variant in real-time, significantly enhancing their phishing protection capabilities. Implementing AegisAI: Swift, Seamless, and Secure Deployment for Enhanced Protection One of AegisAI’s significant advantages is its ease of deployment and its immediate impact on enhancing email security. Customers can install AegisAI’s system on their Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 email accounts via a simple API integration in “no more than five minutes,” according to Khormaee. This rapid setup minimizes disruption and allows organizations to quickly fortify their defenses against advanced cybersecurity threats . Once installed, the system operates in a read-only mode for a week, during which it generates a detailed report outlining detected threats, false positives, and false negatives within the environment. Following this initial assessment, AegisAI activates its quarantine capabilities, actively neutralizing threats. The startup also prides itself on reducing false positives by up to 90% compared to traditional solutions, ensuring that legitimate emails are not unnecessarily blocked. AegisAI has developed multiple AI models tailored to various threats and specific industries, including venture capital and financial services, making it particularly relevant for the crypto sector. With offices in San Francisco and New York, AegisAI is currently running pilot programs with customers across the U.S. and Europe and has already secured three paying customers, including data privacy compliance software Lokker and the prominent crypto payment platform Mesh Connect. The fresh $13 million investment will enable the startup to expand its technical expertise and build a robust go-to-market infrastructure, further solidifying its position as a leader in autonomous AI security solutions. AegisAI: A New Dawn for Digital Defense The emergence of AegisAI marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing battle against sophisticated email-based cyberattacks. By leveraging the power of autonomous AI agents and the deep expertise of former Google security leaders, AegisAI is not just reacting to threats but proactively neutralizing them before they can cause harm. This innovative approach to AI Email Security , coupled with its proven ability to significantly reduce false positives, offers a compelling solution for businesses and individuals seeking robust phishing protection . As AI continues to reshape both offensive and defensive cybersecurity landscapes, AegisAI stands poised to lead the charge, ensuring a safer digital future for all. Its rapid deployment, intelligent threat detection, and adaptive nature make it an indispensable tool in safeguarding sensitive information and digital assets from the ever-evolving array of cybersecurity threats . The future of email security is here, and it’s intelligent, autonomous, and incredibly effective.

Garlinghouse’s remarks before the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on July 9, 2025, laid out Ripple’s position on the future of cryptocurrency markets and highlighted the role of XRP within that vision. Garlinghouse’s testimony provided a direct explanation of Ripple’s priorities. In his opening statement, he reminded lawmakers that Ripple has spent over a decade pursuing its central mission: “to enable the Internet of Value .” Don’t ever forget what Brad said about XRP pic.twitter.com/hHriHU4rzn — BALE (@AltcoinBale) September 9, 2025 Ripple’s Vision for Global Transactions The CEO described how the company’s approach focuses on addressing inefficiencies in financial systems. He said Ripple builds products that serve institutional clients through solutions supporting cross-border payments, stablecoins, and digital custody. These, he argued, help “reduce friction, unlock efficiencies, and serve their customers better.” XRP plays a central role in this system. Garlinghouse pointed to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as a decentralized, battle-tested, open-source blockchain designed to function at scale. He said the network enables “fast, low-cost, and highly scalable transactions” when paired with its native asset, XRP. Ripple has long positioned this capacity as one of the main competitive advantages of its ecosystem. XRP and Its Role in Transactions Garlinghouse emphasized that Ripple’s deliberate decision from the beginning was to align its technology with a clear use case. He explained that the company “made the deliberate choice to work with policymakers and regulators,” and built XRP into that strategy as the asset enabling compliant, efficient payments. By pairing the XRPL’s open-source infrastructure with regulatory licensing, Ripple positioned XRP at the center of its ecosystem for long-term integration with existing financial systems . His testimony also contained crucial details not recorded in Bale’s post, as the CEO emphasized the fact that XRP is not a security before the U.S. Senate.

Bulls are making an effort to defend this critical support, while also eyeing the $113K resistance as the next key barrier. A breakout above it could provide the momentum needed for BTC to retest higher supply zones and reignite bullish sentiment. However, the market remains fragile, with volatility and fear weighing heavily on investor confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin CDD Indicator Signals LTH Distribution As Demand Offsets Pressure Top analyst Axel Adler provided important context from the derivatives market. According to Adler, the Bitcoin Futures Pressure Score currently stands at 18%, which is considered low to moderate and closer to the neutral zone. This suggests that there is no overwhelming short pressure from leverage at this time. In practical terms, futures traders are not aggressively building short positions, nor are they significantly adding to long exposure. This balance reflects a cautious market environment where participants are waiting for a catalyst to determine direction. Until then, Bitcoin’s battle between $110K support and $113K resistance will remain the focal point, setting the stage for the next major move in either direction. Bitcoin Futures In Neutral Mode According to Adler, the current state of the futures market paints a picture of caution rather than conviction. With the Pressure Score at 18%, the indicator suggests a neutral environment where traders are neither aggressively building long positions nor stacking shorts. Adler explains that this lack of strong directional signals reflects an indecisive market, where participants are waiting for external catalysts before committing capital. The Pressure Score becomes particularly important in identifying potential downside risks. Adler notes that when the metric rises toward the 30–40% range, it indicates that shorts are being built up at an accelerated pace. In such cases, open interest increases faster than usual, creating conditions that often lead to sudden price dumps. For now, Bitcoin is not in that danger zone, but the market remains highly sensitive to shifts in sentiment. What adds to the current uncertainty is the weakening US labor market, which has fueled speculation about the Federal Reserve’s next policy moves. Any surprise in economic data or Fed guidance could easily tip the balance, triggering volatility across crypto markets. As investors digest these signals, Bitcoin is expected to trade with increased choppiness in the coming days, with bulls and bears closely monitoring the $110K–$113K range as the decisive battleground. Related Reading: Whales Are Buying Solana: Two Wallets Pull 376K Tokens From Binance Technical Insights: Trading Between Key Levels Bitcoin is currently trading around $112,196, showing a modest recovery after testing lows near $110,000. The chart highlights a consolidation phase, with BTC holding above the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) at $112,102, while the 50-day SMA sits higher at $114,650, acting as immediate resistance. A decisive close above this level could open the path for Bitcoin to retest $116,000 and potentially challenge the major resistance at $123,217, marked by the summer peak. On the downside, the 200-day SMA at $101,980 provides a strong layer of support. As long as BTC remains above this level, the broader bullish structure remains intact despite recent volatility. However, repeated failures to break above the 50-day SMA may invite further consolidation, with risks of a retest of the $108,000–$110,000 zone if selling pressure re-emerges.

Adding to the optimism are speculations about a potential DOGE exchange-traded fund ( ETF ), which is slated for launch on Thursday, September 11, according to Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas; “Meme coin ETF era about to kick off it looks like with DOJE slated for a Thursday launch, albeit under the 40 Act a la $SSK. There’s a big group of ’33 Act-ers waiting for SEC approval still. Pretty sure this is first-ever US ETF to hold something that has no utility on purpose.” On-chain metrics also point to growing optimism, as whales have accumulated about 280 million DOGE so far this week, underscoring rising confidence among large holders. However, trading at around $0.24 at the time of writing, the meme coin faces immediate resistance at $0.29. A decisive close above that level, though, could fuel a substantial rally. Indeed, looking at the data, analyst Ali Martinez, also known as ali_charts, suggested that a break above $0.29 could lead to a $0.50 run. Dogecoin $DOGE next move: break $0.29 and we could be looking at a run to $0.50. pic.twitter.com/sdqThyH6U4 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 10, 2025 Dogecoin ETFs coming: Will DOGE hit $0.50? Martinez’s chart suggests that Dogecoin has been forming higher lows since mid-July, implying accumulation and potentially further momentum. A break above $0.29, particularly with strong trading volume, could result in a sharp rally targeting a $0.31–$0.36 range at first but eventually closing in on $0.50. However, if DOGE fails to surpass $0.29, it may retrace toward the $0.205 support, while a further drop below that level could push the price down toward $0.175. As this week could mark the first step toward the meme coin’s mainstream adoption, short-term price movements are more than likely, while long-term growth speculation has never been more varied. Indeed, some analysts now believe the $1 mark is within reach during this cycle, with even double-digit targets not entirely out of the question.

The asset may extend its bull market ahead of the October 10 ETF approval deadline. Solana (SOL) is gaining traction as more whale wallets are accumulating tokens. The final stretch until the spot ETF approval deadline is seen as an accumulation period, potentially extending the SOL bull market. On October 10, the US Securities and Exchange Commission will have to issue a statement on the launch of a new spot ETF. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, the ETF has a 95% chance of approval. As a result, whales rushed in to move SOL out of Coinbase Prime. The Coinbase Prime wallet has been sending out thousands of SOL, with several large-scale transactions going to four newly created wallets, possibly belonging to one entity . An entity made multiple SOL transactions, accumulating assets ahead of an expected ETF launch. | Source: Solscan Competition for SOL may accelerate, as the tokens are in demand for treasuries, as well as eventual ETF reserves. SOL has ended the most active period of unlocks, and while there are still potential sellers, the token may see accumulation similar to ETH. Galaxy Digital also put $40M SOL in its custody, after a series of withdrawals from Coinbase and Binance. Solana treasuries are also at the beginning of their journey, with just six entities announced. Those buyers hold 4.4M SOL, and are currently outcompeted by older whales. DeFi Dev Corp and Exodus Movement added to their treasuries in the past week. SOL among daily liquidation leaders Following an active period for the Solana ecosystem, SOL broke to a higher price range. The asset is back above $220, causing market-wide short liquidations. The asset peaked at $222.10, attacking the accumulated short positions. As of September 10, Coinglass data showed $7.1M in SOL liquidations, as the token became one of the day’s leading gainers. Other estimates saw over $17M in liquidated SOL positions, as on-chain liquidations once again surpassed centralized activity. The short liquidations followed a SOL breakout above $220 for the first time in eight months. SOL sets expectations for a higher price range SOL is currently trading with a “greed” sentiment based on its specific fear and greed index . Short-term expectations see SOL entering price discovery at over $250 and potentially rising to four-digit assets. SOL is being compared to ETH, which started its bull rally from $217 and set records close to $4,900. While this took years, SOL hopes on adoption and on-chain activity to boost the network. Mainstream acceptance through spot ETFs and treasuries may further boost the price expansion. SOL is currently in a range between $216 and $225 based on accumulated liquidity on long and short positions. Open interest remains near its all-time high at $7.75B . Short traders are becoming bolder, with nearly 40% of all SOL positions attempting to short the asset. This may lead to further liquidations if SOL keeps up its rally.

51495612,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=819547,1757504694,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51495612.jpeg,PredictIt Wins CFTC Approval & Eyes October Launch – Find the Best Crypto to Buy Ahead of Time,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-as-predictit-goes-live/,"Following years of legal battles, PredictIt is finally approved by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Now, the online prediction platform is getting set to go live in the US in October, operating as a designated contract market (DCM) and a derivatives clearing organization (DCO). This way, it’ll be able to expand into broader, more liquid markets with much greater regulatory clarity. With ambitious plans to operate ‘beyond politics,’ it might follow the likes of Polymarket – the largest online prediction platform – and include crypto bets. When considering the US’ current crypto-friendly stance under Trump, this wouldn’t come as a surprise. Say that happens, it could be highly bullish for the emerging crypto projects; a renewed surge of capital being injected into digital assets would likely attract attention to promising early-stage coins like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , making such projects some of the best cryptos to buy now. PredictIt’s 400K Users Might Soon Hedge Crypto Bets Although PredictIt’s path to US regulatory approval hasn’t been easy, the platform attracts over 400K active users. It initially launched in 2014 as an academic project backed by Victoria University of Wellington and operated by D.C.-based Aristotle Inc. During this time, it ran under a CFTC no-action letter so it could operate as a non-profit prediction market. Such an exemption was revoked in 2022 and sparked an extremely lengthy legal battle. But it’s not all been bad. By mid-2023, an appeals court allowed PredictIt to keep operating while the case proceeded. Finally, by mid-2025, the company settled with the CFTC so it could continue under the Prediction Market Research Consortium (a US-based non-profit). It’s now preparing to operate in the US. But there’s a slight hitch: It’ll be entering a crowded field of rivals. One such example is Polymarket, which received CFTC approval just last week . Because it runs on the Polygon network (hence its apt name), Polymarket is extremely popular in the crypto community. This is partly because it goes beyond speculating on traditional events, but also crypto milestones, like ‘What price will Bitcoin hit in September?’ Given Polymarket’s success in crypto bets, it wouldn’t be surprising if PredictIt expanded into Web3 predictions to give it a leg up in the sector. As a result, it might even override its largest competitor. Should it incorporate on-chain forecasts, it would increase awareness of crypto among its 400K+ users and beyond. In turn, projects like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , Aethir ($ATH) , and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) are poised to thrive, becoming the best crypto to buy now. 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Presale Nears $2M Over 150% Staking Rewards & Futures Trading Plans Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a new top dog on the block(chain). Inspired by $DOGE and $SHIB, it’s also a Shiba Inu-themed coin, yet sets itself apart by packing some serious muscle. Doing so underscores its focus on extreme leverage trading and market strength. Since going live on July 29, 2025, $MAXI has nearly raised $2M on presale. Right now, it’s fetching attention by offering utility through staking. You can lock up your tokens via smart contracts to earn daily rewards, with a current 159% APY up for taking. Its roadmap is also likely winning over investors. In the future, the project strives to offer gamified training with ROI-based contests. It also eyes futures trading partnerships that’ll open you up for even greater gains within the ecosystem. When also considering that 40% of $MAXI’s total token supply is set aside for marketing, with an additional 15% earmarked for development, this project shows no signs of slowing down. You can join the action by purchasing $MAXI on presale for just $0.0002565. And there’s no better time to do precisely that; its price will automatically increase tomorrow and thereafter. Join $MAXI before the next price increase. 2. Aethir ($ATH) – Decentralized GPU Cloud Token Spikes 50% After AI & Web3 Expansions Aethir ($ATH) is the native token that powers Aethir, a decentralized GPU-as-a-service cloud platform. It underpins the ecosystem through several core functions, including: Payments for GPU resources; Rewards for node operators for compute power; Developer incentives, such as grants, credits, and partner discounts; Ecosystem governance to help shape the platform’s future; Token-based rewards for partnerships and community members. Beyond its token utility, Aethir is on a mission to build one of the largest decentralized GPU networks worldwide. In fact, it already has a strong foothold within the sector. With over 435K GPU containers deployed across 90+ countries, the platform delivers low-latency compute for AI training, Web3 gaming, real-time rendering, and enterprise workloads. It differentiates itself from centralized providers like AWS and Google Cloud by eliminating hidden fees and regional bottlenecks through the distribution of GPU power worldwide. In turn, it can provide affordable, scalable, and accessible infrastructure for next-gen applications. August was a big month for Aethir. It expanded support for AI and Web3 developers, entered the education sector with Arizona State University, and fine-tuned its Cloud Host rewards. Following this news breaking out, $ATH has spiked by nearly 50% this past week. As Aethir’s developments continue to perk up the entire ecosystem, $ATH’s price trajectory shows no signs of slowing down as a consequence. Now signals an opportune time to purchase the token before it possibly continues to rise. It’s available for roughly $0.04 on some of the best crypto exchanges . Buy $ATH on Bybit for deep liquidity and easy signup. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Raises $15.6M, Offers Low Gas Fees & Governance in Novel Crypto Wallet The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale has already accumulated a whopping $15.6M, and it’s all thanks to being the backbone of Best Wallet – a mobile-first, highly user-friendly non-custodial crypto wallet. Holding $BEST unlocks major perks in the Best Wallet ecosystem: lower gas fees, governance rights, staking rewards (currently at an 85% APY), and exclusive access to top presales. Considering that PredictIt could propel early-stage projects to new heights, such a perk becomes all the more attractive. The wallet itself is built for flexibility and security. It enables you to buy, sell, swap, and stake over 1K tokens across major chains like Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Chain. Plus, it’s getting set to support 60+ networks in the near future. As a non-custodial wallet, you can rest easy knowing that only you have control over your private keys. It also prevents unauthorized access through extra layers of protection like 2FA, biometrics, and encryption, ensuring that your funds stay out of fraudsters’ reach. Yet there’s more to the wallet than token perks and safe storage. It integrates powerful tools to help you maximize gains. This includes a swap feature that lets you secure the best rates across 330+ DEXs and 30 bridges, as well as a token launchpad for easily discovering hot investment opportunities. With a crypto debit card (Best Card), NFT gallery, and intel market analytics also in the pipeline, Best Wallet positions itself as a sustainable one-stop hub for all things crypto. For the ecosystem’s full plethora of benefits, buy $BEST on presale for just $0.025615. The app’s upcoming developments could propel the coin to $0.05106175 in 2026. Joining now might mean a ROI of ~100%, as per our $BEST price prediction . Get the $BEST token from the official presale. Verdict – Best Crypto to Buy Following PredictIt’s Growth With PredictIt going live in October under full CFTC approval, US traders will soon have a fresh, regulated gateway to speculate on real-world events for gains. If the platform follows in the heels of platforms like Polymarket and expands into crypto, it could send capital and attention toward promising early-stage projects. Presales like $MAXI and $BEST stand to benefit as they each have tangible utility that could capture trader interest. If market attention acts in their favor, they might even be the next 1000x crypto . This isn’t financial advice. As usual, before making any investment, always do your due diligence and don’t spend more than you’d be sad to lose.

However, it broke its 2021 ATH a few weeks ago, breaking $4,900 to reach a new record. However, the correction in the general cryptocurrency market also affected Etheruem, and it fell to $4,200 levels. The drop in Ethereum's price has been accompanied by a sharp drop in ETH trading volume. While we're wondering what impact this will have on the market and price, cryptocurrency services provider Matrixport has released an updated analysis. Matrixport said that Ethereum's falling ETH volume will increase pressure on long positions and may force traders to close their long positions. Matrixport analysts noted that while ETH spot trading volume fell from $122 billion to $41 billion this week, open interest in futures barely decreased. Matrixport noted that this situation will force some investors to close their leveraged long positions and the price could be negatively affected. Matrixport, which is anticipating a bearish price for ETH, also deposited $43.7 million worth of ETH into Binance. According to data, an address associated with Matrixport deposited 10,000 ETH worth $43.77 million to Binance today. Matrixport currently holds $461 million in assets, with BTC accounting for 81.6% of that total. The company also holds an additional 4,272 ETH worth $18.33 million. Matrixport-connected wallets previously deposited a total of 95,873 ETH (approximately $452 million) to Binance and OKX exchanges, while the same wallets withdrew 2,354.6 BTC ($272 million) from Binance and OKX. *This is not investment advice.

The token is down about 1% in the past 24 hours in a volatile session, experiencing a 7% price swing, per CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. The price action followed Arizona-based real estate and asset manager Caliber's (CWD) Tuesday announcement that it completed its first purchase of LINK tokens, marking the start of its digital asset treasury strategy. Its stock skyrocketed nearly 2,000% on Tuesday before giving back a bulk of the gains, down another 20% on Wednesday pre-market. The firm didn't disclose the amount of tokens bought. The move makes Caliber the first Nasdaq-listed firm to adopt a treasury reserve policy focused on LINK. The company said it aims to accumulate LINK over time using existing credit lines, cash reserves and equity-based securities, with plans to stake tokens to generate yield. Technical analysis Trading Performance: LINK posted a modest 1% decline over the 24-hour period, experiencing volatile intraday swings of 7% between $22.84 and $24.46, CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model showed.

The Japanese company allocates ¥183.7 billion ($1.24 billion) directly to Bitcoin acquisitions between September and October 2025. The Tokyo-listed firm increased Bitcoin holdings to 20,136 BTC worth approximately $2.25 billion, making it the sixth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Recent acquisitions include 136 Bitcoin for $15.2 million and 1,009 Bitcoin for $112 million. *Notice Regarding Determination of Issue Price and Other Matters* pic.twitter.com/DWM3r1oYCC — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) September 9, 2025 Asian Corporate Treasury Revolution Accelerates Nakamoto Holdings committed $30 million to participate in Metaplanet’s global equity offering, marking its largest investment and first stake in an Asian Bitcoin-focused public company. KindlyMD’s subsidiary stock surged 77.2% on Nasdaq following the announcement despite recent monthly declines. Similarly, Sora Ventures recently launched a dedicated $1 billion Bitcoin treasury fund backed by $200 million in regional commitments, targeting rapid accumulation within six months. Just today, QMMM Holdings reported 1,736% stock gains after announcing $100 million crypto treasury plans targeting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The Hong Kong-based digital media firm’s shares soared 2,300% before closing higher at $207 on Nasdaq. Japan leads corporate Bitcoin adoption with multiple Tokyo-listed firms announcing treasury strategies . Government policy changes support corporate crypto adoption, with proposed tax reforms potentially reducing capital gains rates from 55% to 20%. The Flywheel Effect Faces Premium Compression Challenges Metaplanet’s financing strategy relies on “moving strike warrants” issued to Evo Fund, creating a capital generation flywheel for Bitcoin purchases. CEO Simon Gerovich designed the mechanism to raise funds at low costs during stock price appreciation. The model showed signs of strain as shares declined 54% since mid-June peaks despite Bitcoin gaining 2% during the same period. Accumulation rates slowed from 160% growth through June to less than 50% since. Bitcoin premium compression threatens the strategy’s sustainability. The company’s market capitalization multiple versus Bitcoin holdings narrowed from eight times reserves in June to approximately two times currently. As a result, analysts warn that further premium compression could limit accumulation capacity. However, Gerovich called preferred share issuances a “defensive mechanism” protecting common shareholders from dilution during price convergence. Japanese BTC investor Metaplanet has announced a fresh purchase of 136 BTC, boosting its BTC Yield to 487% YTD 2025. #Metaplanet #BTCAccumulation #BTCYield https://t.co/Q5VbxzEH03 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 8, 2025 As of September 8, Metaplanet reported a 487% Bitcoin yield year-to-date through aggressive accumulation from 12,000 BTC at June-end to current levels. Stock performance, however, lagged Bitcoin gains with shares trading near four-month lows despite reaching 20,000 BTC milestones. Revenue Generation Through Options Strategy The company allocated ¥20.4 billion from the offering proceeds to the Bitcoin Income Generation Business, expanding options trading operations. Metaplanet generated ¥1.9 billion in sales revenue from Bitcoin options during Q2 2025. The options strategy addresses Bitcoin’s yield-free nature by generating income through covered call writing and volatility trading. Management targets full-year operating profitability through accumulated options premiums. Japan's @Metaplanet_JP Q2 financial report shows a 468% Bitcoin yield, becoming the 4th largest global holder with 18,113 BTC worth $2.1B, targeting 210,000 BTC by 2027. #Japan #Bitcoin https://t.co/n5xJXwpgW7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 Q2 financial results showed ¥816 million operating profit on ¥1.2 billion revenue, largely driven by ¥1.1 billion in Bitcoin option underwriting income. The business model provides recurring revenue streams beyond price appreciation speculation. Shareholder base expanded over 1,000% to 128,000 individuals as the Bitcoin strategy gained international attention. The company transformed from a struggling hotel operator to Asia’s most prominent corporate Bitcoin holder. Global corporate Bitcoin movement spans 31 entities controlling over $413 billion in holdings. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries However, Sentora research has recently warned that most participants won’t survive credit cycles due to structural vulnerabilities in rising-rate environments. Institutional critics argue that idle Bitcoin holdings lack scalability in rising-rate environments without yield generation capabilities. Corporate treasuries increasingly face sustainability questions regarding mark-to-market dependency. For Metaplanet, the international offering price reflected a 9.93% discount to the September 9 reference price of ¥614, ensuring attractive entry points for overseas institutional investors. The settlement proceeds will be immediately used for Bitcoin purchases. Payment completion is set for September 16, with delivery the following day.

Europe, your wait is over. xStocks are now live in the Kraken app for eligible clients in Europe! Break the broker barrier https://t.co/viHhrZp8Jv pic.twitter.com/sGV7MeI4nJ — Kraken (@krakenfx) September 10, 2025 The offering, available via Kraken’s PEDSL-CY entity, marks a major step forward in bridging traditional markets with blockchain-based innovation. According to Kraken, xStocks are available only to EU-based clients who have passed an appropriateness assessment or who qualify as professional investors. Importantly, xStocks are not registered under the U.S. Securities Act and cannot be sold to or held by U.S. persons. What Are xStocks and How Do They Work? Kraken explains xStocks function as tokenized certificates that mirror the market prices of real-world U.S. stocks and ETFs. Each token is backed 1:1 by the underlying security and issued on-chain as an SPL or BNB token. Unlike actual shares, xStocks do not confer shareholder rights such as voting or dividends. Instead, holders gain exposure to the price performance of the asset through a financial instrument issued by Backed Assets (JE) Limited, a Jersey-based company. Kraken initially offers 60 assets through xStocks, including 55 stocks and 5 ETFs. Household names such as Tesla, Apple, and GameStop are among the available listings. Features and Trading Options xStocks can be traded 24 hours a day, five days a week, extending access beyond traditional market hours. Weekend trading support is in development, which could push tokenized securities closer to true round-the-clock availability. Kraken also allows for fractional investments, with a minimum entry point as low as €1. This opens the door to a wider pool of retail investors who might otherwise be priced out of high-value stocks. In addition, Kraken supports self-custody of xStocks, giving users the ability to withdraw holdings to a compatible on-chain wallet. This flexibility ensures that investors retain direct control over their assets, aligning with the principles of decentralized finance. Tokenization as a Growing Trend Kraken emphasizes that xStocks are secured through audited reserves, robust custody arrangements, and blockchain infrastructure. The company has also announced plans to expand support for additional blockchain standards, including BEP-20 on BNB Chain. Recent partnerships with Tron DAO and upcoming integrations with other networks such as Inkhighlight Kraken’s strategy to broaden accessibility across ecosystems. The rise of tokenized securities underscores the momentum behind real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, a trend that seeks to modernize markets by combining the stability of traditional assets with the transparency and efficiency of blockchain. As tokenized assets gain traction, initiatives like Kraken’s xStocks may reshape how global investors interact with both equities and digital finance.

Recent data indicates a significant cooling in spot demand, leading to a dramatic decline in trading volume. This shift has analysts sounding the alarm, suggesting a potential ETH price drop to as low as $3,600 before any signs of a rebound. If you’re invested in Ethereum, understanding these underlying factors is crucial for navigating the weeks ahead and making informed decisions. What’s Driving the Alarming ETH Price Drop Signal? A sharp decline in Ethereum’s spot trading volume is at the heart of current market anxieties. According to a recent report by Cointelegraph, which meticulously analyzed data from Glassnode, spot demand for ETH has cooled significantly. This isn’t just a minor dip; trading volume has plummeted by a staggering 85% in a relatively short period. To put this into a clearer perspective, ETH’s spot trading volume dramatically fell from an impressive $18.5 billion on August 22 to a mere $2.6 billion by September 8. Such a drastic reduction in trading activity typically indicates a lack of buying conviction among market participants. When fewer people are actively buying and selling, the market becomes more susceptible to significant price movements, making the prospect of an immediate ETH price drop a serious consideration for all investors. Decoding the Technical Signals: Is $3,600 an Inevitable Target? From a technical analysis standpoint, the ETH/USD pair is currently at a highly critical juncture. On its daily chart, Ethereum is retesting the lower trendline of a well-defined symmetrical triangle pattern. This crucial support level sits approximately around the $4,280 mark. The integrity of this level is absolutely vital for preventing further downside price action. A decisive daily close below this critical support level could indeed trigger a more substantial decline, potentially confirming the bearish outlook. Prominent analysts are now pointing to the $3,600 mark as a strong potential target in such a scenario. Adding to this perspective, analyst Ted Pillows specifically highlighted that a significant supply zone exists between $3,600 and $4,000. This implies that the price may first need to decline into this range to absorb substantial selling pressure from existing holders before any meaningful recovery or rebound can occur. This makes the possibility of an ETH price drop to these levels a scenario worth preparing for. Navigating Volatility: What Should Ethereum Investors Consider? In light of these concerning developments, understanding how to strategically approach the market is paramount. The potential for an ETH price drop underscores the critical importance of a well-researched and disciplined investment strategy. Here are some key considerations for both seasoned and new Ethereum investors: Vigilantly Monitor Key Support Levels: Keep a very close eye on the $4,280 support level. A decisive break below this point, confirmed by multiple daily closes, could strongly confirm the bearish outlook and signal further declines. Understand Market Psychology: Severely reduced trading volume often indicates a widespread lack of conviction from buyers. This allows sellers to exert disproportionately more influence, pushing prices lower with less effort. Implement Robust Risk Management: For those currently holding ETH, it is prudent to review your existing risk exposure. Implementing protective measures such as stop-loss orders or exploring hedging strategies might be wise during these highly volatile market conditions. Differentiate Between Short-Term and Long-Term: It’s essential to differentiate between short-term price fluctuations and Ethereum’s long-term fundamental potential. While a short-term dip is certainly possible, the underlying technology, network upgrades (like the upcoming Dencun upgrade), and growing ecosystem continue to evolve and attract innovation. Stay Informed: Regularly consult reputable sources for market analysis and news. Knowledge is your best defense against market uncertainty. While the immediate outlook suggests a cautious approach, it is important to remember that cryptocurrency market dynamics can shift rapidly. Informed decisions, based on data and analysis rather than emotional reactions, are always the best approach in the often-unpredictable crypto space. What’s Next for Ethereum? Preparing for the Path Forward The sharp decline in spot trading volume for Ethereum is a clear and undeniable signal of cooling demand, pointing towards potential price weakness. With technical analysis indicating a critical support level at risk and expert analysts forecasting a potential ETH price drop towards the $3,600-$4,000 range, investors must remain exceptionally vigilant and prepared. However, the crypto market is also known for its remarkable resilience and ability to recover. While the immediate future may present significant challenges and volatility, understanding these market signals allows for better preparation and strategic positioning. The potential for a strong rebound, particularly after the market has fully absorbed the current selling pressure, remains a possibility. Yet, the journey to that point might indeed be bumpy, requiring patience and a clear strategy from investors. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Ethereum price action . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a “plummeting spot volume” mean for Ethereum? A: A plummeting spot volume means there’s significantly less buying and selling activity for ETH on exchanges. This indicates a decrease in market interest and demand, making the asset more vulnerable to price declines. Q: Why is $3,600 being cited as a potential target for the ETH price drop? A: Analysts cite $3,600 based on technical analysis, specifically if Ethereum breaks below a critical support level of a symmetrical triangle pattern at $4,280. Additionally, a large supply zone between $3,600 and $4,000 suggests it’s a key area where selling pressure might be absorbed. Q: Should I sell my Ethereum holdings if an ETH price drop is expected? A: The decision to sell or hold depends on your individual investment strategy, risk tolerance, and long-term outlook for Ethereum. It’s crucial to conduct your own research, consult with a financial advisor, and consider implementing risk management tools like stop-loss orders. Q: What is a “symmetrical triangle” in technical analysis? A: A symmetrical triangle is a chart pattern where two converging trend lines connect a series of peaks and troughs. It often indicates a period of consolidation before a significant price breakout in either direction. A break below the lower trendline typically signals a bearish move. Q: How can I stay informed about Ethereum’s market movements? A: To stay informed, regularly follow reputable cryptocurrency news outlets, analyze on-chain data from platforms like Glassnode, and monitor technical analysis from experienced traders. Always cross-reference information from multiple sources. Did you find this analysis on the potential ETH price drop helpful?

Bitcoin’s price action this year has seen a wild ride when compared to some past cycles. However, it is still less significant than most of the previous cycles. How Bitcoin’s Current Rally Stacks Against Previous Bull Cycle After hitting multiple all-time highs this year, Bitcoin seems to have stalled as the flagship asset retests key support levels. In the meantime, Joao Wedson, a leading market expert, has shed light on how Bitcoin’s performance up to September 2025 stacks up against its historic cycles. While outlining BTC’s performance this year to past cycles, the expert is providing a valuable perspective to help investors navigate the market today. Following his analysis of the Bitcoin Yearly Seasonality metric, Wedson highlighted that BTC’s action this year up to September has been better than in 2014, 2018, and 2022. The trend reflects key differences between these years and the current cycle , particularly a more developed market structure, increased institutional engagement, and changing global liquidity dynamics . Bitcoin’s price rally this year may have outperformed the aforementioned years, but recent data on the chart shows it is still worse than in all the other 12 years of its existence. The expert also outlined how BTC’s ongoing price action in September compares to previous Septembers in the past cycles. BTC’s Monthly Seasonality for September reveals that the flagship asset is performing better this month than the historical average. Presently, Bitcoin’s price action this month is only lagging behind that of 2012, 2015, 2016, and 2022. As a result, Wedson is pointing to the potential that BTC might not perform as poorly this September as many anticipate . Support Zones Aligning With On-Chain Metrics While Bitcoin is holding above the $111,000 price level, CryptoOnchain, a market expert, revealed that the crypto king is currently positioned at one of its most critical support zones in recent years. According to the expert, this level, which is shown on the weekly period as a long-term ascending trendline, represents more than just a straightforward technical support. It further matches perfectly with the New Whales Realized Price, one of the most important on-chain metrics. As a result of this powerful confluence, an extremely robust defensive zone is created for the market. Technical analysis suggests that the bullish structure can be rendered invalid if it breaks below this trendline. However, on-chain data indicates that new, large investors have a strong motivation to defend their positions here because this area reflects the average purchase price. Amid the trend, CryptoOnchain noted that the bearish divergence on the RSI and MACD indicators is casting a shadow for BTC . These divergences hint at a decline in bullish momentum and raise the risk of this support failing. In the meantime, Bitcoin’s mid-term prospects rely on maintaining or losing this level. A decisive loss of this on-chain and technical support would serve as a powerful sell signal and would cause the market to enter a steep and protracted decline.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Yearly Seasonality Metric|Bitcoin’s Monthly Seasonality for September r|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoOnchain|Joao Wedson|MACD|New Whales Realized Price|RSI,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-10 12:00:58

Moscow should follow the example of Minsk, where this is currently under consideration, a member of the civil society institution suggested, highlighting the crypto experience of ally Belarus. Proposal to set up a crypto bank pitched in Russia The country needs a crypto bank, a representative of the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation said in an interview with the official TASS news agency. According to Evgeny Masharov, member of the organization’s commission for public examination of bills and regulations, such an entity will solve many issues, including illegal payments for billions of rubles. He believes a Russian crypto trading platform will also bring more revenue to the state budget and help regulate the activities of cryptocurrency miners who will be able to sell their minted coins on it. Also quoted by the Gazeta.ru news portal, Masharov said the digital asset bank will help reduce cases of fraud and block a major channel for “financing and recruiting” Russian citizens “to commit serious crimes, including against the state.” Funds currently processed by “ droppers ,” as money mules are commonly called in Russia, are usually transferred to cryptocurrency wallets and then legalized for the purchase of real estate and luxury goods, he explained. Settlements in the new bank should be made in cryptocurrencies and money should be credited only through customers’ current accounts, the Civic Chamber member elaborated on his idea. Russia urged to follow in the footsteps of Belarus Masharov cited Belarus as an example, Russia’s closest political and economic ally, which regulated its digital economy, including cryptocurrency transactions, more than eight years ago. Last week, the country’s long-term president, Alexander Lukashenko, called on government officials to update these regulations, as reported by Cryptopolitan. He also highlighted the record levels of Belarusian crypto payments amid sanctions in front of a group of leading bankers this week. During one of the series of meetings devoted to fast-tracking the new regulatory framework, Lukashenko approved a proposal to establish a crypto bank in Belarus. The idea was presented by a deputy governor of the central bank, who was tasked, along with the government, to prepare the respective presidential decree within a month. Speaking on Tuesday, Evgeny Masharov told TASS: “The Russian Federation also needs to create its own crypto bank. This will solve a number of current problems. In particular, bring shadow transactions, which amount to hundreds of billions of rubles, into the legal field, and therefore replenish the federal budget.” Russia is lagging behind Belarus in terms of introducing proper rules for its crypto space. The law “On Digital Financial Assets,” which came into force a few years ago, actually banned certain cryptocurrency transactions such as payments. The Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) remains the main opponent to legalizing the free circulation of decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin in the country’s economy. So far, the monetary authority has only agreed to allow the use of cryptocurrencies in cross-border trade settlements within a special “experimental legal regime,” designed to help Russian companies in their dealings with foreign partners under sanctions. Russian economist Sergey Suetin, professor at the Institute of International Economic Relations in Moscow, recently assessed the possibility of introducing crypto payments in Russia in the next five years at just 1%. Meanwhile, Belarusian payments through the country’s licensed cryptocurrency exchanges exceeded $1.7 billion in the first seven months of the year and may reach $3 billion by the end of 2025, according to estimates quoted by Lukashenko on Tuesday.

Strap In,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-that-approval-date-is-coming-strap-in/,"Crypto analyst Mason Versluis, popularly known as Crypto Mason, has sounded a fresh warning to XRP investors: brace for impact once spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) win regulatory approval . Speaking in a video clip shared on his X account, Versluis stressed that the countdown has already begun, even if the exact approval date remains uncertain. The Coming Shift in Market Structure According to Versluis, the approval of spot XRP ETFs is inevitable. “It doesn’t matter if they get approved in 2025 or 2026 or even 2027,” he said. “The fact of the matter is, they will get approved.” His case draws on precedent: Bitcoin ETFs gained approval in January 2024, Ethereum ETFs launched soon after, and filings for Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) ETFs are already underway. The XRP applications, now sitting with regulators, represent the next logical step in the expanding ETF landscape . That approval date is coming for $XRP holders. Strap in. pic.twitter.com/xcZMA3O0hF — MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) September 9, 2025 Lessons from Bitcoin and Ethereum The experience of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs provides a roadmap for what XRP holders might expect. Bitcoin ETFs drew billions of dollars in inflows within weeks of approval , reshaping liquidity and institutional exposure. Ethereum products, greenlit later in 2024, delivered similar structural changes. Analysts suggest XRP ETFs might follow a similar path, offering regulated access points for Wall Street and pension funds to invest without directly engaging crypto exchanges Transparency on the Blockchain One of Versluis’s most striking points is the transparency ETFs could bring to XRP markets. Spot ETFs require actual holdings of the underlying asset, which means custodians’ wallet addresses will be visible on-chain. For the first time, retail traders and institutions alike will be able to track when major funds are buying or selling XRP in real time. “This is going to bring bearishness, volatility, and even maturity to the XRP chart that we haven’t seen before,” Versluis explained. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Demand and Market Volatility While approval would likely bring substantial liquidity and buying pressure, it may also introduce heightened volatility. Institutional players rebalance portfolios on strict schedules, meaning large inflows and outflows could cause sudden price swings. For long-term holders, however, the presence of ETF-driven demand could anchor XRP more firmly in global markets, adding credibility and deepening adoption. The Strategic Takeaway for XRP Holders Versluis, who emphasized he has held XRP for seven years without selling, framed his comments as a perspective rather than financial advice. Still, his message was clear: holders should pay close attention to regulatory timelines, monitor filings from asset managers, and be ready for the ripple effects of institutional flows. For now, the SEC’s decision clock is ticking, with multiple filings under review. Whether the green light comes in 2025, 2026, or later, the industry consensus aligns with Versluis: spot XRP ETFs are not a matter of “if,” but “when.” When that approval date finally arrives, XRP holders will indeed need to strap in.

That wave is making room for a nimble contender, Remittix , with real-world utility and a buzz you’d want to catch early. Funds tied to Ethereum are drawing historic attention right now. Institutions are moving capital in via ETFs at levels we haven’t seen before. Meanwhile, a quietly emerging token with real transaction value and low-fee infrastructure is gaining traction among those who seek more than just hype. Ethereum ETF: Record Inflows and What They Mean On August 11, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a staggering $1.02 billion in net inflows, marking the largest single-day total since launch. That was followed by another $729 million just days later. Over the span of three days, these inflows summed to $2.3 billion, pushing total inflows toward $12.1 billion and trading volumes to $4.5 billion. These moves reflect a major shift in institutional allocation, tapping into Ethereum’s DeFi, staking, and utility-driven value narrative. ETFs have become a clean, regulated way into crypto. Technical signals show that $4,250 is the support level to watch for Ethereum. Remittix: A Utility-First Token Gaining Ground Remittix bridges chains and supports low-fee transfers, which makes it more like a tool than a speculative play. The CEX listing announcement on BitMart and LBank is a key milestone that could bring liquidity and broader reach. Highlights of Remittix Utility-first token powering real transaction volume Security First: Audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch The community is tight and engaged, with incentives like a $250,000 giveaway driving participation. Real Utility Meets Institutional Momentum Ethereum is capturing headlines and capital as ETF inflows soar. That grounds the narrative in institutional adoption and real-world finance trends. Yet, the quiet arrival of a utility-driven token like Remittix shows a different kind of potential. It’s built for real use, with low gas fees, borderless utility, audited security, and a buzz increasingly backed by substance. With a $250,000 giveaway and an upcoming CEX listing around the corner, Remittix is not just hype. It’s a project aiming for everyday use and mainstream traction. Now may be the time to pay attention to what utility-first altcoins can offer—instead of chasing short-term gains.

Despite the buzz around these established tokens, analysts are pointing to Remittix , a new contender gaining momentum as the best crypto to buy now. With real-world use cases and growing adoption, this rising project is capturing serious investor attention. XRP News Shows Whale Accumulation Remains Strong XRP has been in the spotlight after a $600 million Ripple transfer sparked uncertainty among traders, leaving the market cautious despite recent bullish signs. At the time of writing, the XRP Price today is $2.88, holding key support at $2.85 after briefly testing $2.94. While whale accumulation has added confidence, profit-taking by short-term holders is limiting upside momentum. Analysts warn that unless XRP breaks above $3.10, the Ripple Price Prediction remains fragile. Technical indicators like RSI and MACD suggest easing selling pressure, but the risk of another pullback lingers. In the midst of this, Remittix is quietly emerging as a safe haven in the PayFi sector, drawing attention as traders hedge against volatility in XRP. Cardano Price Suggests Slow Momentum Ahead The latest Cardano price has put ADA back in focus, with experts warning the token could slip under $0.50 if momentum fails to return. While the ADA Price today holds around $0.84, many traders see Cardano’s research-first approach as too slow compared to rivals like Solana. Recent Cardano news highlights ecosystem growth and consistent staking rewards. However, excitement is fading. Without a new catalyst, the Cardano price prediction remains cautious, leaving investors to question whether ADA can keep pace in 2025. Investors Call Remittix The Best Crypto To Buy Now Remittix is quickly being highlighted as one of the best cryptos to buy now thanks to its practical use case in payments. Unlike speculative projects, Remittix connects crypto directly to fiat across 30+ currencies, enabling smooth, low-cost international transfers. Remittix is backed by stablecoins and secured by smart contracts, and this allows the platform to ensure reliable and efficient cross-border transactions. Support for Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain expands its reach, positioning Remittix as a serious competitor to legacy remittance solutions. Remittix Wallet beta testing launches September 15th, 2025 $20M milestone reached with BitMart confirmed as the first CEX listing Over $24.7M raised with LBank announced as another exchange partner Smart contract security ensures transparency and faster settlements With over 653 million tokens sold at $0.1050, Remittix has already secured major traction. The combination of utility and adoption makes RTX stand out from XRP and Cardano happenings, proving it could be the best crypto to buy right now.

Market enthusiasts are buying digital blue chips such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana at a rapid pace. For the first time ever, Ethereum flux has turned negative, suggesting more outflows from exchanges than inflows. Data shows that Ethereum available on exchanges is drying up quickly and has now reached a new low. Meanwhile, Metaplanet acquired 136 $BTC on September 8 for $15.2M, with a $BTC yield of 487% YTD 2025. The company now holds 20,136 $BTC. On the same day, Strategy – the largest Bitcoin treasury company – acquired 1,955 $BTC for $217.4M. As of September 9, Strategy holds 638,460 $BTC . Amidst this aggressive accumulation, we turned to DeepSeek to build a robust crypto portfolio – one that looks beyond the obvious and also includes a handful of low-cap, high-upside options. Here are the top 4 most likely next cryptos to explode , according to DeepSeek. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – First Layer 2 Bitcoin Solution Offering Programmability, Speed, and Low Fees Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the first-ever Layer 2 solution for the Bitcoin blockchain, bringing Solana-like speed and scalability to the OG cryptocurrency. Although the biggest crypto in the world, Bitcoin is still not compatible with Web3 and DeFi apps, leaving it more of a bystander in a rapidly growing sector. $HYPER changes this with its Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, which allows developers on the Bitcoin blockchain to execute smart contracts and build dApps without compromising security. At the core of this is a non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge that locks up Layer 1 Bitcoin and mints an equivalent amount of Layer 2 $BTC, called wrapped Bitcoin. These L2 tokens can then be used for DeFi apps, staking, lending, and NFT marketplaces. Once you’re done, simply send the L2 tokens back to the bridge, and it will unlock your L1 Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale is currently live and has already raised a whopping $14.83M. And it’s not just retail frenzy driving sales – whales have been spotted swooping in as well. Just yesterday, for instance, one whale bought nearly $16K worth of $HYPER in a single transaction. Each $HYPER is currently priced at $0.012885, and according to our $HYPER price prediction , the token could hit $0.32 before the end of 2025, representing a staggering 2,300% gain from current levels. Visit Bitcoin Hyper for more information on how this new L2 is revolutionizing the greatest cryptocurrency. 2. SPX6900 ($SPX) – Degen Meme Coin Parodying Wall Street’s S&P 500 SPX6900 ($SPX) is an Ethereum-based altcoin that adds a dose of degen hype to the S&P 500 index – one of the world’s most widely tracked financial benchmarks. The token blends humor with serious finance to deliver one of the best meme coins . It embodies the true ethos of crypto culture: part speculation, part satire, and part genuine innovation. SPX6900 has gained more than 25% in the last 7 days and is currently trading around $1.41. The token has built a strong base at $1.05, which has acted as support multiple times. It has now bounced off this support to break out of a descending trendline, signaling the beginning of a fresh upward move. Just two months ago, $SPX hit a new all-time high of $2.28 on July 28. A fresh breakout now could see the token reclaim this high in the coming weeks and push further toward its next target of $2.50. Interested? Buy $SPX on Bybit , KuCoin , or any of the other crypto exchanges it’s available on. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – One-Stop Secure Crypto Wallet That Lets You Spot the Best Presales Early Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the in-house cryptocurrency of Best Wallet – a decentralized, non-custodial, multi-chain crypto wallet that lets you buy, sell, swap, exchange, store, and send cryptos across multiple chains from a single app. Since it’s a non-custodial crypto wallet , only you have access to its private keys, ensuring no malicious third party can access or alter your funds. This puts you in complete control of your security without relying on the wallet provider. Best Wallet also leverages Fireblocks MPC security tech to safeguard your assets and ensure safe storage. On top of that, multifactor authentication, including biometrics, further bolsters security and prevents unauthorized access. The standout feature of the Best Wallet App is its ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section, which lets you spot and invest in the best crypto presales before they hit the mainstream. This helps you catch the trend early and ride it longer. Even better, you don’t have to leave the app to invest – everything happens within the wallet itself, ensuring a streamlined and seamless experience. With the Best Wallet App aiming to capture 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market share, it’s the $BEST token that will ultimately benefit. The $BEST presale is currently live, with each token available at $0.025615. The project has already raised $15.68M, with the next price increase less than a day away. It’s also worth noting that buying $BEST also unlocks extra benefits, including voting rights, reduced transaction fees, and early access to new meme coins in presale . Check out $BEST’s official website to learn more about how it plans to challenge traditional crypto wallets. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) – AI Agent That Makes Smart Investing Decisions Through Real-Time Market Analysis ai16z ($AI16Z) is a first-of-its-kind decentralized venture capital firm that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to make investing decisions.

It’s up 20% in the last seven days, with strong support at $0.0836. Fresh momentum could trigger an 80% gain from here, taking $AI16Z to $0.2069, after which it may target the $0.50 mark.

Final Thoughts When deep-pocketed institutional players are busy accumulating blue-chip tokens, we asked DeepSeek to identify some under-the-radar cryptos that could really deliver in the upcoming rally. The AI’s top pick was Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , followed by Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , SPX6900 ($SPX), and ai16z ($AI16Z). That said, kindly remember that crypto investments are highly risky due to the market’s volatility. This article is not financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing.

As one of the first Solana-focused firms to list on Nasdaq, the company aims to grow its visibility, increase liquidity, and attract more institutional investors. The Toronto-based company released a press release announcing its debut on Nasdaq. The firm said it will keep trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the symbol HODL as it builds a strong foundation in the U.S. capital markets. As stated earlier by Cryptopolitan , this is the first time any treasury fully dedicated to Solana will appear on Wall Street. The company has officially exited the OTCQB Venture Market, where it was listed under the ticker CYFRF. SOL Strategies grows visibility with Nasdaq listing SOL Strategies held a launch event with its community, partners, and investors to celebrate its entry into the Nasdaq market . In addition to the bell-ringing ceremony in New York, the firm held a digital version of the ceremony on its stke.community platform and invited people to “ring the bell” through a Solana transaction. SOL Strategies also hosted live sessions on X Spaces for company executives, partners, and industry leaders to share their views about what the Nasdaq debut means for the firm’s future. In these sessions, they discussed how the listing would help the company to attract more investors, enter the U.S. capital markets, and increase liquidity for shareholders. They even talked about the many opportunities that Solana will create for institutions looking to enter the digital asset space. The speakers further explained the long-term plan for SOL Strategies and its vision of being recognized globally as a trustworthy and capable blockchain. Chief Executive Officer Leah Wald said the Nasdaq listing was a big step for the company in achieving its mission of providing institutional-grade infrastructure for Solana. She also said the company will now be more visible on Wall Street, connect directly with large U.S. investors, and boost the resources for the Solana ecosystem. She added that the listing began a bigger and broader effort to expand the company’s role in the global economy. SOL Strategies supports the Solana network with strong holdings SOL Strategies said it now has about $94 million worth of Solana in its treasury, which proves the firm’s commitment to Solana’s long-term growth to investors, regulators, and the entire community. It also shows that SOL Strategies is willing to allocate most of its resources to building and maintaining the technology needed to keep the network stable and efficient. SOL Strategies also filed a shelf prospectus with Canadian regulators earlier this year, allowing it to raise $1 billion through securities offerings like shares, debt instruments, or other financial products. The filling allows the company to raise funds quickly without getting new approvals for every offering. This way, SOL Strategies will be able to act on new opportunities like partnerships, acquisitions, or infrastructure investments faster than competitors who might still be waiting for regulatory clearance. Popular investment firm, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest , even selected SOL Strategies to manage its RK Digital Asset Revolutions Fund, showing how it believes in the company’s ability to run validator operations at an enterprise level. These events were perfectly timed because new data shows institutions are investing heavily in the Solana ecosystem. For example, DeFi Dev Corp purchased nearly $40 million worth of Solana, raising its holdings to over $427 million. Analysts say SOL Strategies is becoming more popular in the global economy, and investors believe it can compete with the major players on the blockchain.

Is $WLD seeing a major breakthrough? Is the new momentum sustainable – and will it boost other promising AI tokens like $SUBBD ? Let’s see! Worldcoin’s Momentum Accelerates with Upbit Listing and $250M Institutional Bet On September 9, 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) soared by over 20% following its listing on Upbit , South Korea’s top cryptocurrency exchange. $WLD trading pairs in $KRW,$BTC, and $USDT went live, with deposits and withdrawals across Ethereum, Optimism, and its native blockchain. More than a simple expansion, adding $WLD signals renewed confidence in the crypto economy after previous regulatory hurdles. It could also be a vote of confidence in Altman’s ambitious Worldcoin project and the ‘universal human ID’ Altman wants to unroll to, well, the entire world. Using Orbs, World – the project itself – has already processed IDs for over 15M individuals. Eightco’s Game-Changing Commitment Indicates Institutional Shift Just as $WLD’s momentum began, U.S.-listed firm Eightco Holdings unveiled a bold strategic pivot: a $250M private placement to adopt Worldcoin as its primary treasury asset. That move was then bolstered by a $20M strategic investment from BitMine. The company also appointed Wall Street analyst Dan Ives as chairman and plans to rebrand its ticker to $ORBS, signaling its full transformation. By anchoring its treasury in human-centric digital identity, the company is betting on a future where tokens like $WLD function as infrastructure for entire ecosystems, not just mere assets to trade. This strategy raises both potential and risk, as success hinges on long-term adoption and trust in biometric systems. For now, the plan is working. Due to a combination of pro-$WLD news, the token surged. Trading volume increased by 257% and the token price rose dramatically. That growth might not be done yet; some analysts project $WLD could climb 200% to $4, buoyed by diminished circulating supply and institutional demand. Worldcoin stands at the intersection of AI and blockchain with its unique biometric ‘Proof-of-Human’ system, the eye-scanning Orbs that verify identity without compromising privacy. The project provides foundational infrastructure that many institutional players now believe will be indispensable. And Worldcoin isn’t the only AI project ready to make big moves. The SUBBD platform brings AI tools to an $85B content creation industry and could transform the market. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Bringing AI Tools to $85B Content Subscription Market SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) functions as the native utility token for the SUBBD platform, one of the hottest projects around. SUBBD brings blockchain technology and AI tools to the subscription content creation market, already an $85B market. On the SUBBD platform, fans and creators get new ways to interact with each other using the $SUBBD token. With $SUBBD, users gain access to exclusive content like: VIP staking benefits Platform discounts Platform multipliers Early access There’s also a complete AI toolset, including automated content management and even programmable AI livestreams and AI influencers. What is SUBBD? It’s a project that gives human content creators advanced AI tools to boost and improve their workflows. Learn how to buy $SUBBD in the ongoing presale, which is past $1.1M. Tokens are priced at $0.0564. Get ahead in the AI crypto game by joining the SUBBD Token presale. Worldcoin’s Expanding Vision Upbit’s strategic listing and Eightco’s historic $250M treasury demonstrate Worldcoin’s upwards trajectory. Its biometric identity infrastructure aligns neatly with the digital-first, AI-heavy future – a future Sam Altman is heavily invested in creating. Whether this translates into sustained momentum or signals speculative fever remains to be seen – but it positions projects like $SUBBD for immediate success. As always, do your own research. This isn’t financial advice.

Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan believes a significant Solana rally is on the horizon. He points to critical factors like increasing inflows into exchange-traded products (ETPs) and a growing number of companies adding the asset to their balance sheets as key drivers. This prediction has the crypto community buzzing with anticipation. What’s Fueling the Impending Solana Rally? The potential for a substantial Solana rally stems from a confluence of powerful market forces. These are not just speculative whispers; they are concrete developments that have historically propelled other major cryptocurrencies to new heights. Spot ETF Filings: Multiple asset managers have officially filed for spot SOL ETFs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to make a crucial decision on these approvals by October 10. If approved, we could see several SOL ETFs launching simultaneously in the fourth quarter of this year. This institutional gateway is often a game-changer. Corporate Accumulation: It is not just institutional funds eyeing Solana. Various companies, including notable names like DeFi Development and SolStrategy, are actively accumulating SOL. This strategic corporate buying signals strong confidence in Solana’s long-term value and utility. Hougan highlights that these very conditions—ETF inflows and corporate buying—were instrumental in driving significant price increases for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in their past bull runs. The parallels are striking, suggesting a similar trajectory for Solana. Why is Solana Attracting Such Significant Interest? Beyond the immediate catalysts, Solana’s underlying technology and robust ecosystem make it a compelling asset for both institutional and corporate players. It is not just about hype; it is about fundamental value and innovation. Technical Prowess: Solana boasts incredibly high transaction speeds and remarkably low transaction fees, making it an attractive platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and enterprise solutions. This scalability is a key differentiator in the blockchain space. Thriving Ecosystem: The Solana network supports a diverse and rapidly expanding ecosystem, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming, and various other Web3 applications. This vibrant activity demonstrates real-world utility and adoption. Strategic Asset: Companies are not just speculating on SOL; they are integrating it into their balance sheets as a strategic asset. This indicates a belief in Solana’s enduring role in the future of finance and technology. The growing confidence from experts and corporations suggests a deeper understanding of Solana’s potential to disrupt traditional financial systems and power the next generation of internet applications. Are There Any Hurdles for the Solana Rally? While the outlook for a Solana rally appears robust, it is important to acknowledge that the cryptocurrency market is inherently dynamic and subject to various challenges. Understanding these potential hurdles provides a more balanced perspective. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their price swings. Broader market downturns or unexpected macroeconomic events could impact even the strongest assets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies always presents a degree of uncertainty. Any sudden shifts in policy could affect market sentiment and investor confidence. Network Stability: While Solana has made significant strides in improving its infrastructure, past network outages have raised concerns. Continued focus on stability and decentralization is crucial for sustained growth. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider these factors when evaluating potential opportunities within the crypto space. Informed decisions are always the best decisions. What Does This Mean for the Future of Solana? The confluence of institutional interest, corporate adoption, and Solana’s technological advantages paints a compelling picture for its future. The anticipated Solana rally could mark a significant turning point, further solidifying its position as a major player in the blockchain arena. The potential approval of spot Solana ETFs would open the floodgates for a new wave of capital, making it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to SOL. This, combined with continued corporate buying, could create a powerful upward momentum, mirroring the transformative growth observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum. In conclusion, the stage appears set for an exciting period for Solana. With expert predictions, historical precedents, and a strong fundamental basis, the potential for an explosive year-end surge is undeniably high. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Solana stands out as an asset with significant momentum and a promising outlook. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Solana rally?

Global cryptocurrency powerhouse Binance has announced a significant collaboration with Franklin Templeton, a financial titan managing over $1.6 trillion in assets. This Binance Franklin Templeton partnership marks a crucial step towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative crypto space, promising new digital asset initiatives and products for investors worldwide. What Does the Binance Franklin Templeton Partnership Entail? This isn’t just a handshake; it’s a strategic alliance. The core of the Binance Franklin Templeton partnership is to combine Franklin Templeton’s deep expertise in regulated tokenized securities with Binance’s unparalleled global trading infrastructure and vast investor base. Think of it as bringing together the best of both worlds: Franklin Templeton’s Strength: Decades of experience in traditional asset management, regulatory compliance, and a strong track record with institutional clients. They understand the intricacies of regulated financial products. Binance’s Prowess: The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, offering liquidity, advanced trading tools, and access to a diverse global audience passionate about digital assets. Specific details about the products stemming from this collaboration are eagerly anticipated, with initial releases expected around the end of this year.

New Investor Access: More traditional investors, who might have been hesitant to enter the crypto market directly, could now access digital assets through regulated, familiar channels. Innovation in Tokenization: The focus on tokenized securities is particularly exciting. Tokenization involves representing real-world assets, like real estate, stocks, or bonds, as digital tokens on a blockchain. This can lead to increased liquidity, fractional ownership, and greater transparency. This Binance Franklin Templeton partnership could set a new standard for how traditional financial institutions engage with the blockchain ecosystem. Unpacking the Potential: New Digital Asset Products from the Partnership While the exact products are still under wraps, we can speculate on the exciting possibilities. Given Franklin Templeton’s background and Binance’s platform, the new offerings will likely revolve around regulated digital asset products. Consider these potential avenues: Tokenized Funds: Imagine traditional mutual funds or ETFs, but with shares represented as tokens on a blockchain, offering faster settlement and potentially lower fees. Regulated Crypto Products: Development of compliant products that offer exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but with the regulatory oversight and structure familiar to institutional investors. Enhanced Access to DeFi: Bridging regulated finance with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, making these innovative financial services more accessible and secure for a broader audience. This move highlights a growing trend where established financial players are not just observing but actively participating in shaping the future of digital finance through strategic alliances like the Binance Franklin Templeton partnership . What Challenges Might the Binance Franklin Templeton Partnership Face? Every groundbreaking initiative comes with its set of hurdles. Despite the immense potential, this partnership will undoubtedly navigate several challenges. Key areas of focus will include: Regulatory Landscape: The global regulatory environment for digital assets is still evolving and varies significantly across jurisdictions. Ensuring compliance for new products will be paramount and complex. Technological Integration: Seamlessly merging the technical infrastructure of a global crypto exchange with a traditional asset manager requires robust and secure integration. Market Education: Educating both traditional and crypto investors about these new hybrid products will be crucial for their adoption and success. However, with both companies bringing significant expertise in their respective fields, they are well-positioned to tackle these obstacles head-on. A Glimpse into the Future of Finance The Binance Franklin Templeton partnership is more than just a business deal; it’s a testament to the maturation of the digital asset industry. It signifies a future where the efficiency and innovation of blockchain technology are harmoniously integrated with the stability and regulatory rigor of traditional finance. As the year progresses and more details emerge, we anticipate seeing how this powerful alliance will redefine investment opportunities and reshape the global financial landscape. Keep an eye on this space – the implications could be truly transformative. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of the Binance Franklin Templeton partnership?

51499426,578211,1757511035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51499426.jpeg,Kyrgyzstan Pushes National Bitcoin Reserve With State Mining Plan,https://bitcoinist.com/kyrgyzstan-national-bitcoin-reserve-state-mining/,"Kyrgyzstan has taken a concrete step toward creating a state-held reserve of crypto assets—centered, in practice, on Bitcoin—alongside government-backed mining operations. Kyrgyzstan Targets Bitcoin Reserve And State Mining At a September 9 hearing of the Zhogorku Kenesh (parliament) Committee on Budget, Economic and Fiscal Policy, Minister of Economy and Trade Bakyt Sydykov said draft amendments to the Law “On Virtual Assets” would introduce the concepts of “state mining” and a “state cryptocurrency reserve.” He argued the reserve would be built through several channels—“mining, tokenization of real assets and the issuance of stablecoins backed by the national currency”—and that the mechanism would “strengthen the country’s financial stability and provide new accumulation tools.” The minister anchored the discussion in hard numbers about the sector’s scale. From January through July 2025, turnover across companies operating in Kyrgyzstan’s crypto economy “exceeded 1 trillion soms,” generating “900 million to 1 billion soms” in tax revenue. Official registries now list 169 crypto exchangers, 13 crypto exchanges and 11 mining firms, Sydykov said. Energy security—and what asset the state would actually mine—dominated the committee exchange. MP Dastan Bekeshev warned that “about 800 thousand kilowatts are required to mine one bitcoin. This is enough energy to power about 1,200 apartments for a month. Winter is coming—is it worth the risk?” In reply, Sydykov said Kyrgyzstan applies separate power tariffs to mining and that the state would adhere to them. He stressed no mining farms would be sited at thermal power plants (TPPs) or at the under-construction Kambar-Ata-1 hydro facility. “The main purpose of thermal power plants and hydroelectric power plants, including the Kambar-Ata-1 under construction, is not related to mining. The capacity of small hydroelectric power plants is used for this area: 17 of them are currently operating, and another 15 projects are under implementation,” the minister said. The draft overhauls market rules as well. Sydykov said that beginning January 1, 2026, any crypto exchange seeking to operate domestically must hold at least 10 billion soms in authorized capital—a prudential bar the government says is designed to “strengthen confidence in the market and develop the crypto industry in the country.” Local media tracking the bill’s progress note that “state mining” is defined as the extraction of digital assets using state energy, infrastructure and technological resources, with the reserve to be formed not only from mining proceeds but also from token issuance and acquisitions of virtual assets owned by the state. While the bill’s language consistently uses “cryptocurrency reserve,” the committee exchange and risk framing centered on Bitcoin. Bekeshev’s power-use comparison explicitly referenced “one bitcoin,” and the government’s preferred supply source—mining—points to BTC first. Kyrgyzstan Races Kazakhstan In Central Asia’s Crypto Push That practical emphasis also aligns with prior policy signaling. In mid-April, Kyrgyzstan’s National Investment Agency signed a strategic memorandum with Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao , formally appointing him as an advisor on national blockchain policy and Web3 strategy. In early May, during a visit to Bishkek, Zhao publicly suggested that the country use Bitcoin—alongside BNB—as the initial assets for a national crypto reserve. The push comes as Kyrgyzstan’s crypto sector has become both a budget contributor and a geopolitical flashpoint. The surge in domestic platform activity has coincided with Western sanctions scrutiny, including British and US measures in August targeting entities linked to a rouble-pegged stablecoin network and Kyrgyz firms alleged to have aided Russian sanctions evasion—pressure that prompted President Sadyr Japarov to publicly appeal to Washington and London. The government has rejected wrongdoing claims and emphasized that crypto-related banking operations are under state oversight. Regional context is shifting in parallel. Neighboring Kazakhstan has just proposed creating a national “crypto reserve fund” under its State of the Nation blueprint, part of a broader digital-assets agenda that includes a pilot “CryptoCity” and new legislation by 2026. Analyst Daniel Batten highlighted a key difference with other Bitcoin-curious states, noting on X that, “Unlike El Salvador, Pakistan, Argentina, CAR, Kazakhstan does not have an IMF loan —so this order is likely to go through unimpeded.” If Astana proceeds, it would mark a second Central Asian sovereign building a formal digital-asset buffer, intensifying regulatory and competitive dynamics in the region.

51499502,578679,1757511099,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51499502.jpeg,Dogecoin News: Wie DOGE jetzt mit einem ETF erwachsen wird,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-etf-zulassung-meme-coin/,"Dogecoin hat jetzt einen eigenen ETF in den USA. Experten loben die strengere Regulierung, warnen aber vor fehlender Substanz. Institutionelle Investoren bleiben skeptisch, während die Community feiert. Dogecoin war einst nur ein Internet-Meme mit einem Shiba Inu und einem Augenzwinkern. Jetzt schafft es die Witz-Währung auf das seriöse Parkett der Wall Street – mit einem eigenen ETF. Das sorgt für Begeisterung, Stirnrunzeln und einige spannende Fragen: Wie ernst kann ein Coin ohne klaren Nutzen genommen werden, wenn er plötzlich in einem regulierten Finanzprodukt steckt? Der erste Dogecoin ETF – ein Witz wird ernst Am Donnerstag feiert der Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) sein Debüt an den US-Märkten. Bloomberg-Analyst Eric Balchunas kommentierte trocken, es sei wohl der erste ETF, der „etwas ohne absichtliche Nutzung“ enthalte. Genau dieser Kontrast macht Dogecoin aus: ein Meme-Coin, der eigentlich keine Funktion hat, außer, dass Millionen Menschen ihn lieben. Und diese Liebe hat ihn bis in die Portfolios von Börsenhändlern katapultiert. BIG: Dogecoin is set to enter the ETF market with the launch of the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF, marking the first U.S. ETF centered on a purely speculative token. pic.twitter.com/vMxJohfCbG — CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) September 9, 2025 Mit diesem Schritt wird Dogecoin von einem Internetphänomen zu einem regulierten Anlageprodukt. Das ist nicht nur symbolisch, sondern auch ein Testballon für andere Spaß-Coins. Denn die Frage liegt in der Luft: Wenn Dogecoin es schafft, warum nicht auch Shiba Inu oder Pepe ? Juristische Finesse: Warum der 1940er-Act zählt Das Besondere an DOJE ist nicht nur der Coin selbst, sondern die gewählte rechtliche Basis. Statt wie viele Krypto-Produkte über den Securities Act von 1933 gelistet zu werden, nutzt dieser ETF den Investment Company Act von 1940. Klingt trocken, ist aber entscheidend. Der 1940er-Act verlangt strengere Regeln für Diversifikation und Governance. Mit anderen Worten: mehr Kontrolle, mehr Aufsicht, mehr Schutz. Investment-Experte Ganesh Mahidhar erklärte, dass dies Dogecoin stärker in die Nähe von klassischen Aktien- und Anleihe-ETFs rückt. Das unterscheidet ihn von Bitcoin-ETFs, die eher wie Rohstofffonds funktionieren. Das Ergebnis: Dogecoin bekommt eine seriösere Verpackung, auch wenn der Inhalt weiterhin ein Meme ist. Der Kurs von DOGE reagierte auf jeden Fall stark und stieg gestern um knapp 10 %. Dogecoin im Vergleich zu anderen Meme-Coins Technisch gesehen ist Dogecoin kein reiner Scherz. Er basiert, wie Bitcoin , auf dem Proof-of-Work-Mechanismus. Das bedeutet, dass echte Rechenleistung und Energie nötig sind, um neue Coins zu erzeugen. Damit existiert eine Art „Boden“ für den Wert – ein Unterschied zu vielen anderen Meme-Coins. Shiba Inu oder Pepe laufen hingegen auf Proof-of-Stake und bieten keine vergleichbare Substanz. Sie sind damit anfälliger für extreme Schwankungen und verlieren schneller ihre Basis. Mahidhar betonte jedoch, dass neue Technologien wie Layer-2 oder App-Chains auch dort potenziell Anwendungen in Gaming oder Gambling schaffen könnten. Dogecoin bleibt trotzdem der Platzhirsch im Meme-Sektor – jetzt auch an der Börse. Institutionelle Zurückhaltung, Community-Jubel Die großen Fonds und Pensionskassen werden den Dogecoin ETF vorerst ignorieren. Zu riskant, zu volatil, zu wenig fundamentale Daten. Doch was heute noch als Spielerei gilt, kann morgen schon Marktvolumen haben. Sollte Dogecoin seine Marktkapitalisierung weiter ausbauen, könnte selbst das konservative Kapital neugierig werden. Hier gehts zu einer langfristige Prognose zum Dogecoin. Kurzfristig geht es allerdings weniger um Fundamentaldaten, sondern um Preisbewegungen. Volatilität ist hier Programm – und genau das macht den Reiz für Trader aus. Für die Community ist der ETF jedenfalls ein Ritterschlag: Der Coin, der einst „so wow“ war, hat nun eine Wall-Street-Adresse. SEC-Druck und ETF-Flut Die Genehmigung des Dogecoin ETF erfolgt nicht im luftleeren Raum. Über 90 Anträge für Krypto-ETFs warten derzeit bei der US-Börsenaufsicht SEC, darunter für Solana und XRP. Die Fristen reichen bis in den Oktober. Rex Shares selbst hat gleich eine ganze Palette eingereicht: von weiteren Dogecoin-Produkten bis hin zu BONK und sogar Trump-Token. Analysten wie Mahidhar sind überzeugt, dass ETFs langfristig die Standardhülle für alle Arten von Vermögenswerten werden. Wenn sich die Märkte immer stärker in Richtung Liquidität statt Cashflow bewegen, passt selbst ein Meme-Coin in diese Logik. Ob Dogecoin damit zur Legende oder zur Fußnote wird, entscheidet der Markt – und vielleicht ein bisschen auch der Humor der Anleger. $MAXI: der Wachhund, der DOGE überholen will. DOGE war der freundliche Urvater der Meme-Coins – charmant, verspielt und global anerkannt. MAXI DOGE dagegen ist seine übersteigerte Evolution: derselbe Stammbaum, doch mit Steroiden, Hanteln und 1000x-Leverage. Während DOGE das Lächeln brachte, liefert MAXI DOGE die rohe Markt-Power. Man könnte sagen: DOGE war der Schoßhund, MAXI ist der Wachhund des Bullruns. Rudelführer Anspruch: Kann MAXI das schaffen? $MAXI kombiniert Meme-Kultur mit markttechnischer Raffinesse. Der Token steht für „Proof of Workout & Winning“ – ein Symbol für Disziplin und unerschütterlichen Marktglauben. Durch seine enge Verknüpfung mit DOGE ist $MAXI kein Fremder im Rudel, sondern die weiterentwickelte, ehrgeizigere Version. Wer hier einsteigt, kauft nicht nur einen Coin, sondern einen Turbo-Booster für das gesamte DOGE-Ökosystem. Jetzt rechtzeitig einsteigen und $MAXI im Presale kaufen.

His post included the official document outlining the agreement, which provides details on how both companies plan to position RLUSD in one of the most important financial markets in Asia, a move that could boost XRP’s demand. Ripple and SBI Group Sign a Memorandum of Understanding Towards Distribution of RLUSD in Japan https://t.co/eUhdR4ZCZz pic.twitter.com/TzSQr1iDNm — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) September 9, 2025 The Plan to Distribute RLUSD Ripple and SBI confirmed this agreement in late August , and the image BankXRP shared shows the Memorandum of Understanding signed on August 22, 2025. It includes the involvement of SBI Holdings, its subsidiary SBI VC Trade, Ripple Labs, and Standard Custody & Trust Company. Together, the parties outlined plans for distributing RLUSD in Japan. The document described RLUSD as “a trusted, enterprise-grade stablecoin, built with compliance and transparency in mind.” It notes that RLUSD is fully backed by high-quality reserves, including U.S. dollar deposits, short-term government bonds, and other cash equivalents. Why This Matters for Ripple and XRP The stablecoin market today is valued at nearly $300 billion, with growth expected to reach the trillions in the coming years. For Ripple, the partnership with SBI offers a direct channel into a regulated and expanding market, giving RLUSD credibility and utility at the institutional level. The alignment with SBI, which has consistently supported XRP , strengthens Ripple’s global footprint and helps boost XRP’s adoption. XRP and RLUSD complement each other, as increased adoption of the stablecoin increases demand for XRP as a bridge asset, potentially driving up its price. By working with SBI, Ripple benefits from a licensed local partner that can accelerate the entry of RLUSD into Japan. This collaboration embeds XRP within a regulated ecosystem where RLUSD provides stability and XRP delivers efficiency. Implications for the Japanese Market SBI VC Trade is expected to make RLUSD available in Japan during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026. This timing places RLUSD in a favorable position as Japan continues expanding its regulated digital asset landscape. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to the memorandum, the introduction of RLUSD is not just an expansion of stablecoin options in Japan, but a major step forward in reliability and convenience. SBI VC Trade’s statement within the document reinforces this outlook. The company explained that it was the first to obtain the Electronic Payment Instrument Services Provider License in Japan and has already begun handling stablecoins. This regulatory readiness gives SBI and Ripple a clear entry point for RLUSD distribution and a path to increased adoption for XRP .

As AI models become more sophisticated, their appetite for vast datasets grows, raising critical questions about copyright, fair use, and compensation for original content creators. For those invested in the digital economy, understanding the future of AI data licensing is paramount, as it directly impacts how value is created and distributed in the age of AI. The recent $1.5 billion copyright settlement involving Anthropic has sent shockwaves, signaling a pivotal moment for the industry. Now, a new contender has emerged, promising to revolutionize how AI interacts with the internet’s treasure trove of information. The Looming AI Copyright Crisis: Why AI Data Licensing is Critical The artificial intelligence industry finds itself at a crossroads. On one side, the promise of transformative innovation; on the other, a growing storm of legal challenges. The settlement involving Anthropic is just the tip of the iceberg, with over 40 other pending cases seeking damages for the unlicensed use of data. Imagine a scenario where a popular AI model generates images of iconic characters like Superman without proper attribution or compensation – this isn’t hypothetical, it’s already happening, with Midjourney facing legal action for precisely this reason. Without a robust and scalable AI data licensing framework, experts warn that the industry could face an “avalanche of copyright lawsuits,” potentially stifling innovation and setting back progress indefinitely. This isn’t just a legal quagmire; it’s a fundamental challenge to the economic model of the internet, where content creators, big and small, deserve fair compensation for their intellectual property. Introducing the RSL Protocol: A New Era for Training Data Management Amidst this growing crisis, a beacon of hope has emerged from a familiar name in internet history. Eckart Walther, a co-creator of the foundational RSS standard, has teamed up with a group of technologists and web publishers to launch Real Simple Licensing (RSL). The core mission of the RSL Protocol is ambitious yet essential: to create a training-data licensing system that can operate at an internet-wide scale. As Walther articulated to Bitcoin World, “We need to have machine-readable licensing agreements for the internet. That’s really what RSL solves.” This isn’t the first time calls have been made for clearer data collection practices, with groups like the Dataset Providers Alliance advocating for years. However, RSL stands out as the first concrete attempt at building both the technical and legal infrastructure required to make such a system a practical reality. The RSL system operates on two key pillars: Technical Framework: The RSL Protocol defines specific licensing terms that a publisher can embed directly into their content. This could range from requiring a custom license to adopting standard Creative Commons provisions. Crucially, participating websites will include these terms in their robots.txt file, a widely recognized web standard, in a prearranged, machine-readable format. This makes it straightforward for AI companies to identify which data falls under which terms before ingestion. Legal Infrastructure: To streamline negotiations and royalty collection, the RSL team has established the RSL Collective. This organization functions much like ASCAP for musicians or MPLC for films, acting as a single point of contact for licensors to pay royalties and for rightsholders to set terms with numerous potential licensees simultaneously. This collective approach significantly reduces the administrative burden for both sides. The momentum behind RSL is already impressive, with major players throwing their weight behind the initiative. Early backers of the standard and members of the RSL Collective include: Yahoo Reddit Medium O’Reilly Media Ziff Davis (owner of Mashable and Cnet) Internet Brands (owner of WebMD) People Inc. The Daily Beast Additionally, companies like Fastly, Quora, and Adweek are supporting the standard, even if not directly joining the collective, signaling broad industry recognition of its necessity. This collective backing underscores the urgent need for a structured approach to training data management. Empowering Web Publishers: A Fair Deal for Digital Content For years, web publishers have grappled with the challenge of monetizing their content in an increasingly data-driven world. The advent of AI, while offering new avenues for content distribution and discovery, also presented a significant threat of widespread data exploitation without fair compensation. RSL offers a powerful solution, particularly for smaller publishers who lack the resources or negotiating power to strike individual licensing deals with tech giants. Through the RSL Collective, these publishers can now collectively set terms and receive royalties, ensuring their valuable contributions to the internet are recognized and rewarded. Even large publishers with existing deals can benefit. Consider Reddit, which reportedly receives an estimated $60 million annually from Google for the use of its training data. The RSL system is designed to be flexible; companies are not prevented from negotiating their own custom deals. As Doug Leeds, a co-founder of RSL and former CEO of IAC Publishing, explains, “There’s nothing stopping companies from cutting their own deals within the RSL system, just as Taylor Swift can set special terms for licensing while still collecting royalties through ASCAP.” This flexibility means RSL can serve as a baseline for fair compensation, while also accommodating bespoke agreements for premium content. Navigating the Challenges: The Future of AI Copyright and Compensation While the vision for RSL is compelling, implementing a universal AI copyright and licensing system at scale presents unique challenges. One of the primary hurdles lies in accurately tracking and attributing the use of specific training data within complex AI models. For instance, determining when royalties are due for a particular piece of content ingested into a large language model (LLM) can be far more intricate than tracking a song play on a streaming service. The issue is somewhat simpler for applications like Google’s AI Search Abstracts, which draw data from the web in real-time and maintain clear attribution. However, if the initial training ingestion isn’t meticulously logged, it becomes nearly impossible to confirm if a given document was used. This complexity is amplified if publishers opt for per-inference payments rather than a blanket licensing fee, an option offered by some RSL licenses. Despite these technical complexities, RSL’s creators remain optimistic. “Some of the licensing agreements they’ve already done have required them to be able to report on it, so it’s possible,” says Doug Leeds, emphasizing that perfection isn’t the enemy of progress. “It doesn’t have to be perfect. It just has to be good enough to get people paid.” The core belief is that if the will exists, the technical solutions can be found. However, a more significant challenge might be convincing major AI companies to embrace a system that requires them to pay for data they’ve historically accessed for free. Datasets like Common Crawl have long provided a vast, inexpensive source of web data for AI training. The perception of web data as “cheap, low-quality” could make extracting royalties a difficult proposition. Moreover, the line between legitimate web-scraping and machine-enhanced browsing, as highlighted by the recent CloudFlare and Perplexity dispute, remains blurred, adding another layer of complexity to enforcement. The Path Forward: Will AI Companies Embrace Fair Training Data Practices? The ultimate success of the RSL Protocol hinges on the willingness of major AI labs to adopt and integrate it into their data acquisition strategies. While the economic incentives for publishers are clear, the benefits for AI companies might seem less immediate, especially if they perceive it as an added cost. However, there’s a growing chorus of voices from within the AI industry itself calling for just such a system. Doug Leeds points to recent statements from AI leaders, including Sundar Pichai at last year’s Dealbook Summit, who have publicly acknowledged the need for a standardized licensing framework. “They have said outwardly to everyone, something like this needs to exist,” Leeds affirmed. “We need a protocol. We need a system.” The RSL team plans to hold them to these public declarations. The choice now lies with the AI giants: continue to navigate a legal minefield, or embrace a structured, transparent system that could foster greater trust, unlock new datasets, and ensure the sustainable growth of the industry. The establishment of RSL marks a pivotal moment, offering a concrete solution to one of AI’s most pressing ethical and legal dilemmas regarding training data . Whether it becomes the universally adopted standard remains to be seen, but its arrival undeniably shifts the conversation towards a future of fairer compensation and clearer rules in the AI ecosystem. The launch of the Real Simple Licensing (RSL) protocol by RSS co-creator Eckart Walther represents a significant leap forward in addressing the complex issue of AI data licensing and copyright. Born from the urgent need to provide a scalable, machine-readable system for publishers to license their content for AI training, RSL offers both a technical framework for embedding licensing terms and a legal collective for streamlined royalty collection. Backed by major web publishers like Reddit and Yahoo, RSL aims to empower content creators, ensuring fair compensation and mitigating the risk of future copyright lawsuits that threaten to impede AI innovation. While challenges remain in tracking data usage and securing universal adoption from AI companies accustomed to free data, the protocol offers a compelling solution that aligns with calls from AI leaders for a standardized system. RSL has the potential to reshape the digital economy, fostering a more equitable and sustainable relationship between content creators and the burgeoning AI industry.

Authorized bodies are assigned clear responsibilities: One body will license virtual asset service providers. The other will monitor compliance, especially regarding anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures. The legislation also regulates miner registration, equipment standards for cryptocurrency mining, and licensing procedures for entities conducting transactions with digital assets, creating a structured framework for the sector. National Cryptocurrency Reserve and State Mining Operations According to official statements, the government plans to launch its own mining operations using state infrastructure and resources. Additionally, Kyrgyzstan aims to establish a national cryptocurrency reserve, positioning itself as a forward-looking participant in the global crypto economy. The new law is expected to attract foreign investors, promote blockchain innovation, and create new economic opportunities. Analysts suggest it could position Kyrgyzstan as a regional leader in cryptocurrency adoption and digital asset regulation.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MINING|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-10 13:43:17

Berlin-based AI gaming startup Born has successfully raised $15 million in Series A funding, bringing its total capital to an impressive $25 million. This substantial investment is earmarked for a pioneering mission: to build ‘social’ AI companions that actively combat loneliness and foster real-world bonds, rather than isolating users. For those observing the intersection of technology and human connection, particularly in the rapidly evolving digital landscape, Born’s approach offers a compelling glimpse into the future of interactive AI, echoing the transformative potential seen in decentralized technologies. The Rise of Social AI Companions: A New Vision Fabian Kamberi, CEO and co-founder of Born, articulates a powerful critique of the prevailing landscape of AI companions . He suggests that many existing models are inherently exploitative, designed to create one-to-one relationships with AI chatbots that inadvertently fuel the loneliness epidemic. Kamberi envisions a different path, one where AI serves to enrich human lives through shared experiences. “It feels like it fuels the loneliness epidemic, instead of making it more fun and giving users the opportunity to make their lives better,” Kamberi told Bitcoin World, highlighting a fundamental philosophical shift. Born’s core thesis is refreshingly human-centric: the future of AI companions lies in strengthening real-world connections through collaborative digital engagement. This philosophy underpins their flagship product, Pengu, a virtual pet app that reimagines the classic Tamagotchi or Neopets experience. Unlike its predecessors, Pengu is a generative AI-powered companion that necessitates co-parenting and interaction with another human, be it a friend or a romantic partner. This unique social dynamic transforms the digital pet into a shared project, fostering engagement not just with the AI character, but crucially, with real-life relationships. Born’s Innovative AI Gaming Model: Beyond Tamagotchi The Pengu app represents a significant leap forward in the AI gaming space, moving beyond simple digital pet ownership to create a truly interactive and collaborative experience. Users can raise their virtual Pengu, engage in mini-games, and make joint decisions about their pet’s well-being. This co-parenting model is designed to encourage consistent interaction and shared responsibility, turning a solitary digital activity into a social one. Born operates on a freemium model, offering a base experience with the option for users to subscribe to a ‘Pengu Pass’ for additional features. While the company proudly reports over 15 million global users, the crucial metric of paying customers remains undisclosed. For any consumer subscription business, understanding conversion rates from free to paid users is paramount to long-term sustainability and growth. However, the sheer volume of users indicates a strong initial appeal for Born’s innovative approach to digital companionship and AI gaming . The success of Pengu demonstrates a clear demand for AI interactions that offer more than just text-based conversations. It highlights a growing appetite for immersive, shared digital worlds where AI acts as a catalyst for human connection, rather than a substitute. Born’s model suggests that the next frontier in gaming and AI will be defined by experiences that seamlessly blend virtual engagement with tangible social benefits. Strategic Funding and Expansion for Born Startup The compelling vision behind the Born startup has not gone unnoticed by prominent investors. The recent $15 million Series A round, led by firms including Accel, Tencent, and Laton Ventures, underscores the market’s confidence in Born’s potential. This funding brings their total capital raised to $25 million, providing significant resources for expansion and product development. Born’s journey began under the name ‘Slay,’ a social media app for teenagers focused on positive interactions through giving and receiving compliments. The pivot to AI companions, while seemingly a departure, retains the core principle of fostering positive and socially engaging digital experiences. Kamberi’s earlier description of Slay as the “go-to spot for teens to rediscover social interactions in various play modes” directly foreshadows Born’s current mission. This continuity in their underlying philosophy suggests a well-considered strategic evolution rather than a complete overhaul. With the fresh capital, the Born startup has ambitious plans. They intend to launch new characters for the Pengu app, including a digital companion designed to double as a learning aid. Furthermore, Born is establishing a new office in New York later this year, which will focus on marketing efforts and advanced AI research. This research aims to significantly improve their character engine, enabling each new AI friend to develop a consistent personality, remember past interactions, and genuinely grow alongside its user, making for a richer, more personalized experience. Enrico Dal Re, Born’s head of finance, will spearhead the company’s expansion into the U.S. market. Redefining Connection with Social AI Products Beyond Pengu, Born is actively developing another groundbreaking Social AI product specifically tailored for young people aged 16 to 21, though its apps are accessible to users as young as 13. While this new product remains in stealth mode, Kamberi has offered tantalizing hints about its capabilities. He states that it will empower users to create and interact with “culturally relevant AI companions that feel like real friends.” Imagine AI bots that seamlessly integrate into the digital lives of Gen Z, sending curated TikTok videos or Instagram Reels based on individual content consumption. This level of personalized, context-aware interaction aims to make the AI companions feel genuinely connected to the user’s social world. Kamberi anticipates that this new product will generate significant “network effects” as users share their unique AI creations across social media platforms, fostering a vibrant, interconnected community around their digital friends. “We don’t believe that the current chatbot landscape is the final form factor for how AI friends and consumer AI is done,” Kamberi asserted. “There must be ways for consumer Social AI to be way more engaging to users than just entering a platform and texting a bot that was maybe created by me or another person.” This statement encapsulates Born’s ambition to move beyond static, one-way AI interactions towards dynamic, shared, and truly social experiences that enrich users’ lives. The Power of Generative AI in Crafting Empathetic Digital Friends At the heart of Born’s innovative approach lies the power of Generative AI . Kamberi confirms that the startup primarily leverages OpenAI’s sophisticated generative AI models, which are instrumental in creating the dynamic and evolving personalities of their digital companions. However, Born isn’t simply relying on off-the-shelf solutions; they have built additional, robust safety layers on top of these models to ensure a secure and positive user experience, particularly given their focus on younger demographics. The ongoing AI research at Born’s new New York office will be crucial for refining their character engine. The goal is to enable each new AI friend to develop a consistent and memorable personality, recall past interactions, and grow alongside its human user. This level of personalized evolution is where Generative AI truly shines, allowing for an unprecedented depth of interaction and a sense of genuine companionship. The ability of AI to learn, adapt, and remember fosters a feeling of a developing relationship, moving beyond repetitive chatbot responses to create truly empathetic and engaging digital friends. Luca Bocchio, a partner at Accel, eloquently summarized the investor appeal, noting Born’s ambition to forge a new consumer social category centered on emotionally intelligent AI characters. “We’ve been really impressed by the team’s ability to develop chart-topping apps and their inspiring product vision, and we’re looking forward to continuing our partnership with them as they scale globally,” Bocchio stated. This endorsement highlights the profound impact Born is expected to have on the future of digital interaction, driven by advanced Generative AI capabilities. Benefits and Challenges of Born’s Vision Born’s innovative model presents both significant benefits and unique challenges as it aims to reshape the landscape of digital companionship. Key Benefits: Combating Loneliness: By fostering shared experiences, Born’s AI companions aim to mitigate feelings of isolation, a prevalent issue in modern society. Strengthening Real-World Bonds: The collaborative nature of Pengu encourages interaction between human users, enhancing existing friendships or romantic partnerships. Engaging Shared Experiences: The AI acts as a catalyst for joint activities, providing a novel platform for people to connect and interact. Personalized and Evolving Interaction: Future AI research aims to create companions with consistent personalities that remember interactions and grow with the user, leading to deeper engagement. Potential for Learning Companions: The planned expansion into learning-focused digital companions could offer educational benefits alongside social interaction. Potential Challenges: Monetization Strategy: Converting a large base of freemium users to paying subscribers is a critical challenge for long-term financial viability. Ethical AI Development: Ensuring robust safety layers and responsible AI design, especially for younger users, is paramount to maintaining trust and avoiding unintended negative consequences. Sustaining User Engagement: The novelty of AI companions must translate into sustained, meaningful engagement over time to prevent user churn. Achieving Consistent AI Personalities: Developing a character engine that can maintain a truly consistent and evolving AI personality across numerous interactions is a complex technical hurdle. Privacy Concerns: As AI companions become more integrated into users’ social lives and content consumption, addressing data privacy and security will be crucial. A Connected Future Powered by AI Born is pioneering a transformative approach to digital interaction, moving beyond the isolated chatbot model to cultivate genuine social engagement through AI companions . With significant funding and a clear vision, the Born startup is poised to revolutionize the AI gaming landscape, offering not just entertainment but a meaningful solution to modern loneliness. By leveraging the advanced capabilities of Generative AI and focusing on shared experiences, Born is crafting a future where digital friends enhance, rather than detract from, our real-world connections. This innovative journey underscores the immense potential of AI to enrich human lives and foster a more connected society.

The bill aims to expand virtual asset regulation, introduce state cryptocurrency mining tools, and create a licensing system. The legislation was approved in three readings at once, and new legal definitions on stablecoins and real-world asset tokens (RWA tokens) were introduced. The bill also allows the state to establish its cryptocurrency reserve to strengthen the nation’s financial stability. Kyrgyzstan plans to establish a state crypto reserve Kyrgyzstan will also be able to launch government mining operations using state infrastructure and resources under the new legislation. Miner registration and requirements for digital asset mining equipment will also be regulated. According to local reports, the bill aims to expand the President’s powers to set rules for the regulation, issuance, and circulation of virtual currencies. The ruling also introduces regulatory sandboxes that will test innovative services and technologies within its limited territories. The document revealed that one of the state’s authorized entities will regulate and issue licenses to cryptocurrency service providers. Another authority will be in charge of compliance measures such as combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Kyrgyzstan’s new ruling comes as its Minister of Economy and Trade, Bakyt Sydykov, revealed Tuesday that the country’s turnover of cryptocurrency exchanges and exchanges reached 1 trillion soms in the first seven months of the year. He also revealed at a meeting of the Committee on Budget that approximately 1 billion soms in taxes were received from the sector during the same period. The minister also highlighted that the country’s crypto sector continues to grow and expand every year. Sydykov noted that Kyrgyzstan currently has around 169 crypto exchange operators, including 13 digital asset exchanges and 11 registered companies involved in industrial crypto mining. Committee members agreed after the meeting to approve the legislation on the introduction of state mining. The representative of the executive power in Bishkek also warned that large-scale crypto mining has the potential to disrupt households in residential areas due to its high energy consumption. The country’s member of parliament, Dastan Bekeshec, revealed that the 800,000 KW required to mine one Bitcoin could power approximately 1,200 apartments in the country for a month. He highlighted that winter is coming and questioned whether introducing state mining was worth the risk. Kyrgyzstan plans to introduce a state CBDC President Sadyr Japarov signed legislation in April that gives Kyrgyzstan its central bank digital currency, digital som, legal status. “The purpose of the Constitutional Law is to launch a pilot project of a prototype of a national digital currency, the ‘digital som,’ as well as to create a legal basis and its status.” – Sadyr Japarov , President of Kyrgyzstan. The country plans to make the final decision on whether to officially issue the currency-backed digital assets at the end of 2026. Kyrgyzstan is also expected to begin testing the digital som sometime this year. The minister confirmed that crypto exchanges that want to work in Kyrgyzstan must have at least 1 billion soms (roughly $115,000) in proven capital from January next year. He said the initiative aims to strengthen the country’s confidence in the crypto industry and facilitate its growth. Get seen where it counts.

Key Takeaways: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says banks should raise deposit rates instead of blaming stablecoins. He argues stablecoins won’t kill lending, but will shift credit to DeFi and benefit savers. With higher yields and lower fees, stablecoins are becoming a more attractive alternative to banks. “If local banks are worried about competition from stablecoins, they should pay more interest on deposits,” Hougan posted on X Tuesday , criticizing the long-standing banking model. “They’ve been abusing depositors as a free source of capital for decades.” Stablecoins Threaten Bank Deposits, Says Bloomberg Report His comments come in response to a recent Bloomberg article warning that stablecoins, especially those offering yields, could disrupt traditional banking by drawing away deposits. According to the report, community and regional banks, which rely heavily on customer deposits to issue loans, are especially vulnerable as they lack access to the wholesale funding markets used by bigger institutions. The piece echoed concerns raised by Citi last month , which claimed that yield-bearing stablecoins could trigger a flood of withdrawals from U.S. banks. In parallel, banking lobbyists are pushing Congress to tighten stablecoin legislation, particularly targeting rules around yield offerings under the GENIUS Act. Hougan dismissed the fears, labeling the idea that stablecoins will kill local lending markets as “absurd.” While he acknowledged that fewer deposits may mean reduced lending from banks, he argued that capital won’t disappear, it will simply flow through alternative channels. These scare articles about stablecoins destroying local lending markets are absurd. If local banks are worried about competition from stablecoins, they should pay more interest on deposits. They're only worried because they've been abusing depositors as a free source of… https://t.co/WDALrdLxGp — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) September 9, 2025 “People with stablecoins will provide credit directly to borrowers through DeFi applications,” Hougan said. “The loser here is bank profit margins. The winner here is individual savers. The economy will be just fine.” Stablecoin platforms offering returns of up to 5% have become increasingly attractive as the average US savings account still yields only 0.6%, with the highest rates barely touching 4%, according to Bankrate. After accounting for inflation and bank fees, many consumers see their savings erode in real terms, a reality that pushes more savers toward crypto-based alternatives. Proponents of stablecoins also tout lower transaction costs, instant transfers, and no holding fees as key advantages over traditional banks. US Banking Groups Push to Close Stablecoin Yield ‘Loophole’ Last month, several major US banking associations urged Congress to tighten new stablecoin regulations, warning that a gap in the GENIUS Act could allow issuers to skirt restrictions on paying interest to holders. The Bank Policy Institute (BPI) said the law’s current wording leaves room for stablecoin issuers to offer yield indirectly through affiliated exchanges or other partners. The BPI was joined by the American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Independent Community Bankers of America, and the Financial Services Forum. The GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 18, bans issuers from directly paying interest or yield but does not explicitly prohibit related entities from doing so. However, users holding Circle’s USDC on Coinbase or Kraken can earn returns, creating a competitive alternative to traditional savings accounts. Meanwhile, the crypto industry has warned that aggressive efforts by banks to limit stablecoin yields through regulation would stifle financial innovation and consumer choice.

The exchange recently confirmed a temporary Bithumb POL suspension , halting all deposits and withdrawals for the Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL). This move directly impacts users and highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset operations. What Exactly Happened with the Bithumb POL Suspension? On a recent update, Bithumb officially communicated its decision to temporarily pause services for the Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL). This immediate action affects both deposits and withdrawals. The primary reason cited for this significant Bithumb POL suspension is ongoing network issues. Such disruptions are not uncommon in the fast-evolving blockchain space, but they require swift responses from exchanges to protect user assets and maintain platform stability. The Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) is an upgrade to the existing MATIC token, designed to power the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem. It aims to be a next-generation token that can stake across multiple chains, supporting a wide array of ZK-based Layer 2 chains. Therefore, any disruption to its trading or transfer capabilities is a noteworthy event for its holders. Why is This Bithumb POL Suspension Important for You? If you hold POL tokens on Bithumb, this temporary halt means you cannot move your assets in or out of the exchange for now. This could affect your immediate trading strategies or plans to transfer tokens to other wallets or platforms. Understanding the implications is key: Accessibility: Your POL tokens are currently inaccessible for external transfers. Trading Impact: While deposits and withdrawals are suspended, trading within Bithumb might still be possible, but this needs verification on the exchange’s platform. Market Reaction: Such announcements can sometimes lead to market volatility for the affected asset, though the temporary nature of this Bithumb POL suspension might mitigate long-term effects. This situation underscores the importance of staying informed about exchange announcements, especially for assets you hold. Exchanges like Bithumb prioritize network integrity and user security, which often means taking proactive measures when issues arise. Navigating the Impact: What Should POL Holders Do? When faced with a temporary service suspension like the Bithumb POL suspension , it is natural to feel concerned. However, panic is rarely the best approach. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Regularly check Bithumb’s official announcement channels, including their website and social media. They will provide updates on the resolution of the network issues and the resumption of services. Avoid Unofficial Sources: Be wary of misinformation. Always rely on official communications from Bithumb. Review Your Strategy: If you had immediate plans for your POL tokens, you might need to adjust them. Consider the temporary nature of the suspension and plan accordingly for when services resume. Diversify Holdings: This event serves as a reminder of the risks associated with keeping all assets on a single exchange. Diversifying across multiple platforms or utilizing cold storage can enhance security and accessibility. Bithumb has stated the suspension is temporary, indicating they are actively working to resolve the underlying network issues. Patience and vigilance are crucial during such periods. Looking Ahead: The Future of Polygon Ecosystem Token on Bithumb While the current Bithumb POL suspension is an inconvenience, it is important to remember that temporary suspensions due to network issues are a part of operating in the blockchain space. Exchanges continuously monitor network health and user activity to ensure smooth operations. Once the network issues affecting the Polygon Ecosystem Token are resolved, Bithumb is expected to reinstate deposit and withdrawal services. This incident is a testament to the ongoing challenges and necessary maintenance in the crypto ecosystem. For the Polygon Ecosystem Token, its long-term potential remains tied to the development and adoption of the broader Polygon 2.0 framework. Users should focus on official updates and prepare for the eventual resumption of services, which will allow for normal transaction activity to continue. The commitment of exchanges like Bithumb to address these issues promptly reinforces trust and stability in the market. As the situation evolves, staying connected to reliable news sources will provide the clearest picture. Summary: A Temporary Halt for Polygon Ecosystem Token The temporary Bithumb POL suspension for deposits and withdrawals highlights the operational challenges within the crypto exchange landscape. While inconvenient for Polygon Ecosystem Token holders, Bithumb’s swift action to address network issues demonstrates its commitment to platform integrity. Users are advised to monitor official announcements and remain patient as the exchange works towards restoring full services.

When asked which three cryptocurrencies it would hold forever, OpenAI’s latest large language model, ChatGPT-5 , selected a combination of two market leaders and one less suspected competitor: Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Cardano ( ADA ). Cardano was the most notable pick, with a peer-to-peer review approach and more practical uses, which the artificial intelligence ( AI ) model highlighted as strong catalysts for long-term survival in the crypto space. The list is thus largely unchanged from our last query in August, which consisted of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink ( LINK ) as the “infrastructure bet” indispensable to decentralized finance ( DeFi ) protocols, which has now been replaced by Cardano. ChatGPT’s 3 “forever” cryptocurrencies. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT Bitcoin, “the digital gold” Currently trading at around $112,300, up 96% over the past year, Bitcoin has long been known as the “digital gold” given the fact that it is the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency. Institutional adoption has also grown, with banks, hedge funds, and even governments increasingly relying on it as a hedge against inflation . ChatGPT also singled out its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism and over a decade of uninterrupted operation. Ethereum, “the smart contract giant” Trading at $4,365 at the time of writing, Ethereum stood out to ChatGPT as “the smart contract giant”. Indeed, Ethereum’s blockchain powers decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ), and other DeFi projects, so the asset is more versatile than a mere currency. The transition to Ethereum 2.0 and proof-of-stake ( PoS ) also reduces energy usage and introduces scaling solutions such as sharding, which the AI suggests will make the network more future-proof. Cardano, “the research-driven blockchain” Priced at around $0.88 at press time, Cardano is known for its research-driven approach to blockchain development . The cryptocurrency prioritizes security, scalability, and sustainability through peer-reviewed protocol upgrades. Additionally, its PoS consensus, Ouroboros, is built around energy efficiency and is thus more environmentally friendly than some larger blockchains. Equally important, Cardano focuses on real-world applications, particularly in developing regions, which enhances decentralization and long-term viability, according to the language learning model (LLM).

The famous name stated that ADA lost its rise and wave due to wrong investments and that this mistake benefited Solana and he gained. “Cardano was excited about its long-awaited smart contracts. However, we made the wrong investment because the smart contract model in the project was too rigid and made it difficult for developers to build.

The company, known for strategically holding a substantial amount of Litecoin (LTC) in its reserves, will soon be known as Lite Strategy. This strategic pivot highlights a bold Litecoin strategy that could redefine corporate asset management. What is This Bold Litecoin Strategy All About? The news, initially reported by Business Wire, reveals a significant shift in corporate identity and focus. MEI Pharma currently holds an impressive 929,000 LTC, a digital asset valued at approximately $100 million. This isn’t merely a casual investment; it’s a deliberate and substantial allocation, demonstrating a clear commitment to a digital asset-centric approach. The decision to rename the company to Lite Strategy directly reflects this deep integration of Litecoin into its core financial planning. It moves beyond simply holding an asset to making it a foundational element of the company’s very identity and future direction. This move sends a powerful message to both the traditional financial markets and the burgeoning crypto community. Why Embrace a Litecoin Strategy for Corporate Reserves? Many companies are exploring how digital assets can diversify their balance sheets and provide new avenues for growth. For MEI Pharma, adopting a robust Litecoin strategy offers several potential benefits: Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Litecoin can help stabilize overall portfolio performance, especially during periods of market uncertainty in traditional sectors. Inflation Hedge: Cryptocurrencies, often seen as a hedge against inflation, can protect corporate reserves from the eroding purchasing power of fiat currencies. Growth Potential: Despite volatility, cryptocurrencies like Litecoin have demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, offering substantial returns on investment. Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing digital assets positions the company as innovative and adaptable, appealing to a new generation of investors and stakeholders. This rebranding is more than a name change; it’s a declaration of a new financial philosophy. It underscores the belief that digital assets will play an increasingly vital role in corporate finance. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities of a Litecoin Strategy While the opportunities are compelling, implementing a significant Litecoin strategy also comes with its own set of challenges. Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, meaning the value of MEI Pharma’s holdings could fluctuate significantly. Regulatory landscapes are also evolving, presenting potential uncertainties that companies must navigate carefully. However, the opportunities often outweigh these risks for pioneering companies. By establishing itself as Lite Strategy, the company could: Attract a new class of investors interested in crypto-exposed equities. Leverage its digital asset holdings for future strategic initiatives, such as mergers or acquisitions. Become a thought leader in the space where traditional companies integrate digital assets. This bold move positions Lite Strategy at the forefront of a financial paradigm shift. What Does This Mean for Litecoin and the Broader Crypto Market? The decision by a Nasdaq-listed company to not only hold substantial Litecoin but to rename itself in honor of this Litecoin strategy is a significant endorsement. It lends credibility to Litecoin as a legitimate store of value and an investable asset for institutional players. This move could inspire other publicly traded companies to consider similar allocations, further accelerating institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. For Litecoin specifically, this could lead to increased visibility, enhanced market confidence, and potentially, a positive impact on its price. It signals that beyond individual investors, large corporations are recognizing the intrinsic value and long-term potential of the digital silver. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses: For Investors: Pay close attention to companies adopting digital asset strategies. These could represent early opportunities in a transforming market. For Businesses: Evaluate the potential of digital assets to diversify reserves, enhance liquidity, and signal innovation to stakeholders. Research is Key: Understand the specific risks and rewards associated with different cryptocurrencies and regulatory environments before making any decisions. A New Era of Corporate Finance Driven by a Litecoin Strategy MEI Pharma’s rebranding to Lite Strategy marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional corporate finance and the digital asset economy. By explicitly embedding its substantial Litecoin holdings into its new identity, the company is not just making a financial decision but a profound statement about its future vision. This revolutionary Litecoin strategy could pave the way for other corporations, demonstrating a viable path for integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream business operations.

With momentum building, this crucial juncture has captured investors’ attention, as a sustained breakthrough could signal the beginning of a significant upward surge, and failure to do so may indicate a loss of momentum. SUI Maintains Strength At $3.52 With Fresh Gains In a recent post, crypto analyst BitGuru revealed that SUI is demonstrating notable strength in the market. At the time of the post, SUI was holding firm at the $3.48 level, having already secured a respectable 3.1% gain, a direct result of the asset bouncing back from its recent lows. Related Reading: SUI Breakout Structure Builds – Can The Bulls Push Past $3.50? Bitguru further highlighted that SUI’s momentum is not erratic but steady, signaling that buyers are firmly in control of the price action. This consistency is a key technical indicator, suggesting that the current upward trend has a solid foundation and is not simply a temporary spike. Looking ahead, BitGuru emphasized that the next critical point for SUI is the $3.52 resistance level, which SUI has now claimed. Meanwhile, a successful close above this price point is expected to trigger the next significant upward movement for the asset. This breakout would confirm the bullish momentum and reinforce the positive long-term outlook for SUI. Retest In Focus: Can Bulls Secure The Breakout? CryptoPulse, a prominent analyst, has provided an updated technical analysis of SUI’s price action, highlighting a key bullish development. According to the post, SUI has successfully broken out of a daily falling wedge pattern on its 12-hour chart. This is a significant event, as a falling wedge breakout typically signals a potential trend reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend, indicating that sellers are losing momentum and buyers are gaining control. Related Reading: SUI Price To $7? Analyst Predicts Altcoin’s Path To New ATH Following the breakout, SUI is now engaged in a crucial retest of the zone that previously served as resistance. In a classic “resistance-turned-support” scenario, the price is now testing this former ceiling to confirm it as a new floor, a trend that will likely dictate the asset’s short-term trajectory and confirm the validity of the breakout. Furthermore, CryptoPulse outlines two distinct scenarios based on the retest. If SUI can successfully hold this new support level, it would validate the breakout and set the stage for a continuation of the upward momentum, with the next potential price targets at $4.00 and $4.40. However, if SUI fails to hold the retest and falls back below this key level, it could trigger a deeper pullback, with the price retracing to the $3.20 area before any potential continuation of the uptrend.

A softer-than-expected U.S. PPI pushed bitcoin (BTC) past $113,600, confirming the bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern highlighted earlier this week. The breakout signals the end of the recent pullback from record highs above $124,000 and the resumption of the broader rally. Using the measured move technique, which adds the distance between the pattern’s low and the breakout point to the breakout level, suggests bitcoin could reach nearly $120,000. The ascending 50-, 100-, and 200-hour simple moving averages (SMAs) support the bullish momentum gathering strength. Additionally, the daily chart’s MACD histogram crossing above zero further confirms a positive shift in market sentiment. On the upside, bulls may encounter resistance near the heavily watched 50-day SMA at $114,700, while on the downside, the recent higher low at around $110,000 serves as a key level for bears to challenge.",Markets|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-10 14:02:36

With Ripple’s long legal battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally over , XRP stands on firmer ground, poised to shape wealth, finance, and generational opportunity in ways once thought improbable. Ripple vs. SEC: The Curtain Falls On August 23, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit formally approved a joint dismissal of appeals from both Ripple and the SEC. This ruling closed a nearly five-year saga that had clouded XRP’s future. Judge Analisa Torres’ 2023 decision now stands as the final word: retail sales of XRP are not securities, while institutional sales are securities under U.S. law. Ripple remains responsible for a $125 million penalty and must comply with a permanent injunction governing institutional transactions. The closure removes the single largest source of legal uncertainty for XRP, granting investors and institutions a long-awaited sense of clarity. XRP will not only change your life, it will change your kids life, their kids life, their kids life, and their kids life. Understand the impact ? Most don’t — BALE (@AltcoinBale) September 9, 2025 Ripple’s Expanding Reach The courtroom victory coincides with Ripple’s steady push into new financial products. In December 2024, the company launched RLUSD, a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin built for compliant settlement and institutional use. Combined with Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network, RLUSD strengthens Ripple’s role in global payments, positioning it to compete directly in the rapidly growing tokenized finance sector. Unlocking Institutional Demand With the legal overhang lifted, institutional appetite for XRP is expected to expand. Custody providers, asset managers, and payment platforms now have a firmer footing to integrate XRP into their offerings. Analysts highlight that custody infrastructure and potential exchange-traded products (ETPs) could channel large pools of capital into the asset, deepening liquidity and stabilizing markets. This shift is critical for XRP’s longevity. Generational impact will not come from speculation alone, but from durable adoption by both households and institutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Multi-Generational Vision Bale’s statement touches on a larger truth: XRP’s success could extend beyond today’s investors to shape how families transfer and preserve wealth . Faster remittances can improve livelihoods in emerging economies. Tokenized assets and programmable payments may streamline inheritance and intergenerational savings. With legal clarity, long-term XRP holdings could become part of family portfolios passed down across decades. The Road Ahead Still, challenges remain. Ripple must operate within the limits imposed on institutional sales, while global competition from other digital assets continues to intensify. Economic conditions and regulatory shifts will also influence how far and how fast XRP can scale. Yet the foundation is stronger than ever. With litigation behind it, Ripple is free to build, institutions have reason to engage, and retail users face fewer barriers. Bale’s prediction may sound ambitious, but it is no longer far-fetched. XRP is entering a phase where generational impact is not just rhetoric but a real possibility — provided adoption and utility continue to expand. For the first time in years, XRP’s future looks clearer, and its potential legacy brighter. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

It touched an BNB all-time high of $904.37, a moment that has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This remarkable surge highlights BNB’s growing influence and resilience in a dynamic market. What Fueled BNB’s Unprecedented All-Time High? According to a Bitcoin World market analysis, BNB’s price soared to $904.37, with the token currently trading around $901.90, marking a significant daily increase of 2.72% as per CoinMarketCap data. This impressive performance isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s a clear indicator of strong market confidence and strategic developments within the Binance ecosystem. One of the primary catalysts behind this extraordinary price movement was a key announcement from Binance. The leading crypto exchange revealed a significant partnership with Franklin Templeton, a global asset manager boasting over $1.6 trillion in assets under management. Such collaborations are crucial, as they bridge the traditional financial world with the innovative realm of digital assets. Institutional Validation: Partnerships with established financial giants like Franklin Templeton lend immense credibility to the crypto space, attracting more mainstream investors. Ecosystem Growth: Binance continually expands its offerings, from its robust exchange to the BNB Smart Chain (BSC), fostering a vibrant environment for decentralized applications and services. Increased Utility: BNB’s utility extends beyond trading. It powers transactions on BSC, offers fee discounts on Binance, and participates in token sales, increasing its intrinsic value. The Impact of Strategic Partnerships on BNB’s Valuation The collaboration with Franklin Templeton is a game-changer. It signals a growing appetite among traditional financial institutions to explore and integrate digital assets into their portfolios. For BNB, this means increased exposure and potential demand from a new class of investors who value stability and regulatory compliance. This institutional backing often translates into sustained price momentum and a stronger market position for tokens like BNB. When large asset managers enter the crypto arena, they bring not only capital but also a stamp of approval. This can significantly reduce perceived risks for other institutional and retail investors, potentially paving the way for further adoption. The focus on compliance and robust infrastructure, often a priority for such partnerships, strengthens the overall ecosystem. The recent BNB all-time high demonstrates that fundamental developments, not just speculative trading, can drive significant value appreciation. Investors are increasingly looking at the underlying technology, partnerships, and utility of a token when making investment decisions. This shift towards fundamental analysis bodes well for projects with strong ecosystems and clear use cases, reinforcing BNB’s position. What Does This BNB All-Time High Mean for Investors? For current BNB holders, the achievement of an BNB all-time high is certainly a cause for celebration, validating their investment thesis. For potential investors, it presents an interesting scenario. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the underlying factors contributing to this surge suggest a maturing asset with growing institutional interest. Key takeaways for investors: Long-Term Potential: Strategic partnerships and ecosystem development can contribute to long-term value appreciation. Market Volatility: Even with strong fundamentals, the crypto market remains volatile. It is essential to conduct thorough research and consider risk tolerance. Diversification: As with any investment, diversification is key. BNB can be a part of a broader crypto portfolio. Understanding the forces driving BNB’s success, from its robust ecosystem to strategic alliances, provides valuable insights into the broader cryptocurrency landscape. This BNB all-time high is more than just a number; it reflects a shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. Looking Ahead: The Future Trajectory of BNB The recent surge to a new BNB all-time high positions the token for continued relevance in the crypto market. As Binance continues to innovate and forge new alliances, the utility and demand for BNB are likely to expand. Future developments could include further integrations with DeFi protocols, enhanced staking opportunities, and broader acceptance in various payment systems. The crypto market is constantly evolving, and tokens like BNB, with strong foundational support and strategic vision, are often at the forefront of these changes. Observing how Binance leverages its partnerships and technological advancements will be crucial for understanding BNB’s future trajectory. This exciting period underscores the dynamic nature of digital finance and the immense potential that lies within. In conclusion, BNB’s journey to an unprecedented BNB all-time high of $904 is a testament to the power of strategic partnerships and a robust ecosystem. The collaboration with Franklin Templeton has not only boosted its price but also signaled a broader acceptance of digital assets by traditional finance. As the crypto market continues to mature, BNB stands out as a significant player, offering both utility and potential for growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is BNB?

A significant Bitmain lawsuit has emerged, with the renowned Bitcoin mining rig manufacturer taking legal action against its former partner, Obelisk Energy. This high-stakes legal battle centers on the return of thousands of valuable mining machines, and its outcome could have ripple effects across the digital asset landscape. What’s at Stake in the Bitmain Lawsuit? At the heart of this dispute are 2,700 Antminer rigs, powerful machines essential for mining Bitcoin. Bitmain, a leading name in mining hardware, claims outright ownership of these units. These rigs are currently located at Obelisk Energy’s Beau & Black facility, a crucial detail in the ongoing legal proceedings. The situation escalated following Obelisk Energy’s decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August. This move typically triggers a complex process of asset evaluation and distribution, making Bitmain’s claim even more urgent. The Bitmain lawsuit aims to secure the return of these assets, preventing them from being entangled indefinitely in bankruptcy proceedings. Claimed Ownership: Bitmain asserts clear title to all 2,700 Antminer rigs. Bankruptcy Context: Obelisk Energy’s Chapter 11 filing complicates asset recovery. High Value: Each Antminer represents a significant investment, making the collective value substantial. Unpacking the Financial Impact of the Bitmain Lawsuit To truly grasp the significance of this case, it’s important to understand the value of the assets involved. Thousands of Antminer rigs represent a substantial financial investment. These machines are not just pieces of hardware; they are profit-generating engines in the highly competitive Bitcoin mining industry. For Bitmain, the return of these rigs means reclaiming a significant portion of its inventory or potential revenue-generating assets. For Obelisk Energy, the rigs, if deemed part of their estate, would be crucial in satisfying creditors during bankruptcy. The outcome of the Bitmain lawsuit will directly influence the financial health of both entities. Consider the following: Revenue Generation: Antminers contribute to Bitcoin’s network security and generate rewards for their operators. Market Value: The resale or operational value of 2,700 high-performance rigs can easily run into millions of dollars. Operational Capacity: For Bitmain, these rigs represent a loss of potential deployment or sales, impacting its market presence. Legal Precedent and the Future of Crypto Partnerships This isn’t just a dispute between two companies; the Bitmain lawsuit could set an important legal precedent for the broader cryptocurrency industry. As more traditional legal frameworks intersect with the unique nature of digital assets and decentralized businesses, such cases become vital benchmarks. How courts interpret ownership and contractual agreements involving specialized crypto hardware, especially in the context of bankruptcy, will be closely watched. This case highlights the critical need for crystal-clear contracts and robust legal agreements when forming partnerships in the rapidly evolving crypto space. It also sheds light on the inherent risks associated with business relationships where physical assets are deployed or managed by a third party, particularly in an industry as volatile as crypto. Ensuring proper documentation and legal counsel is paramount. Navigating Business Risks: Lessons from the Bitmain Lawsuit The ongoing legal battle offers valuable insights for any company operating within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It underscores the importance of thorough due diligence when selecting business partners and the necessity of having watertight legal agreements in place. This includes explicit clauses regarding asset ownership, dispute resolution, and contingencies for financial distress, such as bankruptcy. Companies should proactively review their contractual arrangements and ensure they adequately protect their interests, especially when dealing with high-value assets like mining equipment. The lessons from this Bitmain lawsuit are clear: preparation and legal foresight can mitigate significant future headaches and financial losses. The cryptocurrency market, while offering immense opportunities, also comes with unique challenges. Legal clarity and strong foundational agreements are essential tools for navigating this complex landscape successfully. The Bitmain lawsuit against Obelisk Energy is more than just a corporate disagreement; it’s a compelling case that underscores the intricate legal and financial challenges within the Bitcoin mining sector. As the industry matures, such disputes highlight the increasing importance of robust legal frameworks and clear contractual agreements. The resolution of this case will undoubtedly offer valuable lessons for businesses operating in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, emphasizing the need for meticulous planning and strong legal counsel to safeguard assets and partnerships.
