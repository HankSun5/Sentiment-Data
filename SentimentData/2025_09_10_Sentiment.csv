The company pulled in $972.2 million in net sales for the quarter ending August 2. That’s up from $798.3 million last year in the same quarter. The reason? A small lift in hardware sales, enough to tick the total revenue higher, but nothing major. Still, investors pushed the stock up 4% after hours, riding momentum and memes more than actual operational wins. This company, still known for the 2021 retail frenzy, posted a net income of $168.6 million, up from $14.8 million a year ago. The massive jump came down to some wild swings in asset values, especially crypto. GameStop now holds $528.6 million in Bitcoin, up sharply from last year. Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities hit $8.7 billion, compared to just $4.2 billion at the end of Q2 last year. Cut costs drive operating income turnaround GameStop slashed its spending in a big way. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses dropped to $218.8 million, down from $270.8 million last year. That’s a drop of over $50 million. This cost-cutting helped turn things around. Operating income swung to $66.4 million this quarter, up from a $22 million loss in the same period last year. When excluding impairment and other adjustments, adjusted operating income came in at $64.7 million, compared to an adjusted loss of $31.6 million last year. That shows GameStop leaned hard on cutting fat rather than growing core sales. The company’s adjusted net income, after removing impairment, unrealized digital asset gains, and other line items, came in at $138.3 million. That’s a massive spike from the $5.2 million adjusted net income posted in Q2 last year. But again, most of that is balance sheet math and crypto exposure. GameStop leaned into non-GAAP reporting this quarter. They highlighted several adjusted numbers: adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. All these tweaks remove transformation costs, severance, digital asset gains and losses, impairments, and divestitures. The company argued that these figures “provide useful information” for investors watching its core operations. Critics say they’re just cleaning up the mess to make the quarter look better. Either way, there’s a huge gap between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers this time. Capital expenditures were taken out of free cash flow calculations, painting a smoother financial picture. Meanwhile, crypto played a big role in inflating the company’s books. That $528.6 million Bitcoin stash is now a piece of their financial story.

It was also heavily obfuscated to avoid detection. The crypto-stealing malware has two attack vectors. When no crypto wallet extension is found, the malware intercepts all network traffic by replacing the browser’s native fetch and HTTP request functions with extensive lists of attacker-owned wallet addresses. Using sophisticated address swapping, it employs algorithms to find replacement addresses that look visually similar to legitimate ones, making the fraud nearly impossible to spot with the naked eye, said cybersecurity researchers. If a crypto wallet is found, the malware intercepts transactions before signing, and when users initiate transactions, it modifies them in memory to redirect funds to attacker addresses. The attack targeted packages such as ‘chalk,’ ‘strip-ansi,’ ‘color-convert,’ and ‘color-name,’ which are core building blocks buried deep in the dependency trees of countless projects. The attack was discovered accidentally when a build pipeline failed with a “fetch is not defined” error as the malware attempted to exfiltrate data using the fetch function. “If you use a hardware wallet, pay attention to every transaction before signing, and you’re safe. If you don’t use a hardware wallet, refrain from making any on-chain transactions for now,” advised Ledger CEO Charles Guillemet.

It affects any environment running JavaScript/Node.js applications, such as web applications running in browsers, desktop applications, server-side Node.js applications, and mobile apps using JavaScript frameworks. So a regular business web application could unknowingly include these malicious packages, but the malware would only activate when users interact with cryptocurrency on that site. Uniswap and Blockstream were among the first to reassure users that their systems were not at risk.

Vous signez, tout a l’air normal et vos fonds partent chez le pirate. Irrécupérables. L’attaque a été traquée dans des packages NPM vérolés , preuve qu’une simple brique de la chaîne logicielle peut ouvrir une brèche gigantesque . Oui, la régulation progresse et l’adoption grimpe, mais ce coup de semonce rappelle une réalité brute : la crypto, c’est top, si vous êtes carré . Le risque est bien là, et c’est pour ça que certains projets bossent dur pour remettre la sécurité au centre et rassurer les utilisateurs . On décortique l’attaque, puis focus sur deux initiatives qui veulent rendre la crypto plus sûre, plus simple, plus fiable . Un malware qui remplace vos adresses crypto Le hack mis au jour repose sur une méthode aussi simple qu’efficace : modifier les adresses de destination lors des transferts crypto. L’utilisateur pense envoyer ses fonds à un proche ou à un exchange, mais l’adresse est automatiquement remplacée par celle du pirate. Le pire ? L’attaque est invisible à l’œil nu : tant que vous ne vérifiez pas manuellement chaque caractère, la transaction part mais pas au bon endroit. Un type de hack, basé sur la supply chain logicielle , qui montre, malheureusement, que la menace ne vient pas toujours d’une faille blockchain, mais bien des outils annexes (plugins, bibliothèques, applications). La leçon est claire : il faut redoubler de vigilance avant de signer une transaction, même sur des plateformes réputées fiables. Pourquoi cet incident inquiète autant Ce n’est pas un “accident de parcours” . Ce hack met à nu une faille de fond dans la crypto. Plus l’argent afflue, plus les attaquants se professionnalisent et visent des maillons inattendus de la chaîne. Les devs encaissent en première ligne mais c’est l’utilisateur final qui paie la note . Avec les ETF BTC/ETH et le retour des capitaux institutionnels , la sécurité devient un sujet vital . Chaque incident ronge un peu plus la confiance du grand public et sert d’argument aux régulateurs les plus durs. D’où l’urgence de projets security-by-design : des protections intégrées dès le cahier des charges , pas bricolées après coup, pour protéger l’utilisateur par défaut . Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) : la Layer 2 qui sécurise et accélère Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) est pensé comme une évolution de Bitcoin . Construit en Layer 2 , il s’attaque aux limites historiques du réseau : lenteur, frais élevés et impact énergétique.

Des projets comme Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) (Layer 2 plus fluide et plus sûre) ou Best Wallet ($BEST) (protection utilisateur au centre) montrent que l’écosystème sait contre-attaquer . La leçon pour les investisseurs : Vigilance quotidienne : vérifiez l’adresse à chaque envoi, verrouillez vos wallets, mettez à jour vos outils. Priorisez le “security-first” : suivez les projets qui intègrent la sécurité dès la conception. Au-delà des promesses, la vraie richesse à long terme est simple : des fonds en sécurité .",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-09 22:05:12

The capital raise, according to a statement, will be through an overseas issuance of new shares. This comes as the company is looking at using cryptocurrency as its primary treasury asset to offset domestic economic challenges. Metaplanet makes another aggressive move to buy BTC The Tokyo-based firm, which is listed on the Standard Market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, planned on issuing a total of 385 million new shares at a price of 553 yen per share, representing a 9.93% discount from the closing price on September 9. Payment date for the new shares is pegged at September 16, and the delivery date the following day, on September 17. The company expects its outstanding shares to grow from approximately 756 million to more than 1.4 billion after the capital increase. *Notice Regarding Determination of Issue Price and Other Matters* pic.twitter.com/DWM3r1oYCC — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) September 9, 2025 Metaplanet may be on track to meet its targets within set timelines Metaplanet stated that its strategy to acquire more Bitcoin is a response to Japan’s mounting economic challenges that include a weakening of the yen, high government debt, and prolonged negative interest rates. As recently reported by Cryptopolitan , MetaPlanet added 136 BTC worth 2.25 billion yen as part of its continued Bitcoin Treasury initiative. Its total Bitcoin holdings are now worth 304.563 billion yen, or $2.08 billion. The purchases build on the company’s plans to grow its digital asset stash to 100,000 BTC by the end of next year. Meta Planet’s current holding of 20,136 BTC indicates that it has achieved about 67% of its 2025 target and 20% of its 2026 target. MetaPlanet is also looking at acquiring 210,000 BTC by 2027 in a move that would account for 10% of the total Bitcoin in circulation. With the latest developments, MetaPlanet could be on track to meet its ambitious targets by the end of next year and 2027. And its 20,136 BTC holdings place it in sixth position globally among public firms with Bitcoin Treasury strategies. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

All three major indexes closed at record highs Tuesday, ignoring warning signs in the economy like it was business as usual. The S&P 500 finished the session up 0.27% at 6,512.61, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.37% to close at 21,879.49, a new intraday record too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 196.39 points, or 0.43%, landing at 45,711.34. One big reason? A surge in UnitedHealth stock. Meanwhile, new labor data dropped like a hammer. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised its numbers for the 12 months through March, cutting 911,000 jobs from the books, Cryptopolitan reported Tuesday. These weren’t tiny adjustments. This was the biggest downward revision since at least 2002. It was also way worse than Wall Street expected. Basically, job growth during that period was a lot weaker than people thought. “I think the economy is weakening,” said Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, during a chat with CNBC. “Whether it’s on the way to recession or just weakening, I don’t know.” Stocks rally despite ugly job numbers Despite the brutal revisions, markets barely reacted. Why? Because the data covered a period that ended six months ago. Traders didn’t see it as an immediate problem. But there’s a twist, this kind of bad labor data might pressure the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates faster than planned. That’s what Wall Street really cares about. Chris Zaccarelli, the chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, put it this way: “The jobs picture keeps deteriorating and while that should make it easier for the Fed to cut rates this fall, it could also throw some cold water on the recent rally.” So yeah, rate cuts could come. But they will likely not be the magic fix everyone’s betting on. Tech stocks, especially semiconductors, have been doing a lot of the heavy lifting lately. Broadcom and Nvidia helped push the Nasdaq to that record high earlier this week. But Broadcom took a hit on Tuesday, falling more than 2%, after rallying nearly 13% over the past week. That little stumble didn’t derail the bigger momentum, but it was a reminder that even hot stocks can cool fast. Traders watch inflation, and AI frenzy grows What’s next? Two big inflation reports that could shape what the Fed decides at its meeting next week. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for August comes out on Wednesday morning. Then on Thursday, it’s the Consumer Price Index (CPI). If either one shows inflation heating up again, it could kill the whole “rate cuts are coming” fantasy. “If the CPI shows a worsening trend of higher inflation on Thursday then the market will begin worrying about stagflation,” said Zaccarelli. “The bull market has been extremely resilient this year, but we could be approaching an inflection point where it is tested again.” In plain English: If prices rise and growth slows at the same time, things could get messy. While Wall Street kept one eye on inflation and the other on job data, a full-on buying frenzy broke out in the AI space. Nebius Group, a lesser-known infrastructure company focused on artificial intelligence, exploded almost 50% higher Tuesday. That came one day after it announced a multi-billion-dollar deal with Microsoft. The stock had already jumped 60% in extended trading on Monday. Nebius’s rival CoreWeave saw its own boost, up 8%, just from riding the same wave.

Market trends seem to support this outlook. At the end of last month, Bitcoin surged to a record-breaking $124,128, eclipsing its previous high of $122,838 reached only weeks earlier. That rally slowed, however, once July’s inflation report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics came in hotter than expected. On the regulatory side, President Trump recently approved the GENIUS Act, the country’s first comprehensive law for stablecoins, requiring them to be fully backed by reserves. Simultaneously, the SEC rolled out Project Crypto , a broad reform plan designed to modernize securities laws and provide blockchain firms with clearer guidance. These developments have many analysts pointing to the potential start of a new bull run. If Claude’s forecasts are on target, XRP, Pudgy Penguins, and Dogecoin could find themselves at the forefront of the next major wave of meme coins and altcoins. XRP (Ripple): Claude Predicts a Possible 17x Run Toward $50 Claude AI predicts that XRP ($XRP) may climb as high as $50 by late 2025, nearly 17x its current value around $3. The coin has already shown resilience, peaking at $3.65 on July 18 and breaking past its 2018 record of $3.40 before easing back by about 18%. Ripple’s global reach continues to grow. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund endorsed XRP as a promising option for cross-border payments in developing regions. Earlier this year, Ripple also resolved its prolonged dispute with the SEC after the agency abandoned its case, cementing the 2023 ruling that retail XRP trades are not securities sales. This outcome provided clarity and confidence not just for Ripple but for major altcoins more broadly. Claude’s conservative scenario puts XRP between $3.20 and $5, while its bullish outlook sets $50 as a stretch target contingent on the US approval of spot XRP ETFs. Technical readings back this up: the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 55, signaling that selling pressure is over and there is rising buying momentum. Additionally, the appearance of several bullish flag formations across its support and resistance lines over the year indicates the probability of further upside. Over the past year, XRP has gained 467%, pipping market leaders Bitcoin (104%) and Ethereum (88%). Pengu ($PENGU): Cross-chain Penguin Token is Now Solana’s Biggest Meme Coin. Claude AI Predicts Further Growth Yet Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) , expanded to Solana from Ethereum back in December but is already now the largest meme coin on Solana with a market cap just shy of $2.2 billion. Currently priced at $0.03465 after rallying 18% in the past week, PENGU is now the fifth-largest meme coin in crypto. As of this writing, it’s trading 49% short of its all-time high of $0.06845, set on December 17, 2024. Its RSI has dropped to 57 and is trending lower, suggesting that there is plenty of headroom left for growth in the short to mid-term as investors continue to target the psychological $0.05 level, which would clear the token above previous resistance levels. Technical patterns are also worth watching. Between January and April, PENGU formed a bullish descending wedge, a setup often linked to bullish reversals. Claude’s outlook sees the token potentially making a push toward $0.0791 by New Year if momentum continues. This would mean a 123% in 5 months, more than doubling from current price. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Still Commands the Market Launched in 2013 as a parody, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has grown into a top ten crypto, capitalizing $36.3 billion of the $4 trillion market. Its staying power stems from a dedicated community and its use as a payment option across a growing number of platforms. Although DOGE frequently tracks Bitcoin’s movements, its deep liquidity and strong base of supporters have helped it weather multiple market cycles. Currently trading around $0.2417, it has doubled in value over the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. After hitting an RSI of 80 in July, Dogecoin cooled almost to 40 in the midst of a market-wide selloff last month, although it’s now back up to 60, indicating rapidly growing buying momentum. While its large market cap ties its movements to major cryptos, DOGE has a history of sudden, outsized rallies. Analysts have noted falling wedge patterns forming between November and April, again in mid-July, and once more in August, a recurring sign of possible upward moves. Claude’s high-end projection sees DOGE at $0.39 by year’s end, which would be a tidy 62% increase. However, it is a little underwhelming for the “Doge Army” for whom the idea of Dogecoin reaching $1 remains a long-standing rallying cry. Adoption continues to grow as well. Tesla now accepts DOGE for select merchandise, and major platforms like PayPal and Revolut allow Dogecoin transfers. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A New Challenger to Dogecoin’s Throne For those seeking newer meme coin plays outside Claude’s forecast, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has emerged as an intriguing option. Dubbed the “amped-up cousin” of Dogecoin, MAXI offers a fresh take on the meme coin formula. Dogecoin, with its massive market cap, often mirrors Bitcoin and Ethereum’s moves and has lost much of its explosive volatility from earlier cycles. Maxi Doge, by contrast, is designed to capture that higher-risk, higher-reward appeal, and has already raised nearly $2 million just weeks into its presale. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MAXI is heavily focused on building strong community channels through Telegram and Discord, complete with contests and cross-project collaborations. Out of its 150.24 billion supply, 25% is set aside for the Maxi Fund, which will bankroll marketing and partnerships. Investors can also stake tokens, with current yields reaching 161% APY, though this will decline as more users participate.

51467654,https://cryptonews.com/?p=420500,1757457000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51467654.jpeg,Best New Cryptos Under $1 – 9 September,https://cryptonews.com/news/best-new-cryptos-under-1-9-september/,"As the global cryptocurrency market begins its recovery and the total market cap pushes back toward $4 trillion, retail investors are once again hunting for the best meme cryptos to buy in 2025 under $1. Below, we explore three trending meme coins that are generating serious buzz, why they stand out from the crowd, and why they may be among the best and most explosive affordable cryptos this year. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): The Dogecoin Rival That Could Explode in 2025 A bold new competitor to Dogecoin is making waves, introducing Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , the roided-up cousin of the original meme coin. With Dogecoin now established as a multibillion-dollar asset, its price action tends to mirror blue-chip cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While still iconic, Dogecoin’s volatility has cooled compared to its dramatic 2021 bull run highs. For investors looking for high-risk, high-reward meme coins in 2025, Maxi Doge is quickly becoming a hot choice. Since launching its presale just weeks ago, the project has already raised nearly $2 million, showing strong early demand. Built as an ERC-20 token, MAXI emphasizes community-driven growth, with plans to expand Telegram and Discord groups into full-fledged meme coin hubs featuring contests, trading competitions, and collaborations with other projects. From its 150.24 billion supply, 25% goes towards the “Maxi Fund,” a pool for marketing and strategic partnerships. Holders also benefit from lucrative staking rewards, currently offering up to 163% APY (though yields decrease as more stakers join). The token’s presale price is $0.0002565, with a slight price increase set to take effect within 60 hours. Investors can participate directly through the Maxi Doge official website, using crypto wallets like MetaMask and Best Wallet or a bank card.

Launched just over two weeks ago, this ERC-20 meme coin has already raised nearly $1 million, showcasing growing momentum and rising investor excitement. PEPENODE brands itself as the first “mine-to-earn” meme token. Instead of simple passive staking, users can build digital mining nodes that boost their staking rewards the more nodes they add. This gamified approach encourages continued token accumulation and long-term participation, making it one of the most creative meme coins to watch in 2025. Right now, PEPENODE is priced at $0.0010491 on its official presale site. Prices are designed to increase incrementally every few days until the presale concludes, rewarding early investors with the lowest entry point.

Visit the Official Website Here Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE): Pepe’s Best Iteration Yet is Challenging Established Cryptos Like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Finally, Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is quickly carving out a name as one of the top meme coins to invest in 2025, blending humor with a strong retail trading community. Its beguiling premise helped it to become one of the largest meme coin presales in history, raising almost $74 million before listing. Originally launched on Ethereum earlier this year, WEPE has already surged over 250% since late May. In the past 24 hours alone, it rose 7.3%, outperforming bigger meme coins such as Dogecoin ($DOGE), Shiba Inu ($SHIB), and Pepe ($PEPE). The project’s core mission is simple: empower meme coin enthusiasts through community-led trading hubs where members share insights, signs, and collaborate on trading strategies. Now, WEPE is expanding onto Solana, a move designed to increase scalability and reduce transaction costs. The clever part? Every Solana WEPE purchase automatically burns an equal amount of Ethereum-based WEPE 1:1. This ensures supply remains unchanged while expanding distribution across two major blockchains. With Solana’s speed, lower gas fees, and massive user base, WEPE looks well-positioned to attract a wider audience and strengthen its momentum. The new Solana version of WEPE is priced at just $0.001 and will soon be available through the official Wall Street Pepe site. Stay updated through Wall Street Pepe’s official X and Telegram pages.

51467644,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82593,1757457060,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ruvi AI (RUVI) Could Be the Next Tron (TRX) as Phase 3 Nears 10% in Days, Securing The Title Of One Of The Highest In Demand Altcoins",https://timestabloid.com/ruvi-ai-ruvi-could-be-the-next-tron-trx-as-phase-3-nears-10/,"Every so often, a new altcoin emerges with the community, utility, and momentum to become the next big thing. Investors who got into Tron (TRX) early know this feeling well. Now, a new project, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is showing the same signs of explosive potential. Its presale is moving at a blistering pace, with Phase 3 nearing the 10% sold mark just days after starting. This incredible velocity has secured its title as one of the highest-in-demand altcoins on the market. The numbers speak for themselves. Ruvi AI’s presale is on the brink of crossing the $3.6 million milestone, with over 265 million tokens already sold. This surge is driven by a fast-growing and powerful community of more than 3,500 investors who see the clear potential for a Tron-like ascent. The market has spoken: Ruvi AI is a project to watch. From Tron’s Rise to Ruvi AI’s Reign The comparison to Tron is about disruptive potential. Tron built a massive ecosystem by focusing on decentralized content and entertainment. Ruvi AI is set to do the same by targeting the booming $104 billion creator economy . By providing powerful, real-world solutions, Ruvi AI is laying the groundwork for mass adoption and a valuation that could rival today’s top projects. This potential is built on a rock-solid foundation of credibility. Ruvi AI has successfully completed a comprehensive smart contract audit with CyberScope , a reputable third-party security firm, assuring investors of the platform’s security. This, combined with a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , has established Ruvi AI as a legitimate, high-growth project attracting serious capital. A Super App to Revolutionize a Multi-Billion-Dollar Industry The engine behind Ruvi AI’s potential to become the next Tron is its revolutionary super app. This all-in-one ecosystem empowers content creators with a suite of AI-driven tools that streamline workflows and enhance creativity. By serving a massive and growing market, the app creates sustainable demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Helps creators identify viral topics before they become saturated, giving them a significant competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube and TikTok, saving hours of work. Native Media Creation: Allows users to generate professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, reducing production costs. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire content creation process, from planning to scheduling, for maximum efficiency. Last Call: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge Is Just Around the Corner The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token available at an attractive $0.020 . But with 10% of this phase selling out in mere days, this ground-floor opportunity is closing fast. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO, driving record sales as investors rush to lock in an immediate paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s journey is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience upon launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broader market adoption. For investors seeking to maximize their returns, the project’s VIP program offers a clear path to significant wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. Seizing the Next Big Opportunity As the presale accelerates toward a sell-out and a 40% price surge looms, the parallels to the early days of Tron are undeniable. For investors who missed that historic run, Ruvi AI presents a rare second chance to be part of what could be this bull run’s defining success story.

These three altcoins have comfortably outperformed the market average, yet their gains today may only be the beginning of a medium- and long-term drive. We examine their technicals (and fundamentals) in this article, considering where they could be heading in the coming weeks and towards the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction Today 9 September XRP (XRP): Altcoin Eyeing New Record Highs As Ripple Continues to Expand The third-biggest cryptocurrency in the market, XRP, has climbed over the psychologically important $3 level, making for a 2.5% gain in the past 24 hours. It’s also up by 7% in a week, and while it hasn’t yet erased a 6% loss in a month, doing so is likely only a matter of time. Its chart today suggests that now may be a perfect time to buy the coin, given that its indicators have begun rising without having yet moved into an overbought position. Source: TradingView For instance, its RSI (yellow) has just risen above 50, while its MACD (orange, blue) is also about to turn positive. The FOMC’s meeting next week could be the big catalyst for a major rally, and when combined with Ripple’s increasingly strong fundamentals, we could see the XRP hit new heights soon enough. Ripple has been expanding vigorously this year, particularly since it finally ended its legal case with the SEC in early August , and the expansion of its cross-border (and stablecoin) business will translate into greater demand for XRP down the line. As such, we could see the XRP price return to $3.50 as soon as the end of this month, while the alt could climb beyond $5 by the end of the year. Bonk (BONK): Analysts Predict That Meme Coin Could Soon Enter ‘Price Discovery’ At $0.00002345, BONK has managed an impressive 6% return in a day, and an even more impressive 15% increase in a week. As with XRP, it is still down in the past month (by 12%), yet this only means that it can still afford to rise further without becoming dangerously overbought. Its chart today confirms what it had been hinting at in previous days and weeks, which is that a breakout is underway. Source: TradingView Indeed, the BONK price has surged out of its most recent bullish pennant, while its RSI has gone from around 40 to 55 in only a day or two. This trend is likely to continue, with some online analysts predicting that the token will enter “price discovery” soon . This could mean that it will not only return to its current ATH of $0.00005825 but will surpass it in the following weeks, especially if the market enters an end-of-year rally. Hyperliquid (HYPE): DEX Growth Pushing Alt to New All-Time Highs Hyperliquid has gained by 6% in the past 24 hours, and actually set a new ATH of $55.04 only a few hours ago. In other words, it’s one of the most bullish altcoins in the top 100 right now, and could set new records in the coming hours and days. At $53.94, it’s up by 21% in a week and by 24% in a month, while it has also gained by just over 1,300% since its all-time low of $3.81 from November, which was when it listed. The coin is clearly going from strength to strength, which is all largely because its native platform, the DEX Hyperliquid, is doing very much the same. Hyperliquid has been setting new revenue records in recent weeks and months, recording $106 million in August and accounting for 70% of the DeFi perpetuals market. This is exceedingly bullish, and given that the wider market appears to be waking up again, the HYPE price is only likely to rise further. Encouragingly, HYPE’s technical indicators are rising but have not yet entered overbought regions, so there’s still an opportunity to buy the coin even now. Its crypto price prediction is therefore very positive, and the coin could potentially hit $100 by the middle of November, and end the year closer to $150. Bitcoin Hyper: Exciting New Later-Two Network Raises $14.6 Million in Presale As strong as the coins above are looking, traders may also be interested in diversifying into newer tokens, so as to widen their exposure to possible market-beating gains. To this end, they may want to investigate some of the more interesting presale tokens currently doing the rounds at the moment. One of the best of these is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a Solana-based layer-two network for Bitcoin . The focus is on verifiability—ensuring every state change can be reproduced from the Bitcoin chain without trusting intermediaries. Efficiency and security must be balanced. Frequent anchoring raises costs; infrequent anchoring weakens trust. Current research points to periodic… — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 8, 2025 Bitcoin Hyper has now raised just over $14.6 million in its ongoing presale, which has snowballed to become one of the biggest of 2025. The reason why the project is outperforming other presales is that it has some very promising fundamentals. It’s about to launch a fully fledged layer-two network for Bitcoin, offering smart contract functionality, as well as lower fees and faster confirmation times. This means it could help tap into Bitcoin’s enormous value for DeFi purposes, with the platform aiming to develop into a growing ecosystem of dapps and decentralized trading protocols. It makes use of Solana’s Virtual Machine and of zero-knowledge rollups, giving it a speed and security unsurpassed by other extant L2s. Native token HYPER will be necessary to pay for its transaction fees, something which could result in big demand for the token. Investors can buy it now by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as MetaMask or Best Wallet. HYPER is currently available at $0.012885, although this will continue to rise for the duration of the sale.

The company has partnered with BlackRock’s BUIDL fund through USDtb, a token issued with Anchorage Digital Bank, to position itself as a frontrunner in one of the most closely watched races in crypto. Leading decentralized exchange, Hyperliquid, is preparing to launch USDH as its native stablecoin. The decision over which issuer will oversee its minting and redemption has attracted a slate of major players. In August, Hyperliquid processed around $400 billion in perpetuals trading volume and has a stablecoin market cap of over $5.7 billion, so the stakes are high. Whoever wins the mandate will have access to one of the largest stablecoin liquidity bases in the market, and Ethena’s proposal shows it really wants to emerge as the winner. Proposals for Hyperliquid’s USDH. Source: Messari Ethena pitches revenue-sharing, migration, and security Ethena is offering a package designed to appeal to both Hyperliquid validators and its community. Central to its proposal is a pledge to redirect 95% of net USDH reserve revenues back to the ecosystem. The company said this would be done through the purchase and distribution of HYPE tokens, validator rewards, and ecosystem development funding, among other means preferred by the community. Ethena has also promised to shoulder the costs of migrating existing USDC trading pairs to USDH. Security is another pillar of the plan as Ethena proposed introducing a guardian network of Hyperliquid validators, including infrastructure partners like LayerZero, to oversee USDH operations. Part of the goal is to avoid a single point of failure and ensure transparent governance of the new stablecoin. “We want to play a role in supporting this story regardless of whether the community grants us the privilege and responsibility of delivering USDH,” Ethena wrote in its proposal. Ethena wants to offer more than an ordinary USDH stablecoin Ethena’s ambitions go beyond simply issuing USDH. The company laid out plans for hUSDe, a Hyperliquid-native synthetic dollar product that builds on its existing USDe model. To jumpstart adoption, Ethena has earmarked $75 million in incentives, with the potential to expand that figure to $150 million as the ecosystem scales, to support market development under the HIP-3 proposal. The incentive program would fund new markets, front-end integrations, and liquidity initiatives that tie together USDH, USDe, and hUSDe under a single umbrella. The company also said it will integrate with Securitize to enable tokenization of real-world assets and bring USDtb, the BlackRock-backed token, onto HyperEVM. That integration would allow for seamless minting and redemption flows, giving institutional users a clearer path to tap into Hyperliquid’s ecosystem. The field is competitive Since the announcement, Hyperliquid’s native token HYPE has been on the rise. At the time of writing, it sits at $53.55 per token, having risen by over 6% in 24 hours, with a market cap of $14.39 billion according to data from Messari. Ethena’s bid brings it into a crowded field of suitors . Paxos, known for its regulated custodial model, has pitched itself as the most compliant option. Frax has proposed integrating its algorithmic stablecoin model into Hyperliquid, while Sky, Native Markets and Agora, among others have also submitted competing frameworks. Each proposal focuses on a different philosophy on how to balance transparency, scalability, and user adoption. The outcome will be decided by Hyperliquid’s validators, who are expected to vote on September 14. With billions of dollars in potential liquidity at stake, the decision will likely shape the trajectory of Hyperliquid’s growth in the coming years. For Ethena, winning the mandate could cement its position as one of the most influential players in the stablecoin market. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

You’ll tap into an engaged audience of over 10,000 attendees, a powerful mix of industry leaders, emerging talent, and capital allocators, all eager to discover what’s next.

Strategic Connections: Imagine meeting the exact startup leaders, influential investors, and potential partners you’ve been seeking, all within an environment you control.

This tailored setting facilitates deeper conversations, making it easier to cultivate meaningful relationships and drive crucial investor deal flow . It’s about quality over quantity, connecting with the right people at the right time. Unmatched Flexibility: From thought-provoking panels and interactive workshops to casual networking parties and high-stakes pitch-offs, the format is entirely yours to define.

For investors, finding the next unicorn amidst a sea of innovation requires keen insight and direct access. Side Events at Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 bridge this gap with remarkable efficiency. Consider the pitch competitions hosted last year: they offered nascent companies an unparalleled stage to present their visions directly to a room full of active VCs and angel investors, often leading to immediate follow-up meetings and, ultimately, significant funding rounds. These events are designed to accelerate investor deal flow by creating a curated, high-impact environment where connections can quickly evolve into concrete opportunities.

This direct access to top-tier talent within the startup community can be a game-changer for your recruitment efforts.

51468670,577350,1757458827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51468670.jpeg,New Bitcoin Reserve Bill Pressures Treasury On Custody Rules,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-reserve-bill-treasury-custody-rules/,"The US House Appropriations Committee has advanced H.R. 5166 — the Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) spending bill for FY2026 — with language that would formally direct the Treasury Department to spell out how the federal government will custody Bitcoin and other digital assets it acquires, explicitly including holdings earmarked for the newly created Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The bill was reported on September 5, 2025, as House Report 119-236 and placed on the Union Calendar. Congress Demands Public Information On Bitcoin Reserve At the statutory level, Section 138 of the reported bill requires the Treasury, within 90 days of enactment, to deliver a public plan for the “secure and efficient custody” of federal digital assets, “including assets held under the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile.” The plan must delineate custody architecture, legal authorities, cybersecurity controls, and interagency workflows for transfers and safekeeping. Section 137 adds a second mandate: a report on the practicability of establishing the reserve and the related stockpile, addressing potential barriers, the expected impact on the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, how Bitcoin and other digital assets would be presented on the federal balance sheet, and any third-party contractors used for custody. Read together, the two sections would force the Treasury to clarify both whether and how the federal government will maintain long-term Bitcoin holdings — and what that means for government accounting and forfeiture-fund mechanics. The committee report accompanying the bill underlines Congress’s intent to track the flow of seized assets into the program. It directs the Treasury to provide monthly tables of the Forfeiture Fund’s activity, including any “diversions from the Forfeiture Fund to the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and/or the digital asset stockpile.” That same report section labels the custody directive “Custody of Digital Assets,” emphasizing strong safeguards to prevent loss, unauthorized access, or liquidation. The push comes six months after the White House issued Executive Order 14233 , which created both the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile by consolidating government-owned crypto seized in criminal and civil cases. The order states that government BTC placed into the reserve “shall not be sold,” positioning Bitcoin as a strategic asset held for national objectives subject to law. It also instructs Treasury and Commerce to develop ways to acquire additional government BTC on a budget-neutral basis . H.R. 5166 would also bring the national-security community into the loop. Section 139 directs the Treasury Secretary and the Director of the National Security Agency to provide a classified report on inter-agency coordination within 90 days of enactment — a signal that lawmakers see digital-asset custody (and key management) as an operational risk surface as well as a balance-sheet question. The legislative pressure is occurring alongside separate efforts to codify the reserve. In March, Rep. Byron Donalds introduced H.R. 2112 to give the executive order “the force and effect of law,” while other measures, such as H.R. 2032, have proposed building out a decentralized, cold-storage reserve network for government BTC. None of those standalone bills has been enacted, but the appropriations route, if passed, would time-box the Treasury to deliver concrete answers shortly after the spending bill becomes law. What Changes If H.R. 5166 Becomes Law? First, the Treasury would owe the public a detailed custody blueprint, not just internal memoranda or ad-hoc practices developed for asset seizures. Second, Congress would receive an analytical roadmap for how a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and stockpile would interact with forfeiture processes and the federal balance sheet — key inputs for any future decision to scale the program beyond seized assets. Third, the classified NSA-Treasury report would institutionalize security coordination around wallet infrastructure and interagency transfers. Together, those steps would shift the federal government’s handling of Bitcoin from case-by-case liquidation towards a defined reserve posture aligned with the March 6 policy that reserve BTC is not to be sold. However, the measure does not itself appropriate BTC, purchase Bitcoin on the open market, or authorize immediate diversions into the reserve; it sets reporting and planning obligations contingent on enactment of the underlying appropriations bill. The House-reported text must still clear the full House, the Senate, and reconciliation before reaching the President’s desk. Until then, the timelines — “within 90 days of enactment” — are prospective.

After weeks of sideways trading, the SuperTrend indicator has turned bullish for the first time since late August, according to trader Ali (@ali_charts). Related Reading: This Bitcoin Cycle Changes Everything, Real Vision Analyst Explains Why XLM now faces a decisive test at the $0.386 resistance, a level where sellers have repeatedly pushed back in recent weeks. The bullish reversal came as XLM established support at $0.363, creating a stronger floor for accumulation. With volume steadily increasing around this zone, traders are treating the move as more than just a temporary bounce. If momentum holds, XLM could unlock a major upside move that shifts market sentiment. What’s Fueling Stellar’s Momentum? The broader crypto market’s recent stabilization has provided a healthy backdrop for altcoins like Stellar (XLM) to regain traction. Hidden accumulation patterns within key demand zones suggest larger wallets are quietly entering the market, strengthening the bullish case. On the technical front, the MACD has turned positive, while XLM’s RSI remains neutral at 48, leaving room for further gains without hitting overbought territory. Analysts note that a clean break above $0.386 could quickly open the door to higher targets at $0.390 and $0.400, with medium-term forecasts eyeing $0.45–$0.48 by October 2025. Institutional traders are also watching the $0.43 resistance closely. A confirmed breakout above this level could ignite stronger momentum, potentially pushing XLM into a sustained rally toward its 52-week high near $0.50. Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Ahead If Stellar manages to break and hold above $0.386, short-term targets sit at $0.41–$0.42, with a stronger push toward $0.45–$0.48 likely in the next 4–6 weeks. XLM's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: XLMUSD on Tradingview However, failure at resistance could send XLM back to retest support between $0.38 and $0.383, with a deeper drop toward $0.37 possible if sellers regain control. For now, XLM trades at $0.384 with a 3.5% intraday gain, reflecting cautious optimism. Traders are closely monitoring volume expansion and momentum indicators as confirmation signals.

The decision to diversify its AI system represents the company’s desire to maximize output from a range of AI providers, rather than depend on a single partner. Microsoft has begun incorporating technology from Anthropic into its flagship Office 365 applications, according to a report from The Information. For several years, Microsoft has primarily relied on OpenAI’s models for its AI-driven features in applications such as Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint, but developers working on Office AI enhancements found that Anthropic’s latest models outperformed OpenAI in certain tasks. Microsoft has begun incorporating Anthropic’s technology in its products The report specified that Anthropic’s models were said to handle complex financial functions in Excel more effectively and to produce more visually appealing PowerPoint presentations when given text-based instructions. This performance gap prompted Microsoft to begin blending Anthropic’s AI with OpenAI’s technology across Office tools. Microsoft is also currently advancing its own AI research and development while using DeepSeek’s models to bolster its Azure cloud services. According to the report, Microsoft will pay to access Anthropic’s models through Amazon Web Services (AWS) despite its competition with AWS in the cloud market. Microsoft plans to publicly announce its decision in the coming weeks, but the pricing of Office AI tools will remain unchanged for customers, the report added . Microsoft’s new partnerships Microsoft has been OpenAI’s largest backer , investing more than $13B into the San Francisco-based startup. The partnership secured Microsoft an early lead in the AI race with the rollout of generative AI features in Office 365 and the integration of OpenAI’s models into Azure. However, OpenAI is now facing stronger competition and its technology is failing to outperform them. The failure of GPT-5 to outperform Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 has driven Microsoft to acquire more partners for its AI systems. This multi-partner approach will help the company to meet the demand for AI features. AI adoption has spread among businesses as they are increasingly using the technology to streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance productivity tools. Microsoft’s efforts towards the improvement of the functionality and quality of its Office AI suite could help make it a more attractive option than its competitors like Google Workspace, which is also rolling out advanced AI features.

The Russian state-run news agency TASS reported that the comments came from Yevgeny Masharov, a member of the commission of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation for the Public Examination of Draft Laws and Other Regulatory Acts (OPRF). The OPRF is a policy-forming body, which advises the Kremlin and state lawmakers on legislative proposals. Masharov: Russian Crypto Bank Will Boost Transparency The policymaker opined that launching a state-operated crypto bank would help bring crypto into the legal sector and boost federal budget revenues. Masharov said: “A Russian crypto bank would solve several existing problems. It would bring hundreds of billions of rubles worth of [crypto] transactions out of the shadows.” Yevgeny Masharov (left) at a meeting of the commission of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation for the Public Examination of Draft Laws and Other Regulatory Acts (OPRF) earlier this month. (Source: @oprf_official/VK/Screenshot) Lawmakers have previously talked about the idea of launching state-run crypto exchanges . They also want to ban the quasi-legal coin exchanges that currently operate nationwide. Such a move would also help boost federal budget income, with new taxes imposed on crypto trading, he argued. Masharov noted that similar plans were already being put into place in nations like Belarus. TASS wrote that Minsk lawmakers are set to “develop a regulatory framework for the activities of a crypto bank in the near future.” Facebook and Instagram are already banned in Russia.

Earlier this month, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko told cabinet officials to develop more crypto-related industries to ensure Minsk can take a lead in the space. Lukashenko and other top Belarusian officials have been talking about creating a “national crypto bank” for some time. But the matter appears to have returned to the agenda in Minsk since Washington began rolling out crypto-related legislation earlier this year.

The policymaker added that launching a crypto bank would help “strike a blow against online fraud.” Moscow has been fighting a rise in what the financial sector calls “droppers.” This term refers to cash, card, and crypto mules that fraudsters, online casinos, and drug dealers use to launder money. Masharov said that the funds droppers collect are usually transferred to crypto wallets and then “legalized,” allowing criminals to spend them money on real estate and luxury goods. But restricting Russian crypto transactions to the confines of the bank, Moscow would be able to fight back against this form of fraud, the policymaker said. Bitcoin miners could also stand to benefit, he said. He added: “We still have no infrastructure that lets miners sell their coins in Russia.” And Masharov said that the new bank could also help Russian firms conduct safer cross-border business.

Here's what to know. https://t.co/KnhrPm9jhY — Bloomberg (@business) September 9, 2025 Russia remains disconnected from the SWIFT bank messaging network and heavily sanctioned by Washington, Brussels, and London. As such, many trade firms now use crypto in place of the US dollar in international trade payments. But most of these deals are conducted “outside the legal field,” Masharov said. This gives “fraudsters and Western intelligence agencies” the opportunity to “exploit gaps in legislation,” he concluded. In July this year, Masharov said Russian authorities should be have the power to seize tokens from illegal or quasi-legal Bitcoin miners . Bailiffs should be given the power to transfer these coins to Treasury-controlled crypto wallets , he urged.

Over the past week, the asset has advanced by 7.16%, reaching $3.01 after recovering from an early September price dip to $2.70. While Ethereum and some other altcoins have not joined this rebound, XRP has managed to sustain its upward momentum, drawing attention from analysts who are now outlining key resistance levels that could define the next phase of its performance. The Levels That Matter Most Market strategist EGRAG Crypto has identified the price thresholds XRP must overcome before bullish momentum can firmly return. In his assessment, the $2.94 region marks the first significant test. A daily close above this point is considered the initial confirmation of renewed strength. #XRP – Finishing or Continuation of the Throwback? : If #XRP can close above $2.94 with conviction, and push past the 33 SMA around $3.01, we’ll start to see early signs that the bulls are in control, potentially finishing the throwback. The low from September 1st could… pic.twitter.com/nUtQj2sDEj — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 8, 2025 XRP already achieved this requirement on September 8, closing at $2.9694, its highest closing value so far this month and the strongest finish since late August. However, one condition remains unmet, surpassing the 33-day simple moving average (SMA). This moving average, which stood at $2.9962 at the time, blocked XRP from breaking through the $3 threshold. As of now, the 33-day SMA has adjusted slightly to $2.9853, while XRP trades around $2.9616. According to EGRAG, closing above this SMA would not only confirm resilience but also signal the completion of what he termed a “throwback”, a corrective phase that pulled prices down to $2.70 earlier this month. If this plays out as expected, that price level could end up being the recent low. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Beyond the 33-Day SMA EGRAG also highlighted further milestones that would strengthen the bullish case. After reclaiming the 33-day SMA, XRP would need to rise above the 55-day SMA, which currently sits at $3.066. Crossing this threshold would provide additional evidence that buyers are regaining dominance. The analyst then identified $3.40 as the critical resistance level that could fully shift momentum in favor of the bulls. He labeled this range as the decisive confirmation zone, noting that it coincides with XRP’s January 2025 peak before the token entered a prolonged consolidation phase. A move above $3.40, according to his projection, could set the stage for a rally toward $4.20. Diverging Views and Risks While EGRAG emphasized caution, warning that weakness between $2.94 and $3 could lead to a continuation of the correction, other analysts are more optimistic. Market commentator Gordon argued that XRP’s extended consolidation provides a strong base for a significant breakout. He projected that, once momentum builds, the token could advance toward $6. Overall, XRP’s ability to close decisively above $2.94 and break through the 33-day and 55-day SMAs will be crucial in determining whether the market can transition out of correction territory. The coming days will reveal whether the asset can secure these levels and confirm a broader bullish reversal.

The window of opportunity for Ruvi AI (RUVI) at its current $0.020 price point is closing at an unprecedented rate, as its presale token became a top-trending asset after Phase 2 sold out in record time. For investors who have been waiting for the right moment, this might be one of the last chances to get in on the ground floor of a project with the potential for life-changing returns. The demand for Ruvi AI has been nothing short of explosive. The presale is on the verge of crossing the $3.6 million mark, with over 265 million tokens already sold to a rapidly growing and passionate community of more than 3,500 investors . The speed at which Phase 2 finished has sent a clear message to the market: Ruvi AI is one of the most sought-after projects of this cycle, and the opportunity to buy in at these low prices is disappearing fast. Credibility and Utility: The Foundation for Explosive Growth What makes Ruvi AI such a compelling opportunity is its powerful combination of real-world utility and rock-solid credibility. The project’s commitment to security and transparency is demonstrated by its successful completion of a comprehensive smart contract audit with CyberScope , a reputable third-party security firm. This crucial validation, along with a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , has cemented Ruvi AI’s status as a legitimate, high-growth AI project that is attracting serious attention from major players. A Revolutionary Super App for a $104 Billion Industry The engine driving this incredible demand is Ruvi AI’s revolutionary super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is designed to empower content creators in the booming $104 billion creator economy . By providing a suite of AI-powered tools that solve critical industry challenges, Ruvi AI is creating a foundation for mass adoption and sustainable, long-term demand for its token. Key features of the super app include: Advanced Trend Research: Helps creators identify viral topics before they become saturated, providing a significant competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram in minutes. Native Media Creation: Allows users to generate professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, reducing production costs. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire content creation process, from planning to scheduling, to maximize productivity. Last Call: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge Is Imminent The presale has now entered Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at a highly attractive $0.020 . However, given the speed at which Phase 2 sold out, this opportunity is extremely limited. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO, driving record sales as savvy investors race to lock in an immediate paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s path to a multi-million-dollar valuation for its early investors is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience upon launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broader market adoption. For investors aiming to maximize their returns, the project’s VIP program offers a clear and compelling path to significant wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. Don’t Let This Opportunity Slip Away As the presale accelerates and a 40% price surge looms, it’s clear that the chance to buy Ruvi AI at $0.020 is a rare one.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $853.93. In 2031, AAVE will range between $1,280.9 to $1,387.64. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain .

Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $297.85 Market cap $4.53B Trading volume (24-h) $467.36M Circulating supply 15.22M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $309.84 24-hour high $295.32 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.07% 50-day SMA $300.57 14-Day RSI 47.66 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 48 (Neutral) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $242.56 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE has repeatedly faced rejection at $310. Support zone rests at $295–$283. Despite the volume uptick, signals still lean bearish. Aave 1-day price chart On the 1-day chart for September 9, AAVE closed at $297 after slipping below $300 again, leaving a weak red candle that sits right on mid-range support. The Bollinger midline at $317 has repeatedly capped recovery attempts, while the lower band at $283 now acts as soft support. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView RSI sits neutral near 50 but without direction, and MACD remains in bearish territory, suggesting momentum is still tilted down. Unless buyers can reclaim $317, the structure risks leaning back toward $283, where a stronger test of demand would occur. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour price chart, AAVE failed to hold above $310 and quickly punched lower, now consolidating around $294–$300. The Alligator lines are stacked bearishly, with short-term averages pressing from above near $302–$304. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has picked up slightly, but not enough to show conviction from either side. Immediate support rests at $295 and $290, while $303–$305 is the near-term lid that needs reclaiming for bulls to regain any traction. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $309.77 SELL SMA 5 $306.68 SELL SMA 10 $318.68 SELL SMA 21 $317.09 SELL SMA 50 $300.57 SELL SMA 100 $288.94 BUY SMA 200 $242.56 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 312.29 SELL EMA 5 $ 314.91 SELL EMA 10 $ 316.94 SELL EMA 21 $ 312.91 SELL EMA 50 $ 301.25 SELL EMA 100 $ 283.12 BUY EMA 200 $ 258.47 BUY AAVE price analysis conclusion Unless AAVE can firmly clear $310, price action will likely drift sideways with a slight downward bias. The $295–$283 zone is where buyers need to step in, while only a decisive break above $317 would start to tilt momentum back in favor of the bulls. Is AAVE a good investment?

A recent analysis from community figure Pumpius explored how XRP could, under certain conditions, rise to a three-digit price. Two Drivers Behind the Projection Pumpius argued that XRP’s growth will depend on practical use rather than speculation. In his view, the token’s value comes from its role as a bridge for liquidity, enabling the transfer of funds across markets and borders. He identified two scenarios that could substantially lift XRP’s price: Ripple obtaining a U.S. national trust banking license, and multinational corporations deploying the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for treasury and supply chain operations. HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED? What’s the true price potential of XRP if adoption goes all the way? From banks to central banks, from corporations to capital markets and beyond into genomic identity. Here’s the ladder pic.twitter.com/TDWECRNRtB — Pumpius (@pumpius) September 6, 2025 Banking License as a Catalyst Ripple applied to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in July 2025 to establish Ripple National Trust Bank. If approved, the institution would be allowed to provide custody services, manage stablecoins, and operate with tokenized assets under federal oversight. A decision is expected in October. Pumpius estimated that approval could result in annual settlement flows of roughly $500 billion through Ripple’s network, potentially supporting XRP’s climb to around $50 . While the filing does not explicitly reference XRP, Ripple’s existing products and ecosystem suggest indirect benefits. Ripple has prepared for this step by acquiring Standard Custody & Trust, securing partnerships with firms such as BNY Mellon for safeguarding reserves of its RLUSD stablecoin, and expanding into tokenization initiatives. Ripple’s RLUSD, launched in late 2024, has achieved a market capitalization of over $730 million, showcasing Ripple’s increasing presence in regulated financial sectors. Critics, however, remain cautious. Groups such as the Independent Community Bankers of America have raised concerns that federally chartered crypto banks could bypass certain consumer protection safeguards. Ripple is seeking a Federal Reserve master account to enable direct management of reserves associated with its RLUSD stablecoin. This move could enable Ripple to tap into major payment systems and bolster its initiatives in regulated digital financial services We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Enterprise Adoption as the Next Step In addition to regulatory progress, Pumpius suggested that large corporations moving treasury or supply chain functions to XRPL could unlock further value. He projected that if companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, or Tesla shifted even a portion of their operations, XRP could help facilitate up to $5 trillion in annual flows. Under this scenario, he argued that XRP could reach as high as $100. No major multinational has announced such a move, but Ripple already maintains relationships with more than 300 financial institutions. Many of these partners use XRP for cross-border settlement through its On-Demand Liquidity service . Smaller firms, including VivoPower and Trident Digital , have also adopted XRP for treasury or payment purposes, offering early examples of corporate integration at a smaller scale. Regulatory Clarity Could Encourage Growth The legal environment for XRP has improved following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2023 ruling that secondary market sales of the token are not considered securities transactions. Supporters argue this clarity may encourage additional institutional interest, although widespread corporate adoption remains speculative. While XRP remains far from the triple-digit levels suggested by Pumpius, his analysis reflects optimism within parts of the community about Ripple’s regulatory and enterprise prospects. Achieving a federal trust banking license coupled with substantial corporate adoption could mark a pivotal advancement for Ripple and the XRP ecosystem.

51471504,577373,1757462452,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51471504.jpeg,Here’s Why Crypto Analysts Are Predicting Dogecoin Price To Explode This Week,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-to-explode/,"The Dogecoin price is expected to stage a breakout in the days ahead, with crypto analysts highlighting key catalysts that could drive this rally. Despite weeks of sideways movement and steady dumping by whales , attention is now shifting to emerging technical indicators and a potential Dogecoin ETF as possible triggers for a price explosion this week. ETF Buzz Signal Dogecoin Price Surge This Week According to a TradingView analyst identified as ‘CryptoJobs,’ the possibility of Dogecoin’s first-ever ETF launching in the United States as early as next week could trigger an explosive price surge. This development would mark a major milestone for the popular meme coin, granting it unprecedented visibility and legitimacy within the broader financial system. Historically, ETF approvals have fueled rallies across the crypto market, with Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing notable spikes after similar announcements. Beyond the ETF hype, CryptoJobs highlights a key technical setup that further paints a bullish picture for the Dogecoin price trajectory. They note that Dogecoin is forming a classic Falling Wedge pattern on its 4-hour chart. Based on past trends, this pattern is considered a bullish reversal setup, often signaling that a breakout to the upside is near. The chart also illustrates that Dogecoin is moving within a solid medium-term accumulation phase , consolidating around key levels. These key price levels align with a long-term support range, which CryptoJobs identifies between $0.205 and $0.207. As price consolidates within the Falling Wedge, the analyst predicts that an explosive move of at least 15% could unfold as early as next week, potentially fueled by News of a Dogecoin ETF. The chart points to a potential upward rally toward $0.26 if DOGE sustains its bullish momentum . Further upside targets are projected near $0.277 and $0.28, while key support levels rest in the $0.21 to $0.19 range. Analyst Identifies Two Short-term Targets For DOGE Another well-followed TradingView analyst, Klejdi Cuni, has shared his perspective, pointing to two clear targets for Dogecoin’s next upward leg. Cuni highlights the strong support area around $0.207, which has repeatedly acted as a springboard for price rebounds over the past month. Each time DOGE has tested this level, it has bounced back with strong bullish momentum, reinforcing confidence in the area as a base for higher prices. In his latest chart analysis, the market expert outlines the potential for a minor pullback into the $0.213 – $0.216 range before momentum resumes. From there, his key upside targets are $0.23 and $0.24. These levels represent previous zones where price faced resistance, making them realistic short-term goals for traders watching the market closely. Cuni’s optimistic projection is further supported by a small bullish continuation pattern that has formed on the Dogecoin price chart.",Dogecoin|bitcoin|CryptoJobs|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|Dogecoin spot etf|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Ethereum|Falling Wedge Pattern|Klejdi Cuni,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|DOGE|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-10 00:00:52

PredictIt, a well-known platform, has officially received approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to launch an exchange. This crucial development marks a monumental step, transforming a popular betting site into a regulated financial entity. The details surrounding the specific type of exchange are still emerging, but the implications for the future of forecasting and regulated markets are profound. The PredictIt exchange launch represents a new chapter for the industry. What Does the PredictIt Exchange Launch Mean for Prediction Markets? For years, PredictIt has operated as a unique platform where individuals could place small-stakes bets on the outcomes of political events, economic indicators, and other real-world occurrences. Its primary goal was to provide data for academic research, operating under a “no-action” letter from the CFTC. This new approval, however, elevates its status considerably. The CFTC is the federal agency responsible for regulating the U.S. futures and options markets. Their explicit approval for the PredictIt exchange launch means the platform will now operate under a more formal regulatory framework. This transition is expected to bring increased transparency, enhanced user protection, and potentially broader institutional interest in prediction markets. This move is not merely a change in operational status; it signifies a maturation of the prediction market concept. It indicates that regulators are beginning to see the potential for these markets beyond simple entertainment, recognizing their utility as tools for forecasting and risk assessment. It’s a clear signal that the regulatory environment for such platforms is evolving. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: Why is CFTC Approval Crucial? Operating a prediction market in the U.S. has historically been fraught with regulatory ambiguities. Many platforms have faced legal challenges or been forced to operate offshore due to the complex nature of classifying these markets. Are they gambling? Are they derivatives? The CFTC’s decision provides much-needed clarity. The CFTC’s approval for the PredictIt exchange launch is crucial for several reasons: Legitimacy: It bestows official regulatory recognition, removing the “grey area” status. Investor Protection: Users can expect stronger safeguards against fraud, manipulation, and unfair practices. Market Integrity: The CFTC’s oversight helps ensure fair and orderly markets, building trust among participants. Precedent Setting: This could pave the way for other similar platforms to seek regulatory approval, fostering innovation within a controlled environment. This regulatory clarity is a significant benefit, not just for PredictIt, but for the entire prediction market ecosystem, offering a template for future developments. The Potential of PredictIt’s Exchange Launch: Opportunities Ahead With CFTC approval, PredictIt is poised to unlock a range of new opportunities. While the specific details of the exchange’s operation are yet to be fully disclosed, the shift to a regulated model could bring substantial advantages. Benefits for participants could include: Increased confidence in the platform’s stability and fairness. Potentially higher trading volumes and deeper liquidity, leading to more accurate prices. A broader array of market offerings, as regulatory clarity allows for expansion. Greater acceptance from financial institutions and data analysts who might have previously shied away from unregulated markets. Actionable Insight: For current PredictIt users, it is vital to review any updated terms of service and operational guidelines that will accompany the new exchange launch. Understanding these changes will be key to continued participation. What Challenges Lie Ahead for PredictIt’s New Exchange? While the CFTC approval is a major victory, the path forward for the PredictIt exchange launch will not be without its challenges. Transitioning from a research-focused platform to a fully regulated exchange comes with new responsibilities and potential hurdles. Some of the challenges PredictIt might face include: Operational Compliance: Meeting the ongoing, stringent reporting and compliance requirements of the CFTC. User Adaptation: Educating existing users about the new regulatory framework and any changes to their trading experience. Competition: Navigating a competitive landscape that includes both traditional betting sites and other emerging prediction platforms. Public Perception: Shifting the narrative from a “political betting site” to a legitimate, regulated financial exchange will require strategic communication. Successfully addressing these challenges will be crucial for PredictIt to fully capitalize on its newfound regulatory status and establish itself as a leading player in the regulated prediction market space. A New Era for Prediction Markets The announcement of CFTC approval for the PredictIt exchange launch is truly a landmark event. It signals a significant maturation of prediction markets, moving them from the periphery into a more mainstream, regulated financial environment. This development holds immense promise for increasing transparency, enhancing user protection, and fostering innovation in how we forecast and understand future events. As PredictIt embarks on this new chapter, the industry will be watching closely to see how this crucial approval reshapes the future of prediction and political betting. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is PredictIt? A1: PredictIt is an online platform that allows users to bet on the outcomes of future events, primarily political and economic, operating as a prediction market. It was initially designed for academic research purposes. Q2: What does CFTC approval mean for PredictIt? A2: CFTC approval means PredictIt has received official regulatory recognition from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to operate an exchange. This transition brings enhanced oversight, increased transparency, and stronger user protections, moving it from a “no-action” letter status to a formally regulated entity. Q3: How will this affect current PredictIt users? A3: While specific operational changes are yet to be fully detailed, users can expect a more regulated and secure trading environment. It is crucial for users to review any updated terms of service and platform guidelines that will be released as the new exchange launches. Q4: Will PredictIt now offer new types of markets? A4: The CFTC approval could potentially allow PredictIt to expand its market offerings, given the newfound regulatory clarity. However, any new markets would still need to comply with CFTC regulations and guidelines, which may influence the types of events available for prediction. Q5: Does this set a precedent for other prediction markets? A5: Yes, the CFTC’s decision for the PredictIt exchange launch is likely to set an important precedent. It provides a potential roadmap for other prediction market platforms seeking to operate legally and under regulation within the United States.

Social media marketing firm Asset Entities (ASST) has made a groundbreaking move, approving a merger with U.S. asset manager Strive. This isn’t just any corporate deal; it’s a strategic maneuver designed to facilitate a substantial Asset Entities Bitcoin buy , signaling a strong institutional embrace of digital assets and a bold step into the future of finance. What’s Behind the Asset Entities Bitcoin Buy Strategy? This pivotal approval, as reported by The Block, comes after Strive CEO Matt Cole’s previously stated plan. His vision was clear: conduct a reverse merger with Asset Entities to gain a coveted Nasdaq listing. This strategic move provides Strive with the public market access necessary to execute its ambitious financial goals. Once listed, the combined entity aims to acquire over $700 million in Bitcoin. This demonstrates a clear, forward-thinking strategy to integrate a significant digital asset into a traditional financial framework. The merger allows Strive to tap into public capital markets, which are crucial for funding such a large-scale acquisition. Following the merger, the new, combined company will operate under the name Strive. However, it will maintain continuity for investors by continuing to trade publicly under the familiar ticker symbol ASST. This ensures a smooth transition while leveraging the established market presence of Asset Entities. The Tremendous Impact of a $700 Million BTC Acquisition A $700 million Bitcoin buy by a newly formed entity like Strive carries considerable weight in the crypto market. It signifies a growing trend of institutional players recognizing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a core, long-term component of a diversified portfolio. This isn’t a small fund; it’s a major commitment. Consider these key implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem: Increased Market Confidence: Such large-scale purchases can significantly bolster overall market confidence, potentially attracting other institutional investors who might be on the fence. It acts as a strong signal of legitimacy. Demand Surge and Price Dynamics: A significant buy order of this magnitude can influence Bitcoin’s price dynamics by absorbing available supply, especially if executed over a concentrated period. This adds consistent buying pressure. Validation of Bitcoin’s Role: It further validates Bitcoin’s role as a digital gold, a store of value, and a potential hedge against traditional market inflation in the eyes of traditional finance. This narrative gains strength with each institutional adoption.

A public listing provides several advantages: Enhanced Capital Access: Public companies have greater access to capital markets, allowing them to raise funds more easily for significant investments like a $700 million Bitcoin purchase. Increased Transparency and Credibility: Operating as a publicly traded company on a major exchange like Nasdaq typically entails higher levels of regulatory scrutiny and reporting. This can enhance investor trust and provide greater transparency regarding the firm’s operations and asset holdings. Liquidity for Investors: A Nasdaq listing offers liquidity for shareholders, making it easier for them to buy and sell shares, which can attract a broader investor base. This strategic maneuver by Asset Entities and Strive highlights a sophisticated understanding of how to leverage traditional financial structures to participate in the burgeoning digital asset economy. What Does This Mean for Future Institutional Bitcoin Buys? The proactive approach taken by Asset Entities and Strive could be a blueprint for other companies looking to make substantial moves into the crypto space. It’s an actionable insight for investors to closely observe how traditional companies are adapting to and integrating digital assets. Challenges might include navigating regulatory landscapes that are still evolving, managing market volatility, and ensuring robust security for such significant Bitcoin holdings. However, the potential benefits, including diversification and exposure to a high-growth asset class, clearly outweigh these risks for Strive. This merger is not just a transaction; it’s a statement. It signals a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class within established financial circles. The groundbreaking merger between Asset Entities and Strive, culminating in plans for a colossal $700 million Asset Entities Bitcoin buy , marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrency. This strategic alliance underscores Bitcoin’s increasing appeal to institutional investors and sets a powerful example for future corporate adoption.

Imagine participating in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) meeting with members from across the globe, or attending an international blockchain conference, and understanding every word spoken, instantly. This is precisely the kind of transformative experience the new AirPods Pro 3 aim to deliver, making real-time communication more accessible and intuitive than ever before. For crypto enthusiasts and global citizens alike, this innovation promises to bridge divides and foster a more connected world. Experience the Future: How AirPods Pro 3 Revolutionize Live Translation Apple’s latest iteration of its popular wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro 3 , introduces a groundbreaking live translation feature that promises to change how we interact across linguistic divides. This isn’t just about translating text; it’s about delivering spoken language directly into your ears, in real-time. The core of this functionality lies in its seamless integration and intuitive control, allowing users to prompt translations through simple, natural gestures. This hands-free approach ensures that conversations remain fluid and engaging, without the need to constantly look at a screen or pass a device back and forth. The experience is designed to be as natural as possible. When you’re speaking with someone in a different language, you can activate the translation feature with a quick gesture, such as a squeeze on the AirPod stem. The device then intelligently processes the incoming speech, translates it, and delivers it to your ear. Simultaneously, your spoken words are translated for the other person, creating a two-way communication flow that feels remarkably organic. This advancement is particularly significant for the crypto community, where international partnerships and cross-border discussions are daily occurrences, often involving participants from diverse linguistic backgrounds. The Brain Behind the Breakthrough: Apple Intelligence Powers Real-Time Translation At the heart of this remarkable capability is Apple Intelligence , Apple’s advanced artificial intelligence framework. This sophisticated AI engine is responsible for the complex processing required to perform accurate and low-latency real-time translation . It goes beyond simple word-for-word substitution, leveraging deep learning models to understand context, nuances, and idiomatic expressions, thereby providing translations that are not only accurate but also natural-sounding. Apple Intelligence processes vast amounts of linguistic data, continuously learning and improving its translation capabilities. Here’s how Apple Intelligence contributes to the superior translation experience: Contextual Understanding: The AI analyzes the entire sentence and conversation flow to ensure translations are contextually appropriate, reducing misinterpretations. Accent and Dialect Recognition: It is trained on a wide variety of accents and dialects, enhancing its ability to accurately transcribe and translate diverse speech patterns. Low Latency Processing: Optimized algorithms minimize the delay between spoken word and translated output, making conversations feel more immediate. Privacy-Focused Design: Much of the processing for translation can occur on-device, enhancing user privacy by reducing reliance on cloud-based data transfers for sensitive conversations. For those in the crypto space, where precise communication about technical specifications, financial transactions, and regulatory frameworks is crucial, the reliability and accuracy offered by Apple Intelligence are invaluable. It ensures that critical details are not lost in translation, fostering trust and clarity in global interactions. Silencing the World for Clearer Communication: The Role of Noise Cancellation One of the most critical elements contributing to the efficacy of the AirPods Pro 3 ‘s live translation feature is its industry-leading noise cancellation . In any real-world scenario, background noise—whether it’s the hum of a coffee shop, the chatter of a busy market, or the general ambient sounds of a conference hall—can severely impede the clarity and accuracy of voice recognition and, consequently, translation. Apple has ingeniously leveraged its advanced noise cancellation technology to address this challenge head-on. Here’s how noise cancellation enhances the translation experience: Isolating the Speaker’s Voice: The AirPods Pro 3 actively reduce the volume of ambient noise, allowing the microphone to capture the speaker’s voice with exceptional clarity. This ensures that the audio input for translation is clean and free from interference. Elevating the Translated Output: For the user receiving the translation, noise cancellation mutes or significantly lowers external distractions, making the translated voice clear and prominent in their ear. This ensures that the user can focus solely on the translated message without competing sounds. Adaptive Audio: The system dynamically adjusts noise cancellation levels based on the environment, providing an optimal balance between immersion and situational awareness, while always prioritizing the clarity of the translated speech. Imagine negotiating a deal for a new decentralized finance (DeFi) project in a bustling international city. The ability of the AirPods Pro 3 to cut through the noise and deliver precise translations can be the difference between a successful partnership and a missed opportunity. This focus on clear audio input and output is what truly elevates the live translation feature from a mere novelty to a powerful communication tool. Benefits and Real-World Applications: Who Stands to Gain? The introduction of such advanced real-time translation capabilities in the AirPods Pro 3 offers a plethora of benefits across various sectors, particularly for a globally connected community like cryptocurrency users: Breaking Down Global Barriers for Crypto Enthusiasts International Conferences and Meetups: Attending events like EthDenver, Consensus, or Token2049, where speakers and attendees come from dozens of countries, becomes far more inclusive and productive. DAO Governance and Collaboration: Facilitating seamless communication among diverse members of decentralized autonomous organizations, ensuring every voice is heard and understood, regardless of native language. Cross-Border Business and Trading: Engaging with international partners, clients, or exchanges becomes straightforward, eliminating the need for human interpreters or cumbersome translation apps. Educational Content: Accessing foreign-language webinars, podcasts, or lectures on blockchain technology and crypto trends without a language impediment. Beyond Crypto: Broader Impact Travel and Tourism: Navigating foreign countries, interacting with locals, ordering food, or asking for directions becomes stress-free. International Business: Streamlining meetings, negotiations, and collaborations with global teams, improving efficiency and reducing miscommunication. Healthcare and Emergency Services: Bridging communication gaps between patients and medical professionals in critical situations. Education: Enabling students and educators to connect and learn across linguistic boundaries.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a vital tool for many investors, offering a snapshot of current market sentiment. Recently, this crucial indicator rose one point to 49, firmly placing it in the neutral zone. This subtle shift provides valuable insights into how participants are feeling about their crypto holdings. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and How Does it Work? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is designed to gauge the overall emotional state of the crypto market. It helps investors understand whether the market is leaning towards extreme fear or extreme greed. When the index approaches 0, it signals extreme fear, often indicating potential buying opportunities. Conversely, an index near 100 suggests extreme greed, which can sometimes precede a market correction. But how exactly is this fascinating metric calculated? It’s not just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key market factors. Each factor contributes to the overall score, providing a comprehensive view of sentiment: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them to average values over 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often signals fear. Market Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a positive market typically indicate greedy behavior, while low volumes can suggest fear or indecision. Social Media Mentions (15%): The volume and sentiment of cryptocurrency-related hashtags on social media platforms are analyzed. A surge in positive mentions can signal greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, these polls directly ask crypto investors about their market outlook, providing a direct sentiment reading. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market dominance can indicate fear, as investors might be shifting away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Search Trends (10%): Analyzing search queries related to cryptocurrencies helps identify retail investor interest. A spike in searches for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ might suggest fear. Why is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 49 Significant? The current reading of 49 places the Crypto Fear & Greed Index squarely in the neutral territory. This position is quite interesting because it suggests a balanced market, where neither extreme panic nor irrational exuberance is dominating. Unlike the volatile swings between ‘extreme fear’ and ‘extreme greed’ that often characterize crypto, a neutral stance can offer a period of consolidation and thoughtful consideration for investors. A neutral reading implies that market participants are not making decisions based purely on emotion. Instead, there might be a more rational assessment of market conditions, fundamental values, and technical indicators. This can be a healthier environment for sustained growth, as opposed to speculative bubbles or panic-driven sell-offs. For investors, this neutral zone can represent an opportunity to re-evaluate strategies without the pressure of extreme market sentiment. It’s a moment to observe, plan, and potentially make calculated moves rather than reactive ones. Understanding this balanced state is crucial for long-term success in the dynamic crypto landscape. How Can You Leverage the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Better Decisions? While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful indicator, it’s essential to use it as part of a broader investment strategy, not as a standalone signal. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Investing: Many successful investors use the index as a contrarian indicator. They consider buying when the index signals ‘extreme fear’ and selling or taking profits when it signals ‘extreme greed’. Risk Management: A high ‘greed’ score might prompt you to review your portfolio’s risk exposure, perhaps reducing positions in highly speculative assets. Conversely, ‘fear’ could be a time to consider dollar-cost averaging into promising projects. Market Confirmation: Use the index to confirm your own analysis. If your research suggests a bullish trend but the index shows extreme fear, it might indicate an undervalued opportunity. If your research points to a top and the index shows extreme greed, it reinforces your caution. Avoid Emotional Trading: The primary benefit of the index is to help investors detach from their own emotions. By providing an objective measure of market sentiment, it encourages more disciplined decision-making. However, remember that the crypto market is complex. The index is one piece of the puzzle. Always combine its insights with thorough fundamental and technical analysis, and consider your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Conclusion: Navigating the Neutral Zone with Confidence The Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 49 in the neutral zone offers a fascinating glimpse into the current state of the cryptocurrency market. It suggests a period where emotions are not running rampant, allowing for more rational and strategic decision-making. By understanding how this index is calculated and what its readings imply, investors can gain a significant edge in navigating the often-turbulent waters of crypto. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to the space, using tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can empower you to make more informed choices, reduce emotional trading, and ultimately, build a more resilient investment portfolio. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and always approach the market with a well-thought-out plan. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a ‘neutral’ reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A ‘neutral’ reading, like 49, indicates that the market is not dominated by extreme fear or extreme greed. Investors are likely making more rational decisions, and the market may be in a period of consolidation or balanced sentiment. Q2: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index only based on Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s market dominance is one factor, the index considers broader market data, including volatility, trading volume, social media, and Google trends across the cryptocurrency ecosystem, not just Bitcoin specifically. Q3: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to predict market tops and bottoms? Many investors use the index as a contrarian indicator, viewing ‘extreme fear’ as a potential buying opportunity and ‘extreme greed’ as a potential selling opportunity. However, it should be used in conjunction with other analytical tools, not as a sole predictor. Q4: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh perspective on market sentiment for the current day. Q5: What are the main factors that influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index is calculated based on volatility, trading volume, social media mentions, surveys, Bitcoin’s market dominance, and Google search trends, each weighted differently. Q6: Does the index consider news events? Indirectly, yes. Major news events can influence volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, and Google search trends, which are all components of the index’s calculation.

The finding raises intrigue within the crypto community, as questions swirl over whether the funds are lost, frozen, or simply being held in reserve. Why The Coins Remain Untouched In an X post, Elite KOL Crypto Patel, who is also associated with CoinMarketCap and Binance, has highlighted that Germany’s Bitcoin crackdown has encountered a major roadblock. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham has revealed a massive trove of untouched BTC connected to the now-defunct Movie2K piracy site, suggesting that German authorities’ seizure efforts may have hit a wall. Related Reading: El Salvador’s Bitcoin Journey Hits 4-Year Mark, Results Still Divisive According to the report, approximately 45,000 BTC, valued at around $5 billion, has been sitting dormant across over 100 wallets since 2019. These coins are believed to still be under the control of the site’s original operators. Earlier in 2024, German authorities successfully seized nearly 50,000 BTC, which were later liquidated for about $2.9 billion. However, despite that high-profile move, this new revelation highlights that a significant portion of the Movie2K fortune is still out of reach. Bitcoin continues to gain notable mainstream adoption among prominent figures, institutions, and countries. Crypto expert Hashley Giles explained that Bitcoin is an ideal balance sheet asset for a wide range of profitable businesses of all sizes and across all industries. In the United Kingdom, opening an e-money account is a straightforward way for companies to gain BTC exposure without straining existing banking relationships. Accounting is also simple when businesses focus on accumulating rather than trading, removing the complexity of constant mark-to-market volatility. Beyond ease of integration, Bitcoin offers unmatched liquidity. Companies can instantly convert BTC into pounds within seconds whenever business performance requires it, and even on weekends when banks are closed. Compared to the ultra-low interest rates on business bank deposit savings in the UK, those with slightly better yields often require 90-day or longer notice periods before funds can be accessed. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no notice period, making it both flexible and efficient. Maintaining Bitcoin’s Security While Unlocking Liquidity Bitcoin has long been the most trusted digital asset. However, to fulfill its potential and truly power real economies, it requires a stable unit of account. BSquaredNetwork emphasized that the missing piece is U2, a BTC-backed, USD-pegged stablecoin designed to preserve Bitcoin’s security while unlocking global liquidity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Purchases Down Amid Record Holdings – What Does This Mean? BSquaredNetwork’s vision extends beyond simple payments. With U2 as a stable unit of account, BTC can transform into the settlement engine for payment, decentralized finance (DeFi), and even AI-to-AI microtransactions.

An address linked to the prominent Chinese investment firm, Longling Capital, executed a substantial Longling Capital Binance Deposit , moving millions in various digital assets to the leading exchange. This move, totaling approximately $14.7 million, has naturally sparked considerable discussion about its potential implications for the market and the firm’s strategic outlook. What Exactly Was the Longling Capital Binance Deposit? Roughly three hours ago, according to on-chain analytics from Onchain Lens, an address associated with Longling Capital made a notable transfer to Binance. The assets involved were: 4.065 million WLD , valued at approximately $7.42 million. 1,000 ETH (Ethereum), worth around $4.31 million. 3 million USDT (Tether), maintaining its $3 million value. These combined transfers highlight a strategic repositioning or profit-taking maneuver by the investment firm. Such large-scale movements by institutional players often provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. Unpacking the Profit: A Successful Trading Strategy? The analysis from Onchain Lens suggests that this particular Longling Capital Binance Deposit resulted in a realized profit of approximately $3.84 million. This substantial gain underscores the firm’s adeptness in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency markets. For many, this figure represents more than just a number; it reflects successful asset accumulation and well-timed execution. Realized profits like these are a testament to strategic investment decisions, potentially involving long-term holdings or astute short-term trading. It’s a crucial aspect for understanding how large entities manage their digital asset portfolios. What Does This Longling Capital Binance Deposit Mean for WLD, ETH, and USDT? When an entity like Longling Capital moves such a large volume of assets, it inevitably raises questions about the future performance of those specific cryptocurrencies. While a deposit to an exchange doesn’t automatically mean an immediate sell-off, it often precedes increased liquidity or potential trading activity. WLD (Worldcoin): The largest portion of the deposit, 4.065 million WLD, could introduce significant selling pressure if the firm decides to offload these tokens. This might influence WLD’s short-term price dynamics. ETH (Ethereum): A deposit of 1,000 ETH, while substantial, represents a smaller fraction of Ethereum’s vast market capitalization compared to WLD. Its impact might be less pronounced but still warrants observation. USDT (Tether): As a stablecoin, USDT’s deposit typically signifies a move into a more liquid, less volatile asset, often used to facilitate further trading or simply to hold value after taking profits from other cryptocurrencies. How Do Institutional Moves Like This Influence the Broader Market? Institutional activities, such as this significant Longling Capital Binance Deposit , play a vital role in shaping market sentiment. When large investment firms make such moves, retail investors often pay close attention, seeking cues for their own strategies. These actions can be interpreted in several ways: Profit-Taking: The most straightforward interpretation is that Longling Capital is locking in profits from its holdings, especially given the reported $3.84 million gain. Strategic Rebalancing: The firm might be rebalancing its portfolio, moving out of certain assets to prepare for new investments or to reduce exposure to specific risks. Increased Liquidity: Deposits to exchanges enhance the available supply for trading, which can impact market depth and price stability. Understanding these potential motivations is key to interpreting the broader market implications of such large-scale transfers. Concluding Thoughts on Longling Capital’s Latest Move The recent Longling Capital Binance Deposit serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights the strategic maneuvers of institutional players and their capacity to realize substantial profits from their digital asset investments. While the immediate impact on WLD, ETH, and USDT prices remains to be fully seen, this event provides a clear snapshot of ongoing institutional activity and its potential to influence market sentiment and liquidity. Keeping an eye on these on-chain movements is essential for anyone looking to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Longling Capital?

Q3: What does ‘realized profit’ mean in this context? A3: Realized profit refers to the gain an investor makes when they sell an asset for more than its purchase price. In this case, the address associated with Longling Capital made an estimated $3.84 million profit from these transactions. Q4: How do large deposits to exchanges affect cryptocurrency prices? A4: Large deposits can increase the supply of an asset available for trading on an exchange. If these assets are then sold, it can create selling pressure and potentially lead to a price decrease. Conversely, if they are held or used for other purposes, the impact might be minimal. Q5: Why is it important to track institutional crypto movements?

The latest buzz is all about the Altcoin Season Index , which has just surged to 56! This significant move signals a potential shift in market dynamics, making it a crucial indicator for every crypto enthusiast and investor. Understanding this index can provide invaluable insights into where the market might be heading next. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index , meticulously compiled by CoinMarketCap, serves as a vital barometer for the cryptocurrency market. It helps us understand whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated metric designed to provide clarity in a complex market. It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Crucially, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to ensure a pure assessment of market sentiment and genuine growth. The performance of these altcoins is measured against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The recent rise of the Altcoin Season Index by four points from the previous day to 56 suggests growing momentum for altcoins. While not yet a full-blown altcoin season, this upward trend is certainly catching the attention of astute investors. Decoding the Index: When Does Altcoin Season Begin? Understanding the score of the Altcoin Season Index is key to grasping prevailing market trends. A score closer to 100 indicates a strong altcoin season, where a significant portion of the market’s capital flows into alternative cryptocurrencies. Specifically, an altcoin season is officially declared when a staggering 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90-day period. This threshold signifies a broad-based rally across the altcoin market. Conversely, if Bitcoin is the dominant performer, we find ourselves in a ‘Bitcoin season’. During such times, Bitcoin typically consolidates its position, often drawing capital away from altcoins. The current movement of the Altcoin Season Index at 56 shows a compelling shift towards altcoin strength, indicating that more altcoins are beginning to outshine Bitcoin. Why Does the Altcoin Season Index Matter for Your Portfolio? For investors, the Altcoin Season Index offers invaluable insights into potential market rotations. Recognizing the signs of an impending altcoin season can present significant opportunities for portfolio growth and strategic adjustments. During these periods, many altcoins can experience rapid price appreciation, often outpacing Bitcoin’s gains. Strategic Allocation: It helps investors decide whether to increase their exposure to altcoins or prioritize Bitcoin, optimizing their portfolio for current market conditions. Risk Management: Understanding the prevailing market sentiment can aid in managing risk, as different assets perform better in varying market conditions. Profit Potential: Identifying early signs of an altcoin season can lead to substantial profits from well-chosen altcoins that capitalize on the market’s momentum. Paying attention to the Altcoin Season Index can empower you to make more informed decisions rather than simply reacting to price movements. Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities with the Altcoin Season Index While an increasing Altcoin Season Index is exciting, it’s crucial to approach the market with a balanced perspective. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and altcoin rallies can be particularly intense, both upwards and downwards. This dynamic environment presents both significant challenges and immense opportunities. One challenge is the sheer number of altcoins available. Deciding which ones have genuine potential amidst the hype requires thorough research and a deep understanding of their underlying technology and use cases. Another is the risk of ‘altcoin busts,’ where speculative bubbles can form and burst quickly, leading to substantial losses for unprepared investors. Always do your diligent research before committing capital. However, the opportunities are immense for those who are well-informed. Emerging technologies, innovative use cases, and strong community support can drive certain altcoins to new heights. The current movement of the Altcoin Season Index might indicate that more capital is flowing into these alternative assets, seeking higher returns and innovative projects beyond Bitcoin. What’s Next for the Altcoin Season Index? Actionable Insights The current trajectory of the Altcoin Season Index at 56 indicates a cautious optimism. It’s not a full sprint into an altcoin season yet, but it’s certainly more than a jog. This suggests a period where selective altcoins could see significant gains. What should investors consider doing now to best position themselves? Monitor Closely: Keep a keen eye on the index’s movements and the individual performance of top altcoins. Daily changes can offer valuable clues. Diversify Smartly: Consider diversifying your portfolio with promising altcoins, but avoid over-concentration in highly speculative assets. A balanced approach is key. Research Diligently: Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear roadmaps, active development teams, and real-world utility. Stay Informed: Follow market news, expert analyses, and community sentiment to make well-informed decisions. The crypto landscape evolves rapidly. The recent surge of the Altcoin Season Index to 56 is a compelling indicator of shifting tides in the cryptocurrency landscape. While not a definitive altcoin season yet, this upward movement suggests that altcoins are gaining strength against Bitcoin. By understanding what the index signifies, its calculation, and how to interpret its movements, investors can better position themselves to capitalize on potential opportunities. Always remember to conduct your own research and manage risks wisely in this dynamic market. The stage is set for an exciting period; are you ready to navigate it? Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does the Altcoin Season Index measure? The Altcoin Season Index measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It indicates whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. 2. How is an altcoin season officially declared? An altcoin season is officially declared when 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. A score closer to 100 on the index signals a strong altcoin season. 3. Why did the Altcoin Season Index rise to 56? The Altcoin Season Index rose to 56 because a greater number of the top 100 altcoins have started to outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days, indicating a shift in market momentum and increased interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. 4. What’s the difference between an altcoin season and a Bitcoin season? An altcoin season occurs when altcoins broadly outperform Bitcoin, typically indicated by a high Altcoin Season Index score. A Bitcoin season, conversely, is when Bitcoin is the dominant performer, often attracting capital from altcoins and showing a lower index score. 5. How can I use the Altcoin Season Index in my investment strategy? You can use the Altcoin Season Index as a guide for portfolio allocation. A rising index might suggest increasing exposure to well-researched altcoins, while a falling index could indicate a preference for Bitcoin or more cautious investing. Always combine this with your own due diligence. 6. Is a score of 56 on the Altcoin Season Index a guarantee of an altcoin rally? No, a score of 56 on the Altcoin Season Index is not a guarantee of an immediate, full-blown altcoin rally. While it indicates growing momentum and a positive trend for altcoins, it is still below the 75% threshold for an official altcoin season. It suggests a potential shift, but market conditions can change rapidly. If you found this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful, don’t keep these crucial market insights to yourself!

51472819,577794,1757466040,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51472819.jpeg,Bettors Bet Big On Trump Pardoning Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao,https://bitcoinist.com/bettors-bet-big-on-trump-pardoning-binance-founder-changpeng-zhao/,"According to a Polymarket poll titled “Who will Trump pardon in 2025,” Changpeng Zhao is the favored candidate for a presidential pardon, drawing 36% of bets on the decentralized prediction site. Polymarket Puts CZ Ahead Polymarket’s numbers show strong speculative interest in Zhao’s fate. A 36% share of bettors is a large lead in a market where votes are driven by opinion and information, not official process. Based on reports, the poll reflects what some traders expect rather than any formal signal from the White House. Prediction markets can move fast when new facts appear, and their prices are watched because they capture a slice of public expectation. Congressman George Santos and entrepreneur Roger Ver also made the list, each drawing 10% support from bettors for a Trump pardon. Other names listed by participants include Steve Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, and Sean “Diddy” Combs. Source: Polymarket Legal Background And Public Comments Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering (AML) program at Binance. That conviction led to his resignation as CEO. Reports have disclosed that Zhao publicly hinted at the possibility of a pardon after US President Donald Trump’s controversial December 2024 pardon of Hunter Biden, He also confirmed on a podcast in May that he had formally filed a pardon application with the White House. Legal And Political Pressure Builds Key Democratic lawmakers responded quickly after news of Zhao’s pardon filing and related business moves. Senators led by Elizabeth Warren addressed a letter to White House Counsel David Warrington and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche asking for clarity on the status of any pardon. Reports cite concerns about a separate $2 billion deal announced by Binance, Emirati firm MGX, and World Liberty Financial (WLF) involving a stablecoin called USD1, which those senators said raises questions given the overlap of business ties and a pardon request. On Trump, Bettors, And The Limits Of Speculation Polymarket’s snapshot puts Zhao well ahead of other high-profile names, but a market position is not a legal verdict. Pardons are political acts made by the president; they can be influenced by many forces, and not all rumored candidates end up receiving one. Betting data shows where attention is focused, and it can affect perceptions, but it does not determine the White House’s choice.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. BTC is pinned near $111,000 with volatility compressed to multi-month lows, the kind of calm that tends to precede decisive moves. Traders know what could break the lull: September’s U.S. inflation data and the Fed’s rate decision a week later. Prediction markets are leaning heavily toward easing. Polymarket bettors are assigning an 82% chance of a 25-basis-point cut on Sept. 17, leaving only slim odds for a deeper move or no change. Beyond that, October expectations are fractured, with nearly even probabilities for another cut or a pause. That divergence explains why volatility, though absent now, is unlikely to stay that way. “Markets often look calm just before they move. Bitcoin is trading in one of its tightest ranges in months, and volatility across crypto has compressed to multi-month lows,” said Gracie Lin, OKX Singapore CEO. “With U.S. inflation data like Core CPI out on Sept. 11 and the Fed’s much-anticipated rate decision just ahead, this quiet period is setting the stage for the next decisive move. Whether the catalyst is an upside inflation surprise or a dovish signal from the Fed, what’s clear is that the absence of volatility is rarely permanent in digital assets; history shows the market will find its next direction soon enough.” If a cut pulls money-market returns lower, the opportunity cost of sitting in cash rises, which is the pivot market maker Enflux says could send flows toward crypto. “The real debate now is not if cuts come, but whether liquidity deployment shifts into BTC, ETH, and even riskier assets,” the firm told CoinDesk. In other words, the Fed’s cut may grab headlines, but the real trade is whether sidelined cash rotates into digital assets — a shift that could fuel the return of volatility. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin has dipped slightly intraday, trading between approximately $110,812 and $113,237, reflecting short-term volatility amid shifting investor sentiment and broader crypto market dynamics. ETH: ETH is modestly up intraday, with a range between roughly $4,279 and $4,379, signaling steady demand and some renewed investor interest. Range, however, is limited with modest ETF flows and traders awaiting the Fed's next move. Gold: Gold is rallying to record highs, fueled by mounting expectations of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, a weakening U.S. dollar, and renewed safe-haven demand. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks opened mostly higher Wednesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.2%, as investors awaited China’s August inflation data showing an expected 0.2% CPI drop and a smaller 2.9% PPI decline. S&P 500: U.S. stocks closed at record highs Tuesday, with the S&P 500 up 0.27% to 6,512.61, as investors looked past a record payroll revision that cut 911,000 jobs from prior figures.

This development is not just a footnote; it represents a crucial moment for the company and the broader digital asset landscape. The Gemini IPO is poised to make a substantial impact, reflecting growing investor confidence in the crypto sector’s potential. What’s Driving the Gemini IPO’s Soaring Ambitions? Initially, Gemini aimed to raise $317 million. However, Bloomberg has now reported a revised, much more ambitious goal of $430 million. This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it signifies a robust demand and optimistic outlook for the exchange’s public debut. Key details of this updated plan include: The offering price has been adjusted upwards to a range of $24 to $26 per share, a notable increase from the initial $17 to $19 range. Despite the higher fundraising target and share price, the number of shares to be offered remains consistent at 16.7 million. Nasdaq, a major stock exchange operator, previously announced its intention to purchase $50 million worth of Gemini stock at the offering price, further solidifying institutional interest. This increased target for the Gemini IPO suggests strong preliminary interest from institutional investors and a positive market sentiment surrounding well-established crypto entities. The Significance of a Successful Gemini IPO for the Market A successful Gemini IPO could have profound implications, not only for Gemini itself but for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It serves as a powerful validation of the crypto industry’s maturation and its increasing appeal to traditional financial markets. For Gemini, this capital infusion means accelerated growth, enhanced product development, and the ability to expand its global footprint. It also provides the exchange with greater legitimacy and a stronger competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market. From an investor’s perspective, this IPO offers an opportunity to gain exposure to the digital asset space through a regulated and established entity. This is particularly appealing for those who might be hesitant to directly invest in volatile cryptocurrencies but see value in the infrastructure supporting them. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Exchanges? The upward revision of Gemini’s fundraising target sets a compelling precedent. It indicates that investors are increasingly comfortable with, and actively seeking, opportunities within the crypto economy. This could pave the way for other major cryptocurrency exchanges and related businesses to consider public listings, fostering greater transparency and integration with mainstream finance. However, it is important to remember that the crypto market, while growing, still faces regulatory uncertainties and inherent volatility. The success of the Gemini IPO will be closely watched as a barometer for investor appetite in this innovative sector. It highlights a critical juncture where digital assets are moving from niche interest to significant financial instruments. Navigating the Landscape: Key Considerations for the Gemini IPO As the Gemini IPO approaches, several factors will be crucial for its reception and long-term success. Potential investors and market observers should consider: Market Sentiment: The broader cryptocurrency market’s performance can influence investor enthusiasm. Regulatory Environment: Ongoing developments in crypto regulation will play a significant role in shaping the future of exchanges. Company Performance: Gemini’s financial health, user growth, and technological advancements will be key indicators. Investor Demand: The final pricing and initial trading performance will reflect the market’s overall confidence in Gemini’s valuation. The increased fundraising target underscores a strong belief in Gemini’s vision and its capacity to thrive in the digital asset space. This move is a testament to the enduring potential of cryptocurrency exchanges to attract substantial capital and solidify their position in the global financial landscape. In conclusion, Gemini’s decision to raise its IPO fundraising target to $430 million is a powerful statement of intent and confidence. It reflects a growing institutional embrace of digital assets and positions Gemini for significant expansion. This development marks a pivotal moment, signaling a bullish outlook for both the exchange and the wider cryptocurrency market as it continues its journey towards mainstream adoption and integration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Gemini IPO Q1: What is an IPO and why is it significant for Gemini? A: An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is when a private company first offers its shares to the public. For Gemini, an IPO means raising substantial capital for growth, increasing its public profile, and providing liquidity for early investors and employees. It also signals a significant step towards mainstream financial integration for a crypto company. Q2: Why did Gemini increase its IPO fundraising target? A: Gemini increased its target from $317 million to $430 million likely due to strong investor demand and positive market sentiment. This suggests that initial feedback indicated a higher appetite for Gemini shares than originally anticipated, allowing them to seek more capital for expansion and development. Q3: Who are the key players mentioned in relation to the Gemini IPO? A: The primary player is Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange. Bloomberg reported the fundraising target increase. Nasdaq is also a key player, as it announced its intention to purchase $50 million worth of Gemini stock, highlighting institutional interest in the offering. Q4: What are the potential benefits of investing in a crypto exchange IPO like Gemini’s? A: Investing in a crypto exchange IPO offers exposure to the growing digital asset market without directly holding volatile cryptocurrencies. Benefits can include potential capital appreciation, investment in a regulated entity, and participation in the infrastructure that facilitates the crypto economy. Q5: How might the Gemini IPO impact the wider cryptocurrency market? A: A successful Gemini IPO can boost confidence across the entire crypto market, signaling to traditional investors that crypto-related businesses are viable and attractive.

51473614,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=804152,1757466893,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51473614.jpeg,Ursula von der Leyen sets EU agenda after Trump trade deal backlash,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/von-der-leyen-sets-eu-agenda/,"Ursula von der Leyen, the European Union’s chief executive, will give her annual State of the Union address today, laying out the European Union’s priorities for the coming year. She speaks amid intense political pressure following a summer filled with backlash to a trade deal U.S. President Donald Trump offered. Last year, she was re-elected for a second term, but the President of the European Commission now faces a tricky balancing act . Conversely, she doesn’t want to appear unrealistic in leadership and unity. On the other hand, she has to account for lawmakers, businesses, and voters who believe the U.S. deal shortchanged Europe. Von der Leyen will take the floor in Strasbourg at 9 a.m., delivering a speech whose tradition is to lay out the bloc’s political direction. She is set to emphasise Europe’s defence, demanding new investment and closer co-ordination in a growing global insecurity. Alongside security, she will concentrate on raising the continent’s economic competitiveness to confront the rising challenge from China and protect European jobs. She is championing a stepped-up approach to Ukraine, with continued financial and military support, while she pushes for stronger sanctions against Russia. In addition to these priorities, officials say, she wants to highlight progress on climate policy and the digital transition and project the EU as green and technologically advanced. Yet the most urgent question for business leaders will be whether she can deliver concrete steps to cut red tape and put into practice the competitiveness plan by former ECB chief Mario Draghi. Trade deal sparks EU backlash Casting a significant shadow over her speech is the tariff deal she made with Trump in July at his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland where EU tariffs were abolished on U.S. industrial goods and market barriers for U.S. farm produce were clamped down on. In retaliation, Trump imposed a 15 % tax on most EU products, doing away with low or zero duties that had existed before his second term. The response in Europe has been furious. It was an “act of submission” and “another form of slavery,” France’s former prime minister François Bayrou said. A poll published this week found that 77 % of people in the EU’s five biggest countries believe the deal is weighted in favor of the United States. Just 2% say that it’s good for Europe. Over half said they would support boycotting U.S. products, with the others desiring von der Leyen to make her exit. European officials have defended the deal as a necessary compromise that averted a destructive trade war. Businesses, it is said, wanted certainty, especially with U.S. security guarantees still vital to the defence of Europe. But a broad opposition exists inside Parliament. Socialists and Greens accuse Von der Leyen of bending to Washington pressure. Even some in the centre-right European People’s Party, her own political family, have voiced unease. Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at HEC Paris, said von der Leyen was being made a scapegoat. He argued that while she embodied the EU’s weaknesses, those failings were not hers. According to him, she could not single-handedly retaliate against the United States, respond decisively to the conflict in Gaza, or broker peace in Ukraine. Von der Leyen fights to restore trust The State of the Union address will be watched closely across Europe. For von der Leyen, it is an opportunity to reset the political agenda and drum up support when there are increasing signs of public unrest. She’ll highlight the EU’s global role, its role in defending Ukraine, and even its role in helping to shape trade and climate rules. However, with the Trump deal still leading the news, the question is whether her message can restore trust. A debate will follow her speech to Parliament. Markets, industry groups, and allies elsewhere will be seeking indications of how the EU plans to handle the wars, trade, and competition from others worldwide. This could be von der Leyen’s most challenging State of the Union yet. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

51474010,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=804155,1757467041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51474010.jpeg,Alphabet’s Google Cloud locks in $58B revenue pipeline,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/google-cloud-locks-in-58b-revenue-pipeline/,"Google Cloud by Alphabet said it had lined up a new revenue stream to generate $58 billion over the next two years. The disclosure was made at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference and highlighted the division’s growing importance to Alphabet’s overall plans. The cloud unit has been seeking to establish itself as one of the fastest-growing businesses within Alphabet as the company’s traditional search engine and advertising business faces growing scrutiny from regulators and competitors. Google Cloud currently holds a $106 billion backlog in contracts. CEO Thomas Kurian said about 55% of this, roughly $58 billion, will be converted into revenue within two years. That total includes only projects currently under contract, so any new deals have the potential to keep bumping up the pipeline. The backlog has resumed growing faster than revenue recognized, demonstrating strong momentum. Earlier this year, the cloud division had already crossed a $50 billion annual revenue run rate. This achievement also solidifies that Google Cloud is becoming a dependable and growing revenue stream for Alphabet, particularly as the company still scales its infrastructure. AI giants drive Cloud growth Customer momentum has become one of Google Cloud’s most powerful weapons. The unit saw a 28% increase in new customers in the latest quarter, indicating how much businesses rely on Google for their computing demands . Most importantly, we see more and more in the artificial intelligence community choosing Google Cloud. Nine of the world’s 10 biggest AI labs are now customers. That list includes OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and Anthropic, which has recently been valued at $183 billion. Both are direct rivals to Google’s AI platforms but rely heavily on Google Cloud to train and serve their models. The reason is clear. Training giant AI systems requires vast computing power, speedy networking, and secure infrastructure. Google Cloud has distinguished itself in these domains by providing dedicated chips, like Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and state-of-the-art GPU clusters for accelerating AI workloads. These are not just nice-to-have features for many AI labs; they are necessities. Kurian emphasised at the Goldman Sachs conference that the AI surge of clients wasn’t some fad. Instead, it represents a structural change in how the next generation of tech companies will scale. As businesses in sectors ranging from healthcare to financial services to media and logistics adopt generative AI en masse, the need for robust, high-performance infrastructure can only increase. With the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic, Google Cloud also sends a message to investors and customers: it is not only competing in AI but also strengthening the broader ecosystem. This two-part role strengthens Google’s business as a player in and provider to the growing AI sector. The extent to which AI leaders adopt such tools illustrates a deeper shift. Google Cloud is becoming a supporting business line and a foundation for some of the most resource-intensive projects on earth. That reinforces the company’s aspirations to be considered an advertising giant and a critical provider of 21st-century infrastructure for artificial intelligence. As reported by Cryptopolitan , Google Cloud recently revealed that its L1 blockchain project, Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL), is currently operating in a private testnet phase. Rich Widmann, head of Web3 strategy at Google, explained that GCUL is the culmination of years of research and development in distributed ledger technology. Widmann confirmed that GCUL supports Python-based smart contracts and emphasized that the blockchain is being designed as a neutral platform for multiple financial institutions. He also highlighted that, while similar in scope to companies like Stripe and Circle, GCUL offers unique features that set it apart. Cloud drives Alphabet’s future growth The cloud business is emerging as an important driver of growth for Alphabet. Cloud services represented only 14 percent of Alphabet’s total revenue in the latest quarter, but the unit is one of the company’s fastest-growing lines. By contrast, Google’s advertising business is still generating the majority of revenue, even as it has come under increasing scrutiny. Regulators in the United States and Europe are exploring Google’s dominance in search and ads, paving the way for more competitors. This makes diversification across Google Cloud even more critical. Alphabet’s use of capital is a good example of this; in July, the company’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, raised the company’s 2025 capital expenditure target to $85 billion from $75 billion. Growth is largely fueled by increased interest in cloud services and AI infrastructure. Google Cloud’s expansion comes as tech companies are pressured to prove that heavy investments in artificial intelligence will pay off. Wall Street has been eager to see if the billions invested in AI data centers and chips would turn into actual earnings. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

These documents include the S-1 and S-3, among other related documents. With this, the digital assets platform intends to convert its current closed-end trusts for these cryptocurrencies into ETFs that will mainly be listed on NYSE Arca or Nasdaq. According to reliable sources, this is not the first time Grayscale has initiated such an approach. In 2024, the digital assets platform changed its BTC and ETH trusts into exchange-traded products. Crypto firms seek SEC’s approval for ETFs connected to altcoins Concerning Grayscale’s filings with the SEC on its Litecoin ETF, its S-3 filing document states that this prospectus assumes that the commission has either had the 19b-4 application approved or has established general listing regulations that guarantee the Trust’s shares to be among those listed on NYSE Arca. This follows a growing trend among crypto companies seeking approval for ETFs connected to altcoins. This includes Dogecoin and XRP. Meanwhile, reports from reliable sources have pointed out that earlier on Tuesday, September 9, the SEC had postponed its decision on Bitwise’s spot Dogecoin ETF and Grayscale’s spot Hedera ETF. On the other hand, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Cash trust has demonstrated exemplary results. According to the filing , its net asset value recorded figures exceeding $202 million with its shares priced at $4.31 each on June 30. Notably, a high-performance difference exists between a closed-end trust and an ETF. A closed-end trust can conduct trades for more or less than its net asset value; however, an ETF purchases and sells assets depending on the demand in the market. Additionally, it has an open-end structure that develops and redeems shares to maintain prices close to the net asset value. Earlier, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC for rejecting its proposal to convert its trust. Concerning this, analysts have anticipated that this could be a significant reason behind the commission’s reaction to permit Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs later to carry out trade in the US. According to data from reliable sources, since they started operating in the US in January 2024, spot Bitcoin ETFs have reached their highest overall trading volume, recording figures exceeding 1.2 trillion. The US SEC delays Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF approval REX Shares and Osprey Funds were reportedly making arrangements to launch their Dogecoin ETF this week. However, on Tuesday, September 9, the SEC postponed their decision on Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF. In a filing, the commission mentioned that their abrupt delay was to gather more time to examine whether to approve or reject a proposed rule change that could permit Bitwise to list a meme coin as an ETF tracking. Apart from Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF facing delays recently, it is worth noting that its proposed DOGE fund was also subjected to delays back in June. On the contrary, REX Shares and Osprey Funds’ Dogecoin ETF will commence trading activities on Thursday, September 11, having adopted a completely different approach for its listing. In an X post, Analyst Eric Balchunas commented on the situation. According to him, the Thursday DOGE launch signifies an entry to an era of meme coin ETFs, despite being under the 40 Act. Balchunas further anticipated that this would be the first-ever US ETF to hold something that does not entail practical use. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

One such entity, the AI startup Mercor, is currently making waves across the tech landscape, reportedly eyeing a monumental valuation exceeding $10 billion. For those keenly observing the confluence of technology and finance, particularly within the cryptocurrency space where groundbreaking tech often finds fertile ground, Mercor’s trajectory offers a compelling narrative of rapid expansion and strategic foresight. AI Startup Mercor’s Astonishing Ascent Mercor, founded in 2022 by Thiel Fellows and Harvard dropouts Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, has swiftly positioned itself as a critical enabler for leading AI labs. The company specializes in connecting industry titans like OpenAI and Meta with highly specialized domain experts—from scientists and doctors to lawyers—who are essential for training and refining foundational AI models. This unique service model has propelled Mercor into a league of its own, attracting significant investor attention. Recent reports, citing marketing documents and sources familiar with deal talks, indicate that Mercor is in discussions for a Series C funding round. The target? A staggering valuation of $10 billion or more. This figure represents a significant jump from an $8 billion target discussed just months prior, underscoring the explosive growth and perceived potential of the company. Felicis, an existing investor, is reportedly considering a substantial re-investment, signaling strong confidence in Mercor’s future. Key Milestones and Financial Performance: Founding: 2022 by Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha. Previous Funding: $100 million Series B in February at a $2 billion valuation, led by Felicis. Current ARR: Approaching $450 million in annualized run-rate revenue, with CEO Brendan Foody stating it’s even higher. This is a significant leap from $75 million in February and $100 million in March. Profitability: Generated $6 million in profit in the first half of the year, a notable achievement for a rapidly scaling startup. Understanding Mercor ‘s Disruptive AI Training Model Mercor’s core business model is both innovative and essential for the advancement of complex AI. By providing companies with specialized domain experts for AI model training, Mercor addresses a critical bottleneck in AI development. These experts perform crucial tasks, such as data labeling and verification, ensuring that AI models are not only intelligent but also accurate and reliable. Mercor earns revenue by charging an hourly finder’s fee and a matching rate for these services. The company boasts an impressive client roster, claiming to supply data labeling contractors to five of the top AI labs: Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI, alongside Tesla and Nvidia. Sources suggest that a substantial portion of its revenue is derived from a subset of these high-profile clients, particularly OpenAI, highlighting Mercor’s strategic importance in the AI ecosystem. To further solidify its market position and diversify its offerings, Mercor is also expanding its technological infrastructure: Software Infrastructure for Reinforcement Learning (RL): Mercor is developing advanced software to support RL, a training method where AI models learn through feedback and iterative improvement. This move positions Mercor at the forefront of sophisticated AI development. AI-Powered Recruiting Marketplace: The company intends to leverage AI to build its own recruiting marketplace, potentially streamlining the process of connecting experts with AI projects and further enhancing its service delivery. The Race for Startup Valuation : Mercor’s Billions The rapid escalation of Mercor’s target startup valuation from $8 billion to over $10 billion in a matter of months is a testament to the fervent investor interest in the AI sector. This valuation places Mercor among an elite group of tech companies experiencing hyper-growth. The company has reportedly received multiple offers from venture capitalists, with some preemptive bids reaching the $10 billion mark. Mercor’s financial trajectory is particularly striking when compared to other fast-growing startups. The company claims it is on track to hit the $500 million ARR milestone faster than Anysphere, the creator of the AI coding assistant Cursor, which famously achieved this within a year of its product launch. What sets Mercor apart even further is its profitability; unlike Anysphere, which is still burning cash, Mercor generated $6 million in profit in the first half of the year, demonstrating a sustainable growth model. The appointment of Sundeep Jain, former chief product officer at Uber, as Mercor’s first president, further signals the company’s ambition to scale and professionalize its operations, preparing for its next phase of expansion and potentially a successful Series C round. Driving Innovation with Reinforcement Learning and Beyond Mercor’s strategic pivot into building software infrastructure for reinforcement learning (RL) signifies a proactive approach to evolving AI training methodologies. RL is crucial for developing highly autonomous and adaptive AI systems, and by providing tools for this, Mercor aims to become an indispensable partner for advanced AI development. This move is not without its challenges, as the competitive landscape is intense. Mercor faces formidable rivals in this space, including: Surge AI: Reportedly in talks to raise funding at a staggering $25 billion valuation. Turing Labs: Another significant player in the data labeling and AI services sector. Scale AI: A major competitor that is also expanding its offerings into RL services. Notably, Scale AI has sued Mercor for alleged misappropriation of trade secrets, highlighting the fierce competition for market dominance. Furthermore, OpenAI’s recent launch of its own hiring platform raises questions about the potential for AI giants to develop their human-expert-powered RL training services in-house, adding another layer of competitive pressure for Mercor. Navigating the Competitive AI Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities While Mercor’s growth is undeniable, the competitive landscape presents both challenges and opportunities. The lawsuit from Scale AI, alleging that a former employee stole confidential documents, underscores the high-stakes nature of the AI training market. Such legal battles can be costly and distracting, but Mercor’s leadership remains focused on its ambitious goals. CEO Brendan Foody has publicly downplayed the need for new funding, stating, “We haven’t been trying to raise at all,” and that the company “turn[s] down offers every month.” He also clarified that Mercor’s reported ARR includes the total amount customers pay for services before contractors receive their portion, a common and auditor-recommended accounting practice also used by competitors like Surge AI and Scale AI. This transparency aims to reinforce confidence in Mercor’s financial reporting amidst its rapid growth. The ongoing “Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025” event, attracting thousands of tech and VC leaders, further emphasizes the broader industry’s appetite for innovation. Companies like Mercor, even if not directly involved in cryptocurrency, represent the kind of disruptive technology that draws the attention of investors and innovators across the tech spectrum, including those deeply invested in the future of digital assets and decentralized solutions. A Future Forged in AI Excellence Mercor’s journey from a 2022 startup to a company potentially valued at over $10 billion in just a few years is a powerful narrative of ambition, strategic execution, and the immense demand for specialized AI services. By connecting the world’s leading AI labs with the human expertise needed to refine their models, Mercor has carved out a crucial niche. Its expansion into reinforcement learning infrastructure and an AI-powered recruiting marketplace positions it for continued innovation, even amidst intense competition and legal challenges. As the AI revolution accelerates, Mercor stands as a testament to the incredible opportunities that arise at the intersection of human intelligence and machine learning, driving forward the very frontier of artificial intelligence.

The app’s rollout begins early next year. A select group of customers will be the first to get invitations. After that, the feature will be rolled out to all users. Its arrival is another sign that the online brokerage has entered a new era. Robinhood is a place to invest, combined with community and conversation. Robinhood puts trading at the center of social Robinhood Social follows a simple rule: every post must be linked to a real trade. Whether users share insights on stocks, options, or crypto, it has to reflect an actual position they’ve taken, adding authenticity to the content. The position updates in real time once a trade is posted. Prices, gains, and losses change as markets move. Other traders can join the conversation by commenting directly on the post. This makes the platform more interactive than a static screenshot, for example, or a one-sentence Reddit message. By opting for a trade as the center of every post, Robinhood creates a stark contrast between itself and social platforms like Reddit and X, where users can put unverified claims, inflated claims, or edited screenshots for results. On the other hand, Robinhood Social is transparent because a transaction inside the brokerage underpins every post. The platform also provides additional transparency into investor performance. Users can share the one-day and one-year profit and loss statements. They can also disclose their total profit margins. This allows followers to learn from traders who always win and have the context when trading strategies go awry. The social part won’t be limited to everyday traders. The company expects to include profiles of luminaries like lawmakers and billionaire investors. For instance, trades by the former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which are closely tracked by retail traders online, will automatically appear, according to required public financial disclosures. The same goes for hedge-fund managers like Bill Ackman. This tool puts the information that big investors keep an eye on in the hands of regular people, although notably with a more human, and certainly less dull, form. Individually, they’re all basic, but collectively, they’re enough to turn Robinhood Social into more than just a chatroom. It turns into a live trading feed, and every discussion is based on fact, real positions, and measurable performance. Robinhood builds a financial super-app This is more than a hobby project. Robinhood views the platform as an investment in its plan to become a financial super-app over the long term. Along with the social launch, the company is introducing new trading tools. Active traders will receive AI-powered scanning tools on Robinhood’s desktop platform, Legend. Futures trading, short selling, and overnight index options will also be launched in 2025. The company says such upgrades will enable users to trade like professionals yet remain connected to a reliable social space. Executives said that every year, several verticals are reinvented on the internet, and they believe the new platform will change how money is discussed online. Abhishek Fatehpuria, Robinhood’s vice president of product management, added that the company had always wanted to combine social and investing and could now do so transparently and credibly. Robinhood naturally draws a social audience. Its traders played a central role in the 2021 meme stock frenzy. At the time, thousands of retail investors used the WallStreetBets Reddit forum to band together to run up stocks such as GameStop and AMC. Now Robinhood is chasing that energy inside its own ecosystem. The company sees in-house discussions as a way to help make investing more engaging while reducing misinformation risks on other platforms.

51477080,577511,1757469650,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51477080.jpeg,Bitcoin Supply Flows From Giants To Mid-Sized Holders – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-flows-from-giants-mid-sized-holders/,"Bitcoin is beginning to show signs of renewed bullish energy, with the price testing the $113,000 resistance level after weeks of mixed sentiment. The move comes as many altcoins are gaining strength, suggesting that the broader crypto market is preparing for decisive action. The next few days are set to be crucial, as investors eagerly await the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting, where speculation is building around a potential interest rate cut. Any monetary policy shift from the Fed could significantly impact liquidity flows into Bitcoin and risk assets. At the same time, the structure of Bitcoin’s investor base is changing. According to top analyst Maartunn, the number of addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC has been declining rapidly in this cycle. Meanwhile, addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC are on the rise. This shift highlights a redistribution of supply, where large entities appear to be reducing exposure while smaller but still significant players increase their holdings. Bitcoin Supply Shift: From Big Fish To Medium Players Maartunn explains that the current “Big Fish Down, Medium Players Up” dynamic highlights a fundamental shift in Bitcoin’s ownership structure. This transition reflects a supply redistribution, where massive concentrations of Bitcoin in the hands of a few whales are giving way to medium-sized players, many of whom are linked to ETF custody wallets and institutional investment structures. This development carries major implications for the market. When Bitcoin is concentrated in fewer hands, price action can be vulnerable to abrupt swings triggered by large single-entity decisions. By contrast, supply spread across more medium players tends to create a more resilient and liquid market structure, less prone to outsized shocks. ETF custody wallets, in particular, represent a more transparent, regulated, and demand-driven form of holding, aligning Bitcoin closer with traditional financial infrastructure. Unlike previous cycles, institutional involvement is now playing a decisive role. From ETFs in the US to treasury strategies in Japan, institutional adoption has reshaped how Bitcoin supply is absorbed after each rally. Instead of chaotic peaks followed by sharp drawdowns, the market now shows stretched-out tops and segmented distribution phases. This structural evolution could mark a turning point for Bitcoin, where long-term sustainability increasingly outweighs speculative frenzy, setting the stage for a more mature bull market cycle. Price Action Reveals Growing Momentum Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of recovery after weeks of volatility, currently trading around $112,902 on the 12-hour chart. The price has managed to reclaim momentum following a bounce from the $110K support, but it now faces a critical resistance test. The chart highlights BTC pressing against the 50-day moving average (blue line), which sits just above the current price. A clean break above this level would strengthen the bullish case and potentially open the door toward the $115K–$117K range. On the downside, the 200-day moving average (red line) remains intact near $112K, providing short-term support. This convergence of moving averages creates a narrow trading zone, meaning that the next decisive move could trigger a larger breakout. The ultimate resistance remains at $123,217, the local high marked in August. Failure to sustain above $112K could result in another pullback toward $110K. On the flip side, a breakout with strong momentum above $115K could confirm a renewed rally. The market remains highly sensitive to macroeconomic signals, particularly the upcoming Federal Reserve decision, which could drive volatility in the coming days.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-expert-xrp-to-moon-in-10-days-heres-why/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld has shared an assertive outlook on XRP in a recent post on social media, declaring, “#XRP TO MOON IN 10 DAYS!!!” The statement was accompanied by a video in which Rietveld discussed the Federal Reserve’s interest rate outlook and its potential influence on both traditional financial markets and digital assets. His remarks anticipated monetary policy decisions with the likelihood of significant price movement in cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP. #XRP TO MOON IN 10 DAYS!!! pic.twitter.com/GHInFBEPC2 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 8, 2025 Major Banks Expect Multiple Rate Cuts In the video, Rietveld explained that leading financial institutions are forecasting several interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve before the end of the year. He noted that the Bank of America projects two rate cuts, while JPMorgan Chase has suggested the possibility of two to three cuts. He emphasized that virtually all major banks have issued similar forecasts, reinforcing the idea that monetary easing is widely expected across the financial sector. According to Rietveld, this expectation has also been reflected in betting markets. He cited data suggesting a 94 percent probability of a rate cut being announced on September 17, leaving approximately ten days until a decision is made. He described this timeline as a critical window for investors, stating that it represents, in his view, the last real opportunity to benefit from the coming cycle of lower rates. Correlation Between M2 Growth and Asset Prices Rietveld went further by highlighting the historical relationship between rate cuts, M2 money supply expansion, and asset valuations. He explained that there is a correlation of approximately 95% between increases in M2, typically associated with rate cuts, and the performance of both digital assets and stocks. This, he argued, suggests that the upcoming monetary environment could be highly favorable for assets such as XRP. His comments indicate that he sees the rate cut cycle as directly supportive of higher valuations in the cryptocurrency sector. By tying together central bank policy shifts, liquidity measures, and historical price patterns, Rietveld outlined why he believes XRP may experience a substantial increase in value within the near term. Monetary Policy Signals and Market Reactions Rietveld’s forecast highlights a broader narrative within the digital asset space, suggesting that central bank monetary policy decisions have a significant impact on market performance. Rate cuts generally reduce borrowing costs, increase liquidity, and incentivize investment in both equities and cryptocurrencies. His remarks suggest that XRP, alongside other digital assets, could benefit considerably from these dynamics, with the September 17 meeting seen as a key turning point.

Market outcomes depend not only on rate decisions but also on investor sentiment, regulatory developments, and broader economic conditions. Nonetheless, the financial expert’s view is that XRP may be positioned for a notable upward move within ten days, driven by expectations of imminent U.S. interest rate cuts and their historical correlation with asset appreciation.

This large transfer, involving millions of dollars in Ethereum, sparks important questions about institutional activity and potential market shifts. Understanding such movements is crucial for anyone keen on the dynamics of the digital asset space. Unpacking the Significant Matrixport ETH Deposit Approximately ten hours ago, an address linked to Matrixport, a prominent cryptocurrency service provider, executed a substantial transfer. The transaction involved 10,000 ETH, valued at an impressive $43.77 million, which was moved to the Binance exchange. This data comes from on-chain analytics platform ai_9684xtpa, providing transparency into the transaction. Such a considerable Matrixport ETH deposit to a major exchange like Binance is often interpreted as a signal by market participants. It suggests a potential rebalancing of assets, preparation for future trading activities, or even a strategic shift in portfolio management by the institutional entity. What Does Matrixport’s Portfolio Look Like? To put this recent transfer into perspective, it is helpful to look at Matrixport’s overall asset holdings. The firm currently manages a substantial portfolio, totaling $461 million in various digital assets. Here’s a quick breakdown: Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance: A significant portion of Matrixport’s assets, specifically 81.6%, is held in Bitcoin. This highlights their strong conviction in the flagship cryptocurrency. Remaining Ethereum (ETH): Even after this large transfer, Matrixport still holds a considerable amount of Ethereum. Their current ETH reserves stand at an additional 4,272 ETH, which is valued at $18.33 million. This distribution indicates a diversified, yet BTC-heavy, investment strategy, with Ethereum playing a notable supporting role in their portfolio. Decoding the Market Signals: Why This Transfer Matters Large institutional transfers, such as this Matrixport ETH deposit , are closely monitored by traders and analysts for several reasons. They can offer insights into the strategies of major players and potentially hint at upcoming market trends. Increased Liquidity: Moving a large amount of ETH to an exchange increases the available supply on that platform, potentially impacting short-term price dynamics. Rebalancing or Sales Preparation: Institutions might deposit assets to exchanges to rebalance their portfolios, prepare for over-the-counter (OTC) deals, or get ready for potential selling if they anticipate market shifts. Market Sentiment Indicator: While not a definitive predictor, such moves contribute to the overall market sentiment. A large deposit could be perceived as a bearish signal if the intent is to sell, or simply a logistical move for treasury management. Understanding these potential implications helps investors make more informed decisions. The Broader Impact on Ethereum and Binance The movement of such a substantial amount of Ethereum to Binance naturally has implications for both the asset and the exchange. For Ethereum, increased supply on exchanges could, in theory, lead to selling pressure if the funds are liquidated. However, it could also be part of a larger, more complex strategy not immediately apparent. For Binance, receiving a significant Matrixport ETH deposit reinforces its position as a primary liquidity hub for institutional and retail traders alike. Exchanges thrive on liquidity, and such large inflows demonstrate continued confidence from major crypto service providers in their platforms. The recent Matrixport ETH deposit to Binance serves as a powerful reminder of the continuous, dynamic activity within the institutional cryptocurrency space. These large-scale movements are not just isolated transactions; they are critical data points that provide valuable insights into market liquidity, institutional strategies, and the broader health of the digital asset ecosystem. As the crypto market matures, tracking such transfers becomes increasingly vital for understanding the forces at play. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Matrixport? Matrixport is a leading cryptocurrency financial services platform. It offers a range of services including trading, lending, structured products, and asset management solutions for institutional and retail clients. Why did Matrixport deposit ETH to Binance? While the exact reason is not publicly disclosed, common motivations for such large institutional deposits include preparing for potential sales, rebalancing portfolio assets, managing liquidity, or facilitating specific trading strategies on the exchange. How does a large ETH deposit impact the market? A large deposit of Ethereum to an exchange can increase the available supply, which might lead to increased selling pressure in the short term. It can also be seen as an indicator of institutional sentiment, with market participants watching for subsequent trading activity. Does Matrixport hold other cryptocurrencies? Yes, Matrixport holds a diverse portfolio of digital assets. Their holdings are predominantly in Bitcoin (BTC), accounting for over 81% of their total assets, alongside their remaining Ethereum (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies. Is this Matrixport ETH deposit a bearish sign for Ethereum? Not necessarily. While a large deposit could precede selling, it could also be part of a more complex strategy, such as preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, moving funds for staking, or simply internal treasury management.

KODA has become the first virtual asset service provider (VASP) in the nation to receive the coveted KODA venture company certification from the Ministry of SMEs and Startups. This pivotal moment signals a major shift in how blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses are recognized and supported within the country’s regulatory framework. What Does KODA’s Venture Company Certification Truly Mean? For years, virtual asset service providers in South Korea faced an uphill battle when seeking venture company status. Historically, many VASPs were denied or even had their certifications revoked, primarily due to their registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). This created a unique challenge for legitimate crypto businesses looking to expand and innovate within the traditional startup ecosystem. Regulatory Hurdle: Previously, the very act of being a regulated VASP was a barrier to venture status. Policy Evolution: A recent, crucial policy change has reshaped this landscape. This new policy now explicitly makes blockchain-based crypto asset trading and brokerage businesses eligible for the certification. KODA’s approval under these updated rules isn’t just a win for the company; it represents a broader acceptance and integration of digital asset businesses into South Korea’s innovation-driven economy. The Journey to KODA Venture Company Certification: A Regulatory Shift The path to achieving KODA venture company certification wasn’t straightforward for the industry. The initial reluctance to grant such status stemmed from regulatory caution surrounding the nascent and often volatile cryptocurrency market. The government aimed to prevent potential misuse or instability, leading to strict interpretations of existing venture company eligibility criteria. However, as the blockchain industry matured and more robust regulatory frameworks for VASPs were established, the need for a more progressive approach became evident. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups, recognizing the innovative potential of these firms, initiated a review of its policies. This led to the landmark decision to include blockchain-based crypto asset services in the eligibility criteria. KODA, a joint venture between Hashed and KB Kookmin Bank, stands out as a leader in digital asset custody. Its strong backing and commitment to regulatory compliance likely played a significant role in its successful application, setting a precedent for other VASPs. Why is This KODA Venture Company Certification a Game-Changer? The attainment of KODA venture company certification offers a multitude of benefits, not only for KODA itself but for the entire South Korean digital asset sector. Venture company status often comes with various government incentives, which can include: Tax Benefits: Reduced corporate taxes and other fiscal advantages. Funding Opportunities: Easier access to government grants, subsidies, and preferred lending rates. Talent Attraction: Enhanced credibility and attractiveness to skilled professionals. Increased Investor Confidence: A stamp of approval that can draw more private investment. Moreover, this certification provides legitimacy and recognition to the virtual asset industry as a whole. It signifies that digital asset businesses are now seen as genuine contributors to technological innovation and economic growth, rather than just speculative entities. Looking Ahead: The Future Impact of KODA Venture Company Certification What does this mean for the broader landscape of virtual asset service providers in South Korea? KODA’s achievement paves the way for other eligible VASPs to pursue similar certifications. This could foster a more competitive and innovative environment, encouraging more companies to adhere to high standards of operation and compliance. The policy change reflects a growing understanding and acceptance of blockchain technology’s role in the future economy. It suggests a progressive regulatory stance that seeks to balance innovation with necessary oversight. As more VASPs potentially gain this status, it could lead to a surge in investment, job creation, and the development of new, cutting-edge digital asset services. This move positions South Korea as a more welcoming jurisdiction for blockchain innovation, potentially attracting international attention and investment in its burgeoning crypto sector. The ripple effect of KODA’s pioneering KODA venture company certification is likely to be felt for years to come. KODA’s historic achievement of becoming the first South Korean VASP to secure venture company certification is more than just a corporate success story. It represents a significant policy evolution, validating the digital asset industry’s role in the national economy. This milestone not only empowers KODA with new opportunities but also sets a crucial precedent, fostering a more inclusive and innovative environment for blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses across South Korea. It’s a clear signal that the future of finance is increasingly intertwined with digital assets, recognized and supported at the highest levels. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is KODA? KODA, or Korea Digital Asset, is a digital asset custody firm jointly established by prominent entities Hashed and KB Kookmin Bank. It provides secure storage and management services for digital assets. 2. What is a VASP? VASP stands for Virtual Asset Service Provider. It refers to any business that conducts activities involving virtual assets for or on behalf of another natural or legal person, such as exchanges, custodians, and transfer services. 3.

Historically, VASPs were often denied due to regulatory complexities. This marks a major policy shift, recognizing digital asset businesses as legitimate innovators and opening doors to government incentives and greater industry legitimacy. 4.

These investment vehicles, which allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the digital asset, have shown a renewed surge of interest. This latest development provides a fascinating glimpse into current market sentiment and the evolving landscape of digital asset adoption. What’s Driving the Recent Inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Recently, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a notable net inflow of $23.28 million. This marks the second consecutive day of positive flows, signaling a potential shift in investor confidence. Such movements are closely watched by market participants as they often indicate broader trends in institutional and retail interest. The lion’s share of this positive movement came from BlackRock’s IBIT, which alone attracted a substantial $169.53 million. This impressive performance by IBIT highlights its growing prominence in the market. However, it wasn’t a universal win across all offerings: Fidelity’s FBTC experienced net outflows of $55.81 million. Bitwise’s BITB saw $18.15 million exit. Ark Invest’s ARKB recorded significant outflows of $72.29 million. Interestingly, other ETFs in the sector reported no net change in flows, suggesting a concentrated movement towards specific products rather than a broad market rally. This divergence in performance among different U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs prompts a closer look at investor preferences and underlying strategies. Navigating the Competitive Landscape of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs The competitive nature of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs market is becoming increasingly apparent. While BlackRock’s IBIT continues to demonstrate strong leadership, the outflows from other prominent funds like Fidelity and Ark Invest indicate that investors are being selective. Several factors could contribute to this selectivity: Brand Recognition and Trust: Established financial institutions often inspire greater confidence. Fee Structures: Minor differences in management fees can influence large capital allocations. Marketing and Outreach: Effective communication about the ETF’s benefits can attract more capital. Market Sentiment: Broader market trends and news cycles can temporarily sway investor decisions. These dynamics underscore the importance of ongoing due diligence for both ETF providers and potential investors. Understanding why certain funds attract capital while others see outflows is crucial for assessing the health and direction of the spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. What’s Next for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Investors? The consistent, albeit sometimes uneven, flow of capital into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs suggests a maturing market. For investors, these trends offer valuable insights. While a single day’s inflow doesn’t dictate long-term performance, consecutive positive days can indicate building momentum. It’s essential to consider: Long-Term Trends: Look beyond daily fluctuations to identify sustained interest. Diversification: Consider how these ETFs fit into a broader investment portfolio. Regulatory Environment: Changes in regulations can significantly impact the market. The ability of BlackRock’s IBIT to consistently attract significant inflows, even when competitors face outflows, highlights its strong position. This could be due to its competitive offerings, robust marketing, or simply the sheer scale of BlackRock’s institutional reach. As the market for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continues to evolve, we anticipate more detailed analyses of these flow patterns to emerge. In conclusion, the recent $23.2 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , predominantly led by BlackRock’s IBIT, paints a picture of selective yet persistent investor interest. While some funds experienced outflows, the overall positive trend for two consecutive days indicates a growing, albeit competitive, landscape for Bitcoin investment products. Keeping an eye on these flow dynamics will be key to understanding the future trajectory of digital asset adoption in traditional finance.

It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a regulated investment vehicle without needing to buy and store Bitcoin themselves. Q2: Why is BlackRock’s IBIT seeing such strong inflows? BlackRock’s IBIT has seen strong inflows due to several factors, including BlackRock’s significant institutional presence, competitive fee structures, effective marketing, and potentially strong investor confidence in the firm’s overall financial management capabilities. Q3: Do all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs perform similarly? No, as seen in the recent data, not all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs perform similarly. They can experience varying inflows and outflows based on factors like brand reputation, fees, liquidity, and investor preferences, leading to diverse performance outcomes. Q4: What do net inflows and outflows signify for Bitcoin ETFs? Net inflows generally indicate increasing investor interest and demand for the ETF, suggesting a positive sentiment towards Bitcoin.

Analysts point to buybacks and Binance’s USDe listing as catalysts for Ethena’s bullish momentum. Targets range from $1.25 to $5.00 if ENA holds above $0.68 and momentum continues. ENA Shows Strong Weekly Performance Ethena (ENA) has posted a sharp rise in the past week, gaining over 20%. The token is now priced at $0.84, with a 24-hour trading volume of $1.44 billion. Daily gains stand at 9%. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa said the asset shows strong momentum, noting that while profit-taking may be considered near current levels, the mid-term trend remains positive. “I still am holding my position and it’s probably ok to take some profit around here. With that said, I do think that this trades higher in the mid term,” he said. Chart data shows ENA testing resistance near $0.85, which aligns with the 0 Fibonacci level. This has become an important short-term barrier , where some selling activity could appear. Support is currently seen around $0.70 (0.236 Fib), with deeper levels at $0.61 and $0.53. These levels could act as potential areas for buyers if the market retraces. $ENA : Great coin, everyone shilling it and it’s still going higher. announcement after announcement, beauty.

This suggests that demand is still present, even as ENA approaches near-term resistance. Analysts Eye Higher Targets Rand pointed to buyback programs as a key factor in recent price strength, writing, “No chill for $ENA, the buybacks program on full effect. Triggered the bullish breakout on the local downtrend, wants new ATH.” The weekly chart also reflects a bullish structure, with ENA holding above the support range of $0.48–$0.55, which flipped from resistance into support earlier this year. Finish echoed this sentiment, stating, “Everything under $1.1 is cheap, it’s time we set a new ATH.” Meanwhile, the comment comes as Binance recently listed USDe, with total value locked (TVL) surpassing $13 billion, boosting sentiment around the Ethena ecosystem. The next major resistance levels are at $1.32 and $1.52, both marking previous swing highs. If these are broken, ENA could enter price discovery. Long-Term Outlook Crypto Patel noted that ENA is already up 270% from his initial entry, but still has room to grow. “$ENA is still up 270% from our first entry but I believe it still has room to run, $5 potential on the horizon,” he stated. Patel’s chart points to multiple upside targets: $1.25, $2.60, $4.00, and $5.00+. As long as ENA holds above $0.68, the structure suggests continuation toward higher levels. The pattern of higher lows and higher highs after long consolidation phases supports the bullish case. Overall, ENA remains in a strong uptrend, with analysts identifying key resistance points ahead and projecting higher price ranges if momentum continues.

After a challenging period, US spot ETH ETFs have experienced a significant turnaround, recording a substantial net inflow that signals renewed investor confidence. This shift marks a crucial moment for Ethereum’s presence in traditional finance. What’s Behind the Remarkable Inflow for US Spot ETH ETFs? On September 9, a remarkable $44.09 million (equivalent to 61.2 billion won) flowed into US spot ETH ETFs . This positive movement effectively broke a six-day streak of net outflows, according to data from TraderT. It’s a clear indicator that institutional interest in Ethereum-backed products is far from waning, and perhaps, even strengthening. Interestingly, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) was the sole contributor to this impressive inflow. The other existing ETH ETFs did not report any net changes during this period. This highlights BlackRock’s significant influence and the trust investors place in their offerings, often seen as a bellwether for broader market sentiment. This concentrated inflow into a single ETF product suggests a strategic move by certain investors, possibly indicating a belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its growing utility within the digital economy. The breaking of the outflow streak is a psychological boost for the market, suggesting that the selling pressure might be easing. Why Do These Inflows Matter for Ethereum and the Broader Market? The influx of capital into US spot ETH ETFs carries significant weight for several reasons. Firstly, it demonstrates increasing institutional acceptance and demand for exposure to Ethereum. As more traditional financial players gain access to crypto assets through regulated products like ETFs, it legitimizes the space further. Moreover, these inflows can positively impact Ethereum’s price dynamics. Increased demand from large institutional investors can create upward price pressure, contributing to market stability and growth. It also signals a potential shift in narrative, moving away from short-term volatility concerns towards long-term investment strategies. Consider these key implications: Enhanced Liquidity: More capital flowing in means better liquidity for the ETF market, making it easier for large investors to enter and exit positions without significant price impact. Market Validation: The consistent interest, especially after a period of outflows, validates Ethereum as a serious asset class for diversified portfolios. Future Growth: Continued inflows could pave the way for more innovative financial products built around Ethereum, expanding its reach even further. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Challenges for US Spot ETH ETFs While the recent inflow is certainly a cause for optimism, the journey for US spot ETH ETFs is still evolving. The market remains dynamic, with various factors influencing investor behavior. Understanding both the opportunities and potential challenges is crucial for a comprehensive perspective. Opportunities Ahead: Broader Adoption: As more financial advisors become comfortable with crypto ETFs, they can recommend these products to a wider client base, driving further adoption. Regulatory Clarity: Continued regulatory progress in the U.S. could foster greater confidence and encourage more institutions to participate. Product Innovation: The success of spot ETH ETFs might lead to the development of other Ethereum-based investment vehicles. Potential Challenges: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and ETH ETFs are not immune to price fluctuations. Economic Headwinds: Broader economic conditions, such as inflation or interest rate changes, can influence investor appetite for risk assets like crypto. Competition: The emergence of new crypto investment products or alternative ways to gain ETH exposure could create competition. This latest inflow serves as a powerful reminder of the resilience and growing appeal of Ethereum within the institutional investment landscape. It underscores a crucial moment where confidence appears to be returning, suggesting a potentially brighter outlook for these innovative financial products. The recent $44.1 million net inflow into US spot ETH ETFs is a significant positive development, effectively ending a streak of outflows and highlighting renewed institutional interest, primarily driven by BlackRock. This moment signals a potential turning point, reinforcing Ethereum’s position as a vital asset in the evolving digital economy and encouraging a more optimistic outlook for its market trajectory.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Withdrawal Wave Points To Another Major Leg Up In The Bull Cycle, Analyst Says However, this surge was quickly followed by a decline in the metric, as the BTC: Exchange Whale Ratio tumbled to 0.28, on September 8. However, the price remained stable around $112,500, suggesting that whale movements were short-lived and did not lead to a sell-off in BTC. The CryptoQuant analyst remarked that the fall in whale pressure toward the end of the period is a positive short-term signal. In essence, the likelihood of a sharp price correction driven by whale sell-offs on Binance is now significantly reduced. Arab Chain added: The frequent whale fluctuations in late August and early September highlight that major players are still moving large volumes – meaning risks remain, and the market could be caught off guard by a sudden move if substantial exchange inflows are converted into market orders. However, the analyst cautioned that the relationship is not always absolute. Although the rise in the metric has often been associated with a fall in the price of BTC, not every spike has led to a clear decline in price. As seen in the above chart, there have been instances of whale activity surging beyond 0.5 for multiple days – accompanied by positive net inflows to exchanges. Arab Chain noted that such dynamics may lead to a failure to maintain the $112,000 level, and possibly trigger a drop to $108,000. Historical data for September shows that the beginning of the month is typically quiet in terms of whale pressure on Binance, except for the occasional quick jump. While this offers a safer environment for a gradual rise, it also gives whales a chance to exert pressure on the market, especially if the overall demand is weak. Is BTC Yet To Hit Its Peak? While BTC is currently trading roughly 10% below its latest all-time high (ATH) of $124,128, some crypto experts opine that the flagship cryptocurrency is yet to hit its peak for this market cycle.

The transaction would see CoinShares shift from Stockholm to Wall Street, signaling a major step in its bid for global dominance. Ranked as the fourth-largest digital asset exchange-traded product (ETP) manager globally, behind BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, CoinShares currently holds a commanding 34% market share in Europe. Over the past two years, its assets under management have tripled, fueled by strong inflows and the rapid expansion of its product lineup, which has grown from just four offerings in 2021 to 32 across multiple platforms. A Unique Approach Into the U.S. Market CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti described the move as “far more than a venue change,” framing the Nasdaq listing as a gateway to global leadership. He highlighted the U.S. as the hub of digital asset innovation, where institutional demand and improving regulatory clarity are creating fertile ground for expansion. CoinShares operates with industry-leading margins, 76% adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2025, and has built a diversified business model based on recurring fee revenues supplemented by trading activities. With its proven European strategy, the company now seeks to capture U.S. investors by introducing a broader suite of digital asset products, including tokenized real-world assets. What the CoinShares Nasdaq Debut Means for Crypto The $1.2 billion deal, priced at a discount compared to peer valuations, includes a $50 million institutional anchor investment. Both company boards have approved the merger, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. Upon completion, the combined entity will trade under Odysseus Holdings Limited . The timing of CoinShares’ U.S. expansion coincides with a wave of favorable regulatory developments, including the rollback of restrictive SEC policies and the drafting of new legislation aimed at fostering a clearer market structure for crypto. If successful, CoinShares’ Nasdaq debut could not only strengthen its foothold in the world’s largest asset management market but also set a precedent for how European crypto firms scale globally.

However, the prices of the leading cryptocurrencies are now bouncing back and could be set to rally higher in the near term. Bitcoin dropped to the $110k region but is now trading above $111,300, while Ether has reclaimed its value above $4,300. Ripple’s XRP also dropped below $3 and could be gearing up for another rally above that psychological level. Ripple and Spain’s BBVA extend their partnership XRP is gearing up to surge above $3 once again, and one of the major catalysts could be Ripple’s partnership with the Spanish banking giant BBVA. Ripple announced on Tuesday that it is expanding its partnership with BBVA to provide its digital asset custody technology to the Spanish bank. With this arrangement, BBVA will leverage Ripple Custody, Ripple’s institutional-grade digital asset self-custody technology to deliver a scalable and secure custody service for tokenized assets, including crypto-assets. Cassie Craddock, Managing Director, Europe, at Ripple, stated that this partnership is possible thanks to the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA). Craddock added that MiCA allows banks in the EU to launch the digital asset offerings that their customers are asking for. $3.66 high remains a target for XRP The XRP/USD 4-hour chart remains bullish and efficient despite yesterday’s flash dump. XRP is now trading at $2.96 and could reclaim the $3 psychological mark over the next few hours. The momentum indicators are also bullish, with the RSI of 57 showing that buyers are regaining control of the XRP market following weeks of volatile price action. The MACD lines are also within the bullish zone. XRP established a low at $2.93 on Tuesday afternoon following the Middle East crisis. The low is now serving as an Inducement Liquidity (ILQ) on the 4H chart, allowing XRP to prepare for another leg up. If the bullish trend continues, XRP could surpass Tuesday’s high of $3.035 before heading to the major resistance level at $3.3. The recent high of $3.66 remains XRP’s medium-term target, as hitting it could allow the cryptocurrency to set a new all-time high above $4.0. Analysts are still optimistic about XRP hitting the $6 mark over the next few weeks or months. While the ILQ at $2.93 currently holds, it is not a strong support, and XRP could dip lower if the broader market undergoes a correction. The support level at $2.70 formed earlier this month should hold in case the market decides to extend its correction. Regardless, the XRP/USD chart is bullish at the moment, and buyers could push XRP’s price higher over the next few hours and days.

Up 11% in the last seven days, DOGE has outperformed other major cryptocurrencies and could rally higher in the near term. DOJE ETF to debut on Thursday DOGE was rallying on Tuesday, in line with the broader cryptocurrency market, before abruptly dumping to the $0.233 level. The flash dump occurred following another crisis in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Qatar. The dump saw Bitcoin briefly drop to the $110k level, with other major cryptocurrencies also experiencing a dip. However, DOGE is slowly recovering and could be gearing up for a breakout ahead of a crucial day for the memecoin community in the United States. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revealed on Tuesday that the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF ($DOJE) is expected to debut in U.S. markets on Thursday, under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

DOGE could top $0.25 as market momentum remains bullish The DOGE/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient as the coin has been rallying in recent days. The momentum indicators have also switched bullish, suggesting that buyers are currently in control of the market. The MACD lines are deep within the bullish territory, while the RSI of 66 shows that DOGE could soon enter the overbought region if the current market trend persists. After sweeping the low at $0.233 following Israel’s strike in Qatar, DOGE has resumed its upward movement and is now trading at $0.24065. If the bullish trend continues, DOGE could surge past the $0.25 mark for the first time since August 13. An extended bullish run would allow DOGE to hit the $0.30 mark for the first time this year. However, it would need the support of the broader crypto market to surpass the July high of $0.288. On the flip side, DOGE could undergo a correction following days of bullish movements. If that happens, DOGE could retest the TLQ at $0.233. Failure to defend this level could see DOGE drop to the $0.210 support region in the near term.

This initiative highlights China’s proactive approach to understanding and regulating the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space. Why is China Diving Deep into Stablecoin Policy? The NSFC has officially started accepting research proposals specifically focused on stablecoins and their associated cross-border monitoring systems. This isn’t just a casual inquiry; the foundation plans to provide substantial grants, ranging from 200,000 to 300,000 yuan (approximately $27,400 to $41,100), to successful projects. According to the NSFC, proposals must include actionable stablecoin policy suggestions. These suggestions are crucial for China to effectively address the inherent risks posed by stablecoins and to contribute meaningfully to the broader framework of digital financial governance. It’s a clear signal that China is not just observing but actively seeking to define its role in this new financial frontier. Understanding the Risks and Rewards of Stablecoins Stablecoins, by design, aim to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency or other assets. While they offer benefits like efficient cross-border payments and increased liquidity in the crypto market, they also present unique challenges for regulators worldwide. Potential Risks: These include concerns over financial stability, money laundering, consumer protection, and the potential for regulatory arbitrage if not properly monitored. Opportunities: On the other hand, a well-regulated stablecoin policy could foster innovation, enhance payment systems, and provide a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy. China’s research initiative is a testament to its understanding of this dual nature. By funding these studies, the nation is preparing to navigate the complexities and harness the potential of stablecoins in a controlled manner. What Does This Mean for Global Digital Finance? China has been a frontrunner in central bank digital currency (CBDC) development with its digital yuan (e-CNY). The expansion into stablecoin policy research suggests a more comprehensive strategy for digital assets. This research could have significant international implications: It may influence global regulatory standards for stablecoins, especially concerning cross-border transactions. Other nations might look to China’s findings as they develop their own digital asset frameworks. It reinforces China’s ambition to play a leading role in shaping the future of digital financial governance, not just domestically but on the world stage. The insights generated from these studies could provide a blueprint for how a major economy integrates stablecoins into its financial system while mitigating systemic risks. Charting the Future: China’s Vision for Digital Governance The NSFC’s funding for stablecoin policy research underscores China’s commitment to robust digital financial governance. This isn’t merely about control; it’s about establishing a resilient and secure digital economy that can withstand future challenges. The proactive engagement in academic research on such a critical topic indicates a long-term vision. It suggests that China aims to: Develop sophisticated monitoring systems for digital assets. Craft innovative regulatory solutions for a rapidly evolving market. Position itself as a thought leader in the global discourse on digital currency and financial technology. This strategic move is set to generate invaluable insights that will inform China’s future digital asset regulations and potentially influence global standards for years to come. The decision by China’s largest research fund to finance extensive stablecoin policy studies marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of global digital finance. By focusing on both the risks and the opportunities, China is actively shaping its approach to stablecoins, aiming to establish a robust framework for digital financial governance. This initiative not only highlights the nation’s strategic foresight but also signals its intent to be a key player in defining the future of digital currencies worldwide.

Over the past 24 hours, the crypto landscape witnessed significant turbulence, particularly in the realm of crypto perpetual futures liquidations . These events are not just numbers; they represent substantial shifts in market sentiment and real financial consequences for traders. What Are Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations? Before diving into the recent figures, let’s quickly clarify what crypto perpetual futures liquidations entail. In essence, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin (collateral) falls below a certain threshold, often due to adverse price movements. Perpetual futures contracts are unique because they don’t have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as they maintain sufficient margin. When the market moves against a highly leveraged position, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses for both the trader and the platform. This forced closure is what we call a liquidation, and it can be a painful experience for those caught on the wrong side of the trade. Recent 24-Hour Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations: A Snapshot The past day has shown a vivid picture of this market mechanism in action. Here’s a breakdown of the significant crypto perpetual futures liquidations across major assets: Bitcoin (BTC): A staggering $46.48 million in BTC positions were liquidated. A substantial 71.07% of these liquidations came from long positions, indicating a sharp downward movement that caught bullish traders off guard. Ethereum (ETH): Similarly, Ethereum saw significant activity with $40.55 million in liquidations. Long positions accounted for 67.28% of this total, mirroring the sentiment observed in Bitcoin and suggesting a broader market correction. MYX: Interestingly, MYX experienced $31.30 million in liquidations, but with a crucial difference: 71.8% of these were from short positions. This indicates a sharp upward price movement that liquidated traders betting on a decline for MYX. These figures underscore the inherent volatility of the crypto market and the amplified risks associated with leveraged trading. While BTC and ETH traders primarily suffered from unexpected price drops, MYX traders faced losses due to a sudden rally. Why Do These Liquidations Happen? Understanding Market Dynamics Crypto perpetual futures liquidations are a direct consequence of several interconnected factors: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notorious for their rapid price swings. Even small percentage changes can have a magnified effect on leveraged positions. High Leverage: Many traders use high leverage (e.g., 10x, 50x, or even 100x) to amplify potential profits. While this can be lucrative, it also means a small adverse price movement can quickly deplete margin and trigger liquidation. Unexpected News or Events: Geopolitical events, regulatory announcements, major hacks, or even influential tweets can trigger sudden market shifts, leading to cascades of liquidations. Liquidation Cascades: Sometimes, one wave of liquidations can trigger another. As positions are closed, market sell orders (for long liquidations) or buy orders (for short liquidations) can add to the price pressure, leading to further liquidations in a domino effect. Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for anyone participating in the futures market. The allure of high returns must always be balanced against the significant risks involved. Navigating the Risks: Actionable Insights for Traders While crypto perpetual futures liquidations are a constant feature of the market, traders can adopt strategies to mitigate their exposure: Prudent Leverage: Avoid excessive leverage. Using lower leverage significantly increases the buffer against adverse price movements. Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close a position if it reaches a predetermined loss level. This helps cap potential losses and prevents total liquidation. Risk Management: Allocate only a small percentage of your total portfolio to highly leveraged trades. Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Market Analysis: Stay informed about market trends, news, and technical indicators. A deeper understanding can help anticipate potential shifts. Diversification: While not directly preventing liquidation on a single trade, diversifying your overall crypto portfolio can help manage broader market risk. These insights are not guarantees against losses, but they provide a framework for more responsible and sustainable trading practices in the volatile futures market. Conclusion: The Ever-Present Reality of Crypto Futures Trading The recent 24-hour figures for crypto perpetual futures liquidations serve as a stark reminder of the high stakes involved in leveraged cryptocurrency trading. Whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins, the market’s capacity for sudden, impactful movements remains ever-present. For both seasoned traders and newcomers, understanding the mechanisms behind liquidations, the factors that drive them, and implementing robust risk management strategies are paramount to navigating this exciting yet challenging financial frontier. Always trade with caution and informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Liquidations Q1: What exactly is a crypto perpetual future? A: A crypto perpetual future is a type of derivatives contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, they can be held indefinitely, as long as margin requirements are met. Q2: Why do most liquidations often come from long positions? A: When a significant portion of liquidations comes from long positions, it indicates a sharp downward price movement. Traders who bet on prices going up (long positions) are caught off guard, and their leveraged positions are closed out as the market drops. Q3: Can liquidations impact the overall market price? A: Yes, liquidations can certainly impact market prices. When large leveraged positions are liquidated, exchanges often execute market orders to close them. For long liquidations, this means selling the underlying asset, which can add downward pressure on prices, potentially triggering further liquidations in a cascade effect. Q4: How can I avoid being liquidated in crypto futures trading? A: To avoid liquidation, traders should use prudent leverage, always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, practice strong risk management by not over-allocating capital, and stay informed about market conditions. Maintaining sufficient margin is also key. Q5: Is perpetual futures trading suitable for beginners? A: Perpetual futures trading, especially with leverage, carries significant risk and is generally not recommended for beginners. It requires a deep understanding of market dynamics, risk management, and technical analysis. It’s advisable for newcomers to start with spot trading and thoroughly educate themselves before venturing into derivatives.

This move marks an important transition for the project and its holders, ensuring a smooth process facilitated by a major industry player. What Does the OMNI to NOM Token Swap Entail? This rebranding and token swap will bring notable changes for users. Binance will manage the entire process, making it straightforward for those holding OMNI tokens on the platform. The transition involves specific dates for delisting old pairs and listing new ones, along with a clear conversion rate. Here are the key details you need to know: Delisting of OMNI Spot Trading Pairs: All existing OMNI spot trading pairs will be delisted by Binance on September 29 at 3:00 a.m. UTC . It’s important for traders to close any open OMNI positions before this time. Launch of NOM Spot Trading Pairs: Trading for the new NOM spot pairs is scheduled to commence shortly after, on October 1 at 8:00 a.m. UTC . This provides a brief window between the delisting and the new listing. Conversion Ratio: OMNI tokens will be swapped for NOM at a fixed ratio of 1 OMNI to 75 NOM . This generous conversion rate aims to facilitate the transition smoothly for existing holders. Why is the Omni Network Undergoing a Rebranding? Rebranding in the crypto space often signifies a strategic pivot, an expansion of vision, or a complete overhaul of the project’s identity and goals. While the official announcement from Binance focuses on the logistical support, the underlying reasons for the Omni Network’s transformation into Nomina (NOM) likely involve enhancing its ecosystem, refining its core offerings, or aligning with a new market strategy. Such changes are common as projects mature and adapt to the dynamic blockchain landscape. The rebranding often aims to: Better reflect the project’s updated mission and technological advancements. Improve market perception and attract a broader user base. Differentiate itself more effectively within a competitive environment. How Will This OMNI to NOM Token Swap Affect Your Holdings? For users holding OMNI tokens on Binance, the process of the OMNI to NOM token swap is designed to be seamless. Binance will handle all technical aspects of the conversion automatically. This means you generally won’t need to take specific actions to convert your tokens if they are held on the exchange. However, it is always wise to: Monitor Official Announcements: Stay updated with Binance’s official news channels for any further instructions or clarifications regarding the swap. Review Your Portfolio: After the swap date, verify that your OMNI holdings have been correctly converted to NOM in your Binance wallet. Understand the New Token: Familiarize yourself with Nomina (NOM), its utility, and any new features or developments associated with the rebranded project. Navigating the Transition: What Should Traders Expect? The period around a token swap can sometimes bring increased volatility. Traders should be mindful of the delisting and listing dates. The temporary absence of trading pairs for OMNI, followed by the introduction of NOM, could lead to price discovery phases for the new token. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed trading decisions during this transition. The support from Binance is a significant endorsement, offering reliability and accessibility for the Nomina project. This facilitates a smoother transition for a large number of users, bolstering confidence in the new token. The OMNI to NOM token swap represents not just a name change, but a new chapter for the project, potentially opening up new opportunities and functionalities within the blockchain ecosystem. In conclusion, Binance’s support for the OMNI to NOM token swap and rebranding is a critical event for the Omni Network community. Users can anticipate a well-managed transition, with clear timelines for delisting and new trading pair introductions. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, such strategic moves are essential for projects aiming to maintain relevance and foster growth.

Avalon Labs (AVL), a prominent Bitcoin on-chain financial services platform, recently made headlines with a significant AVL token burn , incinerating nearly $1.9 million worth of its native tokens. This substantial event, entirely funded by the platform’s monthly protocol revenue, has sent ripples through the market, signaling a strong commitment to value and sustainability. Understanding the Power of an AVL Token Burn What exactly does it mean when a cryptocurrency project executes an AVL token burn ? In simple terms, it involves permanently removing tokens from circulation. This action effectively reduces the total supply, similar to a company buying back its own shares to increase their value. For Avalon Labs, this recent event saw $1.88 million worth of AVL tokens permanently destroyed. This isn’t a one-off occurrence. Over the past several months, Avalon Labs has systematically reduced AVL’s total circulating supply by an impressive 37%. This consistent effort demonstrates a clear strategy to enhance the scarcity and, consequently, the potential value of the AVL token. How Does Protocol Revenue Fuel These AVL Token Burns? One of the most compelling aspects of Avalon Labs’ strategy is that these massive AVL token burns are entirely funded by the platform’s monthly protocol revenue. But how does this mechanism work? Revenue Generation: As a Bitcoin on-chain financial services platform, Avalon Labs generates revenue through various services, transactions, and fees within its ecosystem. Buyback Program: A portion of this generated revenue is then allocated to a buyback program. This means the platform actively purchases AVL tokens from the open market. Permanent Removal: Once bought back, these tokens are sent to an inaccessible wallet address, effectively removing them from circulation forever. This process ensures transparency and irreversibility. This self-sustaining model creates a direct link between the platform’s success and the value proposition for AVL token holders. It signifies a healthy, growing ecosystem that can fund its own deflationary measures. What Benefits Can We Expect from the Continuous AVL Token Burn? The consistent execution of the AVL token burn strategy brings several potential benefits for the Avalon Labs ecosystem and its community. Increased Scarcity: By reducing the total supply, each remaining AVL token theoretically becomes more valuable, assuming demand remains constant or increases. Investor Confidence: A clear, transparent, and self-funded buyback and burn program can significantly boost investor confidence, signaling long-term commitment from the development team. Deflationary Pressure: In an often inflationary crypto landscape, a deflationary mechanism like this helps counteract selling pressure and can lead to more stable or appreciating token prices over time. Ecosystem Health: The ability to fund such substantial burns from protocol revenue underscores the robustness and utility of the Avalon Labs platform itself. It shows real-world adoption and transaction volume. Navigating the Future: The Impact of Avalon Labs’ AVL Token Burn While the AVL token burn strategy presents numerous advantages, it’s also important to consider the broader market context. The success of such a strategy is always intertwined with the platform’s continued innovation, user adoption, and the overall health of the crypto market. Avalon Labs is positioning itself as a leader in Bitcoin on-chain financial services. The commitment to a transparent and revenue-funded token burn mechanism could serve as a powerful differentiator. As the platform expands its offerings and attracts more users, the sustained reduction in AVL supply could play a pivotal role in its long-term valuation. This strategic move could indeed be a blueprint for other projects seeking to create sustainable token economies. Avalon Labs’ decision to consistently execute a significant AVL token burn , entirely funded by its protocol revenue, is a bold statement. It highlights a commitment to creating a sustainable and value-driven ecosystem for its native AVL token. With 37% of the total circulating supply already removed, the platform is actively working to enhance scarcity and reward its community. This ongoing strategy positions Avalon Labs as a forward-thinking player in the Bitcoin DeFi space, dedicated to long-term growth and investor value. Frequently Asked Questions about the AVL Token Burn Here are some common questions regarding Avalon Labs’ token burning strategy: What is an AVL token burn? An AVL token burn is the process of permanently removing AVL tokens from circulation by sending them to an inaccessible wallet address. This reduces the total supply of tokens. Why does Avalon Labs burn AVL tokens? Avalon Labs burns AVL tokens to reduce their total circulating supply, aiming to increase scarcity and potentially enhance the value of the remaining tokens. It also demonstrates a commitment to the long-term health of the ecosystem. How often does Avalon Labs conduct an AVL token burn? The article mentions that Avalon Labs has burned 37% of AVL’s total circulating supply over the past several months, indicating a consistent and ongoing strategy rather than infrequent, large events. Where does the money for the AVL token burn come from? The funds for the AVL token buyback and subsequent burn come entirely from Avalon Labs’ monthly protocol revenue, which is generated through its Bitcoin on-chain financial services. What is the total amount of AVL tokens burned so far? Avalon Labs has burned approximately $1.88 million worth of AVL tokens in its most recent event, contributing to a total of 37% of AVL’s circulating supply being removed over time.

This move, involving 6.7 million ENA worth approximately $5.54 million, has naturally sparked discussions among investors and market watchers. Understanding the implications of such large transactions is key to navigating the dynamic digital asset landscape, especially for those closely following Ethena ENA . What Does Flowdesk’s Ethena ENA Deposit Mean for the Market? About six hours ago, on-chain analyst The Data Nerd highlighted Flowdesk’s transfer of 6.7 million Ethena ENA tokens to Binance. Flowdesk isn’t just any participant; they are a critical market maker for Ethena, ensuring liquidity for the project’s token. This deposit isn’t a sudden sale; these tokens were originally received from the Ethena project three weeks prior, suggesting a planned operational move rather than an immediate reaction to market conditions. Market makers play a vital role in maintaining healthy trading environments. They provide continuous buy and sell quotes, which helps to: Improve Liquidity: Making it easier for traders to buy or sell Ethena ENA without causing significant price swings. Reduce Volatility: By absorbing large orders, they help stabilize prices. Tighten Spreads: The difference between the highest bid and lowest ask price becomes smaller. This deposit to Binance, a leading global exchange, indicates Flowdesk’s intention to continue supporting the trading of Ethena ENA , potentially increasing its availability and facilitating smoother transactions for a wider audience. The Crucial Role of Market Makers in Ethena ENA’s Liquidity The relationship between Ethena and Flowdesk is symbiotic. Ethena, as a synthetic dollar protocol, benefits immensely from robust liquidity for its governance token, ENA. Flowdesk’s ongoing commitment as a market maker ensures that there’s always a counterparty for traders looking to engage with Ethena ENA . This stability is particularly important for newer or less liquid assets. When a market maker like Flowdesk deposits a large sum of tokens to an exchange, it typically signals a readiness to facilitate more trading volume. This could mean they anticipate increased demand or are preparing to manage existing trading flows more efficiently. For holders and potential investors of Ethena ENA , this is generally a positive sign, indicating sustained support for the token’s market health. However, it’s also important for investors to observe market maker activities closely. While their primary goal is to provide liquidity, large deposits can sometimes be followed by increased selling pressure if the market maker is rebalancing their inventory. In this specific case, given the tokens were received weeks ago, it suggests a strategic deployment rather than a reactive one, reinforcing confidence in Ethena ENA . Navigating the Impact of Large Ethena ENA Movements Any substantial movement of tokens, especially by key players like market makers, can capture market attention. While this particular deposit of Ethena ENA appears to be part of normal market making operations, it’s a reminder for investors to stay informed and understand the underlying mechanics. Here are some actionable insights for those following Ethena ENA : Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools used by analysts like The Data Nerd provide valuable transparency into large transactions. Understand Market Maker Dynamics: Recognize that their role is to provide liquidity, not necessarily to signal price direction. Consider Broader Market Context: Always evaluate individual token movements within the larger cryptocurrency market trends. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying on a single asset, even one with strong market maker support, carries inherent risks. This deposit by Flowdesk underscores the professional infrastructure supporting projects like Ethena. It highlights the continuous efforts behind the scenes to ensure that digital assets are tradable and accessible, which is vital for the long-term success of Ethena ENA . In conclusion, Flowdesk’s deposit of 6.7 million Ethena ENA to Binance is a testament to the ongoing operational support for the token’s market. As a crucial market maker, Flowdesk’s actions reinforce liquidity and trading efficiency for ENA, providing a smoother experience for participants. While large transactions always warrant attention, this move appears to be a standard part of maintaining a healthy trading environment for Ethena ENA , reflecting strategic planning rather than immediate market reaction. It’s a powerful reminder of the sophisticated mechanisms that underpin the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethena ENA? A1: Ethena ENA is the governance token for Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. Ethena aims to provide a crypto-native, censorship-resistant, and scalable stablecoin solution. Q2: Who is Flowdesk and what is their role? A2: Flowdesk is a cryptocurrency market maker and ETF liquidity provider. Their role is to facilitate trading by providing liquidity for various digital assets, including Ethena ENA , ensuring smooth transactions and price stability.

This move likely aims to increase liquidity for Ethena ENA on the exchange, preparing for potential trading volume or rebalancing their inventory to support efficient trading. Q4: Does this deposit indicate ENA’s price will go up or down? A4: Not directly. Market maker deposits primarily aim to ensure liquidity and efficient trading, not to signal immediate price direction. While increased liquidity can attract more traders, price movements depend on a multitude of factors, including overall market sentiment and demand for Ethena ENA . Q5: How can I monitor such large token movements?

For South Korea, the potential of South Korean stablecoins is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible opportunity, as highlighted by a leading fintech expert. What Makes South Korean Stablecoins a Viable Option? According to Kim Hyoung-joong, president of the Korea Fintech Society, domestically issued stablecoins possess significant viability. Speaking at the Onchain Symposium in Seoul, Kim emphasized that these digital assets have successfully navigated critical hurdles that once questioned their legitimacy. Overcoming Volatility: Traditional cryptocurrencies are known for their price swings. However, stablecoins mitigate this by maintaining a guaranteed 1:1 peg, often backed by 100% fiat reserves. Enhanced Legal Frameworks: Institutional measures are increasingly providing the legal protections necessary for stablecoins to operate securely and reliably. Intrinsic Value Concerns Addressed: While initial skepticism questioned their intrinsic value, robust backing and regulatory oversight now lend them credibility. Despite lingering negative perceptions, the proof-of-concept demonstrated by global players like Tether and Circle is undeniable. These assets are already gaining significant traction, particularly for their transaction efficiency in regions like South America, and are seeing renewed interest due to policy shifts in North America. Why is a Unified Approach Crucial for South Korean Stablecoins ? To truly secure a competitive edge in the global market, a unified national strategy for South Korean stablecoins is essential. Kim Hyoung-joong stressed that the discussion must now move beyond merely considering issuance to actively building the foundational distribution infrastructure. This shift in focus is critical for several reasons: Global Competitiveness: A fragmented approach could hinder South Korea’s ability to compete with other nations and regions that are rapidly developing their stablecoin ecosystems. Market Adoption: Robust infrastructure ensures that stablecoins can be easily integrated into daily transactions, fostering wider adoption among businesses and consumers. Innovation Hub: By prioritizing infrastructure, South Korea can position itself as a leader in stablecoin innovation, attracting talent and investment. The Onchain Symposium, co-organized by Tokenpost, Coinreaders, Tether, and Crypto.com, served as a platform to underscore these urgent needs, highlighting the collaborative effort required to propel the domestic stablecoin market forward. What’s Next for South Korean Stablecoins and the Digital Economy? The message from the Korea Fintech Society is clear: the time for debate on the viability of South Korean stablecoins is over. The focus must now be on tangible action. Building a robust distribution infrastructure means: Developing user-friendly platforms: Making it easy for individuals and businesses to use stablecoins for payments, remittances, and other financial services. Ensuring regulatory clarity: Providing a stable and predictable legal environment that encourages innovation while protecting users. Fostering industry collaboration: Bringing together financial institutions, tech companies, and regulators to create a cohesive ecosystem. Embracing this proactive approach will not only unlock new economic opportunities but also cement South Korea’s position as a forward-thinking leader in the global digital asset space. The journey from concept to widespread adoption requires vision, collaboration, and a steadfast commitment to building the future of finance. In conclusion, the path forward for South Korean stablecoins is bright, provided there is a concerted effort to establish a strong, unified infrastructure. As Kim Hyoung-joong rightly points out, these assets have proven their resilience and utility. By focusing on practical implementation and distribution, South Korea can capitalize on this promising technology, enhancing transaction efficiency and securing a significant stake in the evolving global digital economy. The potential for growth and innovation is immense, making this a pivotal moment for the nation’s financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility. It typically achieves this by being pegged to a “stable” asset, such as a fiat currency (like the US dollar), a commodity (like gold), or another cryptocurrency, often maintaining a 1:1 ratio through reserves. Q2: Why are South Korean stablecoins considered viable by experts? According to Kim Hyoung-joong, president of the Korea Fintech Society, South Korean stablecoins have overcome key limitations like price volatility and lack of legal protection through institutional measures such as 100% fiat reserves and a guaranteed 1:1 peg, proving their reliability and potential for widespread use. Q3: What challenges have stablecoins faced, and how are they being addressed? Stablecoins initially faced skepticism regarding intrinsic value, price volatility, and absent legal protections. These are being addressed through robust institutional measures like full reserve backing, regulatory oversight, and proven operational models by major players like Tether and Circle, which demonstrate their efficiency and security. Q4: Why is building distribution infrastructure crucial for South Korean stablecoins? Building robust distribution infrastructure is crucial because it moves the focus beyond just issuance to practical implementation. It ensures that South Korean stablecoins can be easily used for transactions, fosters wider market adoption, enhances global competitiveness, and positions South Korea as an innovation hub in the digital asset space. Q5: Who is Kim Hyoung-joong? Kim Hyoung-joong is the president of the Korea Fintech Society, a prominent organization focused on financial technology. He is a recognized expert in the field and frequently speaks on the future of digital finance, including the potential and strategic direction for stablecoins in South Korea.

In response to growing investor interest in digital assets, this new product suite is set to debut on November 10. This marks a significant development for the US crypto market under the new regulatory regime envisioned by President Donald Trump, who aims to make America the “crypto capital of the world.” Cboe’s Shift To Meet Market Demand According to a press release issued on Tuesday, these continuous futures will provide a more “streamlined and efficient way” for traders to engage with cryptocurrencies, execute trading strategies, and manage risk. Unlike traditional futures contracts, which often necessitate periodic rolling, Cboe’s continuous futures will be designed as single, long-dated contracts with a ten-year expiration. The contracts will be cash-settled and linked to real-time spot market prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum, incorporating daily cash adjustments, utilizing a funding rate methodology, ensuring that the pricing remains closely aligned with the underlying assets. At the recent HOOD Summit in Las Vegas, Catherine Clay, Cboe’s Global Head of Derivatives, emphasized the significance of this potential launch. She noted that perpetual-style futures have seen robust adoption in offshore markets, and Cboe aims to replicate that success within the US regulatory framework. Under Trump’s second administration in the White House, regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have united to provide a more eased stance toward crypto. The agencies have dropped crypto enforcement cases against exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Uniswap that began under the leadership of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, the passage of key crypto bills in Congress and the House seems to signal a new dawn for digital assets in the US. This has prompted major institutions in the traditional finance sector to adopt cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as treasury reserve assets , being one of the most important trends that has emerged this year under the new administration. By introducing these products, Cboe expects to cater not only to institutional market participants and existing customers of its Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) but also to a growing segment of retail traders eager to access crypto derivatives. Bitcoin Slips, Ethereum Follows Suit This initiative is part of Cboe’s broader strategy to diversify and enhance its Cboe Futures Exchange product offerings. In addition to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures, the exchange aims to further expand its services with products related to equity volatility, digital assets , and global fixed income. The new continuous futures for Bitcoin and Ethereum will be cleared through Cboe Clear US, a derivatives clearing organization regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As of press time, the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, trades at $111,400, recording a 1.2% drop in the 24-hour time frame. During the same period, Ethereum has dropped 1.5%, trading at $4,292.

He anchors the call to a cluster of liquidity sitting above the $3.40 area and an improving relative-strength backdrop versus Bitcoin, Ethereum and even gold, while cautioning that the US CPI print due tomorrow could inject short-term volatility in either direction. Be aware that tomorrow there is CPI news coming from the US and it probably, most likely at this point in the market, brings with it some sort of volatility,” he said, adding that while the move “could be to the upside,” there is still “liquidity sitting below us” that could be swept before continuation. The analyst frames the recent grind higher as constructive but “choppy,” with a pattern of slightly higher lows that would invalidate quickly if one of those pivots is lost. $4.20–$4.50 Is The Target Zone As XRP Liquidity Builds XRP remains his top altcoin setup. “XRP is the base case of something that I think is looking pretty strong right now,” he said. The pair has “formed a nice bottoming pattern” and broken out, but is now “fighting against these previous swing highs.” In his view, the immediate task is a sequence of closes through successive resistance shelves—including the zone just under $3.40—after which the path to the former peak opens. “As soon as we start to get that level broken then… we could argue that all-time highs [are] back on the table,” he said, noting that from the recent local bottom XRP is “up 11%,” and that another ~10% burst through resistance “probably comes pretty quickly.” Related Reading: XRP Set to Lead Altcoin Boom With Explosive $9.69 Target, Says Analyst On higher time frames, he highlights a stacked band of resting interest overhead. “On the daily [for XRP, there is] significant liquidity above us and over the last 2–3 days more has been building in here. When we start to break that $3.40 level… this is the all-time high and we probably resume this march back towards $4.20, $4.30 and then realistically $4.50 is where all this liquidity is sitting right now.” While he characterizes that as the base case, he keeps risk balanced: “It’s not time to get 100% definite [that we’re] going to the upside… We could argue that [liquidity below] could be taken before we go higher especially if Bitcoin and ETH come down.” The cross-asset context matters for his XRP view. He sees Bitcoin at an inflection defined by structural waypoints—“a break above the $111,003 and then… $114,300… and then… above this high here about $117k”—with the daily map still showing “significant liquidity above.” Ethereum, he says, has a “dense” pocket of bids just below, but has been “losing strength against other alts,” creating a window in which ETH might wick lower to clean up liquidity while alts with stronger relative momentum hold up better. That relative momentum is where he places XRP. On XRP/ETH, he notes a sequence of “lows, highs, higher lows and higher highs,” arguing the pair is “back in an uptrend.” He draws attention to the four-hour RSI repeatedly tagging overbought during prior upside phases: “When we start to hit this four hour overbought area… momentum looks like it is pushing back to the upside… it has led to quite significant price action.” He flags 0.000071 on XRP/ETH as a confirmation pivot that would “give us more confirmation back to the upside.” A similar story appears on XRP/BTC, where he wants to see “a real good green day” to break the downtrend after a “bullish cross on the daily RSI.” Related Reading: XRP RSI Remains Bullish As Support Levels Hold, Price Eyes Break Above $3.6 He extends the relative framework beyond crypto. On XRP/gold, the analyst says the weekly structure “actually bounced pretty well off the 702 Fibonacci retracement,” with a clean back-test of prior range highs and “bullish cross” momentum. Projecting from current consolidation, he cites a potential 4.236 extension that, mechanically, implies substantial outperformance: “For a 4.236 extension from where we are now it would be about a 700% outperformance from gold… so if we just say five to six hundred percent that would be bloody nice for XRP.” He is careful to note that gold could also move, which would affect the nominal translation. Despite the urgency of the title levels, he repeatedly frames the next 24–48 hours as path-dependent. Bitcoin dominance sits at a decision point in his model; a breakdown from its “ascending wedge” would, in his view, validate the altcoin-outperformance regime he has been anticipating. “It could get very exciting very soon,” he said. “Or we could just have a few more days of chop.” Still, the directional bias is clear: “I think that I’ve said that XRP I think is leading the market. I still believe that.” His bottom line for XRP is conditional but pointed: reclaim and hold above ~$3.40, convert that resistance into support, and the liquidity magnets at ~$4.20–$4.50 come into play quickly. Fail the near-term tests, especially into a volatile macro print, and a final dip to harvest downside liquidity remains on the table before any renewed advance. At press time, XRP traded at $2.96.

This cool-off period comes as ether (ETH) hovers about 15% from its recent all-time high (ATH), and BTC remains range-bound between $108,000 and $113,000. Analysts at the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex revealed that Ethereum ETFs have just recorded their second-largest single-day outflow since their launch. Ethereum ETF Inflows Cool Off According to this week’s Bitfinex Alpha report, the 14-day average of net flows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs highlights the significant role these products have played in recent price action. Between May and August, daily allocations of 55,000 to 85,000 ETH to Ethereum ETFs drove the cryptocurrency to new highs. However, the slowing demand over the last two weeks has contributed to a slowdown in momentum. Flows into these Ethereum products fell to 16,600 daily in the last week of August. They declined even further to an average of -41,400 ETH last week. On Friday, 104,100 ETH, worth approximately $447 million, left Ethereum ETFs, marking the second-highest outflow day since inception. Bitfinex noted that the price action of both BTC and ETH has become increasingly dependent on ETFs and treasury companies. Although ETH shows a relatively higher dependency, the ETFs for both assets currently reflect a pullback in traditional finance (TradFi) buying power. “This slowdown highlights the sensitivity of institutional demand to both price and macroeconomic conditions, and reinforces the role of ETF flows as a decisive determinant of whether digital assets can regain upward momentum or remain range-bound in the near term,” the report stated. BTC to Mark Cyclical Low This Month Furthermore, the structure of TradFi demand between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has deviated significantly. This is seen by comparing cumulative ETF flows with bi-weekly changes in futures open interest for both assets. Data accessed by analysts show that investors have primarily expressed demand for BTC through direct spot exposure rather than futures positioning. ETH, on the other hand, combines spot allocations with “cash-and-carry strategies.” “The result is a distinct profile of institutional engagement while BTC flows reflect clearer directional conviction, ETH flows highlight a balance between speculative demand and structured arbitrage-driven participation,” analysts added. Meanwhile, Bitfinex insists that while BTC still faces the risk of deeper correction in the near term, the asset could mark a cyclical low in September ahead of a rally next quarter.

The price is now correcting some gains and might find bids near $2.920. XRP price is facing hurdles and struggling to clear the $3.00 resistance. The price is now trading above $2.920 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $2.9650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $2.920 zone. XRP Price Remains Supported for Gains XRP price managed to stay above the $2.8320 level and started a fresh increase, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price climbed above the $2.920 and $2.950 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped the price above the $3.00 level. A high was formed at $3.0365 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.794 swing low to the $3.036 high. Besides, there was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $2.9650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.920 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls protect the $2.920 support, the price could attempt another increase. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.980 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.00 level. A clear move above the $3.00 resistance might send the price toward the $3.0350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.150. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $3.00 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.9350 level. The next major support is near the $2.920 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.794 swing low to the $3.036 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.920 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.860. The next major support sits near the $2.850 zone, below which the price could gain bearish momentum. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now near the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.9350 and $2.920.
